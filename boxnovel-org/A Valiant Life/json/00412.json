Perhaps he could really come up with it today. Then, he raised his head and saw that his mentor was busy playing with his phone. His mentor looked extremely stern and even furious. It was as if he was busy roasting those people of the Internet. However, Zhao Ming Qing was helpless against his mentor. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>His mentor had told him to be calm but his mentor was so infuriated himself.</p><br/><p>However, he was the student and he could only listen to his teacher\u2019s words, which were to come up with the prescription.</p><br/><p>The situation on the internet couldn\u2019t be salvaged after the post had been uploaded. A lot of clueless netizens started to be involved in the internet war.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had initially been the only one being attacked but someone caused Lin Fan to be attacked too. Furthermore, Lin Fan was so cocky and the fact that he didn\u2019t want to back down caused the battle to be shifted over to his side only.</p><br/><p>He immediately posted without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how many people you bring, if you can cause my Weibo to be shut down, I\u2019ll admit defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>When it was posted, the netizens couldn\u2019t take it anymore. They felt that this fella was too much and didn\u2019t even respect them at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a shameless person before. He\u2019s using the old Chinese medical doctor\u2019s fame to help himself become famous. Since you want to be famous, I\u2019ll grant you your wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking dog. You\u2019re actually helping an inhumane beast like him. I\u2019ll make sure you die today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you can\u2019t do that. You\u2019re no longer the Master Lin we know. Where did the just and righteous Master Lin go? Why have you become like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI must have been blind to be his fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still believe in Master Lin. No matter what he does, I\u2019ll believe in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ You must be an idiot for believing in him. Can you please have a brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan handled the situation calmly and Autumn Sword Fish Killer was busy helping Lin Fan with the warfare. He was clicking \u2018like\u2019 on all sorts of web forums. Initially, he had wanted to pretend to be part of the crowd that was flaming Lin Fan but the reality was cruel. He couldn\u2019t have done that without being found out.</p><br/><p>It was a pity. Autumn Sword Fish Killer realized that the situation was unfavorable and the opposing people had a lot of firepower.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you can\u2019t infuriate them anymore. There are more enemies appearing,\u201d Autumn Sword Fish Killer cried helplessly. He was so unlucky to have a boss that loved to create trouble. Lin Fan had created the mess online and he was supposed to pay a price for his actions.</p><br/><p>However, Autumn Sword Fish Killer was the Flame War Emperor and he wouldn\u2019t be afraid of such disorganized Internet trolls. He had to show his true powers to let them know how powerful he was.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t just fighting for Lin Fan. He was fighting for himself; his own glory.</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>The team of professionals laughed. \u201cDid you see the news online? I\u2019m afraid that old Chinese medical doctor, Zhao Ming Qing is doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Chinese medicine to treat anorexia. They should just give Chinese medicine to people who want to maintain their good health. They\u2019re thinking of such impractical things. Now that he\u2019s in this mess, he probably is extremely regretful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think this old Chinese medical doctor means what he said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s possible. Some of these Chinese medical doctors are crazy. Perhaps they\u2019re all secretly crazy and it\u2019s normal that they use humans as test subjects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed when they found out about what happened to this old Chinese medical doctor. They were laughing at his demise. How did this fella think that he could cure anorexia with Chinese medicine? He should\u2019ve just been an honest doctor and continued with what he had been doing since he couldn\u2019t come up with anything useful.</p><br/><p>They really looked down on those Chinese medical doctors.</p><br/><p>They acted politely in front of them but they were extremely upset. They had also considered Chinese medicine when they were researching about anorexia but these Chinese medical doctors only prescribed medicine to help to nurture one\u2019s wellness. They couldn\u2019t interfere with anything else. Besides, people didn\u2019t believe in Chinese medicine these days. They would never think of seeing a Chinese medical doctor when they had critical illnesses. Only those without money or the stupid ones believed in Chinese medicine. In the end, they would all die.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys should think of a solution. The group of reporters is still outside, I\u2019ll go take a look,\u201d Specialist Chang said.</p><br/><p>When he reached the entrance, the reporters rushed towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecialist Chang, did you see what was posted online? The elderly Chinese medical doctor, Zhao Ming Qing, used a human as a test subject and it has created a negative impact. What do you think of this?\u201d A reporter asked.</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang remained calm and smiled. Then, he answered sternly, \u201cIf this matter is true, I\u2019m deeply hurt. Chinese medicine is a national treasure. How did something like this happen? Zhao Ming Qing is the director of the Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy his action doesn\u2019t only represent himself. It represents the school too. He has to be cautious of his words and actions. I hope the relevant authorities investigate this matter. If it is true, please do something about it. If it\u2019s fake, please punish the people accordingly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter nodded. His answer was clear and definite.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecialist Chang, do you guys have a solution now? According to what we know, the patient, Wang Li Li\u2019s condition is critical and there mustn\u2019t be any delay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang nodded. \u201cWe have a preliminary solution but it\u2019s still under investigation. I can confirm that it will be useful. Please wait a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a reporter asked, \u201cSpecialist Chang, you guys have been here for so many days and there\u2019s still no finalized solution. Is it because the situation is getting out of hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang frowned but he nodded. \u201cWang Li Li\u2019s condition is indeed a little complicated. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve never encountered before. It\u2019s difficult to come up with the solution but I believe my team will definitely come up with a perfect solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>This answer made no difference at all.</p><br/><p>The team of professionals was helpless. They had thought that Wang Li Li\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t that serious but after the lab report, they realized that it was extremely serious. They had treated a few anorexic patients before but they had never encountered someone like her.</p><br/><p>It caused them to be extremely lost. They didn\u2019t know how to treat the condition at all. Her stomach couldn\u2019t even take porridge, what else could her body handle?</p><br/><p>At the research lab of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s phone kept ringing. A friend of his called first and then the Health Department called. The Chinese Medical Association also called.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had picked up all the calls but then he stopped picking up any more calls. He didn\u2019t want to waste any time away from his research.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the mentor and the student\u2019s reputation had gotten tarnished.</p><br/><p>Still, he was extremely impressed with his mentor for being calm despite the unfavorable situation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

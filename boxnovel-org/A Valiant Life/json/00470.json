My daughter\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan interrupted her and looked at Liu Jia Hui. \u201cI know, you don\u2019t have to say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan frowned. It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t expect to see a cancer patient. He just didn\u2019t expect to see one today.</p><br/><p>He just took a glance at her and he knew what was wrong.</p><br/><p>Uterus cancer.</p><br/><p>However, she was only in her twenties. How did she contract this illness?</p><br/><p>This illness had a few different possible causes.</p><br/><p>Firstly, it could be due to old age. This illness usually happens when a lady is forty and above. Secondly, it could be due to a stressful lifestyle. Thirdly, it could also be caused by smoking.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui realized that this young chap had been looking at her and she started to smile.</p><br/><p>Her good friends looked at Lin Fan doubtfully and whispered, \u201cAuntie, you are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Aunt Wang whispered, \u201cI know what you want to say. However, all of you should know how Jia Hui\u2019s situation is like. The hospital can\u2019t help her. They said he is a godly doctor. I have to try it out no matter what. I just hope that Jia Hui can recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her good friends didn\u2019t reply. They knew Jia Hui\u2019s condition. It was a common and deadly illness among women. After contracting it, one would basically be unable to recover from it.</p><br/><p>Especially since Jia Hui delayed treatment for some time. There weren\u2019t any symptoms during the early stages of uterus cancer. However, when the illness progressed to a certain level, she experienced abdominal pain and blood flow. Initially, Jia Hui thought that it was an irregular menstrual cycle. Hence, she didn\u2019t think too much about it.</p><br/><p>However, the situation became worse. When she had found out about it, it was too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cStretch out your hand, I\u2019m going to measure your pulse,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaughter, listen to the doctor. Let him have a look at you,\u201d Aunt Wang said.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui looked at her mum and sighed. Since she was already there, she had to give in. She knew that she didn\u2019t have much time left and she didn\u2019t want her mum to be regretful. Hence, she stretched out her hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed his hand on her wrist to measure her pulse.</p><br/><p>He knew that it was cancer. If he was able to cure it, it would definitely cause an uproar. However, he couldn\u2019t just leave her alone. A voluntary medical worker had to be fearless.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, my daughter\u2019s illness\u2026\u201d Aunt Wang started to speak. She wanted to tell him about her daughter\u2019s situation but was interrupted by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it. I know what it is,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Aunt Wang and the others were stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was obviously not at the level where he could just tell about someone\u2019s illness just by looking at the person. He had to make some measurements and deductions before confirming it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, is there a problem?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked cautiously after looking at his mentor\u2019s stern expression.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan whispered, \u201cUterus cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. It was as if he was in disbelief. It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t believe that this lady had uterus cancer. He was shocked that his teacher looked like he was going to treat the illness.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, can it be treated?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked carefully.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a minor disease or a weird disease. It was cancer.</p><br/><p>If his mentor could cure it, they might really run into trouble in the future.</p><br/><p>That didn\u2019t mean it was anything bad. They were probably going to be extremely busy in the future.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and didn\u2019t say much. It was obvious that he meant that he could cure it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at his mentor in shock. Then, he looked at the patient and her family member. Lin Fan was a young doctor and he couldn\u2019t just let her die. However, he knew that if he were to save her, things would be extremely complicated next time.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing wanted to tell him to not heal her yet. They could arrange for another time with her family members and treat it separately. However, before he said anything, Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cAlright, you don\u2019t have to record this down. Your current abilities cannot reach this level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little hesitant. Then, he realized that he didn\u2019t have to be worried. He was really that capable and he wasn\u2019t afraid of anything. Everyone would be amazed by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Then, a middle-aged doctor in a white robe came. He was Liu Jia Hui\u2019s main doctor. He had gone to the ward and realized that she wasn\u2019t there. Then, he began to search everywhere for her. When he found out that she had left the hospital, he came to look for her personally.</p><br/><p>He was unhappy when he saw that her family member brought Jia Hui to seek treatment from another doctor. At the same time, he felt that these people were diving into something that they didn\u2019t know anything about.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Shen,\u201dAunt Wang greeted politely when she saw who it was.</p><br/><p>He was the main doctor of her daughter. The one that had been responsible for her daughter\u2019s condition. Although it wasn\u2019t improving, they obviously didn\u2019t want to offend the doctor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Doctor Shen asked. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \u201cWho are you? Which hospital are you from? Why are you here to treat patients?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little p*ssed. What was going on? He had admitted his mistake for setting up a booth outside the hospital yesterday. However, he was across the road today. The doctors weren\u2019t even involved in this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTreating an illness,\u201d Lin Fan said casually. \u201cDo you guys want to continue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Aunt Wang was a little hesitant. The main doctor was here and if she said she was going to continue, it would definitely anger the main doctor and perhaps he wouldn\u2019t try his best anymore in the future. Hence, she was hesitant and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cTreating an illness?\u201d Show everyone your medical certificate. Did you guys find the wrong place?\u201d Doctor Shen said sternly. \u201cAlso, you guys are Chinese medical doctors?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Shen laughed disdainfully as if he looked down on Chinese medical doctors.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum\u2026\u201d Then, Liu Jia Hui\u2019s forehead was filled with cold sweat. Her face turned pale and she raised an arm, trying to grab onto her mum\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Aunt Wang was anxious, \u201cDaughter, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pain was excruciating for Liu Jia Hui. She could only consume medicine to reduce the pain. However, it was extremely expensive as it was imported. However, Aunt Wang didn\u2019t want her daughter to suffer like that. She had to buy it no matter what.</p><br/><p>However, Liu Jia Hui skipped the medicine sometimes. To her, she didn\u2019t want to waste money on medicine since she felt that she was already going to die.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui\u2019s good friends were all stunned. They didn\u2019t know what to do and looked at the doctor.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were shocked when they saw it. \u201cGodly doctor, quick, take a look at her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s relapsing,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Doctor Shen said, \u201cQuick, send her to the hospital and inject some painkillers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the townsfolk said, \u201cYou need at least ten minutes to get to the hospital. The godly doctor is here. You should let him see her. She doesn\u2019t have to travel so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, look at how pitiful this lady is. Quickly have a look at her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were passionate. When they saw the lady in pain, they would\u2019ve charged forward if they were capable of saving her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and stretched out his hand to press onto her abdomen.</p><br/><p>Doctor Shen immediately went forward trying to stop him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t have stopped Lin Fan. \u201cYou\u2019re so strong\u2026:\u201d</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer was tall and muscular and he shoved Doctor Shen aside. \u201cGet lost. You\u2019re wasting time. Don\u2019t interfere with the godly doctor\u2019s work. Since you guys can\u2019t treat her illness, let the godly doctor do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you still standing here? If you\u2019re not going to leave, I\u2019ll beat you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer looked at him angrily. It was as if he was going to punch him if he continued to stay there.</p><br/><p>*cough* Lin Fan coughed gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, I was just scaring him,\u201d the city enforcement officer chuckled. The godly doctor was his benefactor and he didn\u2019t dare to go against him. Then, he glared at Doctor Shen, \u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Shen furrowed his brows, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 You will regret this.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

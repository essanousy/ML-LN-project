If you want to talk to me about what happened in the morning, please leave now. You don't have to care about me.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"Kid, no matter what, I'm still your uncle. I have the responsibility to educate you.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming laughed disdainfully, \"Don't try to speak like you're so awesome. You can forget about being my uncle. I, He Xiao Ming, will never ever call you my uncle even if I die.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't think you can pressure me just because you know my dad. I, He Xiao Ming, will never take my words back.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"What do you think your position is in your dad's heart?\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan. \"What do you want? Let me tell you that I'm just a failure in his eyes. I do nothing everyday and I'm rubbish. He always puts himself in first place and I'm just a redundant part of his life. He can just scold or hit me anytime he wants. I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"How about I get your dad over now?\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming sneered, \"Don't call him. If it's because of me, I doubt he'll come.\"</p><br/><p>\"He will come,\" Lin Fan said and smiled.</p><br/><p>\"You're so confident.\" He Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan. \"Let me tell you. He sleeps at 9 pm every night. Even if it's an important thing, he'd settle it the next day. He probably doesn't give a d*mn about me.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"He will definitely come because your dad is afraid of me. If I tell him to come, he will come.\"</p><br/><p>Although He Xiao Ming had just had a conflict with his dad, he was furious when he heard Lin Fan's words. It felt like he was insulting his dad.</p><br/><p>He made a call and the voice was a familiar one to He Xiao Ming.</p><br/><p>\"Chief He, I'm at the Rainbow Bridge. Come and look for me at the end of the bridge, I'm waiting for you there.\" Lin Fan hung up after he said that. Then, he looked at He Xiao Ming. \"Come, follow me to the end of the bridge.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not going there!\" He Xiao Ming shouted. Suddenly, Lin Fan placed his arm around He Xiao Ming's shoulders and he suddenly couldn't resist it. He had to follow Lin Fan to the end of the bridge.</p><br/><p>The car was parked there.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming didn't believe that Lin Fan had seen him coincidentally. He didn't understand what he was doing. Perhaps he was trying to educate him.</p><br/><p>It was such a joke.</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck do you want from me? I'm not your follower. Don't think so highly of yourself. This method is useless to me,\" He Xiao Ming shouted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't bother about it. He went to the back of the car and took out a rope. Then, he went to He Xiao Ming. \"Look at this rope. Isn't it very firm? Do you think you can untangle it?\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming shrugged his shoulders, \"You're such a joke. You're trying to reason with me? Are you trying to say my dad and I are like strands of the rope and we have to unite in love to live harmoniously? Or are you trying to talk about the power of unity and see if I can break it? Stop trying so hard. We're already in the twenty-first century and you're telling me these things. That's so outdated\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I wasn't even going to tell you that.\" Lin Fan smiled. He just pulled the string and looked at He Xiao Ming. \"I just want to remind you that you shouldn't struggle or fidget later. Your small body won't be able to untangle it.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was stunned and his face changed. \"What are you trying to do?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \"I'm going to tie you up.\"</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck\u2026\" He Xiao Ming couldn't even understand what Lin Fan was doing. He was trying to break free but he was so weak as compared to Lin Fan. It was just a waste of effort.\"</p><br/><p>\"Help\u2026 help\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>He shouted.</p><br/><p>But it was late and no one would pass through that area. After shouting for a short while, his mouth was stuffed with something.</p><br/><p>He could only murmur and make soft noises. Then, he was hidden behind the bridge by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Sit here quietly. You dad will be here soon,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was trying to break free from the rope. It had been tied so tightly and he wondered how strong this fella was. In the end, he gave up on trying to break free. He just stayed there.</p><br/><p>When he looked at the rope on his body, he felt a little humiliated. Why had he even used that method to tie him up?</p><br/><p>After a short while.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was still trying to break free and Lin Fan said, \"Stop trying. Your dad is here.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, it became quiet.</p><br/><p>Perhaps He Xiao Ming was afraid that he would be discovered by his dad.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin.\" He Cheng Han greeted from a distance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Chief He, sit here.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han replied, \"Master Lin, I'm sorry about what happened this morning. Please don't take it to heart. He's still a kid and doesn't know his manners.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"You don't have to apologize. I've already forgotten about that. I wanted to tell you something and that's why I called you over. But you have to be mentally prepared.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming quietly listened to their conversation as he was hidden away. He stayed still and wanted to find out what Master Lin was up to.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han was stunned. \"Master Lin, what happened?\"</p><br/><p>He sounded a little nervous. It was as if he knew something was about to happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath. \"When I read your son's fortune today, I realized that he's going to be in trouble.\"</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han was stunned. He quickly asked, \"Master Lin, what is it? He's going to be in trouble?!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yeah, do you believe me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" He Cheng Han immediately replied.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming smiled. It was perhaps a piece of good news to him. If he was in trouble, he thought his dad would be even happier since he wouldn't have to worry about him anymore.</p><br/><p>\"It's hard for him to survive this disaster,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>To He Cheng Han, it was a heavy blow. Even He Xiao Ming was stunned as well.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han kneeled on the ground. \"Master Lin, you have to save Xiao Ming, please! I only have one son. He's still young and I can't just lose him like that.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up. \"Chief He, you have to look at things positively sometimes. You can't change one's fate. I guess you must be extremely disappointed in him, right?\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming quietly stayed there. He lowered his head and sneered in his heart, Y eah, he probably kneeled down just to act noble, like he cares about me. He probably doesn't give a d*mn.</p><br/><p>He continued listening on to see what he was going to say.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han nodded. \"Yes. He's let me down but I don't blame him. It's all because of me. His mom left us early. I have to take responsibility for this. After that, I took extra care of him. I gave him everything he wanted even if it was extremely difficult or expensive. I'd do everything to satisfy him. When he was in primary school, I was extremely proud of him. When he reached lower secondary, I thought he could understand things since he had grown up. I was still young then and I met someone that I could click with. I wanted to find him a mom. But I didn't expect that to change him completely. Perhaps I didn't think about his emotions. I didn't know it was going to make him upset. He became quiet after that, up until today.\"</p><br/><p>\"Despite how he's become, it's never changed my love for him.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"You gave up your own happiness because of him. That's so unworthy.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han shook his head. \"No, Master Lin, you won't understand it because you don't have a child. He's my one and only son. I know he didn't like it so I broke up with her. I would not make him upset just because of my own happiness. I already owe him so much.\"</p><br/><p>\"In the past, I worked so hard to earn money because I wanted to give him good things in life. I wanted him to have no worries. But now, I realize that he doesn't lack any of that. He lacks love and care.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed, \"Sigh, but he has such a prejudiced view of you.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said, \"Master Lin, these aren't important anymore. Please, save him. I would give up my life for him too. I won't regret it. I don't care if he hates me for the rest of his life. As long as he's alive, I'd be happy.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was hidden and he looked at him unblinkingly. He hadn't expected it to turn out like that. He was in disbelief to hear such words from his dad.</p><br/><p>His dad had said so many bad things to him before and he suddenly thought of it all.</p><br/><p>\"Get lost. I don't want a son like you.\"</p><br/><p>\"You're so disappointing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why do have a b*stard like you as a son?\"</p><br/><p>\"Look at how old you are now. When I was your age, I was working so hard for my career. You're still a failure now.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>But now, he realized that things were so different now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded helplessly. \"Chief He, I'm a friend of yours too. Since you said all of that, I'll give you guidance on this. There's a temple about 5000 km away from here. Go there and pray for a day. Yo As for what would happen after that, I don't know either. It all depends on your luck.\"</p><br/><p>Chief He shook his head. \"As long as I do that, my son will be okay, right?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded \"At least there would be hope.\"</p><br/><p>\"I understand...\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Chief He left.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan switched on the torchlight on his phone and pointed it at He Xiao Ming's face, he saw him with a lowered head. His face was filled with tears. It was as if he hadn't expected this at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

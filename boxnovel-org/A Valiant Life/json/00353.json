Is there something going on?\"</p><br/><p>The old man laughed and said, \"It's nothing. I'm looking at the time because I'm appreciating the time.\"</p><br/><p>The nurse at the side was very familiar with this old couple. She said, \"Uncle, don't worry. Your body is very healthy.\" As she said these words, even she didn't believe them herself. The Uncle was going to be discharged soon and perhaps that would be the last time she would see him.</p><br/><p>The wife sighed in her heart and said, \"Did you hear that? The nurse says it'll be fine. What could happen to you, right?\"</p><br/><p>The old man answered with a smile, \"Of course. My body is excellent. I'll be fine for sure. I'm going out by myself for a stroll. You should sleep here for a while. Don't let yourself get too tired.\"</p><br/><p>The wife was worried. \"I'll accompany you.\"</p><br/><p>\"No need, no need. I have hands and legs. I'm just going out for some fresh air. Nothing will happen,\" said the old man.</p><br/><p>The nurse then said with a smile, \"Don't worry, Auntie. Uncle won't have any problems going downstairs by himself. Breathing some fresh air would be good for his body as well.\"</p><br/><p>Since even the nurse had spoken, the wife had nothing to say. However, she still felt worried in her heart.</p><br/><p>The old man walked out to the corridor with a face full of smiles. The nurses he passed all greeted him.</p><br/><p>In the ward.</p><br/><p>The wife pulled on the nurse's arm and said, \"Young lady, tell this Auntie, how long more does my husband have?\"</p><br/><p>It was difficult for the nurse to speak. She didn't know what to answer. But the Auntie had the right to know the situation. \"Auntie, Uncle's body may look healthy but that's because he didn't go through chemotherapy. As of now, the cancer cells have spread throughout his body and he may pass away anytime. My only wish is that uncle will be happy during his last moments.\"</p><br/><p>The Auntie wiped the corners of her eyes and said, \"Mmm, thank you for your trouble, young lady. I can bear this but please don't tell him about this. I'm afraid that he would be unhappy.\"</p><br/><p>The nurses knew that the Uncle already knew of the condition of his body but he didn't want to make his wife worry, so he kept a positive spirit.</p><br/><p>The nurses hadn't seen many of such cases. Most cancer patients would be scared to death by their own states.</p><br/><p>Although it isn't proven in medical studies, everyone knows that the human body is the most mysterious existence. Every single emotion and expression that goes through the subconscious mind affects the health of one's body.</p><br/><p>At the lift entrance.</p><br/><p>The old man sat on the chair. He looked at the time every once in a while. It was already 4:50 pm. After much consideration, he finally decided to give it a try.</p><br/><p>As for why he wanted to give it a try, he wasn't sure himself. Perhaps it was because when someone has no other options, he would just take the only option. Also, deep in his heart, he didn't want to die. He wanted to be with his wife.</p><br/><p>The old man sat there with complicated thoughts in his heart. Even he didn't know what he was thinking about. Every time the lift came up, his eyes would shift towards the lift. But even after a few times, he didn't see who he had come to see.</p><br/><p>*Ding!*</p><br/><p>The lift came up again.</p><br/><p>The little old man looked at the lift doors. When the doors opened, he saw the young man that he had seen that afternoon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was carrying things in his hands. He said, \"Wanna give it a try?\"</p><br/><p>The little old man nodded. \"Mmm.\"</p><br/><p>Lin fan smiled. At the same time, he wondered, if the old man had met a scammer instead of himself, whether he would have believed the scammer as well.</p><br/><p>\"There are too many people here. Follow me to a less crowded place,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>They were in a hospital, so the little old man wasn't afraid. He then nodded and followed behind Lin Fan, leaving the place.</p><br/><p>The little old man looked at Lin Fan and asked cautiously, \"I don't need to pay, right? If I do, I don't want to try it anymore.\"</p><br/><p>\"No need to pay,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The little old man's initially alert expression turned into a smile. \"That's good. I still have to leave my money for my wife so that if I die, she would have money to go to the elderly nursing home. She won't have to be afraid of not having anyone to take care of her.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"Don't worry. Since you have trusted me, naturally, I will let you personally take care of your wife. However, I have to remind you again not to tell anyone.\"</p><br/><p>The little old man nodded and asked, \"Why not?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"I won't go into that for now. I'll treat you first. If you recover from my treatment, don't tell anyone. If you don't recover, then you can tell people.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, that's what I was thinking as well,\" said the little old man.</p><br/><p>When he heard this, Lin Fan glanced at the old man. He hadn't thought that this old man knew how to think pretty well.</p><br/><p>They went to a place with no one else.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan passed the little old man the medicine. \"Drink it.\"</p><br/><p>The little old man took a whiff of it, then without hesitating, he drank the whole thing. \"It's a little bitter but also a little sweet.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the packaging of the needle, then he touched the old man's body. According to the knowledge in his mind, he knew how to treat him.</p><br/><p>He held the silver needle between two fingers. Suddenly, the needle in his hand felt different. Somehow, it gained a kind of mystical energy.</p><br/><p>Is that the mystical boost from the Encyclopedia? Lin Fan exclaimed in his heart. It felt similar to the scallion pancakes. Those scallion pancakes that made people fall in love uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>He aimed the needle at an acupuncture point, then pushed it in. All of a sudden, the little old man lightly took a breath of air.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \"What is it? Is it uncomfortable?\"</p><br/><p>The little old man shook his head, \"No, it was too comfortable. When you put the needle in, I felt a surge of heat flowing inside me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that so?\" Lin Fan didn't quite understand what had really happened. If he didn't have the Encyclopedia's mystical boost, this method would surely be the right way to treat him. However, with the Encyclopedia's mystical boost, he was afraid that something might have changed.</p><br/><p>The little old man's body trembled slightly. \"It's so comfortable. It's just that my stomach feels a little bloated.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"That's normal. It means it's effective.\"</p><br/><p>The little old man didn't know what was going on but when his body was pierced by the needle, he suddenly felt comfortable. Those places that hurt before suddenly stopped hurting. It felt even better than eating painkillers.</p><br/><p>At that moment, more needles were placed on the little old man's body. Gradually, droplets of sweat started forming on the little old man's back and abdomen. These sweat droplets had seeped out through his pores. They didn't drip down or slide down. They were just distributed closely throughout his body.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan removed all the silver needles from the little old man's body. Then, he bundled them together safely and threw them into the rubbish bin at the side.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this was only a half an hour treatment but to the little old man, he felt so comfortable it was as if he had been reborn. If his feet weren't on the ground, he would have felt as if he was flying.</p><br/><p>\"Is it done?\" The little old man's little eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><br/><p>Although he was old, he wasn't stupid. Whether the treatment was effective or not, he could feel it. Before, even though he had been able to move his body, his body had felt weak and many parts of it had hurt very much. Even if he ate painkillers, they wouldn't stop hurting.</p><br/><p>But right now, the pain in his body was gone. He felt exceptionally energetic as well.</p><br/><p>\"Not so fast. Tomorrow, at nine in the morning, wait for me here,\" said Lin Fan as he stood up.</p><br/><p>The little old man's back was covered in sweat droplets. When he let his shirt down, it was as if he had just taken a bath. It was soaked. But the old man's mood was really extraordinarily good.</p><br/><p>When the old man was about to give Lin Fan a proper thanks, he realized that the master had already left.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

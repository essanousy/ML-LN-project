Did the certification get processed?\"</p><br/><p>They weren't confident in Lin Fan at all when he said that he was going to the hospital to apply for a certification. It seemed like a joke, especially when they saw Lin Fan's calm expression, they knew that he had failed.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \"I just did a check on the Internet and today's exams are over. How could it be so easy to obtain a medical certification?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan remained silent and sneakily placed the certification on the table. Then, he lied down on the chair, \"Recently, something major is going to happen.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is it? What's going to happen?\" Fraud Tian smiled. Then, he picked up the document on the table. When he looked at it, he was completely stunned. \"D*mn! The medical certification is here. Did you get someone to make a fake copy of it?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang, Wu You Lan, and the others also came over. When they looked at the medical certification content, they were completely stunned. Then, they looked at Lin Fan, \"Is this real?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"Why? This is based on my ability, how could it be fake?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gave him a thumbs up, \"That's amazing.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"Of course. I got this certification so easily. After all, people with true capabilities would be able to get what they want. I'll be busy in the coming days, please look after yourselves.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked curiously, \"We've been busy every day.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath and said, \"Recently, I feel that the burden on me is too much. I feel like I should also write a legendary book.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others looked at Lin Fan in disbelief. They realized that Lin Fan had become an extremely different person and they didn't know what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>Only Lin Fan knew what he was talking about and he meant it this time.</p><br/><p>He could earn Encyclopedic Points for taking in students. He was stuck on the tenth page of the Encyclopedia. Usually, it wouldn't have been this difficult to complete a task. He wanted to take it slow and earn Encyclopedic Points based on his ability. After all, trading them for some knowledge was a decent choice.</p><br/><p>It was indeed a major classification. It didn't just include medical knowledge. It also included something that he didn't know anything about - a legendary composition that could be passed on for generations.</p><br/><p>According to his understanding, he had to choose a book from the selection and copy it down first.</p><br/><p>Chinese medicine was a type of science, it wasn't metaphysics. It had a whole book collection. Furthermore, it was a little bizarre. In the end, he chose a book that was most realistic and believable, 'Various Types of Typhoid Illnesses'. According to the Encyclopedia's introduction, the author of this book was Zhang Zhong Jing. Although he didn't know who it was, he read the introduction and felt that he must have been an extremely capable man.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>At a random villa.</p><br/><p>At the dining table.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was smiling throughout dinner time.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Zhao, finish your medicine.\" Zhao Ming Qing's wife came with some medicine.</p><br/><p>At the dining table, Zhao Ming Qing's children looked at him curiously. They didn't live there but they came over after they received their mum's call. Their mum said that their dad had been smiling to himself after he came back and she felt that something was wrong. Hence, she wanted them to come and have a look.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had three sons and a daughter and every single one of them were capable.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately waved his hand, \"It's okay. I don't have to drink medicine anymore. My lung disease is healed.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you talking about? You're going to have it for the rest of your life. If you don't even know how to treat it, how would it recover?\" Zhao Shi said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \"I said it's recovered. Today, I met a god-like doctor on the streets and after his treatment, I've been completely healed. I have no problems now.\"</p><br/><p>His children looked at each other in disbelief. They felt that his father had run into a con artist. However, they thought about their father's identity and felt that it was impossible. Their father was an experienced Chinese medical doctor with superb medical skills. How could he possibly get cheated?</p><br/><p>\"You guys don't believe me, right? Look, have I been coughing after I came back? Wait, just watch this.\" Zhao Ming Qing stood up and took a skipping rope. Then, he started to skip in front of them. After a few minutes, Zhao Ming Qing placed the skipping rope aside and patted his chest. \"Look, do I look like I have a problem? In the past, I would be panting heavily after a few minutes of skipping. I'd be coughing non-stop but now I'm totally fine.\"</p><br/><p>The children were stunned after looking at him skip. It looked as if he really recovered.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \"I really am in luck today for meeting a god-like doctor. Furthermore, he is willing to take me as a disciple. This time, the discipleship ceremony has to be grand. I will invite everyone to witness it.\"</p><br/><p>The children were shocked after hearing that he had recovered but when they heard that he was going to have a mentor, he was stunned. Then, his oldest son, Zhao Li Xing asked, \"Dad, you're an experienced Chinese medical doctor. Are you sure you're going to have a mentor?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing furrowed his brows, \"So what? Does that mean I can't have a mentor? I really met a godly doctor. Don't try to influence me. If any of you wants to interfere with this, do not blame me for being furious.\"</p><br/><p>His second son, Zhao Bin, said, \"Dad, big brother didn't mean it that way. We're not stopping you. We just want to know who is that god-like doctor. We've never seen him before.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand, \"You don't have to know. Remember this. This was accomplished all because of my luck. You guys don't know that the godly doctor wasn't prepared to have me as a disciple but a thunderbolt changed his mind.\"</p><br/><p>His children were stunned, they didn't know what he meant by that.</p><br/><p>What did he mean by a thunder bolt changed his mind?</p><br/><p>\"Just continue eating. I'll go and contact some people. This is a joyous occasion, I have to manage it well. I can't disappoint my mentor.\" Zhao Ming Qing smiled and he went to his study room. It was as if he was walking on clouds. His steps were light and carefree.</p><br/><p>The few brothers looked at each other at the dining table. \"Mum, did dad really get cheated?\"</p><br/><p>\"I think so too. Look, your dad is an experienced Chinese medical doctor himself and he's reputable within the country. How can he just have a mentor like that?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi was worried too. \"Don't be anxious. You know how your dad is like. Once he is set on doing something, nobody can change his mind. Just wait and see.\"</p><br/><p>They just nodded. It looked like they had to be more careful during this period of time.</p><br/><p>In the study room.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing called his friends and when he said that he was inviting them over for a discipleship ceremony, they were all stunned. It was as if they heard it wrongly.</p><br/><p>When he confirmed it with them, they became silent. They felt that Elder Zhao was just kidding.</p><br/><p>With his ability, who in the world could be capable enough to be his mentor?</p><br/><p>However, they knew about Elder Zhao's personality. They felt that Elder Zhao must have been cheated by someone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

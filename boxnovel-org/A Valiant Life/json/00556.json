It\u2019s pretty late now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t really want to leave yet. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, let\u2019s play a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so fun about this? Let them stay here, that\u2019s it,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said. He\u2019d rather go back home to rest than to stay there and waste time with them.</p><br/><p>The five people that were kneeling down looked at Lin Fan in fear, \u201cWe have sung the song. Can we leave now?\u201d</p><br/><p>They really wanted to leave the place.</p><br/><p>They had already been exposed and the consequences were going to be severe. They wanted to run away quickly. If they were to be caught, they\u2019d be doomed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cYou call that singing? That\u2019s worse than crying. Don\u2019t even think about running away today. Kneel here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The five of them were stunned. Then, they said, \u201cDon\u2019t go overboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, fool.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. Then, he looked at the big patch of red paint on the wall. \u201cWhat are we going to do about that? Are you going to leave it there till someone cleans it up tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted Lin Fan on his shoulder, \u201cLet someone clean it tomorrow. It\u2019s good enough to have caught these people today. Let\u2019s go back to sleep. If not, we won\u2019t be able to wake up tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had wasted an hour on these idiots and it was already 3 am in the morning.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a cleaner drove a cleaning vehicle past them and when she saw what was on the wall, her face changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d The cleaner was a little nervous. This place was going to have VIPs in a few hours\u2019 time. When she saw the red paint on the wall, she was stunned. If this were to be found out, someone was going to die.</p><br/><p>It was going to be extremely humiliating.</p><br/><p>Although she was just a cleaner, she knew that when the VIPs arrived in a few hours, a lot of reporters would be there too. If the foreign reporters were to take any pictures of this and spread it across the globe, the country would be shamed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s chauffeur knew that Chief Wang and Master Lin were a little drunk. He went forward to the cleaner, \u201cAuntie, the situation was like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver told her everything and when the cleaner heard it, she looked at the five youngsters that were kneeling down. Her face changed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why did you guys do that?\u201d The cleaner took out some tools from the toolbox. \u201cThere will be VIPs coming here at 9 am. If the VIPs were to see this place in this state, something is going to happen. You guys\u2026 You guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little curious when he heard that, \u201cAuntie, what VIPs?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner said anxiously, \u201cAt 9 in the morning, Japanese VIPs will be here to look at this place. Foreign reporters will be here too. If people were to see this, what do you think will happen? People will be infuriated and our nation will be humiliated. An important anti-Japanese place had been ruined like this. It\u2019s going to be crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner immediately took out the cleaning tools and started to clean the stains on the wall. As she cleaned it, she realized that something was wrong. \u201cThis is oil paint\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The wall\u2019s surface was thick and viscous and it became even worse as she cleaned further. It wasn\u2019t going to work out.</p><br/><p>The cleaner didn\u2019t know what to do and she was extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>Within the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, something\u2019s going to happen later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese f*ckers. I really want to kill all of them. What are they going to do to resolve this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the cleaner looks as if she is going to cry. If this were to be found out, she\u2019s going to get punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly get people to clean it overnight. Hopefully, it would be cleaned finish in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? These f*ckers caused a mess on a large surface area. Furthermore, oil paint isn\u2019t easily cleaned up. Even if an army of people were here, it would be useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at the few of them and his face became stern. \u201cI am going to teach all of you a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five youngsters were extremely scared when they saw his face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately waved his hand, \u201cMing Yang, don\u2019t be anxious. Let me think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I not be anxious? Look, it\u2019s already 3+ in the morning. We don\u2019t even have six hours. If this were to be found in the morning, it would be a joke,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>Then, as he and Lin Fan were thinking about it, the five of them actually wanted to escape.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately went forward, \u201cKneel down there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five of them realized that they suddenly couldn\u2019t move at all. Their toes couldn\u2019t move and that was extremely frightening.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to the cleaner, \u201cAuntie, leave this to me. I have a way to clean this up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner looked at Lin Fan, \u201cYoung chap, do you really have a way? I think there isn\u2019t enough time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Let me try,\u201d Lin Fan said. Then, he took a cloth from the auntie\u2019s hand and went towards his car.</p><br/><p>In the broadcasting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I feel like there isn\u2019t enough time. Oil paint is so difficult to clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I spent half the day trying to clean oil paint stains on my floor. Furthermore, there aren\u2019t any suitable tools to use here. It\u2019s so difficult to clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, what is he doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan opened his car\u2019s oil tank and placed the cloth into it to let it soak up the car\u2019s petrol.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you doing? Can that clean this up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, if he only relied on car petrol, nothing would\u2019ve worked. However, he had the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia. Even if he didn\u2019t use the car petrol, there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem.</p><br/><p>As everyone looked at him in shock, Lin Fan started to wipe the wall. The mystical boost of the Encyclopedia was being used.</p><br/><p>The red oil paint was gradually disappearing.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the netizens who were watching the broadcast went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that works?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, anything is possible for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner realized that it really worked and she heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he began to mimic Lin Fan\u2019s actions. However, she frowned, \u201cYoung chap, why is it so different when I wipe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. It was a difficult question to answer. However, he was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie, just let me do it. I have a special technique. I won\u2019t brag about it. I am the best at cleaning. Second to none. Just help me keep a lookout and bring some water for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcasting room were moved when they saw Lin Fan kneel down and bend over to clean the wall. His clothes were also stained with oil paint.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like Master Lin is so handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank God for Master Lin passing by here. If not, the consequences would be unimaginable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike it, you have to like it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to be so good at cleaning. He is indeed a tough man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too sexy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner was moved when she saw that, \u201cYoung chap, thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s an easy task. Give me a clean cloth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and the chauffeur started to help out too. There wasn\u2019t a lot of water. They immediately went to a 24h convenience store to buy a few boxes of water.</p><br/><p>What shocked them was that no matter how they cleaned it, it wasn\u2019t as good as Master Lin. Those areas that Lin Fan had cleaned actually shined when the light was pointed at it. That shocked everybody.</p><br/><p>An hour later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s clothes were extremely dirty while the wall had become really clean. It was even cleaner than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, are my eyes playing tricks on me? Why do I feel like this wall is newly built? Do you guys feel the same way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, look. It\u2019s so clean!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wall had been cleaned and the cleaner smiled. She shook Lin Fan\u2019s hand to thank him, \u201cYoung chap, thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s hands were stained with oil paint. He just smiled. Then, Wang Ming Yang took some paper towels and wiped the sweat off Lin Fan\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re too awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only about 4 am. Since it\u2019s already cleaned, let\u2019s clean up everything here. After all, there is an event tomorrow and we have to present the best side to others. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Lin Fan said happily.</p><br/><p>They hustled till it was almost 5 am.</p><br/><p>When they cleaned the last corner, Lin Fan looked at the outer wall of Sihang and smiled. \u201cLook, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the crowd was stunned by what they saw.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cHow did you even clean that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner was extremely shocked too. She had been in this profession for really long but she had not seen someone who could clean so well. It was crazy.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the live broadcast chat room had been watching them right from the start. Although it wasn\u2019t mindblowing, they were simply stunned when they saw the cleaned walls. The viewers in the live broadcast chat room started to increase in numbers. The number of viewers actually doubled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan washed off the oil paint stains from his hand and smiled, \u201cAlright, it\u2019s done. Ming Yang, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he waved towards the netizens watching the live stream. \u201cIt has been cleaned but we can\u2019t let these people go. We have to ensure that they face the punishment they deserve. Auntie, I\u2019ll leave this to you. If the police officers are here, leave it to them. There are pictures of their crime here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I know that.\u201d The cleaner nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s go home and sleep. We\u2019ve been working through the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung chap, what\u2019s your name?\u201d The cleaner asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and didn\u2019t want to say anything.</p><br/><p>The cleaner auntie heaved a sigh, \u201cYou\u2019re such an awesome youngster. You\u2019re not leaving your name after doing such a good deed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the netizens in the live broadcast chat room were unsettled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is Lin Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is called Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

There were a lot of notable people in there and they were really powerful in Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan entered and everyone looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is the godly doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is exactly the same as the one on Weibo, he is so young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Ma\u2019s life is dependent on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I believe it\u2019s the other way around. His life is in Godfather Ma\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this is Qingzhou. If he didn\u2019t come, he\u2019d probably be fine. Now that he is in Qingzhou, does he even have any say here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if I was this powerful, I would definitely be nice to Godfather Ma. Then, I would be able to be successful in Qingzhou. Who else would dare to infuriate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShhh. Be quiet. If the godly doctor became good friends with Godfather Ma, we can also interact with the godly doctor. After all, everyone would fall sick in the future. It is like a form of insurance to know a godly doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Liu Ren said, \u201cGodly doctor, please. Godfather Ma had been waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Then, Ma Qing Zhou walked over from a distance. He walked quickly and proudly. He really looked like a big shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had been observing the moon and the stars. The godly doctor is finally here.\u201d Ma Qing Zhou acted pretty well in front of everyone. He smiled and stretched out his hand to shake his hand. Things didn\u2019t go too well the first time they met each other. The second time naturally was a new beginning.</p><br/><p>After all, the godly doctor was someone that loved money and he managed to find his weakness.</p><br/><p>The love of money was a fatal weakness.</p><br/><p>He lacked nothing but money in Qingzhou. He could give him as much as he wanted. The entire Qingzhou was like a goldmine to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even think of shaking Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Then, the atmosphere got really tense.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned at what was happening.</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma initiated a handshake with him and he actually rejected him. It looked a little embarrassing. They\u2019ve never seen such an occurrence before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not going to shake your hand. I only shake hands with friends. As for you\u2026 you\u2019re not qualified to be my friend,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly. He didn\u2019t even notice how upset Ma Qing Zhou looked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ma Qing Zhou had never felt so humiliated before. He was furious and he wanted to kill him but he had to control himself.</p><br/><p>The guests were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is this guy trying to get himself killed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t see this with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. Someone actually dared to speak like that to Godfather Ma. That\u2019s so cocky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is finished. This man is dead. Everyone knows how Godfather Ma is like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if this fella treats Godfather Ma\u2019s illness, he probably would suffer a tragic fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He and the others were standing beside Godfather Ma and when they heard this fella say those words, they were stunned. Then, they looked at Lin Fan again.</p><br/><p>He was absolutely calm.</p><br/><p>They could feel his calmness just by looking at him. They wondered why this man could afford to be so calm.</p><br/><p>Was it because Godfather Ma\u2019s illness could only be treated by him?</p><br/><p>If it was the case, that would be insufficient to justify his calmness. When Godfather Ma fully recovered, this fella would be of no value anymore.</p><br/><p>They mustn\u2019t become friends with him.</p><br/><p>He was dumb and even if there was a way to revive them from the dead, they didn\u2019t want to befriend him. They\u2019ll never know what this person will get himself into or what trouble he would cause tonight. They might even be dragged into it.</p><br/><p>Then, Godfather Ma smiled as if he wasn\u2019t bothered at all. \u201cYou are the godly doctor indeed. You have a strong backbone. I am impressed. Come, have a seat inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to talk to this fella anymore. He just wanted to be treated by him. The first thing he wanted to do was to make this fella kneel before him and pay the price for saying those things.</p><br/><p>The guests gradually settled down and took their seats.</p><br/><p>Although the guests were talking among themselves, they glanced at Godfather Ma occasionally.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou said, \u201cGodly doctor, look, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sneered, \u201cIt\u2019s just corruption.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Shan He and the others heard what he said, they were furious. Was this guy trying to create trouble? Was he dumb? How could he say such a thing in an event like this?</p><br/><p>Those with a brain would have known what the purpose of the ceremony was.</p><br/><p>However, there was another possibility. Perhaps this fella was trying to get on Godfather Ma\u2019s nerves.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, things would be terrible. Some of them were even looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s fingers were trembling. He was furious at Lin Fan. However, it wasn\u2019t the appropriate time to rage. He forced a smile, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it is because of corruption, the people in the organization are all talented professionals\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re just parasite,\u201d Lin Fan interrupted.</p><br/><p>Clatter!</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou stood up forcefully and glared at Lin Fan. Then, he said, \u201cGodly doctor, please watch your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Lin Fan sneered. His sneer seemed to be asking him to f*ck off.</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He had never seen such an arrogant man before. He asked, \u201cWhere is the godly doctor from? He is an interesting man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am from Zhongzhou. I don\u2019t know if I am an interesting man or not. Do you know who I am? I have a backing that none of you can afford to mess with,\u201d Lin Fan said confidently.</p><br/><p>That was terrifying!</p><br/><p>It was really terrifying.</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He was absolutely stunned by what Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He had a backing indeed and he was someone that they couldn\u2019t afford to infuriate.</p><br/><p>But who could that be?</p><br/><p>Could it be a regional general or something?</p><br/><p>If that was the case, they really couldn\u2019t afford to mess with him.</p><br/><p>Even Godfather Ma\u2019s backing couldn\u2019t afford to infuriate him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know who it is?\u201d Wang Shan He was a little nervous. Then, he drank a small sip of tea from the tea cup.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI am the successor of a party and the crowd is my backing. Can you afford to infuriate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>*spurt*</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He spat out the tea that he just drank. He was absolutely stunned. Was he a crazy man?</p><br/><p>Initially, he thought that he was referring to a powerful individual but he didn\u2019t expect to be pranked.</p><br/><p>The other big shots were also stunned. How could anyone with a brain say such a stupid remark?</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, you really like to joke,\u201d Wang Shan He chuckled. He finally understood that this godly doctor was a crazy man.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m joking? I\u2019ve never joked about these things before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Ma Qing Zhou couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cGodly doctor, just tell me how much money you want for you to treat my disease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He didn\u2019t say anything else. They just needed to listen to the outcome of Godfather Ma\u2019s discussion.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his fingers.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou looked at him, \u201cGodly doctor, you\u2019re really not shy about it. $60 million? Fine, I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and looked at him. \u201cWhat did you say? You must be a poor beggar.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

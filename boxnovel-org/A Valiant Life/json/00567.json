Such a great car but it got ruined to such a state. How big of a heart must he have had?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be here.\u201d According to the location that Chen Yun Yi said. This should be the place.</p><br/><p>Entering the lift, he realized that he actually required a card to go to the intended level. This was awkward. Fortunately, a cleaner auntie came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Auntie. I\u2019m going to the fifteenth floor but I don\u2019t have my card with me. Could you help me swipe yours? Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With his confident and relaxed manner, she naturally did not suspect him. She kindly helped him to swipe her card.</p><br/><p>The lift went straight to the fifteenth floor.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to room 1504.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a man stood in front of the room entrance. He frowned, \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Chen Yun Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t recognize Lin Fan. \u201cShe\u2019s not here. You\u2019re at the wrong place.\u201d</p><br/><p>But then, a voice suddenly came from inside the room, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m inside. I\u2019m inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said cheerily, \u201cLook, she\u2019s inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man took out his phone and called his boss. But suddenly, the phone was snatched away. Just as he was about to open his mouth, he suddenly realized that he couldn\u2019t move his body.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blew his finger. \u201cChinese Medicine is domineering indeed. This hitting of acupuncture points is really reliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi opened the door. When she saw Master Lin, she burst into tears of joy. \u201cMaster Lin, I didn\u2019t think that you would really come!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went into the room, smiling, \u201cYou called me to come and help, how could I not come? Everything is fine now. You can leave now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Yi, who\u2019s this?\u201d The manager, Sister Liu looked at Lin Fan, then suddenly froze as if she had thought of something. Then, she said to Chen Yun Yi, \u201cDo you know that by doing this, you will cause trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi replied, \u201cSister Liu, I\u2019m really not willing. I want to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Liu said helplessly, \u201cHow will you leave? Will you never come back to the company again? You have to know that you\u2019ve signed the agreement. Even if you get away today, you would be breaking the contract if you don\u2019t come back to the company again. If this goes to the court, you\u2019ll be sued. Would you be able to pay for it?</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan fell silent. Sister Liu was right. So what if they escaped today? They would have to pay for breaking the contract. Right now, they were filled with regret. Back then, they had let the joy fill their heads and they had never looked closely at the agreement. Thinking back now, they were in deep regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Who\u2019s your boss?\u201d I\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Sister Liu didn\u2019t know who this young man was. Just as she was about to refute, she suddenly stopped and her expression changed slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am Master Lin. What about it?\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He was now a well-known person. There weren\u2019t many people in Shanghai who didn\u2019t know him anymore.</p><br/><p>Especially those who were in this industry. Who didn\u2019t pay attention to the Weibo trending topics? Lin Fan had been on the trending list numerous times and could be said to be very well-known. Moreover, a number of celebrities hated him just because he always stole the headlines.</p><br/><p>Sister Liu said in astonishment, \u201cYun Yi, Luo Dan, you called Master Lin over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmmhmm.\u201d Chen Yun Yi nodded. When she had no other options, she had thought of Master Lin. She had always observed him. His reputation had gotten greater and greater. It was completely different from when she had just got to know about him.</p><br/><p>Sister Liu thought for a moment, then shook her head. \u201cSigh, even if you\u2019re here, I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t work. The people coming have very impressive backgrounds, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t think too much about this. Where is your boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Liu never thought that Chen Yun Yi would know Master Lin. This matter wasn\u2019t hers to care about anymore. She knew about Master Lin\u2019s status in Shanghai. He was a very capable person as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be in the reception room right now, receiving the guests,\u201d said Sister Liu.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s go together. I\u2019ll resolve this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reception room.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui said with a face full of smiles, \u201cChief Chang, Chief Shen, we are honored by your presence. Please excuse me for not going out to meet you. I\u2019ve already made arrangements for today. Everything has already been settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men referred to as Chief Chang and Chief Shen were both young. Thirty at most.</p><br/><p>They used to be called young masters but they felt that this salutation was for profligate sons of rich people. Then, each of them started a company for fun, just to invest a little to play around. When they went out now, people addressed them as \u2018Chief\u2019 and it felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>Chief Chang smiled, \u201cChief He, since we\u2019re here this time, we have to see your sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui, of course, knew what he meant. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m taking care of things, so you don\u2019t have to worry. When it\u2019s for you two, how could I not do a good job? Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui felt that this was a great deal for him. Initially, with his own abilities, he thought that it was impossible to meet these two important figures. He had never expected them to come looking for him themselves, saying that they wanted to discuss a certain business. And the intermediaries in this deal were Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan.</p><br/><p>When he had signed these two people, he was just trying his luck. He had never thought that such a good thing would come from this. It was indeed a joyous occasion.</p><br/><p>He was very envious of these young masters. For women, they came all the way here from Beijing to \u2018discuss business\u2019 with him. Their ultimate objective was to get the two ladies.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui wanted to interact with them as well. After all, it was difficult to get into that social circle. It wasn\u2019t possible without having the relevant connections.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad. Not bad.\u201d Chief Shen laughed contently.</p><br/><p>He Ming then asked cautiously, \u201cChief Chang, you said that there will be another big figure coming. Why haven\u2019t I seen him yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Chang smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t ask too much. He has gone to do something and he should be here in a bit. Also, when he comes, don\u2019t call us \u2018Chief\u2019 anymore. Just call me Young Chang to save us from being scolded.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui didn\u2019t quite understand the situation but he nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>These people really knew how to play. He couldn\u2019t quite keep up with their tempo.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Master Lin isn\u2019t around?\u201d a man standing at the shop entrance asked.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan saw the man and shook her head, \u201cHe\u2019s not around. He just went out. What do you have for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not here, then forget it. When he comes back, tell him that I, Zou Tian Fu, has submitted to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan didn\u2019t understand this. \u201cHow strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reception room.</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui was praising the two big shots. When he saw Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan, he smiled. Then, he went forward and asked, \u201cHave you thought it through?\u201d</p><br/><p>But at that moment, a hand came and shoved him away. \u201cWho\u2019s He Ming Hui?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui, who had been shoved aside, was dumbfounded. Then, he sulked, \u201cWho are you? Where are you from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this is our Chief, He Ming Hui,\u201d said Chen Yun Yi.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan only realized now that He Ming Hui was the guy who he had shoved aside. \u201cWhere am I from? I\u2019m from Cloud Street. Let me tell you something. These two are my friends. What do you want to do with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin?\u201d He Ming Hui was startled. He took a closer look and realized that it was true.</p><br/><p>His expression changed slowly. A smile appeared on his face. \u201cSo it\u2019s Master Lin. This is a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that it\u2019s a misunderstanding. I\u2019m talking to you about something. These two are my friends, what do you want with them?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui was a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t infuriate this Master Lin. Everyone in Shanghai knew how powerful this Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>However, the unbridled Young Chang and Young Shen were thinking, \u201cWhat is this guy trying to do? What does he want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

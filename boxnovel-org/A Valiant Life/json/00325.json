Director Hu felt that something was amiss, but he also felt that it wasn't that much of a big deal, so he continued working.</p><br/><p>\"There are a lot of celebrities featured in 'Celebrity Family', but I don't like a few of them,\" Zhao Zhong Yang said casually.</p><br/><p>\"How come?\" Lin Fan looked puzzled.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, do you know what the backstabbers club is?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"Not sure, since when was there this club? And what is this backstabbers club?\"</p><br/><p>\"Have you been living under a rock? It's basically all those guys who don't care about anything else but getting girls and would even backstab their other guy friends just to do it. Out of the celebrities in this show, there are two of them who are guilty of this, and the guy who got backstabbed is faring quite badly now.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan processed what he just heard. \"D*mn, if I had known about this earlier I wouldn't have agreed to this. Whatever. Since I've already agreed, it's better not to back out last minute now.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled lecherously. \"When will they come over? I just did a search on it. There are quite a few pretty celebrities on the programme.\"</p><br/><p>\"You better stand aside old man. Keep your evil desires to yourself,\" Lin Fan laughed, nagging at him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu You Lan suddenly let out a cry of surprise, \"Brother Lin, quick take a look at your Weibo. The National Sports Association said your ideology isn't passable and doesn't meet their requirements.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately sprung out in annoyance as he whipped out his cellphone, opening his Weibo and replying the very next instant.</p><br/><p>\"Stop talking so big. I was the one who rejected you guys, don't twist the story.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept his cell phone after sending that Weibo, letting his fans settle the issue for him. Now that the deed had been done, he didn't do anything more and he felt too lazy to refute them if they sent something again.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>6 o'clock at night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was getting ready to leave the shop.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming suddenly appeared in front of Lin Fan. \"Uncle...\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at He Xiao Ming in surprise. \"What happened to you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, I feel like treating you to dinner tonight,\" He Xiao Ming said as he stood at the doorway</p><br/><p>It had been quite a while since that case. He Xiao Ming now learned properly and was moving upwards everyday. Although it was tough in the factory, he felt that if his father could withstand rigors worse than what he was going through, he could definitely do it too. Hence, he persevered, determined to make a successful career.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han felt that everything had been going smoothly lately. His son had suddenly become sensible and this was way better than closing a huge business deal. All of these could only be due to Master Lin's effort; if not for Master Lin, he didn't know when his son would have wisened up and become more responsible.</p><br/><p>\"You should play with your own things, kid. You shouldn't participate in the world of adults.\" Lin Fan waved him away.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming walked up to Lin Fan. \"Uncle, I'm being genuine here. Just agree with me this once. I was an irresponsible brat before and I didn't treat you with respect, but now I've turned over a new leaf. My respect for you is unceasing and overflowing, and I would like to express my gratitude by doing this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scanned He Xiao Ming, whose eyes met his. \"Uncle, I'm sincere about this.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, since you have so much respect, I'll agree to your request just this once. Where to?\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming let out a huge grin. \"Uncle, get into my car. I have a few friends inside as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Friends?\" Lin Fan was surprised.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was beaming with delight. \"Yep.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't get behind the wheel this time but sat in He Xiao Ming's car, which was more eye-catching compared to Lin Fan's one. Ever since he had broken up with his girlfriend, he had resolved to become a better person. After all, he was still young and had many things to learn, and he had decided not to get another girlfriend until he became more mature.</p><br/><p>After turning over a new leaf, he realized that he saw everything in a different light, feeling that everything was beating with such joy and radiance.</p><br/><p>\"You're bringing me here?\" Lin Fan asked as they pulled over.</p><br/><p>In front of him was an open-air restaurant. Lin Fan had originally thought that He Xiao Ming would bring him to somewhere more high-class and never thought he would end up here. He Xiao Ming grinned. \"Uncle, I've worked a few days and asked for an advance so that I could treat you and a few of my friends. Usually, I come here with my friends to chill when I have nothing better to do, so we're quite friendly with the staff here.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \"Alright, here is good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Actually, I don't use Dad's money anymore. I'm earning my own now,\" He Xiao Ming said sneakily.</p><br/><p>\"Not using your dad's money and still driving this car? Do you even have enough money to pay for the gas?\" Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming shook his head. \"This one doesn't count. My house doesn't have any cheaper cars. Anyway, my dad told me that this is only a means of transportation for me and it belongs to the family. It doesn't belong to me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Makes sense.\" Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>After getting off the car.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ming, over here...\" a group of young people called out.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ming, who is this?\" one of the youngsters asked.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming jokingly chided him, \"Yang Zai, this is my uncle. You guys better show him some respect. Although he's young, he's extremely capable.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha! Any uncle of Xiao Ming's is an uncle of ours. Come, sit over here. We're all Xiao Ming's friends and there are no strangers here.\" Yang Zai laughed, thereafter calling for the manager. \"Boss, fifty skewers of large kidneys.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn it, can you order a little less? I don't have enough money.\" He Xiao Ming scolded him.</p><br/><p>\"Give us a hundred skewers!\" yelled Yang Zai</p><br/><p>\"My lord...\" He Xiao Ming looked on helplessly. He turned to Lin Fan. \"Uncle, all of these guys here are my really good friends. I've already cut contact with all my unreliable and flaky friends.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>This bunch of youngsters was very lively, but Lin Fan felt annoyed when he was addressed as someone who was from the older generation. It was too big of a jump for his age.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, this solid lad here is called Zhang Yang, but we call him Yang Zai. The fat one is called Zhao Xu, but we just call him Fatty, and this one here...\" He Xiao Ming introduced everyone one by one.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, how do you do? We are all close friends of Xiao Ming. In the past, Xiao Ming only hung out with that girl and completely ignored us, but now he started hanging out with us again, so we willingly accepted him back.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming glared at Zhang Yang. \"Would it kill to talk less? Uncle, please don't listen to what he's saying.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang laughed heartily, picking up the empty bottle in front of him and throwing it. He Xiao Ming dodged it but in the next instant, the glass bottle shattered on the floor, creating a loud sound.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Who's the hooligan who threw this glass bottle here?\" a shirtless male who was sitting at the table next theirs stood up and looked around, before averting his gaze to the table where Lin Fan was sitting.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang froze in panic. He had never thought that this would happen.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming waved his hands. \"I'll settle this.\" He stood up and walked up to the big man. \"Bro, sorry about that. I was playing with my friends and we got a little carried away and didn't notice. Please don't be angry at us. How about I treat you to something?\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck your mom, blind a*s. Do you know who we are?\" The big dude was a little drunk. He raised his fists and landed a punch aimed at He Xiao Ming's face. He Xiao Ming was way smaller than him and immediately got knocked back a few steps.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there, stunned. \"Are you okay?\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was only eighteen and had never experienced this before. With that one punch, his face was red and swoon, and tears were welling up in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and the rest all stood there frozen, but they stood their ground and stood up.</p><br/><p>The huge guy pointed his finger at them as he saw them standing up. \"Brats, what do you think you guys are doing? Do you think that you guys are strong just because there are a lot of you? Don't think I'll let you guys go until you guys bow down to me and apologize.\"</p><br/><p>An uproar!</p><br/><p>The friends of the big guy all stood up, glaring aggressively at Zhang Yang and the rest.</p><br/><p>One of the big guy's friends looked around seventeen or eighteen years old. He had a tanned complexion and his body had a huge tattoo of a dog. In between his eyebrows was another tattoo of an eye. It was a brainless trend to have such a tattoo.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, we can handle this. You don't have to worry. We won't cause trouble,\" He Xiao Tian said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there, his mind going blank for a moment before he looked at He Xiao Tian, surprised. He had ever thought that this kid would advocate for the option that would cause the least trouble.</p><br/><p>The huge guy jeered. \"You don't want any trouble? What a shame.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"Don't fear, uncle is here.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone looked on with surprise as they saw Lin Fan directly going up to the huge guy. His hands swiftly went for the neck as lifted the huge guy. He was at least a two hundred pound behemoth but Lin Fan lifted him like he was lifting air.</p><br/><p>\"One shouldn't be this reckless. Although you guys look brainless, it doesn't take much to have some self-control,\" Lin Fan looked up as he calmly said.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

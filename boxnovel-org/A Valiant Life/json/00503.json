Extra!</p><br/><p>Big news!</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A piece of news appeared on several big websites. Countless viewers saw the news and were instantly stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Shanghai police has finally cracked the 1997 \u2018Family Massacre\u2019. The two suspects murdered the boss of a hotel and his family of four for money. At that time, this incident caused a severe social impact. As of now, the case has been cracked. According to Inspector Liu, who handled this case, the suspect, Liu Bing (Alias: Liu Biao), surrendered himself voluntarily and also revealed the other suspect, Huang Jun. Before dawn, Huang Jun has been apprehended by the local police in Lianzhou and the case has finally ended. And according to reporters who interviewed Liu Biao, they obtained information of a shocking incident\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The content of the article was long but the information shook the hearts of many people.</p><br/><p>The netizens were in an intense discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this is amazing. After being on the run for twelve years, one became a writer and the other one became an entrepreneur with immense wealth. Just how the heck did this happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the main point. The important part is that Liu Biao said that while he was having his back scrubbed at the bathhouse last night, he suddenly figured it out because of the scrub and decided to surrender himself. Even the phone number of the inspector he surrendered to was given by the back scrubber.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, why does this sound like a fictional story?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich bathhouse\u2019s back-scrubber is so awesome? To be able to scrub awake a suspect who has been on the run for twelve years, that\u2019s too perverse, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zeng\u2019s Bath Centre. This is the one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens kept discussing intensely. They expressed limitless shock towards this incident. To them, this seemed impossible. However, they had to believe it. The police had chased the suspects for twelve years to no avail but now, one of the suspects got awoken by a back-scrubber. Who would believe something like this?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The detainment room!</p><br/><p>Liu Biao was sitting there with a relaxed expression on his face.</p><br/><p>A policeman asked, \u201cYou feel at ease now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao nodded, \u201cYes, I\u2019m at ease now. I\u2019ve never felt so at ease in these past twelve years.\u201d</p><br/><p>This had been an unresolved case for a long time. Now that it had been cracked, it was a joyous occasion. Not only had the culprits been apprehended, but the victims have also received justice and could finally rest in peace.</p><br/><p>The policeman said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been running for twelve years. Why did you suddenly turn yourself in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. I didn\u2019t have such thoughts at first but last night, I was having a bath at a bath center and there was a Little Bro there. When he scrubbed my back, I suddenly felt that I should turn myself in, so I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>The policemen all looked at each other as they felt that this was very strange. He got scrubbed into turning himself in? Who would believe such a thing?</p><br/><p>The policeman asked once more, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao nodded, \u201cYes, I\u2019m serious. That\u2019s really what happened.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian, who had been quiet all along, finally spoke, \u201cWho gave you my phone number?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao replied, \u201cThat back-scrubbing Little Bro. He said his surname was Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard the surname \u2018Lin\u2019, Liu Xiao Tian immediately knew who it was. The surrounding policemen had an idea too. The only person who was familiar with Inspector Liu and had the surname \u2018Lin\u2019 was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But this was strange too. Why was Master Lin working as a back-scrubber in a bathhouse?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at today\u2019s news and smiled to himself. He had never thought that he would be on the news once again. Although no names were mentioned and nobody knew it was him, knowing it himself was enough.</p><br/><p>To make a murderer, who had been on the run for twelve years, turn himself in was not a bad thing.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve been amazing once again,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian sighed.</p><br/><p>He should have found out that it was Lin Fan the previous day but because this matter was a severe once, Liu Xiao Tian immediately arranged for the trials without asking too much. He had been busy finding out who the other culprit was. After much hard work, they had finally captured the other culprit at the airport. That was how this case was cracked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt was alright. You\u2019ve captured the other one already, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian replied, \u201cYes, we\u2019ve captured him. But what I want to ask is, why did you become a back-scrubber at a bathhouse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t say that it was to complete a task. So he said cheerily, \u201cNo particular reason. I\u2019m just experiencing life. How is it? I scrubbed the conscience out of a murderer and made him surrender himself. Do I deserve a Good Citizen Award?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s definitely not a problem. Let\u2019s talk later. The Station Chief is calling me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Liu Xiao Tian shook his head. This person, Master Lin, was way too mysterious.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The forums were buzzing with activity.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, he became famous. Did you all see the news today? That culprit had looked for the young man to get a back scrub. After being scrubbed, he went to turn himself in. That\u2019s really mysterious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m really curious. I have to go and look for this back-scrubber tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough talk. Tonight, he\u2019ll definitely be having many customers. That Little Bro from this bathhouse has been very popular lately. I have to go and try it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>The front desk service staff, Xiao He, looked at the situation before her and was absolutely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The bathhouse was as crowded as a marketplace and they had run out of private rooms. A group of people sat on the sofa in the lounge.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any private room yet? We\u2019re all waiting here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Why are there so little rooms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you all come from? I\u2019m an old customer here. The back-scrubbers here are first-rate but even so, word shouldn\u2019t have spread so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao He slowly watched from the side. \u201cOnce there are spaces, I\u2019ll immediately make arrangements for you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>On a certain food street.</p><br/><p>A hawker stall.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Zeng, have you considered what I said? I can make arrangements for the people. We\u2019ll split the profits nine to one. Nine for me and one for you. Don\u2019t say that you\u2019re not getting enough money. You have to know that the workers will all be mine, so I\u2019m taking a risk as well. Moreover, it\u2019ll carry your bathhouse forward as well,\u201d said a skinny man.</p><br/><p>He was the man in charge of the prostitutes, the brothel-keeper. And he was currently discussing this matter with Elder Zeng.</p><br/><p>Elder Zeng was hesitant. Recently, his mind had been in a mess because of this matter. He kept thinking about whether he should do it. After all, once he decided, there was no turning back.</p><br/><p>The skinny man saw that Elder Zeng was still considering. He smiled and said, \u201cBoss Zeng, you can consider but you have to know that in this line of work, we are very busy. There are countless bathhouses that want to work with us. If you miss this opportunity, there won\u2019t be a second one. According to you, your bathhouse only has twenty to thirty customers a day. That\u2019s not even enough to earn back your daily rent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zeng nodded, \u201cI know that but I\u2026sigh, okay then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The skinny man said with a smile, \u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go to your shop first to have a look. Some of the decorations inside need to be changed and some hidden doors need to be installed. How many bathhouses do you think there are now that don\u2019t do things like this? Those bathhouses simply cannot last for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei didn\u2019t say much else. The skinny man was right. That was indeed the case.</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei didn\u2019t want to do this but he had no choice. He was forced to do it.</p><br/><p>If he was to be caught by the police, he might be done for.</p><br/><p>But if he did not introduce these things, in this current industry, he would surely be done for.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all he could do was take the crooked path and bet his all on it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

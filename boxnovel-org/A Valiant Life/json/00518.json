Why don\u2019t you have a seat first? I\u2019ll let him know when the meeting is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Then, he sat down and waited.</p><br/><p>To them, although Master Lin wasn\u2019t a police officer, they felt that he was more qualified than any of them to be a police officer. They had cracked a lot of cases with his help. They were really grateful for that.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Inspector Liu and Master Lin were close to one another.</p><br/><p>One of the police officers served a cup of tea. \u201cMaster Lin, please have some tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the new colleagues didn\u2019t know who this man was. Then, he asked curiously, \u201cWho is this man? Why is he so welcome here? It seems like he is even more welcome than our Inspector. You guys have been treating him so nicely ever since he came in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, newbie. You don\u2019t even know Master Lin? You\u2019ll know in the future. Be more respectful. He is a powerful individual.\u201d</p><br/><p>The new colleague nodded, \u201cOkay\u2026 Okay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Liu Xiao Tian came out and when he saw Lin Fan, he smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, what brought you here? Don\u2019t tell me yet. Let me guess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian felt that Lin Fan\u2019s appearance at the police station meant that he was going to help them crack another case.</p><br/><p>As he continued thinking\u2026</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, \u201cYou must have found out something about a big case, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian chuckled, \u201cI knew it. Let\u2019s talk in my office.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, this time, Liu Xiao Tian was probably going to vomit blood.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m not in a very good mood today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something bad happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Xiao Tian, \u201cDid you see the trending news today? The old lady got cheated of her savings and she died from sorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a news?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was stunned. Then, he read the news. \u201cNo, that\u2019s in the countryside. It doesn\u2019t involve us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cInspector Liu, how could you say that? We are from the same country. How could you say that it has nothing to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true. However, what happened in the countryside should be managed by the people there. We don\u2019t have the authority to care about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. You just have to see if you want to be involved in this. Look, although the people there got scammed, these scammers are definitely not from the countryside. Therefore, this matter can be said to be affecting the whole nation. What do you think?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian remained silent for a moment. He was wondering what had happened to Master Lin today. It was as if he wanted to manage this matter. He knew that Master Lin was a man of morals and this caused Liu Xiao Tian to admire him a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, tell me the truth. Do you want to manage this matter? Did you read the fortune of someone?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian knew that Master Lin was a pro at fortune-telling. However, they were public servicemen and they couldn\u2019t believe in that. Still, Liu Xiao Tian really trusted him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cHow could I have read the fortune of anyone? However, I got another idea. If Inspector Liu is willing to help, it would be resolved in a matter of minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clearly impossible to be resolved in minutes. However, saying that meant that he was really confident.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was interested now. If he could crack another case, it would be a good thing even if he didn\u2019t get promoted.</p><br/><p>However, he was getting curious. \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m doubting you but can you tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and drank a sip of tea calmly. \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t told you about this but my computing skills are superb. As long as I want to hack into something, there\u2019s nothing that could stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian looked at Lin Fan in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not believe me?\u201d Lin Fan asked. He didn\u2019t expect Liu Xiao Tian to be doubtful of his abilities despite the fact that he had helped him crack a few cases before.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian waved his hand, \u201cThat\u2019s not it. It\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t believed anything like this before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThen do you support me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely support you. Tell me then, what do you want me to do?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked. He didn\u2019t understand the situation and wanted to find out more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cActually, you don\u2019t have to do anything. It\u2019s just that I need to make something clear. If I violated the law and got arrested, you have to save me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was shocked. \u201cWait, what do you mean by that? Breaking the law? I don\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan suddenly realized that it was difficult to communicate with Liu Xiao Tian. \u201cLook, I want to find those scammers. I would have to hack into their bank accounts and the police\u2019s bank accounts. If I was to get caught, I\u2019d be doomed. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was stunned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cStop huh-ing. Tell me if what I said was right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to be using a method like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you have to be calm about this and not be rash. Regardless of what happens, you can\u2019t hack them. If you were to hack them, things would go out of hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNo, this world needs justice. I don\u2019t mind suffering for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian realized that Master Lin looked like he was glowing. It was a bright and strong light. It was as if he was a God.</p><br/><p>Could he really be seeking justice for them?</p><br/><p>However, something seemed off. Lin Fan stood up and asked sternly, \u201cInspector Liu, I\u2019m just here to give you a heads up today. It\u2019s to prevent you from doing the wrong thing in the future when the situation arises. Till then, don\u2019t stress over it. Do whatever you like. I\u2019ll be making a move first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian recovered from his daze. \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t be rash. We can discuss it. If you end up in jail and can\u2019t get out\u2026Hey, hey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>D*mn it.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian slapped his thigh and called his boss immediately. It was a big piece of news and Master Lin didn\u2019t seem to be joking.</p><br/><p>If he really did that, even if it was out of good will, he would definitely be imprisoned.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was his good friend and he didn\u2019t want to see him in prison. He would have to do something about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s not for sure. Master Lin said that he is a pro hacker. He will definitely know how to protect himself. Although that will cause another problem, I\u2019ll definitely keep it to myself and won\u2019t report it. I\u2019ll give the Station Chief a heads up first and prepare myself for it,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian thought to himself.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan exited from the police station. At that moment, he felt that the matter was improbable.</p><br/><p>Then, he suddenly thought of Zheng Zhong Shan. If he could get Zheng Zhong Shan involved, things would definitely be fine.</p><br/><p>Alright\u2026 that was it!</p><br/><p>After all, it wouldn\u2019t be that bad to be caught. He would be able to hide from the wrath of Brother Qiang Qiang.</p></div>\n</div>"}

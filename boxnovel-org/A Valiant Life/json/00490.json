This was a big issue but if it was back in the old times, the news would not have spread to such a large extent. However, since it was the age of the internet, if something happened today, by tomorrow, the whole world would know about it. It was truly a terrifying prospect.</p><br/><p>Also, this issue caused by this one person, Wu Tao, had implicated so many people. This was something everyone thought was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Whenever Lin Fan looked at the news, he would laugh. He knew a long time ago that there would be he would and up in jail and it would be a severe sentence. Wu Tao had been insistent on going against Lin Fan. That was simply asking for death.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu You Lan came over and poured tea for Lin Fan. Then, she sat opposite Lin Fan, both hands under her chin, staring at him with her eyes wide open and with a twinkle in them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sipped the tea, smiled and said, \u201cYou Lan, what are you doing? I can see a love-struck gleam in your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPah! You are the one who is love-struck. I\u2019m just here trying to study you and see what other things you are hiding from me,\u201d Wu You Lan replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cIf you guys didn\u2019t ask, you guys would not know. Actually, I do have one thing that I have been hiding from you guys. Do you see my two hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded and replied, \u201cYes I do. So what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you. My two hands are really good at scrubbing backs, it\u2019s really very comfortable,\u201d Lin Fan said. Thinking about the 11th page of knowledge made him feel like crying.</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan heard that, her cheeks turned red and she said, \u201cBrother Lin, you went out for awhile and then\u2026 then, forget it,\u201d Wu You Lan said as she dejectedly went to hide in the corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s is it? I\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d Lin Fan helplessly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it comes to back scrubbing, there really isn\u2019t anyone better than me. When I was going through tough times back then, I used to scrub backs in Xiaohong\u2019s bath center. My technique was so good that there was a long line of people chasing me to scrub their backs. It\u2019s a pity that my interests did not lie in back scrubbing. If not, I would have become the most famous back scrubber in the nation,\u201d Fraud Tian said as he reminisced about the past. He could not help letting out a sigh.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian. He really despised how Fraud Tian seemed to have such exotic talents.</p><br/><p>You are a Fraud and yet you still insist on being multi-talented. Do you not know that this will be the death of some people?</p><br/><p>\u201cShall we go to the bathroom and have a contest?\u201d Fraud Tian smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shot a glance at him and said, \u201cWho would want to compete with you? I\u2019m going for a stroll, you guys take care of the shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to end of Cloud Street. There was a bath center there. Although the place was not very big in size, it had a good enough reputation. The boss was a short and fat person who was very likable. Although Lin Fan interact with the guy much, he had come to queue at Lin Fan\u2019s shop many times before. After some time, they had become familiar with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, how come you have the time to come here?\u201d at the bath center\u2019s entrance, the boss, Elder Zeng asked with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cI was thinking of you so I came over to find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei was happy at that moment. He knew what Little Boss stood for in Cloud Street so he spoke to him in a very welcoming manner, saying, \u201cLittle Boss, I bought some good teas recently, do you want to try some?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had initially been planning to find a bathhouse. If he was going to go to someone else\u2019s house for it, he might as well go to his neighbors\u2019 one. He then smiled and said, \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to trouble you to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei brewed the tea, poured it for him and said, \u201cPlease, try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no idea how to judge tea so he took a sip and said, \u201cNot bad, not bad. Oh yes, Elder Zeng, how has your business been, recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei shook his head and said, \u201cPassable. It hasn\u2019t been doing poorly but hasn\u2019t been earning much money either. Looks like you\u2019re having trouble believing what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cIt is a little hard to believe. The shop\u2019s decor isn\u2019t bad and the location is quite good. How can you not be earning money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t have that thing. You should know what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was talking about prostitutes, wasn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>However, it was true. Here in Shanghai, this field was well developed. Eight out of every ten of these bathhouses would have such an item. As for the other two, they depended entirely on their own capabilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I first opened this store, I had analyzed the situation. What I saw were many laborers that came to Shanghai. However, what I did not realize is that when people came to these bathhouses, they were also there to relax. Not just relax, but to do that also. So, given that I don\u2019t provide that, how can I compete with others? Look at that Golden Phoenix Bath Centre. Their one night of business is equal to a month of mine. Don\u2019t you think that is scary?\u201d Zeng Wei said. Zeng Wei admired them but would not dare to do something like that because if he got caught, it would be a tragedy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are that amazing?\u201d Lin Fan exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely. They are not just amazing but they are simply money grabbing. You see, their lowest price is 698 dollars and the highest goes up to 1288. There are even times where they are at full capacity. Also, if you want to go for higher quality, it can go up to two or three thousand dollars. However, that\u2019s other people\u2019s business. I\u2019ll just mind my own, I don\u2019t have the guts to do something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and then asked, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m prepared to work here as a back-scrubber, what do you think of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zeng Wei laughed and said. Then, his expression changed and he was dumbfounded as he looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cLittle Boss, what did you say just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked his eyes and then said, \u201cI want to come here and work as a back scrubber, what do you think of that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei had a stupid look on his face as he looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cLittle Boss, you aren\u2019t pulling my leg right? How can my small little shop\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cut him off and said, \u201cSo will you let me? We are all neighbors, I won\u2019t joke with you like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know how to scrub backs?\u201d Zeng Wei doubtfully asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke. My back scrubbing skills are the best in the world. As long as I come here to work, your business will turn around and increase more than tens of times,\u201d Lin Fan boasted.</p><br/><p>Regarding Little Boss\u2019 request, he did not reject it. Even if Little Boss did not know how to do it, he still had to agree since it was the Little Boss asking.</p><br/><p>Also, Little Boss was so popular around Cloud Street and everyone admired him. So he might be able to bring some extra business along.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then it\u2019s a deal. You can relax, I guarantee that I am not wrong,\u201d Lin Fan said as he got up. \u201cI shan\u2019t bother you anymore, I\u2019m going to buy some goods. As for wages, you need not bother about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei was still in shock and he said, \u201cLittle Boss, why are you doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan very seriously replied, \u201cTo experience every profession. To leave a legend in this industry. To become the benchmark in this industry. I don\u2019t think you will understand. That\u2019s all, I shall take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei still had that retarded look on his face as he stared at Lin Fan. He had already been left in a daze by him. He still did not understand what was going on and even after much thought, he still did not get it. He felt that Little Boss was really too impulsive, acting so fast and not giving people any time to react.</p><br/><p>However, the fact that Little Boss agreed to come to his bath center and experience it would definitely help him out a lot.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it made him feel a little happy.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A group of unexpected guests arrived in front of the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was astonished. What in the world was going on?</p></div>\n</div>"}

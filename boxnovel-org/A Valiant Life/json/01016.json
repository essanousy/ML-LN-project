Although he might seem to be meddlesome to others, he had to admit that he was indeed a meddlesome person.</p><br/><p><em>If anyone can\u2019t stand it, they can come and beat me to death.</em></p><br/><p><em>If they can\u2019t beat me to death, then forget about extinguishing my meddlesome heart.</em></p><br/><p>Very soon, a police car arrived.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had already been promoted and he was now a Deputy Bureau Chief. Initially, this kind of thing should have been delegated to one of his subordinates to handle, but since Master Lin had called personally, he felt that he couldn\u2019t let Master Lin feel as if he didn\u2019t care about these things anymore after being promoted.</p><br/><p>To him, as long as it was a police report, regardless of what the situation was, he couldn\u2019t treat it as a small matter. He had to handle it as if it was something major.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, where are they?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian rushed over. Thereafter, several other policemen came and stood by his sides too. They occasionally stole glances at Master Lin. In their unit, the things they would hear most were stories involving Master Lin and their boss.</p><br/><p>To them, those stories were simply very encouraging.</p><br/><p>Their boss, Liu Xiao Tian, had only been an enforcement officer in the past, but after meeting Master Lin, he started to crack cases at an alarming rate and gradually rose to his current appointment.</p><br/><p>They also knew that their boss faced great pressure. He would treat every case seriously as he didn\u2019t want others to gossip about him.</p><br/><p>This case actually wasn\u2019t in their area of management, but their boss wouldn\u2019t care about such things. To him, the whole police force was a family. Whenever something happened, if they came across it, they had to handle it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the three men on the ground. \u201cThese are the three. They even wanted to hit me and escape with the child. If they read the news more often, they probably wouldn\u2019t have come up to confront me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian shook his head and laughed. Master Lin was right indeed. If anyone knew Master Lin, they would know that it was best not to go against him. Who would\u2019ve thought that those three youngsters would confront Master Lin like that? They had simply asked for their own deaths.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian gestured with his hand. \u201cBring them back for questioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The policemen nodded and immediately apprehended the three men.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cBring this girl back first and try to ask her questions. See if you can find her parents. If you really can\u2019t find them, she can stay at my welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \u201cAlright, no problem. If this girl was really being trafficked, we will definitely deal with these people severely. But we don\u2019t know if they have other accomplices yet. We have to interrogate them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that, just after that raid on such a big human trafficking group last year, there would still be people who dare to repeat that crime this year. They are simply behaving lawlessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was furious. It seemed that, under the allure of money, many people were willing to take risks.</p><br/><p>Those people felt that they didn\u2019t even have to do anything. All they had to do was watch over the children every day and they would earn money. In fact, the money they earned was quite substantial. They were utterly heartless.</p><br/><p>After Liu Xiao Tian and his men left, Lin Fan said goodbye to the surrounding townsfolk before leaving to another place to see if he could meet any suitable people.</p><br/><p>Then, he came to the side of a flower pool and took out his phone. He went on Weibo. He was very displeased about what had happened when he had called the police earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just came across a little girl being manipulated, begging in the middle of a crowded public square. I went up to ask her about it. Eventually, I apprehended a few men and called the police. Initially, I thought that the police would immediately be dispatched. However, the police gave me an unexpected answer. They said that they couldn\u2019t handle this matter and even gave me a random phone number and told me to call that number instead. I feel that this is very mysterious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only know to look for the police when I am in trouble. How would commoners like us know so many numbers? I felt a little disappointed but perhaps it was just an exceptional case. In the end, I called someone I know. He\u2019s now a Deputy Bureau Chief and he still came personally to handle the case. I\u2019m truly grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan\u2019s influence on Weibo was very big. Every move and every word from him drew the attention of countless people.</p><br/><p>Now that he had posted this Weibo, there were many topics of discussion within that post. It naturally stirred up many netizens to start discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is too ferocious. Why is it that I never come across such cases?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do come across them. You just don\u2019t notice them. Why don\u2019t you go out for a walk? If you see women with children begging on the streets, 9 out of 10 times, there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I support Master Lin. When we see such cases, we just have to call one number and we might be able to save a child. Perhaps the outcome might be personal but it doesn\u2019t affect us. If everyone can do this, there will be fewer children being trafficked in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^That makes sense. Actually, discovering human traffickers is even easier than discovering drug traffickers, because drug traffickers hide in shady places while human traffickers are often under broad daylight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s up with that number? Why don\u2019t they want to handle these cases?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that the person who said those words on the phone should be found and dealt with. If it wasn\u2019t Master Lin, but an ordinary person, that person might follow the police officer\u2019s instruction and call that number he was given. Or he might even forget about it and stop reporting the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped caring about this situation after posting that on Weibo. Instead, he continued to observe every person who was passing by on the street.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBureau Chief Qin, what do you have for me?\u201d He hadn\u2019t expected to receive this call right after sending his Weibo post. This was quite a quick response.</p><br/><p>Chief Qin said, \u201cSigh, Master Lin, I\u2019m really so sorry. It was a mistake in our work. Regarding what just happened, we will definitely deal with it severely and educate our people strictly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou do have to deal with it severely. When I made that call, I was really dumbfounded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. We will deal with it severely. This is completely tainting our reputation. We work tirelessly to serve the people and we\u2019ve done so many things but sometimes, a single person\u2019s words can ruin all of it. I really feel helpless,\u201d said Chief Qin with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm. As long as you have a clear conscience, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin continued, \u201cMaster Lin, can you remove your Weibo post then? After all, it has quite a bad impact on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so much, Chief Qin just wanted Master Lin to give him face and delete the Weibo post. After all, Master Lin was not a normal person. His influence was not normal either. Once he said something like that, it made things difficult for Chief Qin and the police.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cChief Qin, I know that it has a bad impact. However, when a problem happens, one has to bravely admit to it. Don\u2019t you think so? If we just suppress the matter and hide it, it might produce the opposite effect. What you\u2019ve just said to me, I definitely won\u2019t post that on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Chief Qin smiled embarrassedly. \u201cAlright, Master Lin. What you\u2019ve said is very reasonable. I will do a proper investigation and give the public a proper explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m hanging up then.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

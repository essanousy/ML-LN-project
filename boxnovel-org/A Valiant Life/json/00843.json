He felt that he had done something special.</p><br/><p>For his own safety, he didn\u2019t want to be involved in it.</p><br/><p>He agreed to meet them just to act in front of them. Now that Godfather Liu spilled the beans, the outcome was definitely going to cause destruction.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t know who the person was. However, he felt that he was definitely a big shot since he could bring policemen there to arrest people. Did they watch the broadcast? How did they arrive so quickly?</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Master Lin. I am Zhu Ting Jian. I have to thank you this time for making them spill the beans. If not, we couldn\u2019t have arrested them,\u201d Zhu Ting Jian said.</p><br/><p>He really wanted to thank Master Lin. He had attained his appointment for a few years now and he had been trying to arrest these two people but his efforts were in vain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said modestly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. It was a simple deed. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t expect that to happen. I didn\u2019t know he would spill the beans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I feel like the things that follow after this will be even more complicated. It\u2019s probably really difficult to get them to admit to their crimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The follow-up operations are more important. However, now that we have Master Lin\u2019s evidence, I want to see who would be capable to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and knew that this matter was going to be blow up.</p><br/><p>If he were to seize the opportunity, it would definitely involve a lot of people. That would be a groundbreaking event.</p><br/><p>Then, he went to the police station to record his statement before leaving.</p><br/><p>Who knew how many people had insomnia that night and who knew how many of them ran away in fear?</p><br/><p>Anyway, this didn\u2019t have anything to do with him anymore.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The day had just begun.</p><br/><p>The working crowd took out their phones and read the news. When they read it, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>They realized that fake news must have been published.</p><br/><p>\u2018The mastermind behind the logistics incident is revealed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin sacrificed himself and found out the truth.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Shocking. How can something like this exist in modern society\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>All the news articles started to surface online.</p><br/><p>The media platforms that were suppressed didn\u2019t dare to post about it. However, since the victims were arrested, they didn\u2019t care about it anymore. They just posted everything they knew.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>This matter had moved into the trending list.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is that real? If so, this society is too dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know who is Godfather Qin. He is a really powerful man here. I didn\u2019t expect him to be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I heard Godfather Qin donated to several schools and did a lot of good deeds. I didn\u2019t expect him to be the mastermind. If not for the video, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to punish these two men seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I think even death by gun execution would be considered to be lenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Master Lin. He really did a good deed. If not for Master Lin, who knew when these drugs will be uncovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>The news was not just being spread on Weibo. Some web forums and discussion websites had been talking about it since last night.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some townsfolk immediately posted the video online.</p><br/><p>Those that watched the video were in disbelief. They didn\u2019t expect such a thing to happen.</p><br/><p>However, the truth was before their eyes and they had to believe it. They didn\u2019t expect such law-defying things to have occurred in their peaceful and harmonious society.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin who was overseas, couldn\u2019t fall asleep anymore. She had been awakened by a phone call in her sleep.</p><br/><p>When she knew what had happened, she was dumbfounded. Then, she immediately looked at the local websites and read the news.</p><br/><p>When she read everything, she was infuriated.</p><br/><p>Especially since she saw the man that she hated the most in the video.</p><br/><p>It was over, it was really over.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin knew the severity of the issue. If they continued investigating it, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to escape.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up and read the news online. When he read the articles, he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, justice will always prevail.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that he was really courageous and fearless. He actually broadcasted their conversation and he convinced them to tell him everything.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the thing that he exchanged for from the Encyclopedia\u2019s departmental store was really powerful. Regardless of how much he drank, he was still fine.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang called. When he found out about the news, Wang Ming Yang was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how his brother did it. It was too daring.</p><br/><p>If he was a typical person, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to do it even if he was a courageous man.</p><br/><p>It was terrifying to think that his good friend was so fearless.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, bro, I wanted to ask you if there\u2019s anything that you can\u2019t do.\u201d Wang Ming Yang really admired Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>If he was a girl, he would have gone for Lin Fan without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how was that? Was that sick?\u201d Lin Fan woke up and got out of bed. He stood at his window and looked at the scenery. Something major had happened on such a peaceful day.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick. You\u2019re really sick. However, I really didn\u2019t dare to think that you actually used that method to take down Godfather Liu and Godfather Qin. I think they\u2019re doomed this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it for a moment and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I can only leave the matter here. The rest has to depend on themselves. However, several million people saw it and the video is being shared online. If someone dares to cover it up, I think the society is doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cThat\u2019s true. However, I think nobody would dare to cover it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cHey, these people are just asking for it. They just wanted to infuriate me. I am well-mannered and I didn\u2019t want this to happen too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Chen Chang Sheng called me early in the morning and he was really anxious. He said he\u2019ll have to thank you personally when you come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. He doesn\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve done for him. To him, you\u2019re his lifesaver. After resolving his problem, he has to thank you. If not, I\u2019ll kill him. Oh, right. When are you coming back?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it, \u201cMaybe tonight. I don\u2019t have anything else to do. Anyway, the things that are about to happen have nothing to do with me anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to stay there anymore. He felt that if he were to stay any longer, something bad was going to happen.</p><br/><p>There were definitely people that sided the culprits. If they were to look for him and seek vengeance, he\u2019d be doomed.</p><br/><p>As for the final outcome, he wanted to just leave it to the government.</p><br/><p>He was really confident in his government\u2019s ability to resolve things like this.</p></div>\n</div>"}

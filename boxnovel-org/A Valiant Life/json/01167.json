He definitely wouldn\u2019t doubt Ma Guo Hui\u2019s power. If Ma Guo Hui wanted to investigate someone, he would definitely find out everything about that person.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Zhao Xuan had quite a dirty background. If he were to get investigated, things would definitely turn out badly.</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, Zhao Xuan struggled frantically. His neck turned red as he squeaked, \u201cLet go of me! Let go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>He kept struggling harder and harder. It was as if he was getting nervous.</p><br/><p>The big man smiled. \u201cWow, kid, you\u2019re actually trying to struggle out of my grasp. You must be dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you down!\u201d</p><br/><p>The big man was very strong. There was no way he would let such a weakling escape from his grasp. If the kid could really escape, that would really be surprising.</p><br/><p>Although this kid had been his boss previously, this boss had made him go against Master Lin. Hence, he no longer treated this boss kindly.</p><br/><p>He had nearly been made to commit a huge offence.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a phone rang.</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan stopped struggling. He was panicking as he stared blankly at the phone. He didn\u2019t want to hear anything related to himself. If it was something bad, he would really be done for.</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Hui didn\u2019t say anything as he just listened to the voice from the phone.</p><br/><p>And this phone was pretty good. Not a single sound leaked out from it.</p><br/><p>This made Zhao Xuan even more terrified as he didn\u2019t know what the caller was saying. He was fearful that the opposite party had found out about him.</p><br/><p>His original plan had been to scam Ma Shao Hao. If Ma Guo Hui were to find out, he wouldn\u2019t be let off easily.</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>The call was hung up.</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Hui looked at Zhao Xuan expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Xuan looked back at him, not knowing what was going on exactly. He definitely wouldn\u2019t confess spontaneously. He had even planned to continue playing dumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, so you\u2019ve actually taken two lives before. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s very impressive.\u201d Ma Guo Hui already knew all of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan\u2019s face was white as paper as he cried out. He definitely wouldn\u2019t confess.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cChief Ma, what are you planning to do? Do you want to take him away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Hui smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, I run a proper business. This Zhao Xuan has actually taken lives before. I definitely have to take him to the police. I already have the evidence and I even have his identity. I really have to thank you for this, Master Lin. If it weren\u2019t for Master Lin, I really wouldn\u2019t have known that my stupid brat has been mixing with someone like this. Who knows how things would have turned out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. In reality, his warning wasn\u2019t necessary. With Ma Guo Hui\u2019s capability, he would have investigated Zhao Xuan sooner or later.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan just made it sooner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Zhao Xuan barked. He didn\u2019t doubt Ma Guo Hui\u2019s words. Although he had wiped his trail cleanly, he believed that Ma Guo Hui had definitely found something.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, two big men walked inside. Judging by their physiques, it seemed that they were Ma Guo Hui\u2019s bodyguards.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrab him and send him to the police station later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan panicked when he saw this. He wanted to run away, but with so many big shots in front of him, he could only dream of escaping.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This is for real? This guy has taken lives before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at the situation, it\u2019s probably true. I didn\u2019t expect that big shots these days were so powerful. He actually found out everything about him so quickly. That\u2019s too scary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why keyboard warriors are so dangerous. They can definitely find out all about you if they want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. 6666\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect that I would see such a scene on Brother Yang\u2019s broadcast. This is really eye-opening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that this guy would get taken away by the big shot to be dealt with. I didn\u2019t think he would be sent to the police station instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. You must be living in the past. This is a peaceful society we live in. He wouldn\u2019t just carry out that kind of private punishment. That\u2019s illegal. Sending him to the police is the wisest choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Ma Shao Hao is really fortunate to have come across Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the comments in the broadcast room and laughed happily. It seemed that his Internet buddies were very pleased with the broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why don\u2019t you come with me? I have to do the honors as a host,\u201d said Ma Guo Hui. He really wanted to get to know Master Lin better.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he had a rough idea of Yun Xue Yao\u2019s relationship with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If Yun Xue Yao could really be together with Master Lin, that would be a pretty good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time. Right now, I\u2019m just here to have some fun with my staff. If there is time in the future, it would be great if Chief Ma could come over to Shanghai to have some fun too,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Then, Ma Guo Hui turned to Ma Shao Hao. \u201cBrat, hurry up and thank Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Ma Shao Hao was stunned. <em>What the f*ck? Nothing happened and I\u2019m supposed to thank this guy? What the f*ck is going on?</em></p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan was his friend. Although he wasn\u2019t reliable, there was no need to capture him just like that. At the very least, the situation should be explained.</p><br/><p>However, Ma Shao Hao knew that he was f*cked. When he went home, he might receive a harsh beating from his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018Huh\u2019? Are you disobeying me?\u201d Ma Guo Hui glared at him. To Ma Shao Hao, this glare was filled with ferocity. It seemed as if his father wanted to take his life.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao was most fearful of his own father. Hence, he didn\u2019t dare to disobey.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Hui looked at the situation and had a rough idea of what was going on. \u201cMaster Lin, I shan\u2019t disturb your dinner any further. Let\u2019s get together in the future when we have the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Alright. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very soon, Ma Guo Hui left with his people. As for Ma Shao Hao, he now understood that he had no chance of getting revenge for that slap and that shoulder throw in this lifetime.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally settled.\u201d Lin Fan let out a deep sigh. So many problems had popped up just when they were having one meal. It really made him helpless.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was a reason he had done all this. After all, these incidents were related to Yun Xue Yao. Hence, it was best to kill off all the problems in one go.</p><br/><p>As for that Zhao Xuan, it could be considered his misfortune to have come across Lin Fan here.</p></div>\n</div>"}

The Education Department has given permission for the teaching materials to be used in the Chinese Medical Academies of the remaining provinces. I think in one or two days at most, your teaching materials will become widely distributed, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Lin Fan had been waiting for this moment for a long time. He finally saw hope. However, he was still a little worried. Even if the teaching materials were to become widespread in the Chinese Medical academies, he wouldn\u2019t get any Encyclopedic Points unless the students studied them closely.</p><br/><p>But this didn\u2019t matter. In a total of thirty Chinese Medical Academies, how could there be no one who would seriously study?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Lin Fan was very confident in his foundational teaching materials. Even some old Chinese doctors would study them, so the number of Encyclopedic Points he received shouldn\u2019t be too f*cked up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve been realizing lately that those little intelligence pills are really too mystical. I\u2019ve studied all the medicinal ingredients used in the pill creation but I don\u2019t feel like the essences of those ingredients should produce this kind of effect when fused together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little intelligence pill is magical indeed. I see that your complexion lately has been very different from last time as well,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>That was true indeed. Although Zhao Ming Qing had always been energetic, as compared to now, the difference was really quite obvious.</p><br/><p>However, the most remarkable part should be his memory. The greatest function of the little intelligence pill was to develop one\u2019s brain and improve one\u2019s memory. In Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s state, if he could attain photographic memory, it would really be perverse.</p><br/><p>Judging by the current situation, it seemed that he hadn\u2019t attained photographic memory yet. However, if he used his brain often and made his brain work more, there was a great possibility that he would attain it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \u201cTeacher, I have to say that my memory has been improving. There has been a great improvement in my medical abilities. This is all thanks to the little intelligence pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s thanks to your past hard work. After taking the little intelligence pill, the contents of texts and books that you have read before have resurfaced in your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cThat is indeed the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the two of them, wondering what on earth these two were talking about. \u201cWhat little intelligence pill? And what is it about your memory improving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about that pill I wanted to give you last time. It\u2019s a shame that you didn\u2019t want it. It\u2019s a godly pill. What a shame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, I don\u2019t want such a thing.\u201d Although Fraud Tian said that, he didn\u2019t feel the same way about it. He was very curious about what that pill was. It was so mystical. Could it be that they were talking about the white pill from last time?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cIt\u2019s best if you don\u2019t want it because I don\u2019t want to give it to you either. Later on, I\u2019ll give You Lan and the rest one pill each. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019ll want it then. This is a pill that can make someone become smarter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan. Why was it that he had a feeling that this wasn\u2019t reliable?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Qing, since you are already here, why don\u2019t you stay for dinner? At the same time, I\u2019ll see if you have anything that you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \u201cTeacher, there are indeed such things. Lately, my mind has become more nimble and I\u2019ve read many books, so I have quite a number of questions. These have all been accumulated in my mind and I haven\u2019t gotten answers for them yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>To him, becoming Lin Fan\u2019s disciple was the most fortunate thing that had ever happened to him because his teacher had brought him down the true path of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. This Zhao Ming Qing was really studious. But it was because of this that Lin Fan was so willing to teach him. If Zhao Ming Qing wasn\u2019t so eager to improve, Lin Fan would be too lazy to teach him as well.</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Ming Qing was old, he still had potential. Especially after taking the little intelligence pill, his potential had become even greater.</p><br/><p>To a Chinese doctor, this was a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Several days later.</p><br/><p>At a certain Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear? The new teaching materials will arrive today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already arrived long ago. The new teaching materials have been in the school the whole time and they\u2019ll probably distribute them during the lessons later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the old teaching materials? Have we wasted our time studying them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not for sure. The new teaching materials may not be too different from the old ones. After all, these things are all the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that they were written by the Godly Doctor. I wonder how they will be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Godly Doctor? In today\u2019s society, people like to give themselves nice names. I won\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the academy\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>A group of teachers had gathered together and were discussing the matter of the new teaching materials.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just received a notice that the Education Department has already sent the new teaching materials over. We\u2019re already halfway through this semester. If we suddenly change teaching materials, it won\u2019t be very good, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we do about it? This is an order given by the higher-ups.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anyone know how these new teaching materials are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen enough of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut previously, the writer of the new teaching materials had a conflict with those old specialists right? It was an earth-shattering conflict. I heard that a leader of the Education Department was dragged into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s harsh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, so we should stay low-key. We should take things as they come. Regardless of what teaching materials they are, we should just teach properly and we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that has to be the case. I wonder what Elder Han has to say about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Elder Han is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a fifty-something year old, yellow spectacles-wearing, Mediterranean, middle-aged man entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Han, what do you have to say about the new teaching materials?\u201d asked one of the teachers.</p><br/><p>Elder Han replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think we should do if the new teaching materials are lousy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Han laughed, \u201cLousy? You\u2019re thinking too much. If these new teaching materials are lousy, then there wouldn\u2019t be any good teaching materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other. \u201cElder Han, you\u2019ve seen the new teaching materials? How do you know that they\u2019re not lousy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Han, do you know the man who wrote these teaching materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Han shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know him but I\u2019ve seen him once before. He did volunteer medical work in our city, don\u2019t you all know? I personally went to the site. His medical abilities are amazing. If I hadn\u2019t seen it for myself, I wouldn\u2019t dare to believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. They hadn\u2019t expected that Elder Han would have so much faith in these new teaching materials before he had even seen them. This made them very curious as to how these new teaching materials would be.</p><br/><p>In the classroom.</p><br/><p>The teacher stood at the lectern and said, \u201cStudents, the new teaching materials have arrived. Now, I\u2019ll start to distribute them.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the new teaching materials went into the student\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Those Chinese medicine students were frustrated. They had studied half of the old teaching materials and suddenly, there were new teaching materials. This was a little f*cked up.</p><br/><p>When the students flipped to the content page of the new teaching materials, their expressions slowly changed. Then, they cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. What are these new teaching materials? Why are they not the least bit similar to the old ones?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s true. Are they playing with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, look at the first section. It is written so bluntly. It\u2019s not profound and mysterious like the old teaching materials. It\u2019s so easy to understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t right, these new teaching materials aren\u2019t right. The contents are different from the explanations in the old teaching materials. This can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the news on the Internet from last time? The old teaching materials have a number of parts that are mistaken. The explanations in these new teaching materials are the correct ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really true?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, such situations were happening in every Chinese Medical Academy in the country.</p></div>\n</div>"}

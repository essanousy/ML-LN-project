What he was looking at didn\u2019t seem logical at all.</p><br/><p>Why was it like that?</p><br/><p>What was wrong with these people? Were they under some spell?</p><br/><p>Even if it was delicious, it couldn\u2019t have been like that.</p><br/><p>After a while.</p><br/><p>A series of sighs could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, there goes the ten scallion pancakes. How pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t manage to get it, how sad. Looks like I can only come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so unbearable to see others enjoying it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? That\u2019s all?\u201d Henry Wang was stunned. He didn\u2019t believe it. He just stood there for a short while and the scallion pancakes for the day were sold out.</p><br/><p>Then, a muscular man patted Henry Wang\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIs it your first time here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang nodded, \u201cYes, it is my first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man nodded. \u201cSince it is your first time, get used to it. If you\u2019re unlucky, it\u2019s almost impossible to get it. However, don\u2019t be too sad. You\u2019ll get it someday. However, don\u2019t try to cause any trouble. If not, the consequences are going to be devastating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang smiled, \u201cThanks for the reminder. I won\u2019t cut queues and I will follow the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d The man didn\u2019t say anything else and he left.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang felt as if he had discovered the New World. He felt that it was something he had never experienced before.</p><br/><p>He was confident that if he were to tell everyone his identity, people would definitely organize a ceremony for him.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to do that. He believed in equality when it came to delicious food.</p><br/><p>The rules were rules and he had to abide by them. He wouldn\u2019t try to break the rules by using his identity. This would be a blasphemy.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Henry Wang didn\u2019t manage to buy any scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Another day had passed.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang came with anticipation but he left with disappointment.</p><br/><p>It had been a few consecutive days.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang didn\u2019t believe that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get it. However, the reality taught him a lesson. He really couldn\u2019t buy it.</p><br/><p>He felt like he was going to go crazy. It was just a scallion pancake. Did he have to queue up for it every day and return home empty-handed?</p><br/><p>Initially, he felt that the rules were decent. However, now, he felt that they should be more lenient with it.</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came over to Lin Fan, \u201cBe careful, I think something bad is going to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cHuh? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the Caucasian. His face is so red and he is glaring at us. I have been observing him for the past few days. I feel that his stare is becoming less friendly,\u201d Fraud Tian said and sneakily pointed at the Caucasian. He looked at him with caution.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. I think they all look fine,\u201d Lin Fan looked at the crowd and didn\u2019t feel that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, what could possibly happen? Wasn\u2019t he afraid of the righteous fans drowning him?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Fraud Tian said and shook his head. \u201cI sense something evil. Just be careful. I will stare at him and if he dares to do anything, I will take action against him till he can\u2019t distinguish North, South, East, and West.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Henry Wang was in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>He wanted to tell them his identity. He was actually one of the judges of the Michelin company and he wanted to try the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>However, the rules were rules. How could he break the rules like this? He didn\u2019t believe that he wouldn\u2019t be able to queue up for the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Then, Henry Wang felt like he was suffering. It was something he had never experienced before.</p><br/><p>He had tasted a lot of delicious food but it was his first time trying such an unattainable delicacy.</p><br/><p>He had been queueing there for four days but he always returned home empty-handed. The aroma that he smelled was such a torture.</p><br/><p>He looked at the others as they bit into the scallion pancakes and he really wanted to eat them. However, he couldn\u2019t get them at all. It was a torturous feeling.</p><br/><p>It was an internal battle and he was almost on the verge of giving up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, the scallion pancakes have sold out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d After hearing that, Henry Wang shouted. Suddenly, all the townsfolk around him moved away from him and gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, watch out. This Caucasian is going to rage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is he trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is going to break down. Another one is going to break down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, this newbie is so disobedient. If he doesn\u2019t have the patience to wait, then he should have gone home. He should have left before he gets to try the scallion pancakes. That is the smartest solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang lowered his head and went to the cart.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk knew that something was wrong after seeing that. They wanted to stop this Caucasian but were stopped by someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Don\u2019t move. Let\u2019s not do anything until he strikes. This way, we wouldn\u2019t be at fault,\u201d a witty townsfolk said.</p><br/><p>The other townsfolk nodded. That was logical.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the Caucasian and realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian hurried towards Lin Fan, \u201cI told you. He is not mentally sound. I believe he has broken down after queueing up for so many days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang didn\u2019t say anything. He remained silent and opened up his bag. He took out several documents from it.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t take it any longer. He had been queueing up for so many days and he didn\u2019t get chosen at all. He didn\u2019t even know when he would be able to taste the scallion pancakes. Hence, he didn\u2019t want to wait any further. He had to reveal his identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease have a look, I am one of the judges of the Michelin company. I would like to try your scallion pancakes,\u201d Henry Wang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He quickly recovered from his shock, \u201cOh, Michelin? However, we\u2019ve sold out for today. If you\u2019d like to try it, you can come and queue again tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was dumbfounded. Then, he looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cI am one of the judges of the Michelin company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Lin Fan nodded and asked, \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to try your scallion pancakes and see if it\u2019s able to be added to the list of Michelin-starred dishes,\u201d Henry Wang said.</p><br/><p>He knew that if a chef were to hear that, he would definitely be ecstatic. To be able to acquire the Michelin star meant fame, wealth and status.</p><br/><p>That was probably the dream of many chefs.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk whispered amongst themselves, \u201cWhat Michelin company? I thought they only sold tires?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the Michelin company? It\u2019s a foreign organisation that judges food. If a dish is awarded a Michelin star, it would mean that it is extremely delicious. When that happens, the whole world will know about Master Lin\u2019s shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome my a*s. If the whole world were to know about this, wouldn\u2019t there be more people trying to steal our places in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t really interested in it. \u201cYou can try the scallion pancakes but you have to queue tomorrow. Since you didn\u2019t manage to buy it today, come back again tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang looked at Lin Fan in disbelief. He felt that there was something wrong with this fella. \u201cI am from the Michelin company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that. You don\u2019t have to repeat it again. The rules are mine. Today\u2019s scallion pancakes have sold out. As for the Michelin star, I don\u2019t really care about it because my scallion pancakes are the best in the world. I don\u2019t need any Michelin stars for that,\u201d Lin Fan said confidently.</p><br/><p>It had the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia, was that a joke? That wasn\u2019t a joke at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Then, Henry Wang didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>He felt that he could use his reputable identity to get what he wanted. However, it was practically useless.</p><br/><p>He felt like crying.</p></div>\n</div>"}

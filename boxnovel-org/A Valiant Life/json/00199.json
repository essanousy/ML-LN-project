Then, he looked towards Qian Hao, \"If things weren't like this, how else could it be? Wang Shen has already told us everything. It's too late for you to say this now.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao didn't expect his boss to spill the beans. Only Wang Shen knew about the first time he trafficked a kid. Then, Wang Shen employed him to be his right-hand man as he realized that he was quick and had potential. As for the incident involving seven children, it didn't even concern him at all. It was all instructed by Wang Shen. Furthermore, it was top secret. Nobody should have known about it.</p><br/><p>Since these two people could tell him about it, it showed that Wang Shen had betrayed him. Who else could it be?</p><br/><p>Then, Qian Hao knew that if he didn't quickly cover himself, he might really get sentenced to death.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao looked at the two of them and panicked. \"He is maligning me. It has nothing to do with me. I'm willing to tell you everything. Everything that I know.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"It's too late. Wang Shen already told us everything. What else could you have to say?\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao immediately started to think deeply. Then, he raised his head. \"He has a sheet that records all his transactions. He definitely didn't tell you about this.\"</p><br/><p>At that instant, Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian's eyes lit up. All that he had said up till now, wouldn't have been able to serve as evidence.</p><br/><p>\"What records?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao hurriedly answered, \"This transaction set contains the information of all the children that got trafficked. There's information on their locations and the people that are responsible for them, etc. Everything is written clearly.\"</p><br/><p>It was as if Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian had finally seen some light. This was the evidence that they wanted. \"Where is it now, then?\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao didn't even hesitate. He wanted to cover himself badly. How could he take the rap for Wang Shen? Since Wang Shen had betrayed him, it was pointless to cover up too.</p><br/><p>\"It's at 3 Tian Ming District. It's located on the seventeenth floor. It's under the piece of wood that's under the bed in apartment 1705.\" Qian Hao replied anxiously.</p><br/><p>It was well hidden indeed.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at Master Lin, \"I will bring people there right away.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"I'll just wait here. If it's really true, just give me a call.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian anxiously nodded. He didn't expect things to progress so quickly.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, a fearsome enemy could be a fearful ally. If Wang Shen knew about the current situation, he would definitely vomit blood.</p><br/><p>The situation was common. If a person is extremely stubborn, it doesn't mean that the other person would be as stubborn. Besides, they were in a police station. Regardless of who it was, they'd be nervous if they had done something wrong.</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian stepped out of the room, the colleagues outside quickly asked him what happened. But Liu Xiao Tian obviously didn't have time to explain things to them. He immediately led a team to investigate things.</p><br/><p>In the interrogation room.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao looked at Lin Fan and continued, \"How much do you exactly know from infiltrating our company? Why is it that I haven't noticed you?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Qian Hao and didn't say much. After all, it wasn't favorable for him to speak about things. If they couldn't produce any evidence, things might go out of hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Come, tell me your story. What's the relationship between you and Wang Shen? Perhaps you could have a lighter sentence.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao lowered his head. Things had already been exposed. But it wasn't because he wasn't firm. It was his boss that spilled the beans first. What else could he do? Hence, he told Lin Fan every single thing.</p><br/><p>Time past by quickly as they were discussing.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>The phone rang.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"We found it. It really contains a lot of details! What he said was true.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"That's good.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"I'll be back shortly.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao looked at Lin Fan, \"I didn't lie to you. The thing is really there. Only Wang Shen and I know about it. Other people know nothing about it at all. Perhaps even his own son didn't know about this.\"</p><br/><p>\"Could I be spared and get a lighter sentence based on what I just said?\" Qian Hao asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Qian Hao was horrified but at the same time, he was a little puzzled. He didn't know the meaning of Lin Fan's laughter.</p><br/><p>Soon, Liu Xiao Tian returned.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian entered the interrogation room, \"Master Lin, thank you so much. If it wasn't for you, I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to get any information out of him.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"It's nothing. Anyone would have lent a helping hand.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was extremely in awe. He felt like Master Lin was his lucky star. As long as Master Lin was involved in it, anything could be resolved easily.</p><br/><p>Now that it had been resolved, the remaining problems could be settled by Liu Xiao Tian and his team.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Liu, I should go now,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Chief Liu couldn't bear to see him go, \"Don't you want to stay for a little longer?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands and said, \"It's okay. I'm not a policeman, so it isn't right for me to stay. Furthermore, this problem is pretty serious. I think it's better for me to go.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded in agreement. Now that they had obtained the evidence, it was just the beginning. The problem hadn't been resolved fully yet.</p><br/><p>Just that piece of evidence could possibly make them work their a*ses off for a long time. The circle of people involved was extremely big. Also, they couldn't reveal anything. Otherwise, the traffickers might find out and things would become even worse.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao was extremely fearful. Then, he raised his head and asked Lin Fan in disbelief, \"You're not a police officer?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and smiled, \"You're so smart.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" Qian Hao was shocked. It was as if he had recalled something.</p><br/><p>\"Actually, your boss didn't say much. But you're pretty impressive. You told us everything. Please be smarter in the future. Didn't you know that sanitation workers usually clean the roads in the middle of the night? Never mind, that's normal. When you've done so many evil deeds, you'd often be paranoid,\" Lin Fan chuckled and said.</p><br/><p>\"That's impossible\u2026\" Qian Hao was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Then, how did you know about the seven children?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled mysteriously and said, \"Guess\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao furiously slammed the table, \"Guess? Guess your mom!\"</p><br/><p>Outside the room.</p><br/><p>The young police officers just looked at Master Lin in awe.</p><br/><p>*clapping*</p><br/><p>*applause*</p><br/><p>They followed Chief Liu there and really found something. This information was all obtained through Master Lin's interrogation. They were extremely impressed by his abilities.</p><br/><p>A female police officer went forward. She was in awe. Then, she asked, \"Master Lin, how did you know about everything so clearly?\"</p><br/><p>She really didn't understand how Master Lin managed to get the information. Furthermore, he also managed to frighten Qian Hao. This was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Guess\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>The female police officer was speechless.</p><br/><p>Outside the police station.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian enthusiastically offered, \"Master Lin, let me send you home.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \"It's okay. I'll just take a cab home. This is only the beginning. You have to report to your chief later. This information can't be spread to the public, otherwise, it would cause them to strategize and this would become more troublesome for us.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded, \"Yeah, I will be reporting to him later. This is such a large-scale investigation. I'll have to contact the international police headquarters and host a major meeting to arrest all of them at one go. This will allow us to save all the children.\"</p><br/><p>Based on the information that they had retrieved, if they were to study it closely, they would definitely be able to save a lot of children. They just had to pray that everything will go smoothly.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan didn't bother about this matter anymore. He could only help them till this stage. The rest was all dependent on them.</p><br/><p>After seeing Lin Fan leave, Liu Xiao Tian immediately went back to the police station and reported to his chief. At the same time, he called for an important meeting.</p><br/><p>They had to take action quickly and seize the opportunity to capture all of the culprits at once before they have any chance to plan their escape.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

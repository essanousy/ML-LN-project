Then, he shook his head and said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know what happened but my Uncle suddenly seemed out of sorts, so I came to help him pack up the shop. As for the full situation, he didn\u2019t tell us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \u201cYou\u2019re his nephew. How could you not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man shook his head, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t permit me to tell our family members that he was in the hospital. But I\u2019m guessing that he has a major illness.</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they looked at each other. They never thought something like this would happen to Elder Chen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cThen where is he now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the Shanghai Xie Ren Hospital\u2019s in-patient department, on the sixth floor,\u201d replied the young man.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t move the things. Nothing will happen to Elder Chen. It\u2019ll be more troublesome if you move them and then have to move them back in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man said, \u201cI can\u2019t do that. He already told me to move them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners cried out, \u201cIf Little Boss tells you not to move them, then don\u2019t. If something really happens, we guarantee that you won\u2019t be troubled. We will come and help Elder Chen move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! You should listen, kid. Don\u2019t be stubborn. Later on, we\u2019ll go to visit Elder Chen at the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man looked at the situation before him and was a little surprised. What kind of relationship did these people have with his Uncle? Why were they speaking so warmly?</p><br/><p>Then, he didn\u2019t say much else. Since it was like that, he decided not to move the things for now. He had no idea what illness his uncle had. This doctor really had some standards. No matter how they tried to persuade the doctor, he wouldn\u2019t reveal the truth to them.</p><br/><p>When the family members found out, the young man\u2019s Uncle personally contacted him and asked him to move his things. If that hadn\u2019t happened, the young man really wouldn\u2019t have known what happened.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you really think nothing will happen to Elder Chen?\u201d asked Sister Hong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cNothing will happen. But really, why didn\u2019t Elder Chen tell us anything about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, who knows? Elder Chen has always been a man of few words. If we hadn\u2019t seen this today, he might have moved without us even knowing,\u201d said Elder Zhang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else about this for now. Later on, we\u2019ll go to the hospital to see just what kind of condition Elder Chen is in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Back at the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian wanted to go with them but Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to bring him. Lin Fan told him straight to stay at the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He was taking charge at the shop. The fortune telling business was doing overwhelmingly well but most of the clients were elderly ladies. This situation, to Wu Tian He, felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>In the past, his clients were all high-ranking and influential officials and every time he read their fortunes, it was something big, unlike this bunch where he just read their family\u2019s or children\u2019s simple fortunes. It was carefree and he didn\u2019t have any worries.</p><br/><p>Especially because his daughter, Wu You Lan\u2019s fate had gradually changed, he was very gratified.</p><br/><p>It was indeed like Master Lin had said.</p><br/><p>To get a good fate, one has to be with other people who have good fates.</p><br/><p>The hospital.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, Sister Hong, Elder Zhang and Elder Liang reached their destination. Outside the wards, Lin Fan pointed inwards, \u201cLook, Elder Chen is in the ward that\u2019s furthest in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over. \u201cLooks like he\u2019s sleeping. Really, Elder Chen. He didn\u2019t tell us anything even when something happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d Lin Fan went in while carrying some items with him. It wasn\u2019t much, just fruits and milk. He had to see just what had happened to Elder Chen.</p><br/><p>If this was before he had gotten the Encyclopedia\u2019s tenth page of knowledge, he would have no solution but now, it was different. He didn\u2019t even have to ask if he could treat it, he just had to find out what illness it was.</p><br/><p>In the sick ward, there were three beds but on that day, only Elder Chen was there, laying on one of the beds. The other two beds were empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen,\u201d Lin Fan called out.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen, who had been sound asleep, woke up at that moment. When he saw that everyone had come, he was stunned. \u201cLittle Boss, why are you all here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t come, you would have been able to keep this a secret for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen forced a smile, then sighed, \u201cSigh, I even made you all come here to see me. I\u2019m really embarrassed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drip!</p><br/><p>Drip!</p><br/><p>Below the bed, there was a basin that was connected by a thin tube to his bladder area, supplying it with medicinal liquid.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, what exactly has happened that has caused you to even close your shop?\u201d asked Sister Hong.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said helplessly, \u201cA major illness. Right now, I don\u2019t even know the full situation but I have to go through surgery. It\u2019s not anything good. It\u2019s probably bladder cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang asked anxiously, \u201cIs it early-stage or late-stage cancer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just undergoing tests. But it doesn\u2019t matter. What difference would it make if it\u2019s early-stage? It\u2019s still cancer. Sigh, how did I get such a disease at just forty-something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes your family know yet?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen shook his head, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them. I only told my nephew and asked him to sublease my shop. If I can recover from this, I\u2019d still be able to return. If not, then my life would be over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t finish his sentence. He sat on the bed, grabbed Elder Chen\u2019s hand and started feeling his pulse.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen asked suspiciously, \u201cWhat are you doing, Little Boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I doing? Of course, I\u2019m checking on your condition. It\u2019s nothing major and yet you\u2019re freaking out.\u201d Lin Fan knew the whole situation with just a touch, \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue. It\u2019s early-stage. It\u2019s at the stage in between good and bad. Since you discovered it early enough, it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong and the rest, who were standing at the side, stared at Lin Fan with their mouths gaping. \u201cLittle Boss, how could you tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at them and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you all last time to look for me if there are any issues with your healths? My medical abilities are great, don\u2019t you all know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><br/><p>How could they have known this? They couldn\u2019t believe Little Boss\u2019s words. When someone was sick, they had to go to the hospital.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you undergo the minimally invasive surgery?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday,\u201d replied Elder Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe substance obtained was a miniature cauliflower-shaped object, right?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s only the early stages of the malignant disease. Don\u2019t make that kind of expression, let me finish. Your condition is not a problem. The early-stage of this disease is not severe. Even if it\u2019s the late-stages, at worst, you\u2019d have to cut off \u2018that\u2019 and become Cloud Street\u2019s first eunuch,\u201d explained Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that for real? This is s malignant disease!\u201d Elder Chen did not know much about diseases but when he had found out about his condition, he had been so scared that he almost wet his pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, as Cloud Street\u2019s medical advisor, how could I lie to you? I\u2019ll give you two options now. Think carefully,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first option is for me to treat you. I guarantee you\u2019ll be out of the hospital tomorrow, without any lingering side effects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second option is to wait here and receive treatment from the hospital. You will be discharged a week later. Thereafter, you will have to come here every week for an injection each time. You will need to take a total of eight injections and go through many more check-ups before recovering your health. Choose an option.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen looked at Little Boss, then slowly said, \u201cI choose the second option, to get proper treatment in the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the doctor came. Lin Fan had initially wanted to tell Elder Chen all this sneakily but Elder Chen didn\u2019t want his help so Lin Fan just let the doctor speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Chen, the test results are out. It is a malignant disease but it is only in the early stages. Because it has been discovered early, the chances of recovering are high. No need to feel stressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor said a few words, then left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was frustrated. \u201cHeard that? There\u2019s no problem. Don\u2019t be stressed. Don\u2019t close your shop and ask your family member to look after it just because of a small matter. Just stay in the hospital and properly treat your illness and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Little Boss and couldn\u2019t help but be astonished. They had no idea how Little Boss knew all this.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan was very frustrated. Still, no one believed him. It was absurd.</p><br/><p>Oh right!</p><br/><p>If he told them about the incident at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, everyone would know how f*cking awesome he was.</p><br/><p>But since Elder Chen hadn\u2019t believed him, Lin Fan decided to just let him idle in the hospital for a while.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

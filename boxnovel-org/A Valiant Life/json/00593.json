What does test our luck mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>To him, Young Master definitely had a plan.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t want an amputation. No matter what price he would have to pay, he didn\u2019t want it.</p><br/><p>Shen Ming said, \u201cYoung Master, you have to help Brother Chang out. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t trust Master Lin\u2019s words, but\u2026sigh.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Mama Chang was looking at Young Master Zou. \u201cIs there still hope for my child? Is there really a chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu thought for a moment, then said, \u201cI\u2019m not too sure about that either but I suggest that you look for Master Lin. Master Lin is a Godly Doctor and you should know that. Since the hospital says that they have no other options, why not go to Shanghai to have a try?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin.\u201d Chang Hai Ge was considering. Suddenly a hopeful expression appeared on his face. \u201cRight, I\u2019ll look for Master Lin. He\u2019ll definitely have a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Chang opened the door and entered. \u201cYoung Master Zou, who is this Master Lin that you talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually could have avoided turning into such a state. Master Lin already warned him not to participate in any dangerous activities within seven days. But it\u2019s a shame that he didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Zou Tian Fu shook his head regretfully. However, he now had an even higher regard for Master Lin\u2019s abilities. Master Lin actually managed to see through his calamity and fortune. That was unheard of.</p><br/><p>Papa Chang\u2019s heart shifted. The great nobleman had already warned his son but his son had refused to listen. That was what lead to this disaster.</p><br/><p>He held a high status and had seen all kinds of people but he had really not heard of someone who could predict calamities and fortunes. However, he knew of Young Master Zou\u2019s status, so he asked courteously, \u201cYoung Master, that\u2019s not quite possible, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu gave a short laugh, \u201cThat is indeed not possible. However, that\u2019s just what I used to think. Just because you haven\u2019t seen it, doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t exist. Hai Ge, since you are my follower, I cannot let you become a cripple for the rest of your life. Whether you go to Shanghai to see Master Lin or not depends on yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge replied without a second thought, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was his last hope. He couldn\u2019t be a cripple for the rest of his life. He had to go no matter what. Even if it was just a tiny hope, he had to give it a try.</p><br/><p>But just as Chang Hai Ge was feeling hopeful, Zou Tian Fu\u2019s words made him nervous again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin already warned you but you didn\u2019t listen. I\u2019m afraid this would make him very unhappy. If you just go like that, it\u2019ll be hard to explain. I\u2019m not too close to this Master Lin either. Before you go, prepare something. You\u2019ve embarrassed yourself and it\u2019s sure to make him unhappy,\u201d said Zou Tian Fu.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge heaved a sigh of relief. So that was all it was. \u201cYoung Master, I understand. If not for your reminder, I wouldn\u2019t have thought of that.\u201d Then, he turned to his father. \u201cDad, Master Lin is really a great man and also a Godly Doctor. He\u2019s my last hope. If I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Chang said, \u201cAs long as Hai Ge doesn\u2019t have to be amputated, I\u2019ll agree to any request. But in your state, it isn\u2019t convenient to go. Why don\u2019t we invite him over? I\u2019ll personally receive his flight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu smiled, \u201cDeputy Head Chang, although you hold a high status and have authority, I\u2019m afraid that it would be no good. Even I personally went to Shanghai to thank Master Lin, yet you want Master Lin to personally come all the way to Beijing? Although I\u2019m not too close to the Master, I can tell that this Master isn\u2019t the type to fawn over authority. Since we have already made him unhappy, we have to reduce his anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Chang nodded. He seemed to have understood it. Also, he didn\u2019t expect Zou Tian Fu to know who he was.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge said, \u201cDad, I\u2019ll get Shen Ming to accompany me. This was caused by me and I have to resolve it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu saw that things were pretty much settled, so he said, \u201cAlright, then I shall take my leave. Send my regards to Master Lin for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge nodded. In the end, Father Chang sent Zou Tian Fu off.</p><br/><p>Although he was a Deputy Department Head, the people behind Zou Tian Fu, the Zou Family, were not simple to deal with in Beijing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan casually placed his fingers together and read his fortune. Then, he shook his head, \u201cYou can\u2019t hide, whether it\u2019s from fortune or calamity. This is all fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked curiously, \u201cBrother Lin, what are you doing? What\u2019s fate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just a small matter. Some people are just born with this kind of fate. I\u2019m thinking about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan\u2019s beautiful eyes shifted. \u201cWhat is it? Tell me. Perhaps I can help to give advice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cForget it. You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s best not to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled and said, \u201cI have to say that you really like to deliberately make a mystery out of things, kid. You have the skills to do what I used to do for a living.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPffft\u201d, Zhao Zhong Yang couldn\u2019t help but spit out a mouthful of tea. Then, he hurriedly wiped his mouth and said, \u201cFraud, stop acting. Other people may not know how you do things but we\u2019ve known you for so long, how could we not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Everyone burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glared at him, \u201cWhat do you know, little kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing was that Zhao Zhong Yang really didn\u2019t know that Fraud Tian really had an ability but that ability was Ba Gua Zhang. Judging him by today\u2019s standards, he was master-level. However, he still couldn\u2019t be compared to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a super grandmaster. He wasn\u2019t someone that a little master could compare to.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was chatting with everyone, cries of shock rang from outside.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang came rushing in. \u201cLittle Boss, it\u2019s bad. Lil\u2019 Wang, the computer seller wants to jump from a residential building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was startled and a little dumbfounded. \u201cWhat happened? Why would he want to jump from a building all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either. I heard that his girlfriend was taken away by someone else. He couldn\u2019t think things through properly and so he wants to commit suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. There were so many people who wanted to commit suicide lately. It was a little too much, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, let\u2019s hurry up and go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head helplessly, \u201cLove is really too hurtful. I didn\u2019t think that Lil\u2019 Wang wouldn\u2019t be able to think things through.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the way there, Lin Fan asked, \u201cHow do you know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian seemed to feel a little sorry. \u201cI can read people very accurately. I\u2019ve seen Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s girlfriend before. She\u2019s very beautiful. She wears branded products from head to toe and she spends money very freely. How can Lil\u2019 Wang bear all that? This is just as I predicted. She really dumped Lil\u2019 Wang. It\u2019s a shame for Lil\u2019 Wang as well. His parents are not around and he is all alone. After taking such a hit, he surely wouldn\u2019t be stable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right. I remember that when Lil\u2019 Wang helped me assemble the computer, he didn\u2019t seem to have a girlfriend. How did he find a girlfriend is just over a month?\u201d Lin Fan said in a puzzled tone.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shrugged. \u201cWho knows? Maybe Lil\u2019 Wang is just amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think too much. He just hurried to the scene.</p><br/><p>When they reached the scene, it was in a mess. There were already many people gathered there.</p><br/><p>And on the rooftop was Lil\u2019 Wang, sitting there. His emotions didn\u2019t seem too stable. \u201cLi Xiao Xiao, why? Was I not good enough to you? Why must you be with another man behind my back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was startled. \u201cD*mn, he didn\u2019t get dumped. He got cheated on. No wonder Lil\u2019 Wang can\u2019t take it. It turns out that he\u2019s been wronged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded as well. He had really been wronged too much.</p></div>\n</div>"}

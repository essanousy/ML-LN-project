Let go, it hurts\u2026\" Lin Fan took a deep breath, feeling pain in his hand. </p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk quickly spoke. </p><br/><p>\"Let go of Master Lin's hand quickly. His hand became swollen because he used it to break the door.\" </p><br/><p>The man and woman heard what the citizens said and immediately let go of Lin Fan's hands. They quickly apologized, \"Sorry, we really did not know.\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved, \"No big deal, all these are just small matters. You do not need to be so courteous.\" </p><br/><p>Even though he said so, to them, it was not a small matter. Lin Fan was someone who saved their children, how could they not thank him? </p><br/><p>Also, his hand was swollen due to him trying to save their children. If one had a little conscience, they would not just be okay with it. However, there are many people in this world without a conscience. </p><br/><p>Because of the rescue, Lin Fan was injured. However, some people may not have thanked him. If they were a little more obnoxious, they might even say that they did not ask him to rescue their child...</p><br/><p>Of course, there weren't many such people. If everyone thought that way, then society would become very frightening. </p><br/><p>This couple did not lack money. Not many poor people could afford an apartment over there. At that moment, they were offering to give money and treat Lin Fan to a meal to thank him. This made Lin Fan feel awkward as he did not think it was necessary. At last, after Lin Fan rejected them a couple of times, the couple finally left. It did not occur to the couple that there was such a good man living in their neighborhood, across their street. </p><br/><p>After watching the couple leave, Lin Fan felt relieved. Life could be so interesting sometimes. He went back to the store to rest and realized that sitting in the store was the most meaningful to him. Even when visiting other places, he didn't know what to do there. He felt that it was better to stay in the shop to chat with the rest. </p><br/><p>He saw the news on the internet and did not know what to say. He felt like ever since he received the Encyclopedia, he just kept making news on the internet. </p><br/><p>His Weibo also gained many fans, and the comments left by netizens were all praising him. He was already used to such high praise. After all, it wasn't like it just happened for the first time. </p><br/><p>With regards to the negative criticism brought upon the two locks companies, he was also helpless. He could not put the blame on himself, as the skills from the Encyclopedia were simply too powerful. Furthermore, at that point in time, the situation was so urgent and that was definitely the fastest way to resolve it. </p><br/><p>\u2026 </p><br/><p>After a few days. </p><br/><p>Lin Fan's hand was almost fully recovered, but still slightly swollen. However, if one did not look closely, it would not appear to be injured. Every day, the townsfolk visited the store even though they were aware that the scallion pancakes had stopped selling. To the townsfolk, it was a habit. If they didn't queue for the pancakes, they would feel uncomfortable. </p><br/><p>Fraud Tian took out his handphone to show Lin Fan, \"Look, this Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors looks like they are staging a war against you.\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and took the phone, \"They do not even have any sincerity, yet they still want me to go. I will not go.\" </p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded, \"I think so too. How could we have time to go to them? Furthermore, we are not urgent about this matter, I think it is because they do not know what to do that they said something like that.\" </p><br/><p>In those few days, Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors became famous. Every day, there was news about the quality of the doors. Some news was published by Supreme Tiger company, but no matter what, everyone who saw the video did not believe them. </p><br/><p>On the other hand, Yue Ma Locks did not comment anything. It might have been waiting for Supreme Tiger Locks Company to comment first.</p><br/><p>Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors Company: \"We invite Master Lin down to our headquarters and under the witness of reporters, we challenge him to unlock the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors. If he can unlock it, we will reward him $2 million.\" </p><br/><p>This was posted on Weibo, and they tagged Lin Fan. </p><br/><p>Weibo netizens were all very excited to see the challenge. </p><br/><p>To Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors, if they couldn't prove their name, this incident would haunt them forever, making them a laughing stock. </p><br/><p>Therefore, this time, the President of Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors had declared a challenge on Lin Fan. </p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"I'm not free\u2026\" </p><br/><p>After replying, Lin Fan immediately closed his Weibo and continued enjoying his relaxing life. </p><br/><p>At the headquarters of Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors. </p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \"May I ask, Chief Zhong, what do you have to say about the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors being knocked down by 10 blows? Also, it was said that the doors are not as good as what was advertised.\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhong faced the reporter, \"We are aware of this matter. Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors is our company's main product. We can assure its quality as it has been approved by the country. There are definitely no problems with it.\" </p><br/><p>The reporter asked again, \"Chief Zhong, based on market research, the sales of the company has been drastically dropping these days. Many customers also requested for refunds, how are you going to resolve it?\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhong replied, \"My dear reporter, our sales have not dropped drastically. It is because some citizens do not understand our products, and have believed the comments on the internet, hence they asked for refunds. We have assured the citizens before, by allowing them to try our doors out first before paying for it. If there is robbery within a year, our company is willing to bear all responsibility.\" </p><br/><p>The reporters nodded and were amazed by Chief Zhong's behavior. \"May I ask, Chief Zhong, your company initiated a challenge against Master Lin, and he replied that he has no time for it. What is your next step?\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhong replied, \"Our company will prepare a sample and visit Master Lin in Shanghai for the challenge. If Master Lin can use his skills to open it, we will prepare $2 million for him as a reward.\" </p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \"Do you have confidence in your product? Since Master Lin used his hand to knock down the door.\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhong hesitated, then laughed, \"We have confidence in our own products. Based on our research, Master Lin knows martial arts. Him using his hands to knock down our door is not impossible. However, he said that he can use 10 minutes to unlock our product, this, I do not believe that. All our employees do not believe him either. Therefore, this time, with the reporters present, I will prove that our fingerprint doors are the best in the industry, and not a second-class product as said on the Internet.\" </p><br/><p>\u2026 </p><br/><p>On the Internet. </p><br/><p>The reporters published the interview online. To the netizens, this interested them more than any other news. </p><br/><p>Many who knew Master Lin had been following this incident. They were very curious as to the final outcome of this incident. </p><br/><p>Will Master Lin be able to unlock the door within 10 minutes and win the $2 million?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

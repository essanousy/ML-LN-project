He had never expected anyone to be so unbridled. They were simply behaving lawlessly. If Lin Fan hadn\u2019t been so tough, this corruption would definitely have eaten him up.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seemed that the opposition was clearly trying to eat him up. They weren\u2019t letting anyone else have a say in this.</p><br/><p>The opposition was made up of people from the Chinese Arts Association who were in charge of the Youth Chinese Arts Cup. Even if outsiders were not convinced, the outsiders couldn\u2019t do anything. The Chinese Arts Association was suppressing everyone with their authority.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the phone rang. Lin Fan answered it without even looking.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi said eagerly, \u201cElder Lin, this is Elder Yue. There\u2019s an overseas exhibition next month and our Chinese Arts Association will be putting up thirty art pieces. Everyone has discussed this and we\u2019ve decided that you should draw the final artwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDraw my a*s. I\u2019ve already quit the Chinese Arts Association. I\u2019m hanging up,\u201d Lin Fan shouted angrily. He immediately hung up. He had a very bad opinion about the Chinese Arts Association now. He didn\u2019t even want to care about Yue Qiu Ju Shi and the rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d On the other end of the call, Yue Qiu Ju Shi was dumbfounded. Then. He looked at everyone around. \u201cWhat happened to Master Lin? Why does it seem like he\u2019s very angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Yue Qiu Ju Shi cried out in shock, \u201cOh no! I just heard Master Lin say that he\u2019s quitting the Chinese Arts Association. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was taken aback. They looked at each other in puzzlement, wondering what was the meaning of this. Why would Elder Lin say something like that?</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan felt that something wasn\u2019t right. He hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Elder Yue? How did Elder Lin say it just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi said anxiously, \u201cElder Lin just said that he\u2019s leaving the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zheng Zhong Shan heard this, he instantly exploded. He quickly snatched over the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What is Elder Lin doing? He can\u2019t leave the association. Even over my dead body, he can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang said calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious, Elder Zheng. There must be something that we don\u2019t know. Otherwise, Elder Lin wouldn\u2019t talk about quitting the association. But what exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan waved his big hand. \u201cI don\u2019t care what is going on. Elder Lin absolutely must not quit the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he immediately called Elder Lin. But to his disbelief, Elder Lin didn\u2019t answer the call.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. This left him at a loss. He had no idea at all about what had happened. Even if there had been any displeasure, Elder Lin should at least have given a reason. This situation left everyone confused.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang said, \u201cElder Zheng, no one answered your call?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Tao Shi Gang felt that this situation was probably complicated. For Elder Lin to not even answer Elder Zheng\u2019s call, he must have gotten involved in an exceptionally infuriating incident. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have behaved like that.</p><br/><p>Then, one of the masters suddenly cried out in shock, \u201cI think I know the reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes shifted over. Elder Zheng asked anxiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long while, the master said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know if you look at Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw the incoming call and knew that it was Elder Zheng\u2019s number. However, he was in a very unpleasant mood. He didn\u2019t even want to answer Elder Zheng\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>The situation on the Internet had split into two sides. The netizens who were on Lin Fan\u2019s side were maniacally supporting Lin Fan while the trolls made up the majority of the netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. This guy has been shamed into a rage. He even tore his certificate and wants to quit the association. I think the association probably didn\u2019t agree with his requests, so he wants to cause trouble for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wants to cause trouble? Do you think that\u2019s possible? I think this Chinese Arts Association is very fair and that guy probably wanted to make a shady deal because he was a member of the association. However, the association refused.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes a lot of sense. But this Master Lin really thinks too high of himself. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around anyone. Does he think the association would feel threatened just because he\u2019s quitting? He\u2019s just dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey, troll, you don\u2019t know sh*t. Master Lin knows that the association is corrupted, that\u2019s why he isn\u2019t willing to be part of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I support the guy above.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the association.</p><br/><p>Director Chen was now a little nervous. Sweat kept on dripping from his forehead. He had not expected this guy to be a member of the Chinese Arts Association as well. He had never seen this guy before.</p><br/><p>A staff member said, \u201cDirector, that guy is actually a member of the association but he\u2019s saying that the association is corrupted. I remember that our association has a written rule that the association\u2019s interest comes above everything. No matter what, members are not allowed to talk badly about the association publicly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there such a rule?\u201d asked Director Chen suspiciously.</p><br/><p>The staff member nodded, \u201cThere is. I remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good. As a member of the association, this guy said on the Internet that the association is corrupted. This is completely tainting the association\u2019s reputation. According to the rules, we have the right to revoke his membership rights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan had been looking at Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo the whole time. Everyone had unpleasant looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zheng Zhong Shan slammed the table furiously. \u201cWhat the heck is going on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cElder Zheng, I know now. Recently, we organized a Youth Chinese Arts Cup. It was for children below the age of fourteen. Elder Lin manages a Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, right? He must have sent them all to participate. Now, he\u2019s comparing the first prize winner and the second prize winner\u2019s artworks. That\u2019s probably what made Elder Lin angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan had seen all the posts on Weibo. \u201cI don\u2019t care what\u2019s the situation. I just want to know who manages our association\u2019s official Weibo and who were the judges of this competition. Just what kind of problems were involved?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Chinese arts masters said, \u201cElder Zheng, Elder Lin said that there\u2019s corruption in the judging. Why don\u2019t we look at the two artworks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to look. I trust Elder Lin. What I want to know now is who had the ability to say such things on behalf of the association? If Elder Lin really leaves the association because of this, I\u2019ll f*cking skin him alive.\u201d Ever since Zheng Zhong Shan had started specializing in Chinese arts, his temper had changed significantly. He had become less reckless and rash. However, because of this incident, everyone could tell that Elder Zheng was on the verge of exploding in rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Xiao Chen handled this incident. The association\u2019s official Weibo has always been managed by him,\u201d said Tao Shi Gang.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zheng Zhong Shan stood up. \u201cAll of you, come with me. I want to see who gave him permission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Elder Zheng\u2019s rage-filled expression, Yue Qiu Ju Shi pulled on Tao Shi Gang. \u201cElder Zheng is going to go mad. Things are looking dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang had a very unpleasant look on his face. \u201cGo mad? Even I want to kill somebody.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr!\u201d Yue Qiu Ju Shi was startled. \u201cCalm down, Elder Tao, calm down!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

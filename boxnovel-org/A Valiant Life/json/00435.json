However, when they saw that the president of the association standing up to greet him, they knew that this person was someone special. When they heard \u2018Master Lin\u2019, they were shocked.</p><br/><p>They knew who \u2018Master Lin\u2019 was. President Zheng, Yue Qiu Ju Shi, Tao Shi Gang, and some others kept talking about Master Lin, especially about those two artworks. Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang had been showing off those two artworks.</p><br/><p>Those two artworks were extraordinary and meaningful. They all wanted them but didn\u2019t even stand a chance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re too courteous, President Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, have a seat. I\u2019ll introduce the other Masters to you later,\u201d President Zheng said while smiling. He was the association\u2019s president and the host of the event.</p><br/><p>He had been extremely shocked by Lin Fan\u2019s talent in drawing and at the same time, very impressed.</p><br/><p>In terms of technique and the ability to convey the meaning of the artwork, it surpassed their levels.</p><br/><p>Every single chair in the room was filled and there were twelve people.</p><br/><p>Besides Lin Fan, the youngest person there was at least fifty years of age.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan believed that his status in the association must have been pretty high since he had been invited to an event like this.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan sat beside Lin Fan and introduced them to him one by one. Lin Fan didn\u2019t know these Masters at all but they were renown in the arts industry. If a person that could appreciate arts were to see them, he or she would definitely be shocked.</p><br/><p>Because these elderly men were extremely difficult to meet. Needless to say, it was even harder to request for an artwork from them.</p><br/><p>Some people collected the artworks of these Masters and displayed them in their homes. They didn\u2019t do it just for show. It was a form of collection and obviously, the most coveted pieces were their personal artworks.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded at the others. Although he was young, his artworks spoke for themselves and nobody there had any doubts about him.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, will you have alcohol or non-alcoholic beverages?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the bottle of wine in Zheng Zhong Shan\u2019s hand and smiled. \u201cDo I have a choice? However, I can\u2019t drink too much. I\u2019ll just have a few glasses with all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan began to pour the wine. \u201cYoung man, you have to develop your alcohol tolerance. You can\u2019t make it if you can\u2019t drink alcohol. In the past, I couldn\u2019t drink alcohol and it was difficult to be invigorated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi smiled. \u201cOur President is talking about the past again. However, his alcohol tolerance now is really bad now. It probably isn\u2019t even 10% of his alcohol tolerance in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang just laughed. \u201cMaster Lin, just drink minimally. Elder Zheng has drunk for a few decades and his alcohol tolerance is not comparable. Since everyone\u2019s happy today, he naturally can\u2019t control his alcohol intake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng finished it with one gulp. I have to give him face, I\u2019ll drink it.\u201d Then, he drank it immediately. His throat started to have a burning sensation and it rushed to his head. However, it became milder after entering his stomach. Then, he gasped, \u201cThis is unlike what I have been drinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish, I can probably down a litre of alcohol into my stomach and my face wouldn\u2019t turn red,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan smiled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just listened and didn\u2019t say much. Then, the feast began. Everyone didn\u2019t treat Lin Fan as an outsider. They just discussed arts with him.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan smiled. \u201cElderly men like us would typically talk about these things when we are gathered. It is unlike the lively gathering of the youths. Come, let\u2019s have another cup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he just downed a cup.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just stared at him. If he were to drink like that, he would probably collapse after a few glasses.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan smiled. \u201cThis wine can\u2019t be bought elsewhere. It\u2019s specially imported and an average person wouldn\u2019t be able to get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang smiled. \u201cElder Zheng has brought out a fantastic bottle of wine. Only the senior managers get to drink this. Today, we\u2019re in luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He knew about Zheng Zhong Shan\u2019s identity but he hadn\u2019t expected him to have joined the Chinese Arts Association. Perhaps this art association would be extremely powerful under his guidance.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t a lot of people there but it was a lively place.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan drank a few glasses and Lin Fan drank slightly more than a glass. It was extremely high in alcohol content but he felt great after drinking.</p><br/><p>Then, a piece of paper appeared in front of Lin Fan. Lin Fan was a little taken aback. \u201cPresident Zheng, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, when you sign it, you\u2019ll be part of our association. You\u2019ll have great welfare benefits and you\u2019ll get a bonus at the start of every season. Furthermore, everyone can keep in touch. How should I put it? After you join us, the association will be your biggest pillar of support.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi smiled. \u201cPresident Zheng used to be in the military when he was young. Now that he\u2019s old, he hasn\u2019t changed his style. We\u2019re all artists and there won\u2019t be any problem here. You won\u2019t regret joining us. Master Lin, join us. After that, we\u2019ll be family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at everyone and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m part of a lot of associations, do you guys mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mind. You\u2019re so talented. There\u2019s no difference since we\u2019re all on the same soil.\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll sign it then,\u201d Lin Fan said as he took the pen and signed.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan clapped. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s give Elder Lin a toast!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. Then, he hurriedly added, \u201cWait, I\u2019m only in my twenties and you\u2019re calling me Elder Lin? That isn\u2019t right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi tapped Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMaster Lin, when you sign the form, you\u2019re part of the association. Look at Elder Chen, he\u2019s only in his fifties, that\u2019s about the same age as President Zheng\u2019s eldest son. However, we still call him Elder Chen. We don\u2019t look at age here. We only look at artworks. If you\u2019re good, then you\u2019re considered one of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright then, please prepare ink and a brush. I\u2019ll paint a portrait of someone here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan was extremely elated. He anxiously said, \u201cQuickly prepare some.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At a certain clubhouse in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang had brought Wang Ming Yang to a grand and luxurious clubhouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Gang, this place is not bad,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said after looking around.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang laughed. \u201cOf course, this is the best private clubhouse in Shanghai. An average person wouldn\u2019t be able to come here.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t filled with flashy and shiny objects. It just had a beautiful interior which made people feel as if they had entered somewhere luxurious. It was something to be felt.</p><br/><p>There were two rows of prominent ladies. Then, two beautiful ladies walked out. Their smiles were mesmerizing and the clothes that they wore weren\u2019t too revealing but it showed enough skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSirs, do you have an appointment?\u201d One woman asked gently with a beautiful voice.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang nodded and told her some particulars before following them inside.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cYun Gang, this place is amazing. Why haven\u2019t I come here before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang laughed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a place where you can come just because you\u2019re rich. What do you think Shanghai is? It\u2019s filled with wealthy men. The main factor is this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang suddenly understood what he was saying. Then, he replied sternly, \u201cI understand now.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been hustling in the society for quite some time and he knew what Yun Gang was referring to.</p><br/><p>One might not have power even though he or she could be rich. However, when one had power, he or she would definitely be rich.</p><br/><p>Today, Yun Gang had brought him along and it meant that he wasn\u2019t a simple man.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/a-valiant-life-chapter-434-gotta-stay-firm\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 434 - Gotta stay firm\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/a-valiant-life-chapter-436-making-things-difficult\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 436 - Making things difficult\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"78247\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

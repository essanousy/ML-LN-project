Could it be fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly fake. Four hours have passed. If he took a plane, he would definitely have reached a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s disperse. This was all just bragging. Not everyone would dare to go to the Beijing association. That\u2019s a government recognized organization. If he dares to go, no one would be able to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense. I agree. The Beijing association is not average. They\u2019re big shots. It\u2019s very normal for there to be a transfer of appointment. As a lower-class association, they have to heed the orders. Perhaps Master Lin already got intercepted halfway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Master Lin\u2019s Weibo was updated. And this time, it was also just a picture.</p><br/><p>Countless netizens, when they saw the photo, were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>This was a selfie of Lin Fan holding up a peace sign. Behind him was the Beijing association\u2019s entrance. Even the words on the entrance were big and clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. He\u2019s really there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho were the ones who said that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t dare to go there? Hurry up and step out. We\u2019re going to beat you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is defying nature. He really went all the way there. I think the Beijing association is going to be done for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I really underestimated Master Lin. I give in. I really give in. That\u2019s too quick. Just after quarreling for a bit, he went straight to the airport. That\u2019s nature-defying. Are there any Internet buddies from Beijing? Hurry up and see what\u2019s going on. Give us a live stream!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo wasn\u2019t the only one that had blown up. Even some Internet celebrities were reposting this in a frenzy. They clearly hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out like this.</p><br/><p>To some of the Internet celebrities, Master Lin was definitely one of the most violent characters of this year. This was even more spectacular than some of the Internet quarrels that they usually saw.</p><br/><p>It was simply spectacular.</p><br/><p>It was rare to see such a scene even in the entire history of the Internet. He had completely raised the stakes and gone to challenge them in real life.</p><br/><p>A certain Beijing Internet celebrity sent a Weibo post.</p><br/><p>\u201cNetizens, please follow my Weibo. I\u2019m in Beijing and I\u2019m going to the scene to take a look right now. If anything happens, I\u2019ll report to all of you straight away.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this, they immediately followed his Weibo. This filled the Internet celebrity with motivation.</p><br/><p>Some celebrities were astounded. They were all public figures but they felt that there was a huge difference between them and Master Lin.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t quite understand it. This Master Lin didn\u2019t even produce any products but his fame was much greater than theirs.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they had done everything with exceptional care in order to maintain their image. They would never dare to step out of line. However, that Lin actually dared to do anything. Now, he was actually going to crush the Beijing association.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he afraid of being smothered?</p><br/><p>If it was them, they would probably just die.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it made them feel helpless. Comparing oneself to others can really drive one mad.</p><br/><p>At the entrance to the Beijing association.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there, looking inside. After a long and arduous journey, he was finally here.</p><br/><p>If he doesn\u2019t settle things today, he wouldn\u2019t return. Even if he would have to go to jail, he was not afraid.</p><br/><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t like he wasn\u2019t familiar with jail cells. Why would he be afraid?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d At that moment, the security guard in the guardhouse saw this young man standing at the entrance, so he came out to investigate.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here to find someone, you need to register over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m here to crush this place. Open up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guard was stunned. It was as if he didn\u2019t understand. <em>Crush?</em></p><br/><p><em>Who does this guy want to crush?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>But at that moment, something happened that left the security guard horrified. Under his gaze, this man placed his hand on the door. Then, with a quick use of force, the door collapsed to the ground with a rumbling sound.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the security guard stared blankly at the scene. It was as if he had seen a ghost. The door was at least ten meters tall and it had been fixed to the ground but this man had pushed it down just like that. What the heck was going on?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw the security guard\u2019s dumbfounded look and ignored him. He raised his leg and strode in.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a strong wind swept in.</p><br/><p>To the security guard, it was like something terrifying was attacking the Beijing association.</p><br/><p>Some of the association members heard the rumbling sound and wondered what had happened. But when they looked over, they saw that a man had pushed the door down. This made their jaws drop.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026that looks like Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Master Lin really came to our association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. He said on Weibo that he\u2019s coming to crush our association. I didn\u2019t think that he would really come. Now, even the electric door hasn\u2019t been able to withstand him. That\u2019s way too scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we go and obstruct him? This is our association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to go, you go. I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>A group of association members was talking amongst themselves. As for that suggestion, unless their brains had short-circuited, they would never go and obstruct Master Lin. Hadn\u2019t that guy seen the video? Master Lin was really terrifying.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this was the first time they had seen someone with the guts to come and cause a ruckus at the association.</p><br/><p>After all, everyone here was an expert. If an average person came and acted impudently, he would probably end up dead.</p><br/><p>In an office.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>The door was flung open.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, something big has happened! That Master Lin is here and he has already destroyed our electric door. Moreover, the President and Vice-President are both welcoming the leader. If this gets out of hand, it would really be bad,\u201d an association member said hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Huang Hao stood up. His expression was grave. He was the association\u2019s Security Director, responsible for the management of the association\u2019s security. If he were to let this Lin act impudently in the association, would he still be able to keep his appointment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo. Gather everyone and stop him!\u201d Huang Hao bellowed. There was a ball of fury in his heart. <em>Impudent. Simply impudent. Does he think he can bully the Beijing association so easily?</em></p><br/><p>He had seen the situation on Weibo and he felt that this Master Lin was really too impudent. He simply had no regard for the Beijing association at all.</p><br/><p>Now that he had come unaccompanied, if they don\u2019t show him their power, he would really think that their association was easy to bully.</p></div>\n</div>"}

But at that moment, something that shocked everyone happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three consecutive strikes. Does this young man really know Tiger Fist?\u201d Huang Ru Zhong was astounded as he saw the scene before him. Then, he laughed bitterly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would have misjudged. This young man is an expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the arena.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed his hands behind his back. Meanwhile, that previously-arrogant Zheng Bin had fallen to the ground and was clutching his chest.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had already gone easy on him and only used a tiny bit of strength. It could even be said that he hadn\u2019t used any strength at all. If he had really used even a bit of strength, this Zheng Bin would have died.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure,\u201d said Lin Fan as he placed his fist against his palm.</p><br/><p>The spectators below were dumbfounded when they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! It\u2019s over just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Although Zheng Bin is a little reckless, his power can\u2019t be underestimated. Who is this guy? How did he beat Zheng Bin down in just an instant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys see what happened clearly? This guy just slapped Zheng Bin\u2019s chest thrice and he fell to the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this an act?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t. How could my senior be acting?\u201d the people of the Tiger Fist clan growled. However, they couldn\u2019t believe that things had turned out this way. How had it ended so quickly? It was hard for them to accept it.</p><br/><p>The association members\u2019 jaws dropped. Looking at that figure standing on stage, they were momentarily stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. President Lin is really incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould what President Lin said be true? Does he really know a bit of every type of martial art?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a bit. I think he\u2019s proficient in all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang shouted at the broadcast excitedly, \u201cBrothers, did you see that? That\u2019s too f*cking incredible! That arrogant guy just got beaten to the ground in an instant by our Brother Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, my Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I just blinked for a second and it was over. I didn\u2019t even see it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! This is crazy. I\u2019m simply speechless. I was stunned by this scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. He\u2019s really too strong. Although I didn\u2019t see it very clearly, I know that Master Lin is the strongest of the strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d Zheng Bing bellowed as he lay on the ground. His heart was unyielding. Then, he endured the pain in his chest and stood up. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared just now. Kid, I\u2019ll show you something good!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Zheng Bin charged forward. He didn\u2019t believe that he would lose to this guy.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this, he shook his head helplessly. Then, he extended his arm and casually pushed. But to Zheng Bin, it was as if he was being attacked by some kind of force and he kept staggering backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What the heck is happening?\u201d Zheng Bin cried maniacally and he kept backing off all the way to the edge of the arena. Then, he slipped and fell off the arena. With a thud, his butt landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>With a dazed look, he looked around him. It was as if he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The people below the stage saw this and were astonished. They started mumbling softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid this Zheng Bin get bribed by the opposite party? This is way too fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He only got pushed once but he stepped back so many times. He even fell off the arena. It looks fake indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Zheng Bin use to hate things like this? But it seems that the allure of money is great after all. Even he can\u2019t resist it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Bin was still in his dazed state. Especially after hearing the commotion around him, he roared furiously, \u201cWhat are you all saying? I wasn\u2019t bribed by him! I just\u2026 Regardless, if anyone dares to talk about me, come here and have a fight with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people below shook their heads. They felt that Zheng Bin was just embarrassing them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed his fist to his palm once more and looked at Zheng Bin. \u201cIt was a pleasure. I only hope that you\u2019ll be more polite towards others in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Bin looked at Lin Fan and didn\u2019t know what to say. He could swear to the Heavens that this guy practiced some kind of evil ways. He really hadn\u2019t backed off deliberately. He had been pushed back by this guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmbarrassing. Simply embarrassing.\u201d At that moment, a middle-aged man in his martial arts attire leaped onto the stage.</p><br/><p>When the crowd saw this, they cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the inheritor of Linqing Tantui, Wu Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is really powerful. Moreover, this Linqing Tantui is even more incredible. I heard that it was created during the later part of the five dynasties by the Kunlun great masters of the Longtan Temple. It has been passed down until now and it has many years of history.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Also, this Linqing Tantui uses both the fists and the legs. It encompasses ten different techniques. Zheng Bin\u2019s performance from before must have upset a lot of people. Although this person is from the Shanghai association, a nationally recognized organization, he can\u2019t just lose on purpose and embarrass us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun stepped on stage and placed his fist against his palm as he looked at Lin Fan. \u201cWu Yun, an inheritor of Linqing Tantui, requests your teachings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cVice-President of the Shanghai association, Lin Fan. You are too courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Wu Yun extended his arm, then his expression suddenly changed to a stern expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cForming friendships through martial arts is based on exchanges. Well then, I shall use Linqing Tantui as well,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile</p><br/><p>The people below the stage were astounded when they heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this guy is way too ferocious. He used Tiger Fist against Zheng Bin and now he\u2019s going to use Linqing Tantui against Wu Yun. Could it be that he knows every martial art technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. There\u2019s a limit to one\u2019s strength. How could he know everything? It seems to me that he only knows a bit of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. This guy can\u2019t be underestimated. We\u2019ve all underestimated him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu Yun heard Lin Fan\u2019s words, he wasn\u2019t shocked but he had some fury in his heart. He instantly made a move.</p><br/><p>The bases of Linqing Tantui were coherent vigor, a flowing movement, and a clear rhythm.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, just these few strikes from this opponent were much stronger than the strikes from that Zheng Bin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t finish off the opponent quickly but played along for a while. To the people below, it was an eye-opening sight.</p><br/><p>The association members couldn\u2019t stop exclaiming in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf President even knows this, he has to know everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s awesome. This is why he\u2019s my idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie looked at the situation in the arena and was dumbfounded. He recalled his past conflict with President Lin and felt a surge of fear. If President Lin had come at him seriously back then, he would probably still be in the hospital now.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei\u2019s jaw dropped. He was completely convinced of President Lin\u2019s strength now.</p><br/><p>To the old-timers on stage, it was inconceivable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it feel as if this young man\u2019s technique is a lot purer than Wu Yun\u2019s. Do you feel that way too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Yes. And this young man\u2019s energy is calm. He\u2019s not rushed or panicky. It seems as if he\u2019s not using strength at all. Now, look at Wu Yun. His face and ears are red. He is already using his full strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

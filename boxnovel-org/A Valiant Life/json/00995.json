He felt really delighted. He never judged others wrongly. If he hadn\u2019t had the fortune-telling knowledge, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to guarantee that.</p><br/><p>But with this class of knowledge on top of his meticulous observation skills, nothing could go wrong.</p><br/><p>These two people he had chosen definitely wouldn\u2019t throw away his wooden carving.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian, who had nothing to do at the moment, asked curiously, \u201cDo you think those two guys from yesterday will come to cause trouble for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by that. \u201cWho knows? Regardless, we will still live our daily lives the same way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cThat\u2019s true. But the doggy was really brutal with his bite. You usually wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that he would bite people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him. \u201cThat\u2019s why you should watch your manners from now on. If you provoke the doggy, he might bite you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled, then squatted down. Looking at Elder Dog, he made a friendly expression. \u201cDoggy, with our close relationship, you definitely won\u2019t bite me even if I provoke you, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog glanced at Fraud Tian dominantly before ignoring him. He lowered his head and quietly did his own thing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Elder Dog was really domineering. After all, he was worlds apart from other dogs. How could they be the same?</p><br/><p>As for that Zhou Shi Ming and Zhou Jun father-son duo, Lin Fan didn\u2019t care about them at all. Even in the past, he wouldn\u2019t have been afraid of them. Needless to say, he was completely unafraid of them now.</p><br/><p>In a certain department.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming was a foreign businessman, so he received special treatment. Especially because he was the boss of a large enterprise, the treatment he received was even more exceptional.</p><br/><p>But during the discussions, Zhou Shi Ming said that there were way too many stray dogs in Shanghai and that his son had even gotten bitten. This made the related personnel very shocked.</p><br/><p>Shanghai was different from other places. It was a modern city. How could there have been an incident of a stray dog biting someone?</p><br/><p>Hence, without asking, they sent instructions to start cracking down on the stray dogs in the city.</p><br/><p>As for the Cloud Street stray dog issue that Zhou Shi Ming brought up, they didn\u2019t think much of it. And they didn\u2019t even think that Master Lin owned a dog. They felt that Cloud Street was now an exceptional place in Shanghai. It could even be considered one of Shanghai\u2019s places of attraction.</p><br/><p>Naturally, they valued it a lot.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming cursed in his heart. <em>Lin, although I can\u2019t do much to you, beating your dog to death will not be a problem.</em></p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in his shop when suddenly, a young delivery man came in. \u201cBoss, here\u2019s your express delivery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy anything.\u201d Lin Fan was startled. He didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on. <em>I didn\u2019t even buy anything. Where is this parcel from?</em></p><br/><p>Fraud Tian mumbled, \u201cIt might be one of your fans sending you a love letter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cLove letter? It looks more like a book.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cI heard that some people receive healthcare books sometimes. Most of them try to persuade you to buy certain products.\u201d</p><br/><p>The delivery man didn\u2019t care about all this. He was only in charge of delivering the parcel to its intended recipient. Then, he drove away in his car.</p><br/><p>Everyone didn\u2019t really care about this parcel and just continued doing their own things.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan had opened the parcel and couldn\u2019t help but start cursing. Zhao Zhong Yang was so surprised that he thought Brother Lin had received a threat letter from someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Brother Lin?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDoggy. Where\u2019s the doggy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He went out early in the morning.\u201d When Zhao Zhong Yang reached the shop early in the morning, Elder Dog had run out in a hurry. He didn\u2019t know what Elder Dog had been doing this whole time. But sometimes, they would see Elder Dog appearing on the Internet. He could even be considered an Internet famous dog now.</p><br/><p>Of course, Elder Dog could even enter the news headlines initially but eventually, there were too many incidents involving him and he stopped getting on the headlines.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy is awesome.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the invitation card in his hand and his eyes were wide open. He kept thinking in his mind that it wasn\u2019t possible. It was as if he had taken a huge blow.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang ran over impatiently. When he saw the content on the invitation letter, he was stunned as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>He burst out with a vulgarity. Zhao Zhong Yang rarely cursed but when he saw the card, he couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. This was too unreal.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing? Shouting vulgarities one after another. What on Earth has happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took another look to confirm that it was true. Then, he sighed. \u201cElder Dog is really nature-defying. He has been listed as one of the Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People(Animals).\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian hadn\u2019t cared at first but suddenly, he came to his senses and looked stupidly at Lin Fan. \u201cWhat did you say? Say it once more. I didn\u2019t hear it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t quite understand it. \u201cD*mn, this is unthinkable. This doggy can even win awards. It\u2019s like seeing a ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came over curiously as well. When she took a look, she was astonished. \u201cIt\u2019s actually true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang pondered for a moment, then said, \u201cBrother Lin, I feel like it might be because of that incident where Elder Dog went into the fire to save that person that lead to this award.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have awarded him this based on that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cI think they wanted something different. There\u2019s a common saying that dog is man\u2019s best friend. Since they\u2019re already our friends, giving an award to a dog isn\u2019t impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense. When Elder Dog charged bravely into the fire that time, there was quite a big impact on the Internet. It is possible that he has been chosen for the award,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether or not he can get chosen anymore. He has really been chosen already. He will have to go to the ceremony. When that happens, Brother Lin will have to bring Elder Dog to the prize presentation ceremony.. But I think you will have to give the speech on behalf of Elder Dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He hadn\u2019t expected himself to have raised such an Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>The righteous dog food really was powerful. He hadn\u2019t wasted his Encyclopedic Points to nurture Elder Dog after all.</p><br/><p>Now, he didn\u2019t even know how much righteous dog food he had used to nurture Elder Dog. All he knew was that it was a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof!\u201d</p><br/><p>Barks came from outside and they even sounded very fierce.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a shop owner from outside shouted, \u201cLittle Boss, come quick. Someone is trying to steal dogs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody move. Release the dogs now. They belong to Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had still been discussing the award with the rest when he heard those noises and was stunned. Then, they looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s hurry and take a look. Who\u2019s so brave to come and steal dogs from Cloud Street?\u201d Lin Fan was very curious.</p><br/><p>Even with Elder Dog protecting Cloud Street, someone dared to steal from this place. Where did that bravery come from?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid of Elder Dog being stolen away. He was afraid that Elder Dog might be unable to take it and he might fly into a rage. If that were to happen, he would really be helpless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

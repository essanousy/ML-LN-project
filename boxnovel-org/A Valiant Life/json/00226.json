This situation left them helpless and speechless.</p><br/><p>Mother Lin had a lot of questions to ask but Lin Fan wasn't in the room anymore. She felt miserable for being unable to clarify her doubts. She still wanted to continue chatting with the girl in the video call as she was having a good time.</p><br/><p>Sister Chen was also a little awkward, \"Sister Zhou, I guess this session's considered to be over. We'll make a move first.\"</p><br/><p>Mother Lin didn't know what to say. Initially, she found her daughter to be decent. But now, when she realized that her son was actually that popular with girls, she was in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>She knew that this matchmaking session wasn't for her son to pick someone. It was for someone else to pick her son. But now, her son could finally get to choose someone that he liked. It was a big discovery and she had to brainwash her son into it when she got home.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Below the restaurant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was waiting at a random corner, \"I'm here. Quick, come here!\"</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang left the restaurant, he observed his surroundings and saw a silhouette of Lin Fan. Then, he quickly ran over and smiled, \"I didn't expect the matchmaking to turn out like this. How hilarious!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glared at him, \"Hilarious my a*s! That was all created by you. Would it kill you to not pretend to be a pro? Tell me, where did you find those people?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang unlocked his phone, \"Look, those were my wife's good friends on WeChat. When they knew you were in trouble, they quickly offered their help without any hesitation.\"</p><br/><p>He looked at the WeChat group and Qiao Yue Yue was extremely happy. She kept mentioning Wang Ming Yang, \"How was it? Do I deserve a prize for my acting? It's my first time acting in such a thing and I almost lost it\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"You have to settle this matter for me. If not, I'll never let you off,\" Lin Fan helplessly said. This fella was indeed a trouble-maker. However, he definitely made everyone in his family feel good. Although the situation seemed calm and harmonious at first, he knew that his mum was probably feeling down. This matter definitely cheered her up.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled, \"Don't worry. I've thought through this. Let's not talk about it anymore. Quick, enter the car. If auntie and the rest of them were to come down later, we won't be able to escape!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't say much and immediately went into Wang Ming Yang's luxurious car. Then, they left the place.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked, \"Where should we go now?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it for a moment and realized he couldn't go anywhere. \"Just drive around, I have to think about how I should answer my mum when I get home later.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"Let's head to my wife's location then. You haven't seen how people film shows, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, let's have a look then,\" Lin Fan really didn't know how people did filming and he thought it would've been nice for him to see how it was like.</p><br/><p>After a moment, they reached the Guangzhou Cinema Town as Wang Ming Yang was familiar with the route.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had seen this place from the outside before but he didn't have any opportunities to enter the place. It was the first time he had been there with Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan's mother called.</p><br/><p>Mother Lin said, \"Where did you go?! Come back quickly so that we can discuss this matter.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly replied, \"Mum, I'll be back at night. I'm busy now.\"</p><br/><p>His mother sounded fine on the phone. He didn't know how to handle the situation and could only let it drag on further.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang, \"Look, it's all because of you again.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>There were several drama teams around. Wang Ming Yang brought him directly to Xu Zi Le's drama team. It was as if everyone there knew Wang Ming Yang. The workers also greeted him politely while he was on the way.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang looked around but they couldn't find Xu Zi Le. Then, they asked a team member about her location and found out that she was filming behind where they were.</p><br/><p>While walking, Wang Ming Yang said, \"Sometimes filming can be very boring but it can be interesting too.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Aren't you talking rubbish?\"</p><br/><p>In front of them, a group of people gathered around.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang pointed at them and said, \"Look, they're currently filming. Let's go have a look.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang stood behind them. The director happened to see Wang Ming Yang through the camera and smiled. They knew each other very well. But they didn't talk much since they were in the midst of filming.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le also saw Wang Ming Yang in the midst of filming. Since she was still filming, she had to finish the scene before talking to him.</p><br/><p>After the scene was completed, Xu Zi Le ran over. She laughed when she saw Lin Fan and said, \"Brother Lin, how did the matchmaking go?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"I have to thank your husband for that.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le blushed and smiled, \"We are not married yet.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled, \"Actually, you shouldn't thank me for that. You should thank Qiao Yue Yue. If not for her superb acting skills, it would've been a failure.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the director walked out. Although he was a director, he had to be cautious with his words in front of a wealthy man like Wang Ming Yang. Furthermore, Xu Zi Le was Chief Wang's girlfriend. He had to take special care of her in the drama team. Although Xu Zi Le had Wang Ming Yang as her boyfriend, she was still friendly and humble. The other people in the drama team liked her very much.</p><br/><p>\"Director Qin, this is my good friend, Lin Fan. A local from Guangzhou,\" Wang Ming Yang introduced.</p><br/><p>Director Qin was about forty years of age and he was slightly plump. He looked at Lin Fan and said politely, \"Hi, Chief Lin\u2026\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard his salutation, he chuckled, \"Don't call me Chief Lin, I'm not a boss.\"</p><br/><p>Director Qin wasn't bothered by what he said. For a person to be close friends with Chief Wang, he/she was definitely not an average person.</p><br/><p>Birds of the same feather flock together were such an apt and logical saying.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan saw a familiar silhouette from a distance. He shouted, \"Bai Ke\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The person who looked familiar suddenly stopped and turned around. When he saw Lin Fan, he was ecstatic. He immediately walked over, \"Hey, Young Fan, why brought you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn it, you're really Elder Bai. I just came back yesterday. When did you become an actor?\" Lin Fan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Bai Ke chuckled, \"There's no business for hotels in the afternoon. So I came to experience the life of an actor.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's cool. You have such an interesting life,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>When Bai Ke saw Xu Zi Le and the director, he was stunned. \"Young Fan, you know them\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"Yeah, they're my friends.\"</p><br/><p>Bai Ke chuckled, \"That's impressive. You actually know famous people like them. Quick, help me get their signatures.\"</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le humbly replied, \"A friend of Brother Lin is also a friend of mine. Sure, I can give you my autograph.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan interrupted, \"Alright, alright. There will be plenty of opportunities for you to sign in the future. Tonight, we should have a gathering. They should all be at home, right?\"</p><br/><p>Bai Ke thought for a moment and replied, \"Most of them aren't in Guangzhou anymore. I rarely contact them nowadays. You should know how the situation was like back in high school.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan paused for a moment. That was true. They were a small circle of friends back in high school and he was closer to Big Tree and Elder Bai.</p><br/><p>\"Right, I spoke to Big Tree that time. He said he was working in Shanghai and it was all because you helped him. I didn't expect that you'd become the best achiever out of all of us,\" Bai Ke said sincerely. He wasn't jealous at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Don't tease me. You should come to Shanghai too.\"</p><br/><p>Bai Ke waved his hand, \"I'm not going there. I have to secure my hotel job first.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Bai Ke talked for a while longer and they decided on the meeting details for that night's gathering.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

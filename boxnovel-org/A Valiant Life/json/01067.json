We have to show Master Lin our energy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d His team members were excited as well. Not only were there many fans supporting them, even their idol, Master Lin, was watching.</p><br/><p>If they lose, they wouldn\u2019t be able to face everyone.</p><br/><p>Also, they knew that their seniors\u2019 loss in 2003 had caused a huge impact and made the whole stadium go mad.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why, this time, they had to win no matter what to wash away their shame.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was holding a flag in her hand, clearly excited. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was sitting there and observing the situation. At times, this atmosphere made him feel like his blood was boiling.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze now seemed a little nervous as well. After all, even if the players had done ample preparations, he would never be able to relax until the last moment.</p><br/><p>Huang Jun had been in the stands the whole time, holding his phone and broadcasting. But every once in a while, he would look at the coaches\u2019 seats at the far end. Because it was too far, he couldn\u2019t see clearly if it was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he realized that a fatty next to him was holding a pair of binoculars. He patted the fatty on the shoulder. \u201cBro, could you lend me your binoculars to look at something? Just five seconds will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. No problem, brother.\u201d The fatty handed his binoculars over.</p><br/><p>Huang Jun took it and looked at the coaches\u2019 seats once again. When he saw the figure sitting there he immediately returned it to the fatty, then shouted at the broadcast, \u201cI\u2019ve seen it now. That person on the coach\u2019s seat is really Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It really is Master Lin? D*mn, even Master Lin is here to watch. And he\u2019s even sitting at the coach\u2019s seat. This is f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. But now is the time to watch the match. After the match ends, you have to go and look for Master Lin, Host.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Even though Master Lin is here, we can\u2019t focus our attention on him right now. The match is more important now.*</p><br/><p>Huang Jun suppressed the excitement in his heart. He knew what he had to do and that was to broadcast the current scene for his Internet buddies.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a change happened on site.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Yokohama F. Marino\u2019s offense is too strong. Sh*t, they\u2019re shooting! We have to defend!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Golden Flower\u2019s goalkeeper\u2019s concentration suddenly spiked. He saw the ball flying towards him and he leaped to the right ferociously.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>His shoulder slammed against the post and the ball was swatted away. But it wasn\u2019t over yet. The Yokohama F. Marinos gained possession of the ball once again and shot the ball at the goal.</p><br/><p>The goalkeeper who had collided against the goalpost leaped over. Enduring the pain, he caught the ball in his embrace.</p><br/><p>The whistle blew.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze shot up from his seat. His expression was rather anxious. He hadn\u2019t expected something like this to happen just over ten minutes into the match.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin, it\u2019s bad. The goalkeeper is injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. He hadn\u2019t expected this either. It had happened way too quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. That angle of the ball just now was too tricky.\u201d In Wu You Lan\u2019s view, this start wasn\u2019t too good.</p><br/><p>Huang Jun held his phone as he said, \u201cD*mn. Brothers, things aren\u2019t looking good. This goalkeeper has been injured just over ten minutes into the game. This is bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. That motherf*cker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have to stay strong. They absolutely cannot lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat save was just beautiful. But with this injury, they\u2019re done for.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spectators\u2019 stand had suddenly become silent as well. Then, someone started leading a cheer and the atmosphere started heating up again.</p><br/><p>When the Yokohama F. Marinos saw this, they laughed.</p><br/><p>This time, they had come prepares. They were here to crush the Golden Flowers team once again.</p><br/><p>At the coaches\u2019 stand.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze\u2019s expression was unpleasant. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Coach Wu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze said, \u201cMaster Lin, you don\u2019t know this but we actually had a reserve player. However, he caught a flu yesterday and had a 40-degree fever. Now, this player is injured as well. Where are we going to find a substitute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Wu Ze had thought they would be able to pull through but he hadn\u2019t expected them to have such bad luck.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wu Ze and said unsurely. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I stand in for him for now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu Ze was startled. He looked at Master Lin incredulously. \u201cMaster Lin, can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cI should be fine. If it\u2019s just stopping the ball from entering the goalpost, it won\u2019t be hard at all. My reflexes are quite fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze had wanted to reply \u2018Master Lin, how could it be as easy as you think? A good goalkeeper has to have many qualities.\u2019</p><br/><p>But in this situation, things were very urgent. He had just received notice that the goalkeeper had fractured his shoulder. That really left him lost for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Master Lin, hurry up and come with me to change up.\u201d Desperate times call for desperate measures. All he could do was let Master Lin have a try.</p><br/><p>Entering the changing room, Lin Fan looked at the number 1 jersey in his hands and chuckled. He hadn\u2019t expected a football-idiot like himself who couldn\u2019t even be considered an amateur to go and be the goalkeeper.</p><br/><p>But thinking about it, it felt pretty good. As long as he didn\u2019t let the ball in, it would be fine. To him, this was very simple.</p><br/><p>The match had paused for now.</p><br/><p>The stadium was a little quiet. Some fans were panicking.</p><br/><p>What are we going to do now? Zhang Qun has been injured. Gao Xiong is having a fever. It looks like we don\u2019t have any more goalkeepers left, do we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This time, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, don\u2019t say that. If we really lose, I won\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, someone has stepped on the field.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Who is this number 1? Where did Wu Ze find this substitute? Weren\u2019t there no goalkeepers left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I have nothing to say. I feel like nothing has gone their way this year. The past few times, they\u2019ve been facing problems too and now, both the goalkeepers are out. They don\u2019t even have a substitute anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this guy alright? He\u2019s so skinny. Will he be able to catch the ball if it comes flying at him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. It\u2019s over. I don\u2019t even dare to watch anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I left my work to come and watch this match. If they lose, I\u2019ll jump into Huangpu River tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Brother Lin in astonishment. \u201cBrother Lin, will you really be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cIt should be fine. Let\u2019s have a go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The players of Golden Flowers didn\u2019t know what to do anymore but suddenly, they realized that someone had stepped on the field wearing the number 1 jersey. But when they saw him, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why are you here?\u201d Captain Wang Fei gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone else, right? I\u2019m here to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cAlright. Master Lin, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll work hard later on and we definitely won\u2019t let the opposition kick the ball to our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cNo problem. The match is starting. Go on. Guarding this post shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei didn\u2019t say more. The pressure in his heart grew once again. They absolutely couldn\u2019t let the opposition shoot again. Otherwise, he was afraid it would be difficult for Master Lin to block it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

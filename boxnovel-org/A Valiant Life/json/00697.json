Do you think there\u2019s anything that we\u2019ve done badly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNope, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s artworks are extraordinary. Each time I look at them, I\u2019m in awe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. You speak too highly of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was a little strange as they asked and replied to each other\u2019s queries.</p><br/><p>Chief Che was a little nervous. He looked at Lin Fan but to his surprise, Master Lin asked him something.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Che, why are you looking around? Did something happen? If there\u2019s a problem, let me have a look at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Chief Che felt like dying. He was trying to drop hints but Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand at all.</p><br/><p>The leader had been there for almost ten minutes and they didn\u2019t offer him a seat or a cup of water. Furthermore, he had asked so many questions just to prompt him for an artwork. Since the leader liked it so much, he should just draw one for him.</p><br/><p>Then, the problem would\u2019ve been solved. It would make the leader happy and he would have a good impression of Lin Fan. He would definitely soar with flying colors next time.</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan looked at Lin Fan and Lin Fan looked at him in awkward silence. Suddenly, they had nothing to talk about anymore.</p><br/><p>It was getting awkward.</p><br/><p>What made Chief Che anxious was that Master Lin still pretended to be dumb and stunned. It seemed like he didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>*cough*</p><br/><p>Chief Che cleared his throat and smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s have a seat and talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan pretended to be dumb again. \u201cIsn\u2019t the leader here for an inspection? Aren\u2019t you going somewhere else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Chief Che really felt like killing himself. Was Master Lin really that dumb? If someone was visited by a notable leader, they\u2019d be thanking their ancestors for the lucky opportunity.</p><br/><p>The shop owners outside just looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is crazy. He immediately rejected the leader and didn\u2019t even offer him a sip of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides Little Boss, who would dare to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the secretary, Lil\u2019 Dong had to do something for the leader. He knew the purpose of their visit.</p><br/><p>It had initially been a simple task but he hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to not get the hints. He was probably someone insensible.</p><br/><p>Hence, he felt that it was time to ask for it since the leader didn\u2019t seem like he was going to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, our government unit office lacks an artwork that is as magnificent as yours. As the leader is here, I can only humbly request for an artwork. I wonder if Master Lin could draw one for us to hang it in our office\u2026\u201d Lil\u2019 Dong thought about it and said. It looked like Master Lin wasn\u2019t going to get the hint and he had to make it clear to him.</p><br/><p>Indeed, when he said that, Fang Zheng Yan was delighted. He had said it so directly and there was no way Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t understand it. However, Fang Zheng Yan still pretended. \u201cComrade Lil\u2019 Dong, how could you ask for Master Lin\u2019s artwork so directly? Master Lin\u2019s artworks have been collected by the national museum. His artworks are extraordinary and highly priced. If the others are to find out about this, what would they think of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Dong lowered his head and replied, \u201cYes, yes. It\u2019s my mistake. Master Lin, please don\u2019t take it to heart. It\u2019s just that Master Lin\u2019s artworks are really incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their intention was clear. Master Lin would definitely just laugh and wave his hand. He would probably say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. For my artwork to be hung in your office, that\u2019s my honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was to say that, the matter would be over.</p><br/><p>However, everyone was stunned by what happened next. Master Lin just smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s it. That\u2019s a small matter. I will call Zheng Zhong Shan, also known as Elder Zheng, Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Elder Tao of the Chinese Arts Association. I\u2019ll ask if anyone has any artworks for the leader. Wouldn\u2019t that be okay? Their artworks aren\u2019t worse than mine. They\u2019re more majestic than mine. The leader will definitely like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, you don\u2019t know how good Elder Zheng is at art. If I tell him that a leader wants an artwork, he would definitely send one over. It\u2019s his honor to do so after all, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He emphasized \u2018Elder Zheng\u2019 a lot as if the others didn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>To others, who was Elder Zheng? How could his artwork be compared to Master Lin\u2019s? The leader wanted Master Lin\u2019s artwork, not those of Elder Zheng\u2019s or Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>However, Fang Zheng Yan was stunned when he heard \u2018Zheng Zhong Shan\u2019. He anxiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you know Elder Zheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He asked curiously, \u201cLeader, you\u2019re referring to Zheng Zhong Shan, Elder Zheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan looked at Lin Fan\u2019s stern expression. He had referred to Elder Zheng a little intimidatingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that Elder Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Elder Zheng is the President of the Chinese Arts Association. He is absolutely incredible. Since the leader has made a request, I have to give you some face. I will call Elder Zheng and ask him to give an artwork. If he dares not to give it, I\u2019ll say your name. He would have to give one to you, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan was stunned. There was sweat all over his forehead. If the matter would really develop to that stage, then it would be better to just forget about it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he still wanted to increase his rank to become a member of the standing committee. He had to become one out of the nine people. There were four more years to go and he didn\u2019t want this matter to stain his record.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he felt that Master Lin didn\u2019t know the background of Zheng Zhong Shan. If that was really the case, he would be doomed.</p><br/><p>With Elder Zheng\u2019s ability, if he had wanted to prevent Fang Zheng Yan from becoming a member of the standing committee, he could absolutely do so.</p><br/><p>Hence, Fang Zheng Yan didn\u2019t dare to think too much about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, forget it. Save the trouble. We\u2019re government officials and we have to serve the citizens. How could we use our identity to request for artworks from these Masters? This time, the inspection is to check on the citizens. I shan\u2019t disturb you any further,\u201d Fang Zheng Yan said anxiously. If this matter was to reach Elder Zheng\u2019s ears, who knew what would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not troublesome at all. It\u2019s just a phone call. Chief, don\u2019t leave yet. We can discuss it further,\u201d Lin Fan immediately said when he saw that Fang Zheng Yan wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan looked at his watch, \u201cMaster Lin, the inspection is about to be over. We have to go to the other shops. If there\u2019s an opportunity in the future, I will talk to you about Chinese Arts. If you have anything to report, you can tell Chief Che about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Che was stunned. What was happening? The matter didn\u2019t seem too logical. Why did the leader want to leave so badly?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the secretary, Lil\u2019 Dong kept his mouth shut. He was stunned. Obviously, he knew who Elder Zheng was.</p><br/><p>If the matter was made known to Elder Zheng, things would definitely become worse.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought to himself, \u201cWhy is he leaving? I\u2019m not done acting awesome yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan and gave him a thumbs up, \u201cIncredible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly. He had almost had to give in to him.</p><br/><p>If he was to give his artwork to the leader, what would the public think of him?</p><br/><p>It\u2019d seem as if he was afraid of the authority and had to give in to their requests.</p><br/><p>It might also seem like he was trying to curry the leader\u2019s favor.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t something that Master Lin would do.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter who the person was, he wouldn\u2019t give any of them his artworks.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

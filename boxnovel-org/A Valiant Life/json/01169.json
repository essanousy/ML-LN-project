This has really been strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held his phone, looking closely at the screen. But he still couldn\u2019t tell what was so fashionable about the photo. Then, he looked up at Fraud Tian who was in front of him.</p><br/><p>His f*cking style had changed yet again today.</p><br/><p>His whole body was wrapped in green. And on the table was a pair of aviator sunglasses. What the f*ck was he thinking?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? Has my style mesmerized you? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re all friends. I can recommend a website to you. The clothes there are not only cheap but also good-looking.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian grinned proudly. He already knew that he was famous now. He was very confident of his clothes because they had been bought from the website that had been recommended to him by that girl.</p><br/><p>He had discovered that the clothes there were not only cheap but also good-looking, so he picked a number of them and bought all of them in one go.</p><br/><p><em>This kid doesn\u2019t get it. But as long as there are people who understand my fashion, that\u2019s enough.</em></p><br/><p><em>Look. Everyone on the Internet is talking about this. I\u2019m leading the fashion trend!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put his head down and ate his porridge. He really couldn\u2019t understand. Perhaps he was really lagging behind the trends.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said with a smile, \u201cFraud, you\u2019ve found a new source of income. There are many people who want you to be their model. They\u2019d definitely pay a decent amount.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d Fraud Tian immediately waved his hand as if he didn\u2019t care about all that.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cWow, you\u2019re acting all awesome now. Why won\u2019t you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m a man with principles. If I become their model and do whatever they tell me to do, what would that make me? I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it. I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d Lin Fan burst into laughter. \u201cFraud, they\u2019d pay you a lot of money. Are you sure you don\u2019t want it? Getting some extra income would be pretty good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d Fraud Tian was slightly taken aback. \u201cAbout that\u2026 We\u2019ll see. There will be people who\u2019ll come looking for me. I\u2019ll wait and see. I\u2019m not someone who would do anything for money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure about that? I just asked you for a bit of your winnings, but you couldn\u2019t even bear to give me any. I even accompanied you to sleep yesterday!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off. Who would want to sleep with you? You snored all night like a pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone started chattering loudly.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao had put down all of her responsibilities at work. There were people in the company taking care of it. Right now, she just wanted to be by Brother Lin\u2019s side and be their guide.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, let\u2019s visit some places of interest later. There are many places you guys haven\u2019t been to yet,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao cheerily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. \u201cEat quickly, everyone. We\u2019ll be leaving soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fung Temple. One of Haojiang\u2019s big three ancient temples. It was a rather unique temple.</p><br/><p>Over there, people worshipped Bodhisattva, Guan Yu, Mazu, as well as other deities. The worshippers got along well. It was a phenomenon that represented the highest level of culture in Confucian teachings.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and the rest arrived, there were already many people at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place isn\u2019t big, but there are so many people.\u201d Fraud Tian looked around. He hadn\u2019t expected that there would be so many people here so early.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cThere are many people who come to Haojiang for vacation. We\u2019re not the only ones so there would definitely be many people. Moreover, this place is close to several popular sites. It\u2019s only natural that there are many people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of them walked in. Although the place was small, there were many statues inside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw Wu You Lan going in front of the Buddha\u2019s statues and praying. He had no idea what she was praying for, but since they had come all the way here, he naturally had to go and take a look as well.</p><br/><p>Then, he followed the crowd and went in front of a large statue and prayed.</p><br/><p>When nighttime came, they had gone to many places. They were really content.</p><br/><p>They returned to the hotel.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, why don\u2019t we go down to play a little?\u201d said Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked with a smile, \u201cYou like to gamble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t. But since we\u2019re here, I want to go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao said from the side, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you guys down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cXue Yao, it\u2019s fine if we just go to the regular lounge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Zhong Yang and Fraud Tian heard those words, they were excited as well, and they immediately followed behind.</p><br/><p>The two of them knew just how amazing Lin Fan was. He was the Gambling God. If they followed him, they definitely wouldn\u2019t lose.</p><br/><p>In the regular VIP lounge, there was a lot of noise. Among these noises, there were cheers as well as sighs.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao brought some chips over. They were worth several hundreds of thousands but Lin Fan only took a few tens of thousands.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Liu Xu took some each to go and play.</p><br/><p>In here, beautiful ladies were not as popular as money. And the public relations staff here were very beautiful as well.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan just stood there, a beautiful lady came and asked sweetly for Lin Fan to get a membership card.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend. He doesn\u2019t need to get a card.\u201d Yun Xue Yao came over.</p><br/><p>When the lady saw her, she nodded respectfully. \u201cYes, Chief Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of the gambling table.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with smile, \u201cYou Lan, go ahead and play as you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Wu You Lan looked at the tabletop. She didn\u2019t understand all this, but she just threw in a chip casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, you shouldn\u2019t do that. You should put your chip here,\u201d said Fraud Tian with a chuckle before putting in a chip as well.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t much, but it was just for fun.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already seen through everything long ago. To him, gambling was way too simple. It was so simple that it was meaningless.</p><br/><p>Instead, he looked curiously at the scene around him. Everyone\u2019s expressions were different.</p><br/><p>Some were excited, while others looked blank and seemingly calm. There were also some people who looked furious.</p><br/><p>In here, one could see all kinds of emotions.</p><br/><p>Some of the people of Haojiang had gambled their whole lives. It wasn\u2019t that they liked gambling very much. But they just couldn\u2019t get rid of this habit.</p><br/><p>For example, an elderly man next to Lin Fan kept putting in thousands of dollars. Even when he lost, he would laugh cheerily. When he won, he would laugh cheerily as well. His expression was one of joy.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Wu You Lan and the rest seemed like they were playing some kind of thrilling game. When they won, they would jump excitedly. When they lost, they would sigh.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled as he stood at the side. He didn\u2019t give them any advice, nor did he say anything. If he were to say too much, it would become meaningless.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I lost.\u201d Wu You Lan had lost half of her chips.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu, on the other hand, was smiling. She was perfectly calm. Whether she won or lost, she looked the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Take it slow. Maybe you\u2019ll win soon,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. Then, he took a chip and threw it on the table. \u201cThis one will win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after, he really won.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was thrilled. She hugged Lin Fan\u2019s arm and jumped for joy. \u201cYou really won!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cAlright. Go ahead and play by yourself. Just enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen a youngster as calm as you,\u201d at that moment, the elderly man next to them said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cThe most important thing is just to enjoy the experience. If you rely on it to get rich, you\u2019ll be disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think such a young man would be able to understand this. When I understood that, I was already forty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you leaving already?\u201d Lin Fan saw the old man about to leave so he asked curiously.</p><br/><p>The old man nodded. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s already been half an hour. I don\u2019t like sitting for too long. I have to go home. My luck was pretty good too; I\u2019ve already won several thousands.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

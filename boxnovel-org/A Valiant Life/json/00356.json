After exiting the hospital, Lin Fan ran to the train station. He couldn't stay there any longer. Something would surely happen if he did.</p><br/><p>There were four more cities to go. Where should he go next? He hadn't thought it through properly but he decided. Let's go to Nanjing.</p><br/><p>It wasn't far and the train would be able to get there in an instant.</p><br/><p>After this treatment, he now understood deeply how perverse the Encyclopedia's medical major classification was. Meanwhile, at the Suzhou hospital, Uncle Chen was surrounded by a group of people.</p><br/><p>Doctor Li was very curious. \"Uncle Chen, who is that young man the nurses are talking about?\"</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen shook his head. \"I promised him that I wouldn't say. Stop asking me.\"</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen's wife was very worried. \"Doctor, what happened to my old man? Did he get tricked? Or did something else happen?\"</p><br/><p>Doctor Li was thinking through everything. Then, he nodded. \"According to our observations, Uncle Chen definitely got tricked. There are many tricksters in this hospital nowadays. They take advantage of the patients' weakness and trick them so that they can earn money.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" The wife was crying from the shock. \"Old man, are you okay? What did that trickster do to you? Do you feel unwell anywhere?\"</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen wouldn't submit to them. He said, \"How did Master trick me? He was helping me treat my illness. I feel terrific right now!\"</p><br/><p>The nurses kept warning him, \"Uncle, you need to trust Doctor. Don't ever trust those tricksters from outside. There are too many tricksters nowadays. Those needle marks all over your body are horrible to see. And we even found some silver needles in the rubbish bin. Those are all disposable silver needles. They're worthless!\"</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen waved his hand and said, \"Stop asking. I won't say anything. And he didn't trick me. My wife, don't be afraid. He wasn't a trickster. Look at how terrific my body is right now. There are no issues at all.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Doctor Li, come out for a while.\" At that moment, a colleague's voice came from outside the door.</p><br/><p>Doctor Li nodded at the nurses beside him, telling them to continue talking to Uncle Chen. Then, he went outside and asked, \"What is it?\"</p><br/><p>The doctor outside looked at Doctor Li with a bit of shock in his eyes. Then, he took out a sheet of paper. \"These are the results of our tests. The cancer cells in the patient's body are gradually receding. The illness looks to be getting less severe and he looks like he's progressing in the right direction. How did you accomplish this? He's a terminal cancer sufferer. There is basically no chance of recovering from that.\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Doctor Li was flabbergasted. In disbelief, he asked, \"Did you get it wrong?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, we didn't make any mistakes. When I got this form, I checked it closely. I didn't take the wrong form, nor is the machine spoiled. This is a hundred percent legit.\"</p><br/><p>Doctor Li didn't dare to believe it. How could this be? Then, he looked through the door at Uncle Chen. \"Alright, please don't spread the word about this for now. I want to be clear about it first.\" He then entered the ward. He had to get things clear.</p><br/><p>\"Stop asking me. I won't tell you all anything. I promised him,\" said Uncle Chen.</p><br/><p>Doctor Li took a deep breath and said, \"Uncle Chen, since you promised him, you must keep it a secret indeed but you should know about your body's condition right now. The test results were just released. Your body suddenly became better. The cancer cells are gradually disappearing but we are not completely sure for now.\"</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen smiled and said, \"I knew that would be the case. I know my body best. As for why it's not completely healed yet, that's because I still have to follow-up by nursing it properly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed!\" Doctor Li understood now. He didn't believe that someone could cure cancer but not believing it right now was not a choice because a living, breathing example was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Chen, could you tell me who he is?\" asked Doctor Li.</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen shook his head and said, \"Doctor Li, it's not that I don't want to tell you but I really can't. I've never broken my trust with anyone in my whole lifetime. If I tell you, how do you think I can face Master in the future?\"</p><br/><p>The nurses started talking, \"Uncle, just tell him. This is an important matter. As you can see, we have many cancer patients in our hospital and all of them are in pain. If we can find that Master, we would be able to know how to cure cancer. Don't you think that would be a joyous thing?\"</p><br/><p>\"This...\" Uncle Chen hesitated. That question really touched his heart.</p><br/><p>The nurse continued, \"Uncle, think about it. If we can find him and invite him to the medical world, it would be wonderful news for the thousands upon thousands of cancer patients.\"</p><br/><p>They took turns to urge him for a whole ten minutes.</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen finally opened his mouth, \"Sigh, alright, I'll tell you. I actually don't know him. I don't even know his name. That day, when I actively went to talk to him, he asked me if I trust him and whether or not I could let him treat me. Because I knew about my illness, it didn't matter to me. The next two days, he performed acupuncture on me and gave me medicine to drink. That's when my body became better\u2026\"</p><br/><p>In the ward, the doctor and the nurses were silent. They felt that it was inconceivable.</p><br/><p>Doctor Li gasped in shock, \"Could it be Chinese medical treatment?\"</p><br/><p>Back when he had still been studying, he had come across Chinese Medicine before. He agreed with the theory behind it but the difficulty of Chinese Medicine was rather high so he decided to choose Western Medicine in the end. Even in their hospital right now, they had Chinese medications. Most of them were used to nurse the body. As for major illnesses, not many people would look that way. Perhaps only when the patients were too poor, would they turn to Chinese Medicine's slow treatment.</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen cautiously took out a packet of medicine from his cabinet. \"This is the medicine prescribed by Master. He told me to drink it every day until I finished everything. Then, my illness will be gone. You can take a look at it but don't take it away. I'll still have to brew this medicine. If I'm short of one packet, I'd be in trouble.\"</p><br/><p>Doctor Li looked at that packet of medicine and was dumbfounded. He hurriedly took a closer look. In the packet was Chinese medicine. He couldn't recognize some of the ingredients and had to let the old Chinese doctor take a look.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Chen, don't worry. I'm going to get someone. We will not take the medicine away. We'll just look at it inside this ward,\" said Doctor Li.</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen nodded. \"That's good.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>After a short while.</p><br/><p>That little ward was crowded with people. The hospital director was there and doctors-in-charge of several departments were there as well. There was even an old Chinese doctor.</p><br/><p>\"What is it?\" Everyone had turned their gaze to the old Chinese doctor.</p><br/><p>The old Chinese doctor took a few whiffs and touched the Chinese medicine. His expression was serious and he didn't speak for a long while.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the surrounding people, after asking once, didn't ask again. They patiently waited by the side.</p><br/><p>Then, the old Chinese doctor spoke, \"I recognize these ingredients but not the pharmacology behind it.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless. \"...\"</p><br/><p>In this world, there were no walls that could keep news from spreading. All of a sudden, the incident involving Uncle Chen was spread throughout the hospital.</p><br/><p>Countless cancer patients were all stupefied. Their originally hopeless hearts suddenly revived. They had initially already prepared for death but when they heard this, all of them got excited.</p><br/><p>Uncle Chen's ward became constantly filled with people.</p><br/><p>Some of them were amazed.</p><br/><p>Some of them were shocked.</p><br/><p>And some of them were jealous or even envious.</p><br/><p>They had never thought that this Uncle Chen's luck would be so good, to be able to meet a Godly Doctor like that.</p><br/><p>And even the reporters came. They had a keen sense of smell for such incidents. They felt that it would be big news.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

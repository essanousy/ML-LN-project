But of course, only Lin Fan and the respective patients knew their conditions. No one else did.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Godly Doctor.\u201d At this moment, Chairman Bi approached Lin Fan, smiling courteously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head and didn\u2019t say any more. Zhao Ming Qing, on the other hand, froze for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Bi, it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Zhao Ming Qing from the Chinese Medical Association and I believe we met at the Chinese-Western Medicine Conference a while back,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing smiled. The Chinese-Western Medicine Conference had speakers who were renowned doctors from both Chinese and Western medicine disciplines. They came together to have discussions. The rumor online that Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine weren\u2019t compatible was a little false. Every time they came together, they would discuss how both disciplines could work together to progress the field of medicine.</p><br/><p>Every conference would be a success.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi blushed in shame. He couldn\u2019t remember who he was but that guy could remember himself. But it wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounded since they were both from different cities and there wasn\u2019t much opportunity for interaction. Furthermore, there were so many people participating in the conference, so it was hard to remember every single face.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, we meet again,\u201d Chairman Bi smiled as he said. He vaguely remembered the name and he couldn\u2019t behave like he did n\u2019t know him at all or else it would be an insult. \u201cElder Zhao, who is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had met someone he knew, so it would be easier to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my teacher. I have been learning Chinese Medicine under him,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing smiled, saying.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi stood there stunned for a second. He was shocked, but he regained his composure after a while. The rumors floating around the Internet about the Godly Doctor were true after all.</p><br/><p>For normal people, they would never believe this, but Chairman Bi believed it. It wasn\u2019t because Lin Fan had a face which people could trust, but it was because Zhao Ming Qing was one of the masters in his field, and for him to seek Lin Fan as his teacher on his own accord, it could only mean that Lin Fan was indeed the Godly Doctor.</p><br/><p>Director Zhou stood at the side, full of shock. However, he just kept quiet, not showing any emotion on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet some mineral water and some umbrellas for Elder Zhao and the rest to give them some shade,\u201d Chairman BI instructed Director Zhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Chairman,\u201d Director Zhou said.</p><br/><p>After giving his patient his prescription, Lin Fan stopped what he was doing and looked at Chairman Bi, smiling. \u201cChairman Bi, you are the first one to provide us aid while we worked outside the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Chairman Bi couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cGodly Doctor, we have the common goal of saving lives. Helping each other is our duty. How about you set your clinic in our hospital? There is a better environment there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, but there really isn\u2019t any need for that. The umbrellas are more than enough,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe arrival of the Godly Doctor is a great blessing for the patients. How about I notify the rest of the patients in the hospital to come here to get treatment. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was overjoyed after hearing what Chairman Bi said. This was the first time someone voluntarily came to offer their help. But he understood his intentions. Healthcare shouldn\u2019t have any divisions and it should all be for improving the health and lives of the patients. There wasn\u2019t glory and fame in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll try my best to see as many of them as possible today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thereafter, Chairman Bi stood behind Lin Fan, watching him treat his patients. He had a rough understanding of Chinese Medicine, so he wasn\u2019t very lost. However, Lin Fan\u2019s techniques were beyond his comprehension. But under his explanation, he began to understand a little more.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing diligently took down notes. Studying under Master Lin, he was able to see many different kinds of ailments and at the same time, clarified all the areas he didn\u2019t understand before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much do you know about Western Medicine?\u201d Chairman Bi asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cChinese and Western medicine both have their strengths and weaknesses, and there shouldn\u2019t be a clear distinction. I do have a little knowledge on Western medicine, so if you do meet any troubles, you can look for me and I would be more than willing to help you analyze the problem,\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi stood there, stunned. He realized that this Godly Doctor wasn\u2019t humble at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour skills are indeed respectable,\u201d Chairman Bi said, chuckling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy teacher is also pretty knowledgeable in Western Medicine,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove over, move over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, something shocking happened. A group of large, burly men shoved the patients to the side, clearing a path.</p><br/><p>The patients who were queueing were all angry, but after seeing the huge men, they didn\u2019t dare to say anything against them. They meekly stood to the side.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows, a little annoyed. He wasn\u2019t sure at first what these men wanted with him, but as he looked further, there was a middle-aged man being pushed over on a wheelchair.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi furrowed his brows in dismay, before going up to Lin Fan, whispering in his ear. \u201cGodly Doctor, this is the boss of Jiangning Land Development Company, and he has gotten a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Even after visiting many doctors, he hasn\u2019t found a cure yet. The last time he came to our hospital for treatment, our doctors said he couldn\u2019t be cured. After that, all the huge guys here beat them up. He\u2019s a very powerful man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. He had never thought that he would encounter this situation while voluntarily giving medical treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys waiting for? Don\u2019t you guys know how to be respectful?\u201d Wu Tao said aggressively. All the other huge guys who were standing around him all lowered their heads after being berated by the middle-aged man sitting in the wheelchair, not daring to say anything.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao was the Chief Executive Officer of the Land Development Company. After contracting muscular dystrophy, he had trouble moving around. He had sought out all sorts of treatments and had even gone abroad to see the best doctors. However, nothing had changed and he was worried.</p><br/><p>After hearing about the Godly Doctor on television, he decided to come over to get another shot at treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor, is my condition treatable?\u201d Wu Tao smiled, asking Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to get treatment, please queue up,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao froze for a second, before chuckling. \u201cQueue? I don\u2019t think that is possible, looking at my current condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao turned to look at the other patients. \u201cAre you guys okay with me not queueing up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other patients who were queuing up had never seen this much power. They were afraid of what the big guys would do to them as they looked at the line of cars which they had arrived in.</p><br/><p>Everyone in line kept silent, seething with rage on the inside.</p><br/><p>They dared to be angry but they didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u2018Godly Doctor, from what I gathered from the television report, your medical skills are superior. Are you able to treat my condition? Money is not a problem. I\u2019ll give you as much as you want.\u201d Although Wu Tao couldn\u2019t move, he still had a strong will and an air of authority around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am here to give voluntary medical treatment. I don\u2019t accept money,\u201d Lin Fan said emotionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, no. If you are able to heal me, it would be a huge thing. Money is definitely not a problem. So I\u2019m asking you. Are you able to treat me?\u201d Wu Tao maintained his courteous smile. To him, money was nothing. Health was way more important.</p><br/><p>All he wanted to know now was whether the Godly Doctor was able to treat his illness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is curable,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao was overjoyed as he heard Lin Fan\u2019s reply, his face beaming with joy. \u201cAlright, Godly Doctor, if you are able to heal me, I will give you anything you want. This environment isn\u2019t good. If you follow me and treat me, I guarantee that you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi shook his head helplessly, not knowing what to do. They were doctors and they had no power over these guys who behaved like bandits.</p><br/><p>Doctors had a moral obligation to treat all patients without partiality.</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan replied next shocked Chairman Bi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just tell you bluntly. I am able to treat your condition. It is simple, really. However, I won\u2019t do it, so would you please leave this place? I have other patients to tend to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao stared at him in disbelief, thinking that he had heard wrongly. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I won\u2019t treat you. Although your illness is a little complicated, I know how to treat it. However, you just pissed me off over there, so I won\u2019t treat you. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Lin Fan said slowly, emphasizing every single word.</p></div>\n</div>"}

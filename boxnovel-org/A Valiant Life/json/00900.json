Zhao Ming Qing had followed Master Lin in developing the leukemia prescription and he had made a large contribution. If he wasn\u2019t promoted, that could still be forgiven but instead, he actually got demoted. Now, he had been forced to retire. This was f*cking ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! This is way too corrupted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJingchuan is so far from Shanghai, just look at the map! Then, take a look at Director Zhao\u2019s age. Go and read up on what kind of school that Jingchuan Chinese Medical Academy is while you\u2019re at it. F*ck, they\u2019re trying to kill Director Zhao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to my knowledge, all the previous directors of that Chinese medical academy have all been infuriated by the students so much that they had to be admitted to the hospital before. It wasn\u2019t because the students didn\u2019t study properly, but because they caused trouble every day. If it isn\u2019t about getting into a fight, it\u2019s about impregnating someone. These kinds of problems occur every day there. It\u2019s mentally and physically draining to work there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to think about it, I\u2019ve already seen through this. There\u2019s too much corruption going on here, it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is too 6. He didn\u2019t give them any face with his words. He was just flaming them. The person who made this decision must have sh*t for brains.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? Master Lin is definitely pi*sed. This is an attack on his student. Master Lin must be thinking, \u2018If you have the guts, come and mess with me instead.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, to find trouble with Master Lin, those people must be mentally challenged.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the leader who had made the decision saw this news, his facial expression turned ugly. He immediately called for a conference to criticize this Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Of course, this criticism was only within their organization. They didn\u2019t have the guts to publicly criticize him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this, what the heck are they saying? I have sh*t for brains? Does that Lin have no morals?\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to the leader whine, the rest could only sigh helplessly. That was just how Master Lin was. In the past, when he had flamed others, all kinds of vulgarities would burst out. This was all expected.</p><br/><p>However, what they had not expected was for Master Lin to have enough guts to flame them.</p><br/><p>They were a national organization. This was completely and bluntly offending them.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cLeader, was this order given by the higher-ups?\u201d asked one of the officials curiously.</p><br/><p>He was actually a little curious. Anyone with a normal brain wouldn\u2019t give such an order.</p><br/><p>This Zhao Ming Qing was the Director of Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy and he was well-qualified, having made huge contributions to the development of Chinese medicine. Now that the order had been given to demote him, it didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>Especially now that the leukemia prescription incident was still drawing so much attention, they were simply disregarding everything and inviting carnage by doing that.</p><br/><p>The leader glared at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that order? This is a complete lack of discipline and lack of organizational behavior. That Lin doesn\u2019t belong to any organization but how could that Zhao Ming Qing not understand this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a demotion. If he has the ability, then he should do more to help. That\u2019s the faith that the organization has in him, not a \u2018demotion\u2019 as they say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader was furious. The public opinion was out and all the blame had been put on them. They definitely had to voice out, otherwise, if they continued drawing misunderstanding from the public, it would be troublesome to deal with.</p><br/><p>Everyone was cursing in their hearts. Did the leader think they were all idiots? To be able to phrase a demotion so nicely, it was indeed an ability gained from talking in official jargon all the time.</p><br/><p>However, it was true that sometimes, when making public statements, speaking in such official jargon could help to confuse some people.</p><br/><p>By speaking ambiguously and mysteriously, one could speak for a long time without making any important points. It would be the same as not speaking at all but all this was to appease the public and make the public fill the gaps with their own imagination.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cNow that Zhao Ming Qing has applied for retirement, it would probably cause an even greater misunderstanding amongst the citizens,\u201d said one of the officials.</p><br/><p>The leader pondered for a moment. \u201cPass down this message: Think of ways to resolve this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone felt helpless. The leader had screwed things up and had no way out, so they had to help him resolve it.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>The official statement was out.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding the transfer of Comrade Zhao Ming Qing, it was a decision made after discussions. This represented the organization\u2019s faith in Comrade Zhao, as well as a test for him. We hoped that Comrade Zhao would be able to carry the essence of Chinese medicine over to Jingchuan. Now that Comrade Zhao has applied for retirement, it is a shame. After much discussion, we\u2019ve come to the following conclusion. We accept Comrade Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s retirement request and his retirement benefits will be upgraded to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After the long statement had been publicized, it drew many people\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>It had given the matter a conclusion.</p><br/><p>For some citizens, after seeing the statement, they filled up the gaps with their imagination. They felt that it was reasonable. Capable people had more responsibilities. Since Zhao Ming Qing was so amazing, sending him to somewhere else was actually not a bad idea.</p><br/><p>But to other citizens, this was simply shameless. For them to be able to phrase a demotion so nicely and even say it as if it was perfectly reasonable.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t matter. This matter couldn\u2019t be settled with words anymore. Since a conclusion had already been reached, nothing else could be done.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the statement, he laughed. This response had been really quite quick.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, Director Zhao is really retiring?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, he has retired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang felt that it was a shame. They knew the truth behind this matter but there was nothing they could do about it. He was just a commoner, there wasn\u2019t much that he could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, the construction of the teaching block of the Welfare Institute is about to be completed,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was coming here in the morning, I decided to make a detour to the Welfare Institute. I had a chat with the construction workers over there and they said that it would be finished in about half a month. Have you found teachers?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slapped his own head. \u201cAh, d*mn. I\u2019ve been troubled with so many things recently that I haven\u2019t done many preparations. I have to hurry and contact some people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since the new year, Lin Fan hadn\u2019t been involved much with the Welfare Institute, mainly because he had been too busy. Now, he had to use his connections to find some teachers.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cOh right, you\u2019ve been a broadcaster all this time. Do you have any online friends that teach? Go and contact some of them and call them over for me. Work benefits are negotiable, as long as they are reliable,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang patted his own chest reassuringly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have online friends from all over the country. If they know that Brother Lin is hiring, who knows how many people would be willing to come? I\u2019ll do a live broadcast right now to make this announcement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll leave it to you. I\u2019m going out for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was going to go fishing. Since getting the angling class of knowledge, he hadn\u2019t done a proper test yet. Today, he had to check it out properly and see just what kind of things he could fish up.</p></div>\n</div>"}

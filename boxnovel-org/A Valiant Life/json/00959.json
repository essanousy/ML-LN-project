However, some things don\u2019t always go your way.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>There were rules over at Haojiang. They could be broken but you had to have the ability to do so.</p><br/><p>After talking to Yun Xue Yao for so long, he understood one thing.</p><br/><p>This was a business that was connected between clans. Even the big shots over in Haojiang were involved in it. It was a rather complicated relationship.</p><br/><p>In the past, when there hadn\u2019t been any control, anyone could gamble if they had money. If they lost, all they had to do was pay the principal amount.</p><br/><p>And regardless of whether the person had the means to repay the debt, money lenders would lend them money.</p><br/><p>Later on, lives started to be lost as a result and the casinos started to implement rules to control it. They stopped allowing private money lenders into the casino. In the end, the entire business became connected.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Also, after the rules were implemented, they started to perform checks on the borrowers\u2019 identities to see if they had the means to repay their debts. Moreover, they would stop lending money over a certain limit.</p><br/><p>For example, Wang Wen had claimed to be the son of the famous director, Wang Ke Hao. Naturally, they had to verify that and take his ID and passport before lending him the money.</p><br/><p>With Wang Ke Hao\u2019s standing in society and financial power, repaying the debt naturally wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave an \u2018Mmm\u2019 response every once in a while as he listened to Yun Xue Yao explain this.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao really didn\u2019t know what to do. These things were not moral. Her environment had already decided all this for her.</p><br/><p>But when she faced Lin Fan, she was more mindful. If it had been anyone else, she wouldn\u2019t have explained this much.</p><br/><p>As for the chopping of hands and such, these were just threats. They were scare tactics used against the gamblers by the money lenders.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really didn\u2019t mind all this. To him, there were three types of people in the world that were the scariest.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>First, there were those with mental disorders, because they didn\u2019t know what they were doing themselves.</p><br/><p>Second, there were drug addicts as they wouldn\u2019t even care about their own relatives.</p><br/><p>The last type of people was gambling addicts. These people wouldn\u2019t even care about their relatives and on top of that, they were capable of doing all sorts of crazy things when they reached a severe stage.</p><br/><p>These people were not worthy of sympathy. It was only when something really went wrong that they would wake up from their stupidity.</p><br/><p>For example, the North and South Gambling Kings that Lin Fan had met previously. At their peak, they wouldn\u2019t have stopped even if you told them to. Perhaps they might even think you were crazy for getting in the way of their wealth.</p><br/><p>But after experiencing despair, they didn\u2019t need anyone to warn them anymore. They naturally awoke from it.</p><br/><p>To tackle this kind of dark business was just a dream. For true gamblers, even if you closed down one avenue of gambling, they would find another. This was a business that could never be stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. These are your rules over at Haojiang and they\u2019re not something you can change by yourself,\u201d said Lin Fan. If this had been before, he might have thought rashly that he was a god in this world who could change the world into a just and righteous place.</p><br/><p>But now, he felt that justice wasn\u2019t something that could happen just by talking about it or even doing something about it. Some things couldn\u2019t be changed even if one spent his or her whole life on it.</p><br/><p>As for these people who borrowed money, they clearly knew that it was a disastrous path, yet they kept on going without remorse. Unless God descended from the heavens to stop it, these people could not be saved.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Clinging on to luck or a fluke was the most delusional thing to do.</p><br/><p>As Wang Ke Hao and the rest listened from their seats, they felt that the person talking to Master Lin on the phone was probably not an average person. Moreover, that person seemed to respect Master Lin greatly. It was as if that person didn\u2019t want to leave a bad impression on Master Lin just because of this incident.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it was a little scary.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long both had high standings in society but they had been powerless to help. But now, a call from Master Lin had been enough to allow Wang Ke Hao\u2019s son to escape.</p><br/><p>And the money hadn\u2019t even been paid.</p><br/><p>For them to not even care about the money anymore, what kind of relationship did Master Lin have with that person?</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long, in particular, gained a new level of respect for Master Lin. They felt that he was really exceptional. They started to wonder just how big Master Lin\u2019s network of relations was.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Ke Hao spoke, \u201cMaster Lin, could you ask that person to capture my kid again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. He told Yun Xue Yao to wait before asking, \u201cDirector Wang, what do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao sighed. \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. My d*mned brat is addicted to gambling and he goes over to Haojiang every once in a while. This time, he was saved thanks to you but I believe that he still hasn\u2019t learned his lesson, so I hope that Master Lin can ask the person you\u2019re calling to capture him and make him suffer a little. I hope that would teach him a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d said Wang Ke Hao firmly. He had already decided. Since there was such a good opportunity, he couldn\u2019t let it slip by lest he regrets it in future. Especially now that he was so busy every day, he didn\u2019t have much time to watch over his son.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If this kind of thing were to happen again in future, he wouldn\u2019t want to trouble Master Lin again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan carried on talking to Yun Xue Yao. To Yun Xue Yao, this was just a small task.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Wen left Wynn Casino and instantly felt as if God was too good to him. He had no idea what had happened. <em>Why did they suddenly release me?</em></p><br/><p>Then, he suddenly understood. <em>Could it be that my old man asked some kind of important person to get me out?</em></p><br/><p>Thinking about that, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. <em>Looks like my old man </em>didn\u2019t work so hard for nothing <em>.</em></p><br/><p><em>Even outside, so many people respect him. This feels pretty good.</em></p><br/><p>Then, he reached into his pocket and immediately started cursing in his heart.</p><br/><p>His ID and passport were both still with those people. Without those things, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in a hotel, nor would he be able to leave Haojiang.</p><br/><p><em>Since my old man has already settled things, I\u2019ll go back to retrieve my things.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>After Yun Xue Yao hung up, she called Brother Jun and his men over. She told them the situation and ordered them to get the kid back.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, he has left for quite some time now. It might take some time to find him.\u201d Brother Jun didn\u2019t know what the young lady had gone through but he didn\u2019t dare to ask.</p><br/><p>It was best not to ask what shouldn\u2019t be asked. Knowing too much was not good either.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there were many conflicts in the Yun family. It wasn\u2019t good to get too involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and find him.\u201d Yun Xue Yao didn\u2019t want to say much. If it hadn\u2019t been for this person, this definitely wouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a subordinate rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, Brother Jun, that Wang Wen came back.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Brother Jun heard that, he instantly smiled. It seemed that he could save his efforts.</p><br/><p>Wang Wen was brought over by a subordinate. \u201cMy dear brothers, please excuse me. My passport and ID are still with you. Could you return them to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Wang Wen, his old man must have found an important person to back him. He didn\u2019t have to be afraid anymore.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But suddenly.</p><br/><p>The situation didn\u2019t seem right.</p><br/><p>Brother Jun said, \u201cGrab him and lock him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Wen\u2019s expression changed drastically. He was dumbfounded. \u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Jun said, \u201cWe released you mistakenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Wen\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. <em>Doesn\u2019t that mean that I was asking for death by coming back?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

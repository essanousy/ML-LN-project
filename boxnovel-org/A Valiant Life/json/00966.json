Although he wasn\u2019t at the scene, the people in the broadcast room had called his name many times.</p><br/><p>He really yelled at the screen.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m in Shanghai!\u2019</p><br/><p>But it could not be helped. He would not be able to send the message across. In the end, he could only continue watching the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony awkwardly and watch it end awkwardly.</p><br/><p>No one received the medicine award in the end. Hall didn\u2019t accept it. He felt that he couldn\u2019t take it. Otherwise, it would be unfair.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, are you regretting it?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cRegretting what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegretting that you didn\u2019t go. Actually, I think that if you were there, the prize might have been given to you.\u201d This was what Zhao Zhong Yang felt.</p><br/><p>But it really might have happened. After all, they had even called him up on stage. It was just that Brother Lin wasn\u2019t there. What a shame.</p><br/><p>As the situation had developed to this, they felt much better now. Although he hadn\u2019t gotten the award, however, everyone already knew that Brother Lin was the one who deserved it.</p><br/><p>A call came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered, \u201cDad, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin: \u201cSon, your dad is proud of you.\u201d He sounded as if he was crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Dad, I didn\u2019t even receive the award.\u201d Lin Fan was feeling awkward.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. In your dad\u2019s heart, you\u2019ve already received it. Also, didn\u2019t you see the television? They already admitted that you deserve the award.\u201d Papa Lin was very emotional. Then, he said in an upset tone, \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you go there, kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDad, sigh, I shan\u2019t say more. I still have things to do here. Don\u2019t think too much about it over there. It\u2019s just an award. It\u2019s not that useful anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish. How could it not be useful? Let me tell you, the leader of Zhongzhou is next to me right now. How about you exchange a few words with the leader?\u201d said Papa Lin.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he cursed in his heart. <em>This situation is f*cking embarrassing.</em></p><br/><p>Then, he hurriedly said a few words before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin shook hands with the leader. His neighbors had all gathered outside his door.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, you have a good son. He\u2019s bringing glory to our country. There was a problem with the awarding. If the audit was more strict, this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d said the leader.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin nodded very proudly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. This kid has allowed us to be worry-free since he was young. He did well in his studies too. Now that he has achieved what he has, I am very satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>The neighbors were softly discussing amongst themselves.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s something about Nobel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Nobel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin\u2019s son got an award from someone named Nobel. It\u2019s really amazing. I\u2019ve never seen a leader come here personally before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s it. That\u2019s really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>When some of the young people around heard these elderly men and women discussing, they felt like dying.</p><br/><p>But they decided to ignore it. They were too lazy to explain themselves.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news came out.</p><br/><p>\u2018At the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony yesterday, a problem arose. No one received the medicine award.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The medicine award recipient, Hall, declines the award and says that it should be given to China\u2019s Chinese medicine master, Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The most awkward award ceremony in history.\u2019</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2018Nobel Foundation has stated that this incident was a mistake and they\u2019re willing to bear responsibility. They are currently in the process of investigations.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin, the rightful recipient of the medicine award.\u2019</p><br/><p>On this day, the news articles appearing on the Internet were all related to this incident. A dramatic scene had unfolded in the previous day\u2019s Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.</p><br/><p>Some of the netizens who had watched the broadcast already knew about this. However, the citizens who hadn\u2019t watched the broadcast were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on Earth happened yesterday? What did I miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^You missed a lot. I suggest you go back and watch the replay of the broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The most astounding incident in history happened yesterday. I have to say, it was f*cking beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scientist who let out the big truth is called Hall. He is a very professional and morally upright scientist. He deserves respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a frenzy of discussions on the Internet. The reporters wanted to go and interview Master Lin as well. After all, they wanted to ask about his thoughts on the previous day\u2019s happenings.</p><br/><p>This was an incident that no one had expected.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Initially, Master Lin had said that he wouldn\u2019t receive the award and that turned out to be true. But later on, the award recipient, Hall, felt that he didn\u2019t deserve the award and had even brought up Lin Fan\u2019s name. That had drawn everyone\u2019s attention. In the end, even Hall didn\u2019t receive the award.</p><br/><p>Hence, no one had claimed the award up until now. It would probably end up with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The foreign media agencies had commenced large-scale reporting on Hall giving up the award.</p><br/><p>As for the Chinese medicine prescription for leukemia, it already wasn\u2019t a secret in China. But overseas, it was still a foreign subject.</p><br/><p>This treatment method was using Chinese medicine. To foreigners, Chinese medicine was very mystical. And perhaps they would think that it couldn\u2019t be trusted.</p><br/><p>But this time, a well-known scientist, Hall, had claimed during the ceremony that leukemia had already been conquered. Moreover, his wife had been cured using this Chinese medicine prescription. How could they not lose their minds over this?</p><br/><p>The people of the Nobel Foundation paid much attention to this incident. They immediately went to Hall\u2019s location to investigate the situation. Hall\u2019s wife was a leukemia sufferer. When they reached the local hospital and checked out her medical case, the people of the foundation couldn\u2019t believe their eyes.</p><br/><p>Although they had done research on Master Lin\u2019s leukemia prescription, they hadn\u2019t done any practical testing on it. In these twenty-something days, Hall had given his wife the Chinese medicine and now, she was taking the last dose of the medicine. According to the machine tests, her condition had gradually improved and she had almost been completely cured.</p><br/><p>Chinese Street. Over here, basically all the shops were run by Chinese.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Today, many people crowded the area.</p><br/><p>White people, black people, etc\u2026were all here. They had only one goal: To find a Chinese medicine shop.</p><br/><p>They knew that Chinese Tieda* was very popular here but there weren\u2019t many of such shops now. In fact, Chinese medicine shops were even fewer, mainly because they weren\u2019t very popular.</p><br/><p>At a Chinese medicine shop.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the shop was already packed full of people.</p><br/><p>The shop owner thought that a rebellion had occurred once again but when he discovered the reason for this, he was instantly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He had lived here for almost ten years. When he found out that these people were here to purchase the leukemia medicine, he was dumbfounded. <em>Since when was there medicine for leukemia? Are they joking with me?</em></p><br/><p>However, he heard from his shop\u2019s staff that Master Lin from their country had publicized the prescription on Weibo. Then, his jaw dropped even further.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t grasp the situation.</p><br/><p>He returned to China a few times each year but he had not heard of such an incident.</p><br/><p>But when the shop\u2019s staff opened the Weibo page, he believed it. Then, he started grabbing the medicine according to the prescription on the page.</p><br/><p>In the end, these medications were all sold out.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>This was something that had never happened before. Usually, they wouldn\u2019t be able to sell all their medicine even after months. In a short two hours time, they had sold everything. And there were still people queuing.</p><br/><p>This was a little scary.</p><br/><p>*Note: Tieda is a form of Chinese massage.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s really over. They\u2019re going to score just over ten minutes into the game. I\u2019ve let down the fans\u2019 trust in me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we lose to Yokohama F. Marinos for the second time, even if I resign, they wouldn\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart was aching very much. He didn\u2019t have any hope of Master Lin catching the ball.</p><br/><p>He knew this player, Tanaka Hiroshi. He was a very strong player from Japan, one of Japan\u2019s top prospects. And he even had a title, \u2018God of Power\u2019.</p><br/><p>When he kicked a ball, the force was tremendous. Even a profession goalkeeper wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on to it if he reaches it in time.</p><br/><p>Wang Fei held his own head with both hands. He had already given up. He didn\u2019t even dare to watch what happened next. He knew that what would come next were the sobs of the crowd.</p><br/><p>After conceding a goal, catching up would be really very difficult.</p><br/><p>Especially when the opposition\u2019s defense was flawless, scoring was simply a dream.</p><br/><p>But after a long while.</p><br/><p>The place remained silent as if time had stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they score already?\u201d Wang Fei didn\u2019t dare to look. Perhaps the fans couldn\u2019t forgive them anymore. Perhaps they were silent because they had given up.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>At the coaches\u2019 stands.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was cheering, \u201cAh, Brother Lin, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze took a deep breath and slowly raised his head. When he saw the scene in front of him, his eyes suddenly widened as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the entire place was in an uproar. The Golden Flowers supporters all stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>These two words rang out through the stadium.</p><br/><p>When Wang Fei heard these sounds, he was confused. <em>What the heck is going on? We just conceded a goal, what\u2019s so f*cking awesome?</em></p><br/><p>But when he raised his head, he realized that Master Lin\u2019s hand was extended and in his hand was a ball.</p><br/><p><em>What </em>the heck happened <em>?</em></p><br/><p>In the spectator stands.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Did you see that? It was a beautiful save.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just beautiful. It was simply domineering. I thought this goalkeeper was scared stupid. Who would have thought that this guy would just catch the ball by sticking out his right hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat ball was moving very quickly. In just the blink of an eye, he caught it. What kind of crazy reflexes does this guy have to be able to react to that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this goalkeeper? He\u2019s definitely not someone we know. In my memory, there\u2019s no one so f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s truly f*cking awesome. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to move just now but he simply didn\u2019t need to move because all he had to do was extend his arm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The stadium had completely exploded in cheers. To them, that seen that they had just witnessed was something to talk about for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>When the powerful striker, Tanaka Hiroshi, saw his own shot get caught by the goalkeeper, his eyes had a look of disbelief in them.</p><br/><p>Especially because the goalkeeper had caught it so easily, it really gave him a huge shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain, Master Lin is too f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei\u2019s jaw dropped and he was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>Huang Jun was dumbfounded as well. \u201cMy Internet friends, did you see what happened clearly? I blinked and didn\u2019t see it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I f*cking saw it. But your camera isn\u2019t HD. It\u2019s all blur.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis style is too dashing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that he would really save it. Who exactly is this goalkeeper? Someone please tell us.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the coaches\u2019 stands.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was smiling. \u201cDid you see that, Coach Wu? My Brother Lin is awesome. It\u2019s just guarding the goal post, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s way too simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze\u2019s jaw had dropped. Then, he came back to his senses and shot up from his seat and started applauding. At the same time, he wiped the sweat from his forehead. It had really been too scary.</p><br/><p>He had really thought that the opposition to score. But now, it seemed that he had worried for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, over here!\u201d at that moment, Wang Fei shouted as he ran down the field.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that catching the ball hadn\u2019t been hard at all. In his eyes, it had been as slow as a snail. Then, he saw that the player who had shot the ball was still standing there. He nodded and chuckled.</p><br/><p>Like what he often saw on the television, he rammed the ball into the air.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>\u201cThis goalkeeper is f*cking awesome. What a powerful kick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like this attack is going to be very\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The spectators had all been discussing intensely but suddenly, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>Because that f*cking awesome goalkeeper had kicked the ball into the air. And the ball was still rising.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s the ball?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Where did he kick it?*</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea. I\u2019m looking for it too. It seems like it\u2019s still in the air.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you retarded? What kind of leg do you think he has to kick the ball into the air for so long? Could it have hit an airplane or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei had been dashing in front but suddenly, he realized that the ball had flown into the sky and hadn\u2019t fallen down yet. He stopped in his tracks with a dumbfounded look on his face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up. \u201cD*mn. Looks like I used too much strength and kicked the ball into the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze looked up too. <em>Where is the ball?</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, the other players who had still been running all stooped. What were they going to do without the ball? Where was the ball?</p><br/><p>The referee stood rooted to the ground with a look of astonishment on his face.<em>What\u2019s going on? Where did the ball go?</em></p><br/><p>With a kick from the goalkeeper, the ball had disappeared.</p><br/><p>At the moment, someone shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ball is coming down!</p><br/><p>The players who had all been resting heard this and looked up. All they saw was a ball in the sky, falling towards the ground furiously.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the spectator\u2019s stands went mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Who is this goalkeeper? His kick was too ferocious, wasn\u2019t it? He kicked the ball into the air and it\u2019s only falling down now. That\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll I want to know right now is who that goalkeeper is. Someone please tell me.*</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If I knew, why the f*ck would I ask you?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just stood there. He felt that he had kicked the ball a bit too hard. He had to be more careful later on not to use so much strength.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Wang Fei and the rest managed to get the ball. Although they didn\u2019t know where the ball had gone previously, their only thought right now was to score a goal.</p><br/><p>\u201cCharge!\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere at the stadium intensified once again.</p><br/><p>The spectators were all cheering maniacally. After all, that kick from just now had given them hope. They had hope that Golden Flowers could win this time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just stood there, daydreaming. He suddenly felt very bored. As a goalkeeper, all he could do was watch the rest play.</p><br/><p>That feeling from before had been pretty good. He hoped that someone would come and shoot the ball again so he could experience it once more.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a hard kick from the other side sent the ball flying towards Lin Fan\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>And on Lin Fan\u2019s side, only one Yokohama F. Marino player was present.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the ball, he chased it ferociously.</p><br/><p><em>The chance has come.</em></p><br/><p><em>There\u2019s no one here now.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

The music scores were all completed. All that was left was some finalization before letting Wu Huan Yue practice on her own.</p><br/><p>A few days later!</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue's official Weibo made a post.</p><br/><p>\"A new album, 'Hope', will be releasing soon. It's fully composed by Master Lin. The ten songs will all make the charts. I hope everyone will like them.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was considered quite famous already. Her selling point was that she looked unique and pretty. She had quite a lot of fans and when they saw the post, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>Because their idol's first album had just come out a while ago and it seemed pretty fast for her to release another album. It seemed a little unbelievable.</p><br/><p>There were fans who were discussing and at the same time, they were also worried about Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\"Huan Yue, don't release your next album so quickly. Take it slow. Quality should take precedence. It's not about the quantity.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, the songs on your first album are pretty. Although there are one or two songs that aren't that amazing, they're already considered pretty good for the recent years.\"</p><br/><p>\"The songs aren't even in the top ten of any chart and you're coming up with a new album. I think it's a bit rushed.\"</p><br/><p>\"You have to be steady and not rush things.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is Master Lin? Do you guys know him?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I've never cared about the composers.\"</p><br/><p>\"It sounds a little familiar, I think he's the composer of 'Sky'.\"</p><br/><p>\"The song that has the highest downloads is 'Sky'. If it was composed by him, then this album will be much-anticipated.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't think so. It's too rushed. All the good songs nowadays aren't rushed to be produced. Even if it's a master, he can't just compose ten good songs in such a short time.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue's fans were debating online about the new album. They were worried about it. Since becoming her fans, they wanted her to progress further and longer. They weren't supportive of short-term successes. It felt like Wu Huan Yue was trying to make up for the numbers by releasing a new album.</p><br/><p>Some of the singers found it amusing after they read the message. Then, they also posted on Weibo. Of course, they didn't specify who they were walking about.</p><br/><p>\"Nowadays, some people want to take shortcuts even without a good foundation. The higher you fly, the greater the impact when you fall.\"</p><br/><p>Fans from both sides started to guess what the celebrities meant.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin, as a musical empress, had quit the variety show ever since that season.</p><br/><p>Now, she was busy with concerts. She was scrolling through Weibo and she would occasionally look at Wu Huan Yue's Weibo. After all, the previous incident had been ruined by her. Ying Jin wanted to make life hell for Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin's manager gasped, \"Sister Ying, look at that little girl's Weibo. She's thinking of releasing a new album.\"</p><br/><p>As Ying Jin's manager, she would sometimes act like a babysitter. Everything was decided by Ying Jin and she would just follow her instructions.</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin heard that, she looked at Weibo and laughed disdainfully. But when she saw Master Lin's name, her facial expression changed.</p><br/><p>\"This fella humiliated me on 'The New Voice' and I haven't caused any trouble for him yet,\" Ying Jin said.</p><br/><p>The manager said, \"Sister Ying, aren't you in good relations with Elder Si from Shanghai? Why not get him to look for him?\"</p><br/><p>Ying Jin waved her hand, \"It's a small issue and I don't have to rely on favors for it yet. I want to see his capabilities as a composer first.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Ying Jin also posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\"You want to make it big in such a short time. You must first have a good foundation. Without a foundation, you'll die.\"</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was a legend in the music industry and her status couldn't be matched by Wu Huan Yue. Everyone was curious about what the post meant.</p><br/><p>They didn't even think about Wu Huan Yue as she was still a new artiste. Many people didn't know about her existence.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was elated after sending that post on Weibo. It was as if she was relieved of a burden.</p><br/><p>The manager suddenly gasped, \"Sister Ying, someone's scolding you.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Ying said, \"It's normal for someone to scold me. Not a big deal.\"</p><br/><p>The manager replied, \"No, it's the Master Lin that you hate. He just scolded you in the comments.\"</p><br/><p>Ying Jin frowned when she heard that. Then, she opened Weibo and saw the comment by an account with a despicable profile picture.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"F*cking idiot.\"</p><br/><p>The manager said, \"Sister Ying, don't be angry. Just ignore an idiot like him.\"</p><br/><p>But Ying Jin couldn't take it and she quickly replied. \"A person with no class should leave my Weibo.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan replied again, \"Mega f*cking idiot.\"</p><br/><p>D*mn!</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was infuriated. She couldn't take it anymore.</p><br/><p>The manager tried to console her, \"Sister Ying, don't be angry. Don't waste your energy on people like him.\"</p><br/><p>Ying Jin took a deep breath and calmed herself down. \"Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't be angry.\"</p><br/><p>The manager nodded. There was no need to be angry with someone like him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ying Jin noticed some changes on her Weibo.</p><br/><p>There was a bunch of accounts with the same name as Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>YingJin1: 'I'm Ying Jin. I'm an idiot.\"</p><br/><p>YingJin2: 'I'm Ying Jin. I'm an idiot.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>YingJin999: '...'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"Super duper mega gigantic f*cking idiot, Ying Jin.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I can't take it anymore.\" Ying Jin saw her Weibo being flooded by those IDs and couldn't tolerate it anymore. The manager saw everything and it was clearly an attack by a group of people.</p><br/><p>\"F*cking Lin, I'll humiliate you. Wait till you receive my lawyer's letter.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"You're the biggest idiot in the entire universe.\"</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \"Master, why did you suddenly start flaming Ying Jin?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and said calmly, \"I'm trying to hype things up.\"</p><br/><p>D*mn!</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned when he heard that. Is there a need to be so cocky?</p><br/><p>Then, Li Fan started to doubt if he could complete the task just by writing songs for Wu Huan Yue. Perhaps he should do more preparations to increase the chances of success.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

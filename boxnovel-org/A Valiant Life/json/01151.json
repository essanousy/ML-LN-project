He would leave this matter to Wang Ming Yang and Secretary Chen.</p><br/><p>All he had to do was to check with them once in a while.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was idling in the shop. The discussions on Weibo had been very intense during this period of time. Since the perfect artificial limbs had come out, those specialists had all shut up.</p><br/><p>That specialist who had said that he would streak naked had deleted his Weibo account. It seemed as if he had disappeared from the Earth.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the task completion notification sound came.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Artificial Limb Task has been completed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was no longer alarmed by this task completion sound. After all, he felt that he already knew everything now. Actually, it didn\u2019t even matter whether or not he could unlock a new task.</p><br/><p>However, it still felt pretty good to have tasks waiting to be completed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the twent\u2026twenty\u2026twenty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on. <em>Just f*cking unlock already. Why are you getting stuck? Is this some kind of secondhand good?</em></p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Encyclopedia\u2019s notification sound rang out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of unlocking even more knowledge? A bachelor doesn\u2019t need any knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: Make your life complete. Unlocking the Encyclopedia\u2019s Super Dzogchen knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReward: Encyclopedic Points +100.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrent Encyclopedic Points: 10250\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He couldn\u2019t figure out what the Encyclopedia meant. <em>What the heck is this task?</em></p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p><em>Are you discriminating against bachelors? </em>Lin Fan cursed in his heart. He felt that this Encyclopedia was mocking him. Otherwise, why would it be unwilling to unlock a new task for him?</p><br/><p>But what exactly did it mean by \u2018make your life complete\u2019? Lin Fan really couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. Since I can\u2019t understand it, I\u2019ll just ignore it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very open-minded. Anyway, he didn\u2019t long for the new classes of knowledge as he had before.</p><br/><p>Right now, things were already very good. He was enjoying life and doing meaningful things. His life had become purposeful.</p><br/><p>However, this Encyclopedia actually couldn\u2019t bear to see him being single. It seemed to be worried about his love life.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Wu You Lan asked curiously. She realized that Brother Lin\u2019s expression seemed to change. But she didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was just thinking about something just now and I was immersed in thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Wu You Lan only half-believed him at first. However, she thought that nothing bad had happened recently, so she decided to trust Brother Lin\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu You Lan suddenly thought about something. \u201cBrother Lin, you were saying that we should go on a vacation. I\u2019ve already picked a location!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, where are we going?\u201d asked Lin Fan curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaojiang!\u201d declared Wu You Lan with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. It was as if he hadn\u2019t expected this. Then, he said to Wu You Lan, \u201cWhy did you think of going to Haojiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had gone there once and he hadn\u2019t thought about going there a second time.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said with a thin smile, \u201cI\u2019ve added Yun Xue Yao as a friend on QQ, so she knows that we\u2019re going on a vacation. She spontaneously invited us to visit her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you guys going to Haojiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Liu Xu appeared out of nowhere. Her slender figure was at the entrance of the shop, preventing the light from entering.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Did the Sun rise from the West today? I didn\u2019t think that even our Chief Liu would suddenly appear here at Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was astonished to see Liu Xu. He felt that it didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu glanced at Lin Fan and said, \u201cWhat? Can\u2019t I come to Cloud Street?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Liu.\u201d Wu You Lan immediately went forward upon seeing Liu Xu. She giggled as she grabbed Liu Xu\u2019s arm, appearing to be very warm and intimate.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you guys are going to Haojiang, I want to go with you too,\u201d said Liu Xu.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that this situation had turned very strange. \u201cWhy do you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said helplessly, \u201cNo particular reason. My old man is coming to look for me. I don\u2019t want to see him. He probably wants to matchmake me again. It\u2019s annoying. I want to go out and relax a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said with a smile, \u201cActually, Sister Liu isn\u2019t the only one who wants to come. I even called Huan Yue to join us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that Wu You Lan had invited so many people. It seemed that this vacation was going to be quite interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. The more the merrier. When are we going to leave?\u201d asked Lin Fan curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow!\u201d said Wu You Lan with a face full of smiles. It was as if she felt an indescribable joy because they were going for a vacation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. We\u2019ll leave the day after tomorrow.\u201d Lin Fan thought about it and thought that he didn\u2019t have anything to do anyway. It would be fine to leave in two days.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Since it\u2019s already confirmed, I\u2019ll come back to look for you guys the day after tomorrow. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d Liu Xu waved her hand as she walked away on her high heels towards her car.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled. \u201cThis is great. I\u2019ve been working here so long and I can finally go on a vacation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was all smiles as well. \u201cWhen we go, I\u2019ll do nothing else but broadcast our vacation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang had arranged to meet at a certain place. The two of them were drinking beer and having a barbeque.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going on vacation?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was taken aback when he heard that. \u201cD*mn. Why did you pick such a time to go? Then wouldn\u2019t I be unable to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged helplessly. \u201cThat can\u2019t be helped. You just won\u2019t be able to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, you didn\u2019t even notify me earlier. Right now, I\u2019m overwhelmed with work because of the artificial limbs. You guys are going for a vacation while I\u2019m busy working in Shanghai. How pitiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang felt completely helpless. He really wanted to go but he couldn\u2019t leave right now. He had many things to do every day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, then suddenly thought of something. \u201cMing Yang, I think it\u2019s about time that you and Zi Le get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo particular reason. I just read your fortune and saw that you could get married and Zi Le could become pregnant this year. Next year, your child would be born. It would be the year of the Dog. It\u2019s pretty good. Think about it,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had indeed seen that Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le were suitable to marry this year.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took a gulp of beer, then said, \u201cAbout that, I\u2019ll go back and ask her. Zi Le has hinted to me as well but I haven\u2019t been thinking about it. Now that you\u2019ve said it, I feel that I should really think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s not talk about that for now. Let\u2019s drink. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll send you home tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you know who I am? Do you think that you can get me drunk?\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

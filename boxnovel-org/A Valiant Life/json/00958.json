But for a good meal to be made unhappy because of this incident, it was quite a shame.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, do you need help?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao replied, \u201cThank you for your goodwill but this matter did not happen in Shanghai. Even Ah Hua and Lil\u2019 Zheng aren\u2019t able to help. It looks like I\u2019ll just have to gather the money and pay my son\u2019s ransom first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s late right now and there\u2019s probably no more plane tickets to Haojiang. I know people in Haojiang. They should be able to help. I\u2019ll just help you make a call to ask about it. There\u2019s no use panicking here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Wang Ke Hao and the rest said anything, Lin Fan took out his phone and dialed a number.</p><br/><p>Haojiang!</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was focusing on her work when her phone, which had been placed to her right, rang. She had been about to habitually reject the call but when she saw the phone display, she became excited. On her calm face, a bright smile appeared.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The middle-aged man by her side saw the change in expression and was startled. <em>I wonder who that is. To be able to make the serious young lady suddenly let out such a smile.</em></p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao put down all her work and said sweetly, \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019ve finally decided to call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the middle-aged man heard the young lady call the person \u2018Brother Lin\u2019, he was astounded. That greeting was way too intimate.</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Lin Fan was all smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, did I interrupt your rest by calling so late?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao and the rest looked at Master Lin, wondering who he was calling. But thinking of how amazing Master Lin was, they thought that perhaps he really had a way.</p><br/><p>But even Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long had tried using their relations to no avail. They had no idea who Master Lin could possibly ask for help.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao said, \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019re didn\u2019t. Not at all. I\u2019m still working. But even if I\u2019m resting, I would still be very happy to receive a call from Brother Lin.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Receiving a call from Brother Lin, Yun Xue Yao\u2019s heart fluttered as she felt an indescribable joy.</p><br/><p>She had been too busy with work and she hadn\u2019t been able to remove herself from it. If she could, she would really have liked to go to Shanghai for a visit and to meet up with Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I was really afraid of disturbing your rest. After all, resting is the greatest way to maintain your health, especially for a female. Since coming back from Haojiang that time, I\u2019ve been thinking about that snack you brought me to eat. It was really memorable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao said, \u201cBrother Lin, if you want to eat it, I\u2019ll get someone to send it over for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. \u201cNo need, no need. There\u2019s no need for so much trouble. If I really want to eat it, I\u2019ll go over to Haojiang and eat it fresh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao said, \u201cSo when are you coming? I\u2019ll finish my work in advance so that I\u2019ll be able to bring you around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, perhaps I\u2019ll come by in a while. Oh right, I wanted to ask you for a favor this time,\u201d Lin Fan started to talk about the serious matter.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was a little upset. \u201cBrother Lin, that makes me a little upset. Don\u2019t talk about favors with me. If it\u2019s anything that I can do, I\u2019ll definitely do it. Even if I can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll still find a way to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her passion and warmth were a little too much for Lin Fan to handle. He hadn\u2019t thought that he was so well-liked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the situation. Wang Ke Hao is a friend from Hong Kong whom I\u2019ve just met today. His son has been detained by a money lender. 100 million, if not, they\u2019ll cut off both of his hands. I think this isn\u2019t your company but I want to ask if the money can be reduced. After all, it was increased to 100 million from 43 million. That\u2019s a little scary. And they even want to cut off both his hands. His father is really terrified.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI was just having dinner with Director Wang Ke Hao and the atmosphere was great but now, it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s a bit of a shame,\u201d said Lin Fan with a gentle laugh.</p><br/><p>But when Yun Xue Yao heard this, her face suddenly turned pale.</p><br/><p>It was as if a problem had been discovered by Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>It was as if her bad side had been discovered by the person she liked. This kind of feeling made Yun Xue Yao\u2019s heart suddenly knot up.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man who had been sitting quietly by her side saw the young lady\u2019s sudden change of expression. He was surprised and he didn\u2019t know what to do. At the same time, he saw that the young lady had tears starting to form in the corners of her eyes.</p><br/><p>He was so scared that cold sweat started forming at his pores. He had no idea what had happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that the other end of the call was all quiet and he couldn\u2019t help but become suspicious. \u201cXue Yao, are you listening? If it really is too much trouble, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice was a little stifled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cXue Yao, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t misunderstand. This\u2026this\u2026 I really didn\u2019t know about it. I\u2019m not that kind of person.\u201d Yun Xue Yao\u2019s words were a little strange and he couldn\u2019t quite understand her.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, what\u2019s wrong? I didn\u2019t say that you were that kind of person.\u201d Lin Fan was confused and he didn\u2019t even know what she was talking about.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan caught up. He hurriedly comforted her, \u201cXue Yao, I didn\u2019t say that you were that kind of person. Every place has its rules but we just want to lessen the interest by a little. We will definitely repay the borrowed money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019m not that kind of person,\u201d repeated Yun Xue Yao. Although she wouldn\u2019t relent on this matter, she didn\u2019t want the person she liked to know that she had always been dealing with such things.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t be agitated,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao said, \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll go and resolve this right now. I\u2019ll call you back later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard the beeping sound from the phone. He felt a little helpless. <em>I didn\u2019t say too much, did I?</em></p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao asked nervously, \u201cMaster Lin, did it work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be fine. Just wait a while,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s body relaxed after hanging up the phone. It was as if her secret had been revealed. Suddenly, she got up and walked towards the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d The middle-aged man hurried forward, wanting to ask about what had happened.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cScram.\u201d</p><br/><p>But before he could ask anything, he had been sent backward by a single word from Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>The office.</p><br/><p>Brother Jun looked at Wang Wen. \u201cYour old man really has his ways. He\u2019s looking for people to help you. But in here, no matter who comes, it\u2019s useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>The door was kicked open. Brother Jun wanted to burst out in a rage but when he saw who it was, he said respectfully, \u201cMiss, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Smack smack!*</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao went forward and delivered two slaps to Brother Jun\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Brother Jun could only lower his head and accept it. He didn\u2019t show any resentment or anger. The subordinates at the sides didn\u2019t even dare to breathe.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease him.\u201d Yun Xue Yao\u2019s face was all red.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Brother Jun nodded without hesitation. Then, he looked over to Wang Wen. \u201cScram.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Wen didn\u2019t even know what had happened. He immediately nodded and thanked her before scurrying off in fear.</p><br/><p>Brother Jun had always depended on the Yun family for a living. He was loyal and devoted to the Yun family. But when he looked at the young lady, he realized that she had buried her head on the table as she lay sprawled. She appeared to be very upset.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of here right now. Don\u2019t anybody come and disturb me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Jun nodded. Without saying more, he gestured for his subordinates to leave the place.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang. He said a few words before turning to Wang Ke Hao. \u201cIt\u2019s been settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ke Hao quickly gave his son a call. When he found out that his son had been released, he was dumbfounded. Just as he was about to say something to Lin Fan, Lin Fan waved his hand and pointed to the phone, telling him to talk on the phone first and they could talk about this later on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he had taken the brunt of this matter. He had caused someone who had been perfectly fine to suddenly lose her mind.</p><br/><p>He had to properly reconcile her and tell her not to think too much.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

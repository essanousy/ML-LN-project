Zhao Ming Qing was his disciple. Logically, Master Lin should visit him. However, the reporters had been stationed there for so long but hadn\u2019t even seen a trace of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Even if he was fully dressed in a disguise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the reporters\u2019 eyes. Hence, they believed that if Master Lin came, they would definitely manage to catch him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming out! They\u2019re coming out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters realized that a group of people were coming out of the hospital entrance. And those with sharp eyes realized that there was someone familiar.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! How did Master Lin go in? When did he enter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Did you guys fall asleep and miss him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I\u2019ve been staring at the entrance the whole time. He definitely couldn\u2019t have escaped my sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were dumbfounded. They felt that it was impossible. <em>We\u2019re professionals! We\u2019ve long trained ourselves to have eagle eyes. How could we have missed such an important character?</em></p><br/><p>But now that Master Lin and the rest were coming out from the hospital, these stunned reporters were lost for words.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei was following them from behind. The way he looked at Lin Fan had changed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had clearly been on the verge of death but suddenly, he became as lively as a lion again. It was simply unimaginable. Could it be that Master Lin\u2019s medical ability was really nature-defying?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And just now, before he had been able to react, he had been sent flying out of the room. This made him filled with fear.</p><br/><p>Mysterious and powerful. Chen Xiang Bei had been left puzzled, with no idea of what had happened.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the reporters charged forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how did you enter the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing the reporter\u2019s question, Lin Fan answered very calmly, \u201cI walked in slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, this was just Lin Fan talking trash. There had been so many reporters guarding the entrance. How could he have walked in? He had to have descended from the sky or something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible! We\u2019ve been watching the entrance very carefully. If you walked in, we wouldn\u2019t have missed it.\u201d The reporters couldn\u2019t quite accept that answer.</p><br/><p>Could it be that they had gone blind for a moment?</p><br/><p>That didn\u2019t make any f*cking sense.</p><br/><p>But when they saw Zhao Ming Qing, all of them were astonished.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? Isn\u2019t Director Zhao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters realized that Zhao Ming Qing was lively and energetic. His face was rosy and he was completely unlike before when he had been fading out.</p><br/><p><em>What happened here exactly?</em></p><br/><p>They all wanted to know. But even if they fried their brains from thinking, they still wouldn\u2019t be able to figure it out. What exactly had happened during this period?</p><br/><p>They had found out from the doctors that because Zhao Ming Qing was old, his bodily functions had been failing and he had been close to death. But now, what the heck was going on?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled. \u201cThank you, dear reporters, for your concern. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters definitely wouldn\u2019t let go of this opportunity. This matter was filled with too much doubt and confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, the doctors said before that your condition was extremely severe and it was very dangerous. How did you overcome that? Was it Master Lin who saved you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but look at his teacher as if asking him a question.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded slightly, indicating that he could say whatever he wanted. He had nothing to be afraid of anyway.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing understood, then smiled thinly at the reporters. \u201cYes, it was Teacher who saved me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were in an uproar. They had received news previously that Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s condition had been very critical but now, he was full of life. How the f*ck had he been saved?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They realized that this Master Lin was outrageously mysterious. He was too d*mn mystical. He had done so many unthinkable things.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t just the reporters who thought this.</p><br/><p>Even Zhao Ming Qing himself was a little dazed. Only he understood his own body\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>But that pill given to him by his teacher had possessed such powerful properties. His heart was filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>But he knew that his teacher had probably gone through extreme difficulties in obtaining that pill. His heart was filled with emotion and gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how did you manage to save Director Zhao?\u201d asked the reporters.</p><br/><p>Facing such a question, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t be bothered to reply. After all, he was a person who had performed too many miracles. But since the reporters asked, he had to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did I save him? Of course, it was with my two hands,\u201d Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it. There are still important things that I have to do later on. Let\u2019s have a proper conversation next time. My disciple has just recovered and he needs to go back and rest. Please excuse us.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard his teacher\u2019s words, he was speechless. You know that I\u2019ve just recovered but you\u2019re not even letting me rest. <em>Instead, you\u2019re sending me straight to Beijing. Sigh\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Could it be that teacher is so concerned about me because he wants me to be his errand boy?</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Of course, that was just a passing thought. He believed that his teacher truly cared about him.</p><br/><p>The reporters still wanted to ask more questions but Lin Fan really didn\u2019t want to say anymore. He wanted to go back and have a good sleep. After being in a state of heightened focus for the past few days, if he was an average person, he would have died long ago.</p><br/><p>An average person wouldn\u2019t have been able to be like him, talking to the reporters until now.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters were regretful that they couldn\u2019t ask more. But they thought that the doctors definitely knew more about the situation, so they were very excited. After Master Lin and the rest left, the reporters ran into the hospital to question the doctors about the incident.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Qing, when you reach Beijing, you have to work hard. Don\u2019t let yourself lose out. You have to take what you should take.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing blushed. \u201cTeacher, do I really have to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cOf course. Otherwise, you\u2019d have gone for nothing. You\u2019ve just recovered and you\u2019re going to work again. If those people have such thick skin that they don\u2019t even give you anything, what should you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just forget it and come back,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan glared at him. \u201cJust ask them for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei was in the car too. When he heard this conversation, he was a little embarrassed. He felt the need to speak. \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. If the treatment is successful, we\u2019ll definitely thank him plentifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? Then if the treatment is unsuccessful, are you not going to give him anything at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei\u2019s expression turned stern. \u201cMaster Lin, this person is very important. If he isn\u2019t treated successfully, there will be problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cAlright then. Try me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing suddenly felt as if the atmosphere was stifling. He tried to mediate it, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019ll be fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Chen Xiang Bei had felt that this Master Lin had become different. It was as if he had a strong spirit in him that was enough to split open the skies. It was shocking. Then, he lowered his head and said, \u201cMaster Lin, it was my fault for getting too agitated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThe sooner you go there, the sooner you can return. If there\u2019s anything, give me a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he disappeared from their sights. Now, he had to drive home.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

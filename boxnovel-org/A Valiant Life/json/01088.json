You really managed to taste the toxins?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was in such admiration that he wanted to prostrate himself. He even wanted to kneel down and worship Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t dare to believe that someone could taste such a problem. What kind of mouth must he have? It was such an incredible power.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand calmly. \u201cIt was just alright. There\u2019s no need to be so excited. It was just a small matter. I don\u2019t request much from you all but just don\u2019t doubt me so easily next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d I\u2019ll never dare to doubt you ever again.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang nodded immediately. He now understood how dumb he had been to doubt Brother Lin. He really shouldn\u2019t have done that.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the situation. But thinking about it, she felt helpless. \u201cBrother Lin, why do you think such a big enterprise like Tianshu Milk would produce milk that doesn\u2019t meet the requirements? And it even managed to enter the market.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cWho knows? Let\u2019s not think too much about things out of our control. Anyway, now that the truth is out, naturally, someone will take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners gathered around as well. They were looking at Lin Fan in a different light now. It was as if they were looking at a god.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re way too f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! It actually turned out to be true. But this is good. I firmly trust in Little Boss, so I\u2019ve been boycotting Tianshu Milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. I saw that many people were still doubting Little Boss on the Internet and some didn\u2019t even heed your warning and they continued purchasing Tianshu Milk. They\u2019re really unwise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you should drink more milk when you\u2019re free in the future to see if there are any other brands that don\u2019t meet the standards. We\u2019ll put them all up on the Internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He felt that this idea was very good. However, there were so many brands of milk on the market. Did they want him to die from drinking?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Don\u2019t you all have to work? Don\u2019t you have to look after your shops? Go on and disperse.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand. This had always been a small matter to him.</p><br/><p>Now, the Quality Inspection Head Office had gotten involved. This Tianshu Milk Company would definitely be strictly investigated.</p><br/><p>Looking at the situation on Weibo, it appeared that the Quality Inspection Head Office had intervened. And Tianshu Milk Company had immediately posted a public notice.</p><br/><p>They were recalling all those products.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the netizens kept flaming them. They hadn\u2019t expected that there really was a problem with Tianshu Milk. It had damaged their faith in Tianshu Milk.</p><br/><p>To the people of Tianshu Milk Company, Master Lin was probably their number one enemy now.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter to Lin Fan. They could hate him if they wanted. Anyway, he had not done anything wrong regarding this matter.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>A call came from Wang Ming Yang. Lin Fan answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ming Yang?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Wang Ming Yang was silent for a moment before he said, \u201cBrother, I misunderstood you. I actually didn\u2019t believe you. I really\u2026 Sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cAre you retarded? You called me just because of this stupid thing? But what do you think? Is my mouth powerful or what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re powerful, you\u2019re powerful. I prostrate myself in admiration,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chatted with Wang Ming Yang casually for a while before hanging up.</p><br/><p>This company was a listed company. It had deep roots in China. But the occurrence of such an incident was a good wake up call for them.</p><br/><p>It reminded this Japanese corporation that the citizens would support them if they manufactured their products well. But if there were problems, no one would support them.</p><br/><p>When some of the large milk corporations in the country saw the news, they were taken aback. They hadn\u2019t expected that there really was a problem with Tianshu Milk. Although this incident hadn\u2019t happened to them, they felt that there were definitely implications.</p><br/><p>The occurrence of such an incident would create feelings of distrust among the citizens towards milk products. The public would feel as if there were no safe milk brands anymore.</p><br/><p>They had to view this matter with great importance.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to Cloud Street as usual. He didn\u2019t care about the situation on the Internet anymore. Meanwhile, he was thinking about how Wu Huan Yue\u2019s song recording was going.</p><br/><p>As for that Wang Mei Tian, he wasn\u2019t bothered by her at all. After such an incident, she had probably been scolded to death.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sat at the entrance, smoking his cigarette, when he suddenly saw a group of people in the distance. He instantly cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s bad. The reporters are here again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d When Lin Fan heard that, he was dumbfounded. He had no idea what was going on. <em>Why are the reporters here again? Isn\u2019t the matter resolved already?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d in the distance, the reporters were yelling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to the shop entrance and looked into the distance. The reporters were carrying their cameras as they ran over. There were also some people by the reporters\u2019 sides. These people were carrying milk and they were running like the wind. They had excited expressions on their faces as if they were looking forward to something.</p><br/><p><em>Sigh. </em>Lin Fan was already helpless against these reporters. After all, it wasn\u2019t good to appear on the news so frequently.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters arrived in front of Lin Fan with thrilled looks on their faces. \u201cMaster Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cAre you guys unable to find news every day? Even though we\u2019re familiar with each other, you can\u2019t just come and interview me every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters said with smiles on their faces, \u201cMaster Lin, this time, we\u2019re not the ones who are looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters smiled proudly. \u201cWe were pleaded by the netizens to come and look for you. The netizens really value healthy milk, so this time, even various milk companies have come with their own products. They\u2019re here to let Master Lin try them and see if these brands of milk pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He couldn\u2019t understand it. <em>What the f*ck is this?</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, a middle-aged man carried a box of milk over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Master Lin. I\u2019m the Shanghai representative for Mengniu Milk. I bought this milk from a random supermarket under the witness of the reporters. Now, I\u2019ve brought it over for Master Lin to try and see how our milk is. Also, this will be put on the Internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another lady appeared. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m the representative for Yili Milk. This is also randomly picked from a supermarket. It definitely isn\u2019t deliberately prepared. Our company would like to invite Master Lin to be our milk tester. In the future, we will send our milk to Master Lin at fixed intervals of time. If you can taste any problems, you can tag us on Weibo and we will check it immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Lin Fan was getting more confused as he listened. \u201cIf you want to test your milk, why don\u2019t you just look for a specialized organization? Why are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters shouted in reply, \u201cBecause the netizens only trust you now. They don\u2019t trust anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

How could she stand it? Then, her expression turned cold as she said, \u201cChief Chen, please conduct yourself with a little more dignity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He shook his head and smiled, \u201cWhat? Are you angry? Superstar Xu, I\u2019m only saying the truth. I have to say that you have some abilities, for you to get Wang Ming Yang to protect you. However, you have to be clear that Wang Ming Yang may treat you all very well but I, Chen He, am just so f*cked up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen He slammed the table. Everything had been fine but suddenly, he had lost his temper. Everyone was astonished.</p><br/><p>Everyone at the site shifted their gazes over.</p><br/><p>Chen He\u2019s tone became cold as well. \u201cLet me ask you one last time. Are you going to drink this wine or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le did not hesitate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Chen He flung his palm straight at Xu Zi Le, slapping her onto the ground.</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man was the Director. When he saw this, he was alarmed. He quickly held Chen He back. \u201cChief Chen, don\u2019t be angry. Don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Er immediately squatted down next to Xu Zi Le. \u201cAre you okay, Sister Xu?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very common for celebrities to be taken advantage of by investors.</p><br/><p>And being hit by an investor was a very normal thing.</p><br/><p>Xue Er knew this well. Even she had been hit by the Director before when she was not performing well. But that was when she wasn\u2019t very famous. If she became famous, this kind of thing wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Sister Xu was quite famous. The only people who would dare to hit her would be investors, especially investors who were capable. They wouldn\u2019t care how popular she was and they would just hit her if they wanted to. Celebrities, even if they have to suffer, can only suck it up.</p><br/><p>Xue Er glared at Chen He. \u201cHow could you hit her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director was still holding Chen He back. \u201cChief Chen, please calm yourself down. Don\u2019t hit her. Don\u2019t hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He pointed at Xu Zi Le and bellowed, \u201cYou f*cking whore! I, Chen He, took the initiative to come here but you aren\u2019t tactful at all. Don\u2019t think that you can be lawless just because you rely on Wang Ming Yang. In my eyes, you\u2019re just a whore, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing if Wang Ming Yang will dare to challenge me just because of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding performers and staff didn\u2019t dare to make a sound. This was something that they were sorrowful about, having to face these wealthy people. Even if they were incomparably glorious in front of average people, behind the scenes, they were the victims of countless crimes and they all suffered a lot.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le covered her cheek with one hand as she glared furiously at Chen He.</p><br/><p>Chen He scolded her, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Let me tell you, Xu Zi Le, you\u2019re just a whore to me. Let me ask you again, are you going to drink it or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director was trembling with fear. \u201cShe\u2019ll drink it, she\u2019ll drink it. Don\u2019t be angry, Chief Chen. She\u2019ll drink the wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Er stood in front of Xu Zi Le and said, \u201cChief Chen, I\u2019ll drink on Sister Xu\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram off. You have no say in this,\u201d said Chen He angrily.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le\u2019s eyes were gleaming with rage. She roared, \u201cI won\u2019t drink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker!\u201d Chen He had lost it.</p><br/><p>The Director hugged Chen He\u2019s waist, shouting, \u201cCalm down, Chief Chen, calm down. Run, Zi Le. Leave this to us.\u201d Then, he looked at some of the male performers at the side. \u201cWhat are you all standing there for? Hurry up and hold Chief Chen down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He glared at everyone at the side. \u201cWhoever dares to come, don\u2019t even think of being in the entertainment industry anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard this, everyone was frightened and they just stood in their original spots. They weren\u2019t willing to offend a big shot just for Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d When the Director saw this, he cursed in his heart.</p><br/><p>Since ancient times, actors have always been very fickle. So this situation did make sense.</p><br/><p>Xue Er quickly pulled on Xu Zi Le. \u201cSister Xu, let\u2019s go, quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le stood there stubbornly. \u201cI won\u2019t go. Mr. Chen, if you have the ability, then beat me to death. Otherwise, I\u2019ll definitely have my revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He had never seen a female celebrity who dared to challenge him like that before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*creak*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the banquet room\u2019s door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood at the entrance. There were quite a number of tables inside. \u201cLittle Sister, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xu Zi Le heard his voice, she was delighted. \u201cBig Bro, I\u2019m over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes shifted over. She saw that thing were in a mess over there. Then, he frowned. It seemed that something had happened. There was even a man there who was shouting.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over at Lin Fan. Some of the celebrities were startled. They had always paid attention to Weibo. Wasn\u2019t this Master Lin?</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin wasn\u2019t involved in the entertainment industry, he wasn\u2019t any less famous than them.</p><br/><p>The things he did, in particular, were very impressive and they were very astounding.</p><br/><p>This Xu Zi Le\u2019s Big Bro was Master Lin?</p><br/><p>And Master Lin called Xu Zi Le his Little Sister. Does that mean that Master Lin was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s Brother?</p><br/><p>When the Director saw him, he quickly said, \u201cMaster Lin, this is Chief Chen. There\u2019s been a conflict between him and Zi Le but it\u2019s fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned as he saw Xu Zi Le covering her cheek. He asked, \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le had been putting on a strong front but now, it disappeared. Her tears flowed down as she said, \u201cBrother, he told me to drink with him. I refused, so he hit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, when Wang Ming Yang and Brother Lin weren\u2019t around, she was all alone and without support, so she could only put on a strong front. Now that Brother Lin had come, a weak girl like her could not put on a strong front any longer. Her tears naturally came crashing down.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he was instantly furious. Xu Zi Le called him her Brother, so she saw her as his own sibling. Even he wouldn\u2019t bear to hit her and yet, a fat pig had hit her. This was f*cking outrageous.</p><br/><p>\u201cSkinny man, let him go,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The Director said, \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s just a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin fan said once more, \u201cI told you to let him go. I don\u2019t wish to repeat myself again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing Lin Fan\u2019s gaze, the Director became nervous. Then, he let go of Chen He.</p><br/><p>Chen He immediately came to Lin Fan\u2019s front. \u201cYou\u2019re the whore\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately raised his hand and slapped Chen He. Chen He was stunned. In disbelief, he said, \u201cYou dare to hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>Another slap.</p><br/><p>Chen He stumbled backwards while Lin Fan walked him down, step by step. With every step, another slap was flung out at Chen He.</p><br/><p>Chen He had never expected himself to be beaten by this kid in Shanghai. At that moment, both his eyes were bright red as he bellowed, \u201cDon\u2019t you f*cking know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom! Who the hell are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>One of them kept shouting while the other kept slapping.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s jaws dropped. There was pin-drop silence in the place.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t dare to believe it. Master Lin, without saying a word, just came and started dishing out a beating. Moreover, it was a very dominant beating.</p><br/><p>Chen He\u2019s head was spinning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTalk. Keep talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk about your mom\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood in front of Chen He very calmly. His eyes were steady. \u201cTalk. I told you to keep talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, that calm and dominant aura from Lin Fan made everyone stunned.</p><br/><p>What a dominant man!</p><br/><p>At that moment, they understood that Xu Zi Le\u2019s greatest pillar of support was probably not Wang Ming Yang but it was this Big Bro who would beat others up without saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t talk anymore? Alright then. Let\u2019s start discussing proper matters. Xu Zi Le is my Little Sister. If you slap her, you\u2019re slapping me. Which hand did you slap her with? Stick out that hand.\u201d Lin Fan was composed, his tone was calm but even so, it was enough to send a chill down everyone\u2019s spine.</p><br/><p>This chill went all the way from their feet to their heads and all the way up to the highest heavens.</p><br/><p>Terrifying.</p></div>\n</div>"}

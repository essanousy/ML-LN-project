It was so exaggerated that it looked fake.</p><br/><p>It was way too exaggerated.</p><br/><p>What made them embarrassed was that he didn't even feel that there was something wrong with his expressions.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan was completely immersed in his own world. The scallion pancake that he ate had completely brought him to a different world.</p><br/><p>He felt like he was drifting in the deep blue sea under the hot sun.</p><br/><p>He thought of his past life events. From the time he graduated from University to the point when he found his favorite job. It was considered to be a sacred job to him.</p><br/><p>To be a reporter!</p><br/><p>As he continued in his career, sometimes he would feel that he was always hiding the truth behind the discussion and evils. Even if one found the most crucial piece of evidence, one would be completely defeated when it came to the end.</p><br/><p>\"I have to stand my ground for my values\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, this sentence was all that Chu Yuan said.</p><br/><p>\"It's simply too delicious.\"</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan opened his eyes and exclaimed. His hands were trembling. It was the first time he had tasted a scallion pancake that was so delicious. He felt as if his soul had been reinvigorated.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the remaining piece of scallion pancake in his hand. He immediately opened his mouth and wolfed it down.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, your scallion pancakes are simply too delicious. I can't describe it with any words,\" Chu Yuan said ecstatically. He wiped his tears away. It was the type of food that could touch the hearts of millions of people.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he hadn't expected himself to make those exaggerated expressions. But he wasn't bothered by it since they were involuntary. Those expressions revealed his true feelings.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"My scallion pancakes have always been this delicious.\"</p><br/><p>With the recipe from the Encyclopedia, these scallion pancakes were simply godly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that it was important to be that confident in order to succeed in life.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han was shocked by the expressions of the reporter. \"That was so fake\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, how could the scallion pancake be that delicious?\"</p><br/><p>\"If I didn't know Master Lin, I would've thought that he was an actor employed by him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let me get Master Lin to give me one too.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \"You should quickly go and queue up for it. When the crowd comes later, you might not even be able to buy it.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Ming said, \"You've eaten Master Lin's scallion pancakes before?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \"Of course. Actually, Master Lin still has a lot of unimaginable skills that would shock all of you. All of you just don't know about it yet. If we just mention about the dishes that he cooks, those would already be considered heavenly\u2026\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan eas completely convinced after eating the first scallion pancake. He finally knew how delicious they were. Master Lin's scallion pancakes couldn't be matched up by any other food.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the other townsfolk that watched him said, \"That's so exaggerated. Could it really be that delicious?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know but we can try.\"</p><br/><p>\"I heard online that Master Lin's scallion pancakes are extremely delicious. But it can't be that good. The fella's expressions were horrifying.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he looked at the townsfolk that were discussing amongst themselves. He tried to lure them. \"Want to give them a try?\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk looked at each other and couldn't take it anymore. They wanted to try the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss, we're here!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's so crowded here. The first day of Master Lin's shop opening is simply different.\"</p><br/><p>A group of townsfolk suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at them and realized that they were from Cloud Street. They had really charged there to support him!</p><br/><p>When they reached his shop and found out about the unlimited and free scallion pancakes, they became extremely excited.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, thank god I managed to make it here. I'm so lucky. The scallion pancakes are free and even unlimited. Little Boss, please give me one.\"</p><br/><p>\"Queue up, please queue up. We've eaten it so many times. Don't you know the rules?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, please queue up. It'd be almost impossible to eat Master Lin's scallion pancakes in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, it's Master Lin's first day. The scallion pancakes are free and unlimited. Why is there no queue?\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, do you really think they've tried the scallion pancakes before? They're missing out on a heavenly delicacy.\"</p><br/><p>\"Now that we've gotten the opportunity, we have to try them.\"</p><br/><p>The local townsfolk from Tian Hong Commercial Street were stunned. What was going on? Why were there so many people all of a sudden? They even looked like they were celebrating.</p><br/><p>Some of them became even more curious.</p><br/><p>\"Could the scallion pancakes really be that delicious?\"</p><br/><p>They had never eaten Master Lin's scallion pancakes but it was normal for people to be curious. A typical scallion pancake wouldn't even catch their attention but this time, things were different.</p><br/><p>\"Of course. These are Master Lin's scallion pancakes. Do you think they're the same as those $50-60 scallion pancakes on the street? These can't be matched at all. It's simply heaven and earth. It's your loss if you don't try them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, Master Lin's scallion pancakes are second to none. We've even started to question about life after trying the scallion pancakes at Cloud Street. You guys have it better here. There's no queue at all.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd was adding on countless comments and that made all the local townsfolk stunned.</p><br/><p>That was too fake to be true.</p><br/><p>But after seeing the expressions of these people, it didn't seem like an act anymore.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, some of them started shouting. When they turned to look at them, they were extremely stunned. Their expressions were demonic.</p><br/><p>A plump and bald man looked extremely mesmerized and he didn't bother about what others thought of him. There were even tears flowing from the corners of his eyes. \"It's too delicious. I haven't eaten Little Boss' scallion pancakes in six months. I never thought I'd be able to eat it again today. I'm so excited.\"</p><br/><p>\"Every time I eat Little Boss's scallion pancakes, I feel so relieved. It's like they take my worries away.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, more demonic expressions started to appear in front of the crowd.</p><br/><p>They had been completely taken over by the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled. He didn't even care about how exaggerated their expressions were. It was a normal sight after all because his scallion pancakes were that delicious.</p><br/><p>A teenager exclaimed, \"Could the ingredients be so magical that they can give off light? Although the scallion pancakes can't, those that ate the scallion pancakes are making expressions from the comics. Do they have to be so exaggerated\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the expressions of the loyal customers, the local townsfolk were extremely curious. They wanted to try it for themselves to find out if it was indeed that delicious.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners didn't compete for the scallion pancakes at all. They knew what the true power of Master Lin's scallion pancakes was like.</p><br/><p>These townsfolk were completely under the control of Master Lin's scallion pancakes. They couldn't even get out of it and were sinking deeper into their addiction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

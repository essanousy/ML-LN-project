Although she wasn\u2019t like the other huge celebrities, she would still be recognized when she went out anywhere. To prevent any disturbance that night, she decided to take the corner table to be a little more inconspicuous.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Huan Yue was a little anxious but was, at the same time, bubbling with excitement. Her snow white complexion had a little blush, and her fingers twiddled with each other, \u201cBrother Lin, I think we\u2019ve known each other for about four months already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, time passes really fast. Just then you were just a fresh grad. If it weren\u2019t for Wang Ming Yang, we would never have met,\u201d Lin Fan said, chuckling.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I always wanted to thank you for helping me, but I\u2019ve never had the chance,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, it\u2019s nothing really, just a slight effort. You getting where you are today is really due to your hard work,\u201d Lin Fan said, smiling. Of course, he was being a little humble. If it weren\u2019t for the songs that he wrote, Wu Huan Yue would have had a much harder time.</p><br/><p>Of course, he also knew that Wu Huan Yue was someone who was determined. No matter how long the working hours, she hardly ever took a break.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the waiter brought their food over disrupting their conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them nodded their heads. After the waiter had served them, he turned and walked off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Wu Huan Yue giggled sweetly, causing Lin Fan to be perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan looked at her puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. I just feel so blessed today, as if the goddess of luck is has been with me all this while,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a major misconception. It wasn\u2019t the goddess of luck that has been taking care of you all this while, but me, Brother Lin,\u201d Lin Fan said, thick-skinned.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue covered her mouth, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s so narcissistic, but honestly speaking, you really are the male god of luck to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMale god?\u201d Lin Fan ran his hands across his face, a little narcissistic. \u201cYou\u2019re really good at complimenting me, but you must continue to work hard. When I become the emperor of heaven, you better not embarrass me,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen have I ever? I will work hard, for the sake of not embarrassing you.\u201d Wu Huan Yue said, giving him a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>Both of them continued eating and talking.</p><br/><p>For Wu Huan Yue, she felt like she was on cloud nine today because she had never eaten a meal with Lin Fan alone, and today was the first.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan realized that Wu Huan Yue was staring at his food. \u201cWhat up? Why are you staring at me?\u201d Lin Fan asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t you move,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said. Thereafter, standing up, her hands holding on to a napkin, her head extending forward as she leaned forward.</p><br/><p>Because the table was a little wider than usual, Wu Huan Yue had to bend forward, her hips thrusting backward.</p><br/><p>The scenery was completely different, with her bending forward, face to face with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At the same moment where she bent forward, the collar of her dress weighed downwards, and the scenery on the inside was in plain view.</p><br/><p>A field of white with a red mountaintop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started blushing. He tried not to look, but it was in plain sight and impossible to look away. At the same moment, a subtle fragrance wafted as her silky smooth hair flowed downwards, with the light filtering at the edges of her hair. The sight of that would have moved any men.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a sesame seed next to your mouth,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said, taking her napkin to wipe his face. Thereafter, she sat down, her face looking the same as ever. She knew what Brother Lin had seen, and she had willingly let him see it.</p><br/><p>In her line of work, she had so many social functions to attend, and she knew full well which ones would expose more skin than the rest. She didn\u2019t block anything for Brother Lin, because she wanted only Lin Fan to see it.</p><br/><p>And behold, Brother Lin had seen it, and he was so shy about it.</p><br/><p>This was the first time she saw Lin Fan so bashful.</p><br/><p>She could have never imagined it if she never saw it herself.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lightly coughed, his gaze adverting to one side, pretending to take something. \u201cHuan Yue, please don\u2019t wear something too revealing next time. It isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, If Brother Lin doesn\u2019t like this, I won\u2019t wear it next time,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said, grinning from ear to ear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that what he had said wasn\u2019t quite right, as if he was acting like her boyfriend, stating his likes and dislikes about her dressing. This wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo please, it\u2019s just an opinion. If you like it, you should continue wearing it. Just make sure you don\u2019t expose yourself the next time.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue grinned, nodding her head. She didn\u2019t say anything after that. She definitely wouldn\u2019t wear that dress if she weren\u2019t going out with Lin Fan- it was such a hassle to put on and it was really easy to expose herself in that dress. Since she was going out with Lin Fan to have dinner that day, she decided to wear her most charming and beautiful dress.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll go to the washroom for a while,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said, getting up from her seat.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>In the washroom!</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue looked in the mirror while washing her hands. \u201cCome on, you can do this! This is a very good start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the unbelievable happened.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was stunned. Of all the people, this was the last person she expected to see in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>This couldn\u2019t be it- wasn\u2019t Ying Jing in the Capital City? Suddenly, she remembered that the Shanghai Satellite TV Network had organized a singing competition and had invited Ying Jing to be one of the judges.</p><br/><p>The pay was high.</p><br/><p>It was almost thirty million dollars.</p><br/><p>When Ying Jing saw Wu Huan Yue, her happy face instantly changed, turning severe and serious.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have any enmity with Wu Huan Yue, but she had something against the other guy, especially with that photo which had gone viral after circulating online.</p><br/><p>Although she had appeared on the news in the lead story, it wasn\u2019t a news that she wanted to be in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Ying Jing snorted, as she washed her hands in the basin next to Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne must be self-aware, don\u2019t think that just because you have a better song in this circle that you\u2019ll become more famous,\u201d Ying Jing said, talking to herself. However, Wu Huan Yue knew that those words were for her.</p><br/><p>By any rights, Wu Huan Yue knew that she should be calling Ying Jing teacher, but she was on Lin Fan\u2019s side and knew that Brother Lin had enmity with her. If she called Ying Jing teacher, that would be a big disgrace to Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t say anything. After drying her hands, she turned and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand still. How rude of you. Don\u2019t you know how to greet a teacher?\u201d Ying Jing said.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue just muttered an \u201cOh\u201d before walking off, not turning back to look.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing marched forward in anger after hearing Wu Huan Yue\u2019s lackluster reply. She grabbed Wu Huan Yue\u2019s hands and spun her around and with her other hand, slapped her. \u201cThis is to teach you how to respect your seniors. Don\u2019t think that just because you have some success that you can forget hows to respect your seniors. Do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jing turned around and left after snorting at Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stood there, still trying to process what had happened, battling the tears that were welling up in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue, you have to be strong. This is the first time you are on a date with Brother Lin, you cannot ruin this.\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking a deep breath, Wu Huan Yue walked out of the washroom.</p><br/><p>The water that walked past her was in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

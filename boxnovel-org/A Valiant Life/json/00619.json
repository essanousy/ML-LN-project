Why don\u2019t you sit for a while?\u201d Lu Li shouted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands, \u201cNo need for a seat. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li smiled, \u201cYou say this as if I\u2019m an outsider. You did save my life. However, if you ever run into any problem, you can look for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, sure. I\u2019ll take my leave now.\u201d Lin Fan turned his back and left.</p><br/><p>However, once Lin Fan left, Lu Li\u2019s expression had an immediate change. It became one of icy arrogance. He had to give off the overbearing chairman aura in order for his employees to revere him.</p><br/><p>Of course, if not for that abduction case that happened previously, even Lin Fan would not be able to tell that Lu Li was actually hiding deeper feelings.</p><br/><p>Whenever something were to happen, he would become as timid as a mouse.</p><br/><p>After leaving Lu Li\u2019s place, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to go back to Cloud Street, but instead, he came to an isolated place in the suburbs of Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Ever since he got the major classification of the knowledge of wuxia, he still hadn\u2019t tried what exactly he was supposed to do.</p><br/><p>However, what astonished Lin Fan was that, even though he wasn\u2019t able to look behind him, he could still feel the movements that were happening. Moreover, the mysterious thing was that, even if he were to be shrouded by grass and trees, he would still be able to perceive everything as per usual.</p><br/><p>It was strange. He wasn\u2019t exactly sure what kind of trick this was.</p><br/><p>It might be that his strength was too overpowering, so much so that it transcended humanity.</p><br/><p>Standing at the same spot, he took a breath. The surrounding grasslands started rustling as if they were being moved by some force.</p><br/><p>*boom!*</p><br/><p>He jumped up.</p><br/><p>A silhouette flew up into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! So high!\u201d Lin Fan lowered his head and looked at everything beneath him. He didn\u2019t dare to believe it. It was scientifically unexplainable. He was able to jump extremely high. In the distance, he was able to see structures.</p><br/><p>He had become Superman.</p><br/><p>With just this ability, if people were to see him doing it, it would be as if they saw a ghost.</p><br/><p>When he reached it certain height, he no longer went up, but rather he started descending. Lin Fan was curious, so he took a step again.</p><br/><p>*boom!*</p><br/><p>*boom!*</p><br/><p>There was a booming sound and it was as if the air shook whenever he took a step. It could be said that he was either walking in mid-air or that he was soaring in the sky.</p><br/><p>With each step he took, he could bring his body forward some distance.</p><br/><p>Increase in speed, a thorough increase in speed!</p><br/><p>The frequency of his steps increased over time. The air around was vibrating vigorously. Lin Fan was enjoying himself. How magical was this? It was like he was able to run in the sky, leaving a trail of white smoke behind him.</p><br/><p>He was really running in mid-air!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was one palm technique that required descending from the heavens.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan decided to try it out. He flipped a few times in mid-air, then stretched out his arm, and with his palm fully spread out, he headed directly downwards to the ground.</p><br/><p>He descended at an incredible speed. The sound of wind rushing in his ears.</p><br/><p>When he was about to reach the ground, there was a muffled sound.</p><br/><p>A vast amount of energy was projected from his palm. It hit the ground directly, causing the ground to shake. The soil began eroding, forming a giant palm print on the ground. But it didn\u2019t end there. The ground was still being pressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazingly strong! Am I still a human?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t dare to believe it. He didn\u2019t continue testing his powers. He turned slightly. His legs didn\u2019t find solid ground and he continued to stand in mid-air as if standing stably on the ground. Thereafter, he slowly descending.</p><br/><p>\u201cBa Gua Zhang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shouted once, then moved his hands. The explosion noise was still resonating in his ears, but slowly, it faded away. What surprised him the most was that in the palm-shaped depression he was standing on, the shape of the eight-trigram had also appeared.</p><br/><p>It was somewhat freakish!</p><br/><p>Unbelievable!</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, there was no movement in the area.</p><br/><p>Only the palm-shaped depression in the ground was left behind.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, when people walked past the area, they saw what had happened to the ground and decided to upload a photo of it, causing mini discussions over the Internet.</p><br/><p>Some people said, \u201cWhich crazy idiot had nothing better to do and decided to dig a hole in the shape of an eight-trigram?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had a primary understanding of his powers. It was strong and valiant. It was unmatchable.</p><br/><p>It was quick and had destructive powers. God would be God. Such powers were unexplainable using science.</p><br/><p>Even those wuxia shows were uncomparable to him.</p><br/><p>Could they run in mid-air?</p><br/><p>Definitely not.</p><br/><p>Could they cause blasts in the air, resulting in vigorous shaking?</p><br/><p>Definitely not either.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d When Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan, he became rich in emotion. \u201cWhat did you eat today? This energy, this feeling\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTerrifying.\u201d Fraud Tian stared at Lin Fan as if he just saw a ghost. He was the Ba Gua Zhang Master. He never realized that Lin Fan\u2019s aura was so terrifying before, but looking at it today, it was simply shocking.</p><br/><p>His perception skills were good. Previously, he knew that Lin Fan was strong, but today, it was a feeling that was far from before.</p><br/><p>Normal people would not be able to feel it, however, he was able to.</p><br/><p>It turned out to be terrifying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cFraud, it\u2019s good that you know I\u2019m terrifying. If you are ever presumptuous, then allow me to slap you once. I might be able to slap you out of the Milky Way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that right? Stop boasting around.\u201d Fraud Tian said spitefully. As per usual, he then proceeded to smoke a cigarette while looking out onto the street. He shook his head, \u201cSigh, curse this weather! It\u2019s so cold. There\u2019s nothing interesting to look at on the streets anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFool\u2026\u201d Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then said, \u201cYou Lan, how was your window-shopping with Huan Yue yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fun.\u201d Wu You Lan cutely said with a pout.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan thought for awhile, \u201cHuan Yue is now a major star. She dresses so fancily when we go out. I can\u2019t play this or play that. There isn\u2019t any point at all. I don\u2019t see what\u2019s the point of being a star at all. Being able to happily live a peaceful life is still the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Lin Fan laughed. \u201cEveryone has their own dreams. Huan Yue\u2019s dream was to become a star. You Lan, didn\u2019t Brother Lin say that you had to chase your own dreams as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cI have a dream! And I\u2019m chasing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, \u201cWhat dream? How are you chasing it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan laughed secretively, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you. I\u2019ll tell you when I achieve it one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded his head, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He was reading a book when he sniggered.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>It was an unknown number.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor Lin, how are you? This is Ma Mu Feng of Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly astonished. He never expected that Ma Mu Feng would ever make the first move to call him. It\u2019s really shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Ma Qingzhou. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, I was thinking of asking you to help me treat my illness. Whatever your requests are, just raise it up, I\u2019ll fulfill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cDo you have the capability to fulfill any request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor Lin, maybe you don\u2019t quite understand who I, Ma Qingzhou, is. If possible, you can come over to Qingzhou. I\u2019ll let you experience it.\u201d He was extremely confident in his conversation. Such confidence could be his downfall.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cOkay, then I wouldn\u2019t put you in a spot. Since you said that you can fulfill any request, then I\u2019ll make one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou couldn\u2019t help but laugh through the phone. On this planet, no one is able to reject him, especially when he had ultimate power.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, request away!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want the sun.\u201d Lin Fan felt that he was extremely smart that he would think of such a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to joke around with me?\u201d Ma Qingzhou\u2019s tone took a sudden turn. He sounded gloomy as if his heart was burning with rage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke honestly, \u201cYes, you are smart. I\u2019m trying to joke around with you. Sadly, there\u2019s no reward. Same goes for you. And you still want me to help you treat your illness. How about you take a good look in the mirror and see what you\u2019ve grown up to be like.\u201d After which, he cut the call.</p><br/><p>What was there to be scared of? He should be embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*beep beep*</p><br/><p>The phone signal got cut off.</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou of Qingzhou was thoroughly angry now. He threw his phone on to the ground and cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

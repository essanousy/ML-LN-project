The surroundings were all extremely quiet so it could not be in an urban area. So he was could only be in a suburban area and a very remote one.</p><br/><p>These b*stards must have definitely done a lot of preparations, carefully choosing a location.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwake already?\u201d a cold voice came to his ear. Li Qiang was holding a bayonet as he walked towards Lin Fan. His expression was very gloomy and filled with fire when he said, \u201cDo you know why you have been kidnapped by us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI have no idea. If I knew, I wouldn\u2019t have been kidnapped in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qiang sneered and said, \u201cHumph, reckless even in the face of danger. Even daring to catch a \u2018scorpion\u2019. Let\u2019s see if it will save you this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Li Qiang replied, \u201cWhat am I trying to do? You\u2019re going to find out soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was a sound of a vehicle coming to a stop.</p><br/><p>After that, a man was being dragged by these two other big sized men. He was dragged all the way to Lin Fan\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang, our preparation has been done. This b*stard is the boss of Lu Shi group. He is very rich so even if the police don\u2019t care about this Master Lin, they will definitely worry about this Lu Li,\u201d the bald henchman said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the man next to him and was stunned. He did not expect that the man who was kidnapped was Lu Li, a very rich boss. He did not imagine that a few months later, he would appear right here.</p><br/><p>It was definitely a huge tragedy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lu Li woke up. The moment he woke up, he started to frantically scream, \u201cHelp me! Who are you guys? What are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>*slap*</p><br/><p>Li Qiang went forward and slapped him. \u201cShut the f*ck up. If not, I\u2019ll break your face.\u201d Then, he pointed the black pistol at his head. Lu Li was so frightened that he swallowed his saliva forcefully. He looked extremely fearful.</p><br/><p>Although he was a big boss with a very high status, he was also a human. In the face of these evil criminals, he was also scared till his face was completely white.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Chairman Lu, you are such a coward, being scared to such a huge extent,\u201d Lin Fan said as he laughed.</p><br/><p>Lu Li, who was initially terrified, could not help turning around and taking a look. When he saw the person with him, he was stunned and said, \u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m very sorry to have been kidnapped together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li did not think he would see Master Lin right here, especially being kidnapped together. Then, his gaze shifted to the kidnappers and he said, \u201cWhat do you guys what? If you guys just want money, you can just give me a number and I\u2019ll give it to you. Just don\u2019t hurt us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qiang sneered and said, \u201cChairman Lu, we don\u2019t want money. So, if you still want to live, shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li was flustered. In all his years, he had never been in a situation like this before. Especially with these fierce and evil criminals. All this made Lu Li\u2019s calm and composed attitude just crumble away.</p><br/><p>Li Qiang said, \u201cLook after them,\u201d after saying that, he left the area to attend to other things.</p><br/><p>In this situation, to get the \u2018scorpion\u2019 who rescued him previously was really tough. If he did not prepare what he was going to say, he was scared that it would be even harder to get out.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have you been kidnapped too?\u201d Lu Li looked at Lin Fan and said. It made him slightly more relaxed to be kidnapped with someone he knew, but he was still very uncertain about what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very calm and he said, \u201cNo idea, I was just kidnapped and that\u2019s it. Chairman Lu, you\u2019re a notable man, you can\u2019t possibly be scared right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li replied, \u201cAre you not scared? This could kill us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. What was there to be scared of?</p><br/><p>Lu Li nudged Lin Fan, \u201cDo you think they will kill us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cYea, I\u2019m certain they will kill us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d At this moment, Lu Li lost his cool. He had originally gotten rid of his feelings of fear, but at this moment, it all rushed back. He did not want to die.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d Lu Li shouted. Then he looked at the three kidnappers who were watching them and said, \u201cIf you let me go, I\u2019ll give you any amount of money that you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>The kidnapper fiercely scowled, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monstrous look immediately scared Lu Li. He obediently closed his mouth and the did not say a word. He could not help moving towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>After seeing this, Lin Fan felt a bit helpless. He did not think that the chairman was so cowardly. It was just some kidnappers and he was so scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy kidnapping brothers, are all your men here?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Lu Li who was close by to Lin Fan turned his head to look at him. He started to wonder what in the world he was doing. Why was he asking these kinds of questions?</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, keep talking and you\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d the bald kidnapper said as he turned around. His face had a very fierce appearance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMr. Kidnapper, don\u2019t be so rash. Do you not know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bald kidnapper replied, \u201cHmph, who cares who you are. You are in our midst right now, your life is ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and said, \u201cI just used my fingers to count. I calculated that today could have bloodshed and be disastrous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d the bald kidnapper said as he was losing his patience. If Lin Fan said another word of rubbish, he would point the gun at his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t say any more. Safety first,\u201d Lu Li nervously said.</p><br/><p>He started to feel like he did not know this Master Lin. If other people were kidnapped, they would be scared till they pissed their pants. But this b*stard was nothing like that, even daring to mess with the kidnappers. Is he trying to die?</p><br/><p>\u201cCourting death,\u201d the bald kidnapper said. His temperament was already very violent, then now, a person who was already taken the hostage, was being so impudent, it was hard for him to endure. He wanted to teach this b*stard a lesson.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Hu, don\u2019t touch him. Can you think about yourself? Looking at you, you have a fiendish look, but you have good fortune. This is something very few people in the world have. If you could find the right opportunity, you could definitely soar up. Money, power, anything you want. It\u2019s pity, pity\u2026 forget it. I won\u2019t say any more. I\u2019m just thinking out loud as I look at your face to read your fortune,\u201d Lin Fan shook his head and sighed, then did not say another word.</p><br/><p>The bald kidnapper originally wanted to teach this b*stard a good lesson. However, he did not think that this b*stard actually knew his name and then the trick he was trying to play at the end, sounded like he was trying to scare him.</p><br/><p>Chen Hu suspiciously looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled indifferently and said, \u201cWho am I? I am Master Lin. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can search it online, then you will know who I am.</p><br/><p>The two kidnappers next to him tried to deter him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to his rubbish, just watch them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Hu said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go online and check, you guys watch them,\u201d then he took out his phone and then went to search it. As he looked at the present news online, the way he looked at Lin Fan started to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are even a fortune teller.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan indifferently smiled and then closed his eyes. On the outside, it looked like he had no fear at all, but on the inside, he was thinking about what he was going to do.</p><br/><p>Chen Hu said, \u201cYou are a very talented little man. Now carefully explain to me the situation behind my appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan opened his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just your appearance. I can also see the appearances of the other two of you, Jin He and Wu Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two kidnappers were very alert in their watch of Lin Fan but when they heard their names, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know us?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a great danger emerged. They did not think that the opposition knew who they were. When the whole thing was done they definitely could not just leave them alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have such thoughts of killing me. I am the godly fortune teller. Once I see people, I know them already, it\u2019s such a simple thing. How about I see your futures also?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin He and Wu Wei looked at each other in dismay and thought that these two b*stards who were tied up could not do any harm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

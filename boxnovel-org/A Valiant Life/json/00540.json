He loved to stand up against injustice but he often got bullied by the kids around him because whenever the other kids gathered together to copy each other\u2019s homework, Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang would disappear all of a sudden. When he appeared again, he would be accompanied by a few adults.</p><br/><p>And those little devils that copy each other\u2019s homework would naturally give him a ferocious beating.</p><br/><p>But Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang would have a smile on his face because he would get praised once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all should learn from Lil\u2019 Fatty and do your own homework.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, Uncle has high expectations for you. In the future, if this kind of thing happens again, tell us. Uncle will buy some treats for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>From then on, Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang felt an increased responsibility on his shoulders because he was no longer alone. He had to supervise those guys and prevent them from copying each other\u2019s homework again.</p><br/><p>But because of this, Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang frequently got bullied. After being bullied several times, Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang felt like those adults were unable to protect him. In the end, he discovered Cloud Street\u2019s strongest individual. And that was Uncle Lin.</p><br/><p>If he could hang on to Uncle Lin, then none of the brats of Cloud Street would dare to bully him anymore.</p><br/><p>Uncle Lin, by himself, was stronger than a thousand men.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang\u2019s short little legs moved swiftly. \u201cMove aside, move aside, Uncle Lin is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan followed behind. His expression was stern but he was amused by Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding townsfolk heard that Master Lin was here, they all gave way and created a path for him. Although they were not shop owners here, they all knew that in Cloud Street, Master Lin was the most important person.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin was young, his standing and reputation in Cloud Street were exceptional.</p><br/><p>The shop owners gave way to him as well.</p><br/><p>Elder Chang was reprimanding two little girls but these two girls refused to back down. They had a sense of superiority and arrogance in the way they spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have a rat\u2019s a*s to do with you. This street belongs to your people. Our dogs can go wherever it wants,\u201d the taller girl said fiercely.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang nearly fainted from anger. He pointed at the two girls, \u201cWhy do you have to speak so crudely?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorter girl said, \u201cIf it\u2019s crude, then don\u2019t listen. Who\u2019s asking you to listen? Mind your own business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d Elder Liang was speechless. He never thought that there would still be people like that these days. They looked like they were people of good character but he never thought that despite their pleasant looks, they were so disgusting on the inside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what was going on. Auntie Gao was just cleaning the road, why would a conflict happen with the pedestrians?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Auntie Gao?\u201d Lin Fan went forward and asked. Then, he realized that there was a mark of five fingers on her cheek.</p><br/><p>Before Auntie Gao replied, Elder Liang said, \u201cLittle Boss, come and say something. How can these two ladies be so bad? Sister Gao was just reminding them to bring paper next time to clean up after their pet but the two of them didn\u2019t care about anything and just scolded her. Just now, when we weren\u2019t noticing, they went and scratched Sister Gao. Look at those finger marks on her face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the dog faeces on the floor, then looked at the slight red-eyed Auntie Gao. His gaze shifted towards the two girls and he said angrily, \u201cWhat are you girls trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The taller girl looked at Lin Fan and said disdainfully, \u201cHmph, another busybody. You\u2019re asking us what we\u2019re trying to do? That\u2019s what we should be asking you! Are we supposed to be responsible for our dog\u2019s feces? She\u2019s the road cleaner but she doesn\u2019t want to clean it. She even wants us to clean it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan maintained his cool. \u201cThis is your pet. Your pet is leaving feces everywhere, so you should be the ones cleaning after it. Auntie Gao isn\u2019t your personal cleaner.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorter girl refused to give in. She said, \u201cThis is the street, so she should clean it. If it weren\u2019t for us, would she even have this job?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the surrounding people heard this, they were in a rage. They had never come across people like these.</p><br/><p>Some of the men initially saw that these two ladies looked beautiful and thought they were like goddesses that were probably very shy as well. But now, they only had one thought in their minds, that these two girls were f*cking disgusting.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scolded, \u201cThe two of you, if it weren\u2019t for people like you, they could be doing more meaningful things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Little Boss is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Our Cloud Street has always welcomed people with good characters. Regardless of wealth, as long as someone has good character, we love to have them as guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is shameful. They don\u2019t even know how to repent.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was an endless stream of criticism. Everyone had joined in the act of criticising them.</p><br/><p>However, these two girls refused to back down. They weren\u2019t afraid of being condemned by the public. They kept their heads up and kept battling valiantly.</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao stopped Lin Fan, \u201cLittle Boss, forget it. Forget it. No need to quarrel anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie Gao, you keep our Cloud Street clean and sanitary. We won\u2019t let you suffer. Don\u2019t worry. Then, Lin Fan shifted his gaze to the two girls, \u201cYou two are girls and we have different levels of experience. Apologize to Auntie Ga, clean up your dog feces and leave. We don\u2019t welcome you here and not a single shop will do business with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two girls laughed coldly, \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as these words were said, the surrounding shop owners responded together.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s our boss. Whatever he says goes. Not a single shop in Cloud Street will do business with the two of you. And we don\u2019t welcome you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Doing business with people of your kind of character is simply shameful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo young, yet such disgusting personalities. You really can\u2019t judge someone by appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve all heard what Little Boss said. If anyone does business with these two girls from now on, they aren\u2019t our neighbors anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two girls had erupted as well. They never thought that they\u2019d come across such a situation. Then, one of the raised her voice and said, \u201cWhat are you all trying to do? What rights do you have? How many houses do you have in Shanghai? Let me tell you, people like you will go bankrupt sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou outsiders come to Shanghai to look for a living like beggars and you still dare to scold us. Do you even have homes? What rights do you have to talk to us this way?</p><br/><p>The shorter girl said, \u201cJust talking to you all is already giving you guy face.\u201d</p><br/><p>The taller girl pointed at Lin Fan. Her face, with smoky makeup around her eyes, was initially very beautiful but now, she looked hideous as she pointed at Lin Fan. She snarled, \u201cAnd you, mind your own business. Since you have free time, go and see your girlfriend. She\u2019s probably cheating on you without you knowing. Someone like you can only be a fallback guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Gan grabbed the taller girl\u2019s fingerburstand a cracking sound rang out.</p><br/><p>A horrible shriek emanated from the girl\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>They never thought that Little Boss would make a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you uttering? Don\u2019t think that you can be impudent just because I don\u2019t hit girls. Let me tell you, I\u2019ll hit everyone who deserves to be hit like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The taller girl was still screaming horribly. She squatted down as she held onto her finger. Tears were flowing down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>Two pet dogs barked frantically at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram,\u201d Lin Fan glared at them and the two pet dogs backed off while whining.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Dog Nicholas charged into the scene and barked at the two pet dog as he bared his teeth. When the two pet dogs saw Elder Dog Nicholas, they started to shrink back even more.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog\u2019s breath burst out!</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>The two dogs immediately lay on the floor motionlessly, burying their heads in the ground.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas barked, \u201cYou two invaders dare to be so impudent in my territory. I, Elder Dog, will f*ck you up, do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorter girl saw that her friend had been attacked, so she came at Lin Fan with claws brandished and fangs bared.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even look. He flicked his hand out, slapping the shorter girl and causing her to fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Cloud Street. It\u2019s not a place for you to be impudent. You have the nerve to say that I\u2019m being cheated on? You must be asking for death,\u201d Lin Fan said angrily.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cThey said you were being cheated on. Do you even have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. \u201cNo, but I only needed a reason to strike them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was helpless.</p><br/><p>But on this day, Little Boss had given them a very different feeling. It was f*cking domineering.</p><br/><p>Some of the young men were stunned. These two were goddesses but Little Boss struck them however he wanted, mercilessly. It was simply terrifying.</p></div>\n</div>"}

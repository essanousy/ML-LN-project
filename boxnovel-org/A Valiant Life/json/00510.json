We don\u2019t have to care about them.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was afraid that his teacher would be gloomy and be affected by the discussions on the Internet, so he was comforting his teacher, hoping that his teacher wouldn\u2019t be bothered by it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said cheerily, \u201cYou think too much, Ming Qing. Do you think I\u2019d be bothered by it? Let\u2019s not talk for now. Some idiot is arguing with me again. I have to take care of him. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head gently, clearly embarrassed. \u201cTeacher, you really do care. If you didn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be quarreling with them,\u201d he thought to himself.</p><br/><p>The masses of netizens saw Master Lin\u2019s behavior towards the troll and were stunned. Shouldn\u2019t all godly doctors be of noble character and prestige, and have light temperaments? But this godly doctor wasn\u2019t the same. He directly scolded the opposition without a shred of calmness.</p><br/><p>At times, when he was at the climax of his flaming, Lin Fan thought of using his computer skills to hack the opposition\u2019s computer. However, it was just a thought. That wasn\u2019t a good behavior and he definitely couldn\u2019t do that.</p><br/><p>If those Internet police uncles came to his door, it would end tragically.</p><br/><p>After that, he decided to ignore that troll. He started to immerse himself in writing the teaching materials again. Initially, he had wanted to put it off for a while but the situation now made him very pissed. If he didn\u2019t produce the teaching materials as soon as possible, it wouldn\u2019t be right.</p><br/><p>Now that Lin Fan had stood out, the public opinion changed dramatically. After all, the godly doctor\u2019s reputation on Weibo was great.</p><br/><p>In the Chinese medical world, no one expressed any opinions. They all watched from the side and waited for the teaching materials to be produced before they would say anything.</p><br/><p>If one doesn\u2019t cause jealousy, it means that person is only mediocre. Although Lin Fan was a godly doctor, there were many people in the Chinese medical world that didn\u2019t like him. Of course, Lin Fan\u2019s ability was too great. They would have to be idiots to jump out at him now.</p><br/><p>However, the matter was complicated. Even a godly doctor may not be able to produce good teaching materials. It wouldn\u2019t be too late to flame Lin Fan after the teaching materials were produced if they don\u2019t meet the requirements.</p><br/><p>They had even thought about how they would flame him already.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because your medical skills are great doesn\u2019t mean you can write teaching materials. Old teaching materials are old teaching materials, we won\u2019t allow this blasphemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had thought that things would be peaceful. He had never thought that the descendants of those old Chinese doctors would come out clamoring.</p><br/><p>Among them, a person named Wu Xi Jun was the fiercest and he flamed Lin Fan multiple times.</p><br/><p>\u201c@Master Lin, you\u2019re a godly doctor, your medical skills are supreme, that we admit. However, what do you mean by your words yesterday? Our grandfathers put their blood and sweat into writing China\u2019s first teaching materials and they\u2019ve been used until today. They\u2019ve nurtured countless Chinese medical masters. What do you mean by that last sentence you said? Are you trying to say that there are problems with our grandfathers\u2019 teaching materials? You can see their contributions to Chinese medicine but you don\u2019t want to admit it. Although my grandfather isn\u2019t around anymore, I can still sue you for slander.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens responded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is well said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what the Godly Doctor meant. You all have misunderstood him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I dislike the poster very much, this does make sense. Those old Chinese doctors put their blood and sweat into producing our nation\u2019s first Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials. That\u2019s a huge contribution and it can\u2019t be taken for granted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor these old teaching materials to have been used for several decades, they must be outstanding. Furthermore, there can\u2019t be any issues with these teaching materials, otherwise, they would\u2019ve been discovered by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like Director Zhao Ming Qing has discovered those issues. That\u2019s why he wants to replace them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t. How can the current Chinese doctors even compare to the past? The masters of the past dedicated their heart and souls to Chinese medicine, unlike these Chinese doctors nowadays who only cause so much trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Xu Jun saw that the public opinion on the Internet was gradually shifting and he couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.</p><br/><p>This was exactly what he wanted. If the old teaching materials were to really be replaced, it would have a great impact on them. Although the impact wouldn\u2019t be great at first, who knew what would happen in future?</p><br/><p>Several years?</p><br/><p>Ten years?</p><br/><p>When that time comes, how would they use their grandfathers\u2019 reputation to monopolize the Chinese Medical Academies\u2019 treatment equipment?</p><br/><p>There were many people nowadays who worked in this field. The competition was intense. It was only because they had this relationship with their grandfathers that some of the leaders took care of them.</p><br/><p>After all, their grandfathers had indeed made great contributions to Chinese medicine. Some of the leaders only opened doors for them because of this.</p><br/><p>Wu Xi Jun clamored once again, \u201c@Master Lin, we can forget what you said but we wish for you to apologize to us. At the same time, it would also be an apology to our grandfathers.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a long while, Lin Fan didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>The netizens\u2019 imaginations started to run wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Master Lin having a guilty conscience. Is he not speaking because he knows that he\u2019s in the wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuilty conscience my a*s! Do you know who our Master Lin is? He isn\u2019t someone who can be made to feel guilty by this idiots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Master Lin just doesn\u2019t want to stoop to his level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin possesses noble integrity. He isn\u2019t at the same level as that kind of person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that this person is right. What Master Lin said at first was wrong and he should apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor those teachings materials written by their ancestors to have lasted so long, they must have commendable aspects.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some time later.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>The netizens were all stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, hurry up and take a look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. This is nature-defying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ha! He\u2019s trying to cause trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker. I take back what I said earlier. Master Lin doesn\u2019t possess noble integrity nor is he of a higher level than others. He is someone who would slap other people in the face with the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god, this is going to cause the earth to shake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t back down. This guy was really too greedy. Initially, Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to care about him but he never thought that this guy would challenge him. Lin Fan couldn\u2019t stand it. He couldn\u2019t stand it at all.</p><br/><p>He respected those old Chinese doctors very much. After all, they had made contributions to Chinese medicine education back in their era. But these grandsons and descendants were absurd.</p><br/><p>It seemed he had no choice but to confront them.</p><br/><p>He immediately went to Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Centre and asked Zhao Ming Qing for the Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials. Then, he read through it quickly and picked out all the problems within.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cFirst page, first section, The Importance of Chinese Medical Theory. There is a mistake here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis part, I have to say is complete nonsense. Chinese Medical Theory is, if said a little more bluntly, nonsense. It is only the whole of Chinese medicine that is useful. Why can\u2019t the current Chinese medicine compare with the previous generation\u2019s? That\u2019s because there are too many people bound by convention. Nowadays, in the Chinese medical world, all they talk about is theory. They\u2019ve already forgotten that the most important part of Chinese medicine is having effective treatments and medicine. Our ancestors have gone through thousands of years of practice to confirm countless methods but is there anyone still confirming the effectiveness of medicine now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of offending anyone either. These days, many theories in the Chinese medicine foundational teaching materials are mistaken. And many old Chinese doctors know this in their hearts but they aren\u2019t willing to say so openly. After all, most teaching plans are written by Chinese medical theory professors and Chinese medical experts, how could they not know of these mistakes? They know but they aren\u2019t willing to change them because that would be slapping themselves in the face. They are afraid of being humiliated. That\u2019s why they won\u2019t admit that their theories are wrong, nor will they admit that they have taught their students wrongly. Hence, they all try to safeguard these mistaken theories.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first Chinese medical masterpiece of our country, \u2018Qing Yuan Medical Book\u2019, has already been distributed for thousands of years. Now, countless Chinese doctors treat it as a treasure and study Chinese medicine from it. What I want to say is, have your brains all short-circuited? I won\u2019t admit that it is a masterpiece but I will admit that it is a Chinese medicine introductory book that has brought many people to Chinese medicine. Now, people worship our ancestors too highly and feel that the current generation cannot compare to our ancestors. The decline of Chinese medicine has much to do with this. People are not thinking about how to forge forward. They don\u2019t know which direction to go with Chinese medicine so they stay in the same spot. They keep studying our ancestors\u2019 knowledge and never think about whether it is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said a bit much but there is no hurry. There will be more. I\u2019ll slowly say more.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Lin Fan had erupted. He wanted to give this group of fellas a good lesson.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have the Encyclopedia, he might have thought the same as those guys but since he received the Encyclopedia\u2019s knowledge, he had a clear goal.</p></div>\n</div>"}

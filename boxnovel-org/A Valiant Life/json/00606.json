Meanwhile, Liu Xu was displeased but in front of everyone, she acted normally.</p><br/><p>When no one was noticing, Liu Xu\u2019s expression changed instantly. Her face was pale as she said, \u201cDo you feel very good pinching me?\u201d</p><br/><p>While walking over, Liu Xu felt as if her waist had almost been pinched broken by that b*stard.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t thought that things would turn out like this. If she had known earlier, she wouldn\u2019t have thought of this idea even if she had to die.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded with a face full of smiles. \u201cMmm, what nonsense are you saying? Of course, it feels good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d Liu Xu laughed coldly. \u201d Alright, you win this time. But we aren\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan made a shushing sound and said, \u201cBe quiet. Don\u2019t let anyone discover about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang came over at this moment. \u201cBrother, you\u2026I don\u2019t quite understand this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cWhat do you not understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang leaned over to Lin Fan\u2019s ear and said, \u201cWhen did you get together with this girl? Why don\u2019t I know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang and blinked a few times. Wang Ming Yang was able to tell what Lin Fan wanted to say just by looking. At that moment, he realized that his brother was trying to send a message to him using his eyes.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t find himself stupid. He thought for a moment and instantly understood.</p><br/><p>So that was it.</p><br/><p>He understood. He finally understood.</p><br/><p>The banquet hall wasn\u2019t small. It was enough to contain so many people.</p><br/><p>The shop owners of Cloud Street were gasping in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is really luxurious. I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to leech off Little Boss\u2019s fortune. Otherwise, how else would we be able to come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this is expensive, isn\u2019t it? Just a meal here would probably cost you around ten thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be that scary? It\u2019s not like every dish is so expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan entered. He raised his voice and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, eat as you like today. Order whatever you want. It\u2019s Chief Liu\u2019s opening ceremony today and she\u2019s feeling very proud. No need to be modest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, is that really true? The dishes here are expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s follow Chief Liu\u2019s arrangements then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>All of Lin Fan\u2019s contacts in Shanghai had been called over because of Liu Xu. If he didn\u2019t do something about it, he would feel sorry for himself. Moreover, the shop owners of Cloud Street had always been busy with work and had no time to enjoy their lives. Today, they had the rare chance of coming to this luxurious place. If Lin Fan didn\u2019t let them enjoy themselves to their utmost, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stepped forward and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Chief Liu has a very good relationship with your Little Boss. It\u2019s just a meal. Chief Liu can afford it. Furthermore, you guys know how capable your Little Boss is. Do you think he\u2019d be short of money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s true. It would be a waste not to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Little Boss. At that moment, Little Boss had one hand around Liu Xu\u2019s waist. They seemed really intimate. They heaved a breath of relief. They knew about Little Boss\u2019s character.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cToday, you don\u2019t need to be courteous. If you are still doubtful, why don\u2019t I get Chief Liu to say a word? Chief Liu, what do you have to say\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu had an urge to pin Lin Fan to the wall. This guy was really too despicable. However, she couldn\u2019t be angry at that moment. She had to resist it. Resist it.</p><br/><p>She had come to Shanghai from Jiangning in order to take her revenge on this Little Boss. However, she eventually gave up. She had changed her mind, deciding not to go back to Jiangning and be under the control of her father. She decided to stay in Shanghai, work hard, and make a living for herself.</p><br/><p>Right now, there were many people looking at her. That guy could afford to be embarrassed but she couldn\u2019t. Then, she smiled and said, \u201cMmm, today is the opening ceremony. Everyone, you may eat as you like. After eating, there\u2019s even a KTV upstairs where you can sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liu Xu said this, the shop owners started smiling delightedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, Chief Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, not only did we not bring presents but we\u2019ll also be eating and drinking for free. That is a little embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the crowd being so happy, Lin Fan smiled as well. Then, he turned to Liu Xu. \u201cChief Xu, you really are generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu looked at Lin Fan and forced a smile. \u201cHehe, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just several hundreds of thousands.\u201d</p><br/><p>But it really was several hundreds of thousands. She wasn\u2019t earning a single cent. Many of the dishes were made with expensive ingredients. If they were charging money, each dish would cost at least a thousand dollars.</p><br/><p>While the shop owners of Cloud Street were eating in the banquet hall, Lin Fan and the rest went to the private room upstairs.</p><br/><p>There was a big table that was just enough for everybody to have a seat.</p><br/><p>This table was a custom-made one. It cost several tens of thousands.</p><br/><p>Although Wu You Lan and Wu Huan Yue were rivals, they were usually very peaceful when they interacted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what\u2019s going on between that Chief Liu and Brother Lin?\u201d asked Wu Huan Yue. When she had seen Brother Lin hold onto Liu Xu\u2019s waist, she felt a little jealous.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain. You haven\u2019t been on Cloud Street, so you don\u2019t know the full situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to be there, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan waved her hand. \u201cI know, I know. A celebrity is very busy. But there is a little conflict between Liu Xu and Brother Lin. Didn\u2019t you see how they were trying to sabotage each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu You Lan was stunned. Sabotage each other? What did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019ll know if you keep looking,\u201d said Wu You Lan with a laugh. She wasn\u2019t jealous at all. Perhaps it was because she knew that Liu Xu was only interested in women or perhaps it was something else, but she wasn\u2019t worried at all.</p><br/><p>During the feast.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu pulled on Lin Fan. \u201cSorry, everyone. I have to leave for a while.\u201d Then, she looked at Lin Fan. Her meaning was clear: Come with me.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou guys have fun on your own. This woman has many issues.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Everyone laughed. \u201cWe understand, Master Lin. Go on, go on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside. In the toilet.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu immediately struggled free from Lin Fan\u2019s grip. Her expression turned cold as she said, \u201cHmph. I never thought that the famous Godly Doctor Lin would take advantage of others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cWhat? Is this not okay? Am I allowed to be taken advantage of but not allowed to take advantage of others? It\u2019s just several tens of tables. If you can\u2019t afford it, I\u2019ll just pay for it after this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu\u2019s face turned pale with rage. She knew that she couldn\u2019t win Lin Fan in a fight but she could send a kick flying straight at Lin Fan\u2019s balls.</p><br/><p>Was that what she had been talking about?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we are even on this matter. I screwed you up once and you screwed me up once. Help me to carry on this act. However, you cannot keep holding onto me. If you hold onto me again, I\u2019ll pinch your balls until they burst. Do you believe me?\u201d said Liu Xu. She was already on the verge of falling apart. This guy had been holding her waist the whole time and his hand had been pinching her waist region the whole time too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cNo. They\u2019re all very smart. If we don\u2019t make it seem more real, they\u2019ll definitely see through it. I think you should just bear with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off. You\u2019re too despicable.\u201d Liu Xu immediately entered the female toilet. When she closed the door, she leaned on the wall and her face turned red. But she recovered to her normal state quickly. She had never expected herself to be taken advantage of by this guy. D*mn it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t afraid of being embarrassed, I wouldn\u2019t want to hold onto a fake woman like you,\u201d Lin Fan reproached. Then, he left.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu, who was in the toilet, clenched her soft and tender fists. \u201cD*mn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the fake woman! Your whole family is made up of fake women!</p></div>\n</div>"}

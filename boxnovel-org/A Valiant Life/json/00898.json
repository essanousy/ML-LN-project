Who on Earth is so bored to play such a prank?</em></p><br/><p>But when he thought about the angling major classification of knowledge, he knew that it couldn\u2019t be so simple. After all, it even had the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost. Could it be that this bra had really come from the future?</p><br/><p>He could fish up things from the future?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing saw the stunned expression on his teacher\u2019s face and he thought that his teacher couldn\u2019t believe he had fished up a bra for his first try. Then, he tried to comfort Lin Fan, \u201cTeacher, there are all kinds of things in these waters. It\u2019s perfectly normal. In the past, I\u2019ve even fished up a pot before\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Zhao Ming Qing. <em>Even if you\u2019re trying to comfort me, that\u2019s not the way to do it. A pot? Why don\u2019t you fish one up for me to see?</em></p><br/><p>Then, he threw the bra back into the water. \u201cLet\u2019s continue. This was just a single mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>But what Lin Fan didn\u2019t know was that that bra which had submerged into the water was slowly disappearing as if it had never appeared before.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at the small fish in his hand and shook his head before letting it go. \u201cThis fish is too small. It\u2019s better to let it continue enjoying its freedom.</p><br/><p>Many people fish not to get fish but just as an enjoyment.</p><br/><p>If they manage to catch small fish, they would let them go. If they catch a big fish, they would take a photo as a souvenir before letting it go too. This was because they didn\u2019t need fish but just enjoyed the sense of anticipation when fishing and the sense of achievement when they catch something.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>While they were fishing, something major happened at Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chinese Medicine Studies Grade 2.</p><br/><p>A group of students had gathered together and their expressions were all unpleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? Our Director Zhao has been replaced?\u201d a short and stout student asked in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he has been replaced. This news hasn\u2019t been announced yet. I heard the teachers discussing it when I went to the office.\u201d The know-it-all female student was in a terrible mood. She loved Director Zhao. To her, Director Zhao was the kindest Academy Director.</p><br/><p>At times, when she came across problems that she did not understand, she would go looking for the Director and the Director would seriously answer her queries. And in the school, if there were students who could not afford to pay for their school fees because their families were poor, the Director would exempt them from having to pay the fees. He would even lend personal assistance to those students to solve any problems they might face.</p><br/><p>To the students, Director Zhao was a very good person. He had a great character.</p><br/><p>Now that they heard that he was being replaced, they couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><br/><p>One person spread the news to ten people and ten spread to a hundred. This news became widely known amongst the students very soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys hear that the Director is going to be replaced? The new Director is going through the procedures now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What on Earth is going on? Director Zhao was doing so well, why would he be replaced?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWas Director Zhao promoted? The Director developed the leukemia prescription with Master Lin, he must have been promoted because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPromoted my a*s. I heard that he was demoted to an outcast academy to be the director there. Who the hell decided all this? Does that person have a brain problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to this school because of Director Zhao. I love listening to Director Zhao\u2019s lectures. Now that he isn\u2019t around anymore, what\u2019s the point of staying? Even if I become a delivery boy outside, I\u2019d rather do that than stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s protest! We have to take Director Zhao back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will we protest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to find reporters, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The students were all discussing this incident. Some of the students who had connections had actively contacted reporters and described the entire situation to them.</p><br/><p>To the reporters, this was a huge incident.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Director Zhao had participated in the development of the leukemia prescription and his contribution had been invaluable. Now that he was being moved from his appointment and he wasn\u2019t even being promoted, there was a problem.</p><br/><p>Within the reporters\u2019 circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys hear? The Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s Director Zhao is being demoted.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI heard it. And according to my research, the new director is a Chinese medical professor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. With Director Zhao\u2019s contributions, how could he be demoted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must not know. This is called killing the chicken to warn the monkeys. Master Lin publicized the prescription instead of handing it to the higher-ups and this caused resentment. However, they couldn\u2019t do anything to Master Lin, so they took it out on his student.\u201d</p><br/><p>D*mn, that\u2019s lowly of them. We have to report this and expose them. Let\u2019s use the media to find justice for Director Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go to Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy right now to interview some people. Let\u2019s find out what exactly is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>By the river.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing caught a small fish every ten minutes or so.</p><br/><p>But on Lin Fan\u2019s side, it was a little f*cked up. Half an hour had passed but he hadn\u2019t even caught a shadow of a fish. This didn\u2019t make any f*cking sense. Could it be that all the fishes on his side had gone over to his student\u2019s side?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Teacher, that\u2019s a little strange. Why haven\u2019t any fishes taken your bait even after so long?\u201d asked Zhao Ming Qing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan was helpless. \u201cIf you ask me, who am I supposed to ask? There\u2019s no hurry. I\u2019ll keep waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, a ripple appeared on the water surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, something is happening on your side.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing had been observing the situation on his teacher\u2019s side the whole time. He felt that it was a little weird. His teacher\u2019s bait was perfectly fine, why hadn\u2019t any fish taken it?</p><br/><p>Just as he had been thinking about that, there was finally some activity.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very curious. He wondered what he would reel in this time.</p><br/><p><em>Just don\u2019t let it be a f*cking bra. Otherwise, this major classification of knowledge would be rubbish.</em></p><br/><p>It felt quite light, like a small object.</p><br/><p>Without exerting too much energy, he raised the fishing rod.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>Lin Fan cursed in his heart as he looked from afar. <em>Isn\u2019t that a f*cking bunch of grass?</em></p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was dumbfounded. What was up with his teacher? Could it be that he had done some sort of unspeakable act? Why was it that all he fished up was such rubbish?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p><em>It can\u2019t be that he offended the legendary River God and got cursed to never catch any fish in his life, right?</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan was annoyed. He pulled the fishing line in. but when he took a closer look, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was the same as they both exclaimed simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cRed sage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Why would there be red sage in the water? It isn\u2019t suitable for it to live down there. It can\u2019t be that someone threw this red sage into the river, right?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing muttered. However, when he took a closer look, he was even more puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, look at those roots. Why are there nine green lines? Could it be rotten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was very familiar with Chinese medicine. With one look, it was clearly red sage but then, something wasn\u2019t quite right. Those green lines were very strange.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was stunned. He had recognized what it was.</p><br/><p>It was red sage indeed, but it was a ninety-year-old red sage.</p><br/><p>Red sage was typically harvested two or three years after planting. But this ninety-year-old red sage was something he had never seen before.</p><br/><p>Could it be that it came from another world?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

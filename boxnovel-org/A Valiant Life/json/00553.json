There was also a need to create an exercise program for the children. Lin Fan didn\u2019t know how to do any of these, but luckily for him, Director Huang knew everything and this just came naturally to her.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to settle many things after this. All he had to do was to come occasionally to play with the children and teach the kids a little.</p><br/><p>They also had to contact the Ministry of Education to make sure that the syllabus that the children were undergoing kept in step with the other schools so that when the children graduated, they could integrate well with the children from the other schools.</p><br/><p>There were many things to settle and everything had to be planned well.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t settle that, the children would not have the necessary qualifications to advance in their studies, but it was still early, and there was no need for rushing now.</p><br/><p>In the silence, deep into the night.</p><br/><p>At a random warehouse, a limousine stopped there.</p><br/><p>The five youngsters were smiling on the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is so exciting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say? This is our final destination. When does the live stream begin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start it now. Cover all your faces, make sure you guys don\u2019t expose them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, that isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>In some live broadcast channel.</p><br/><p>When the live broadcast started, a large group of people joined immediately.</p><br/><p>But all these viewers didn\u2019t send any gifts at all, and instead, started raging in the chat group.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mother, you five doggies. If you have enough balls, come and tell me your address. I\u2019ll go over to f*ck you guys up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow disgusting. How dare you even call yourselves Chinese?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody dogs. I\u2019ll make sure to skin you guys alive if I get the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The comments covered the whole screen of the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>The five youngsters all started laughing. They covered their faces, hiding from the camera. \u201cHello everyone, I am Zhong Tian Hao the Second. I\u2019m currently wearing the imperial navy\u2019s uniform of the Imperial Nippon Army. Today I brought a few of my friends and we decided to let you guys see how we professionally trespass a landmark.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d One of the other youngsters grabbed the phone impatiently. \u201cTo all our supporters, I am Chun Tian. What I am wearing now is the other type of navy uniform of the Imperial Nippon Army. I hope you guys are welcoming.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the netizens who were in the live broadcast room were all about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome my ass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are just looking for trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet f*cked by dogs. If I know who you guys are, I\u2019ll kill all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys have no morals at all. Dog f*ckers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The live broadcast chat was filled with rage, but the five youngsters didn\u2019t care at all.</p><br/><p>Another one of the youngsters took the phone, speaking to it. \u201cMy fellow netizens, you guys are just keyboard warriors, but you guys are lucky to be able to witness our one week challenge, and the results have exceeded our expectations. At this point, I want to pause and thank our sponsors for helping us with all the food and drinks and equipment needed. There were many people around here and it was more exciting breaking in compared to stealing a well lid, although the number of people walking around now is lesser. I, Zhong Chun Hao the Second have conquered this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, we know that you guys hate us and want to look for us, except that you\u2019ll probably never find us. We\u2019ll let you see where we are, but you guys are just thinking too much. We will be gone by the time anything happens. We will take pictures here and at the same time paint some graffiti over the place. We plan on painting the walls to leave our mark here. Alright, we won\u2019t talk anymore, let\u2019s get to action.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the youngsters who didn\u2019t appear in the live broadcast smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I guarantee that I\u2019ll take the best shots of you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of people who were watching the live broadcast numbered around a hundred thousand, and all there was in the chat section was endless scolding and death threats. However, there were some who still praised them for what they were doing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At some supper place.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, you\u2019re such a prude. You drank so much with me, now I can\u2019t drive back anymore,\u201d Lin Fan downed another shot of alcohol. After leaving the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, he had received Wang Ming Yang\u2019s call for a meet up after so long.</p><br/><p>It was about time since they hadn\u2019t met up for quite some time. It was an offer that he didn\u2019t want to refuse.</p><br/><p>He never thought that Wang Ming Yang would be such an alcoholic that day. Both of them had a whole bucket of beer and Lin Fan was on the verge of puking.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cHaha, this is once in a while. I haven\u2019t seen you in a very long time and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to do this again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them were leaning on each other as they stumbled down the street. Behind them was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s private driver, following closely behind them, who could not help laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep on drinking? If I drink one more gulp, I may just puke. Right, what has Wu Huan Yue been up to lately? She always calls me up to tell me about her problems and I\u2019m too busy to even have any time to eat,\u201d Lin Fan said, chuckling.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted Lin Fan on the shoulders. \u201cAre you distressed on the inside? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll ask,\u201d Lin Fan shook his head, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she just become even more popular? All she has to do is to brush up her presence on stage. But really, the album of songs that you wrote for her is just too awesome. She even got the award for the best album some time back. Do you think she can start branching out into acting?\u201d Wang Ming Wang asked. With his money and Lin Fan\u2019s songwriting skills, it was a lethal combination that could propel her to stardom.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me that? You can start anytime, and you can do it as many times as you like. But don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re thinking of switching industries. I thought your real estate business is doing pretty well?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cBrother, I\u2019ve got to admit that this real estate business isn\u2019t lucrative enough. I\u2019ve got to find something new and I think that this entertainment business can go together with the real estate business. I call it the entertainment-real estate business. What do you think?\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me that. I have no idea at all,\u201d Lin Fan waved his hands. He didn\u2019t know anything about the business lingo that Wang Ming Yang was using.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang put his arms around Lin Fan\u2019s neck. \u201cNo, I trust you. If you say it can work, it means it can work. If you think otherwise, I will follow your instruction. As long as you\u2026 you support me, I will be able to start doing. If you\u2026 you don\u2019t support me, I won\u2019t have motivation to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, are you trying to strangle me? Wait till you see my 18 palms of the descending dragon technique,\u201d Lin Fan said, waving his hands around haphazardly. Wang Ming Yang laughed, also mimicking a martial arts move. \u201cMoney plucking plum technique!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, stand still,\u201d Lin Fan said, looking at Wang Ming Yang running forward. Lin Fan started picking up his pace to catch up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang started laughing loudly, his hands doing a celebratory dance. \u201cIf you can catch me, I\u2019ll piggyback you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re on,\u201d Lin Fan said, chasing from the back.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s driver started panicking as he saw Wang Ming Yang and Lin Fan run off. \u201cPresident Wang, Master Lin, please slow down. The car is parked here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them didn\u2019t pay any attention to the driver, and the driver looked on helplessly. All he could do now was start the car as he continued to follow them.</p><br/><p>He never thought that President Wang who was strict on a daily basis would become such a buffoon with Master Lin. If he wasn\u2019t his personal driver, he would have never been able to see this for himself.</p></div>\n</div>"}

However, now that the show has officially started, there wouldn\u2019t be too big of an influence.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t know why, whenever Zhao Li pressed the selection button, the audience would jeer.</p><br/><p>This jeering made Zhao Li very unhappy, but she couldn\u2019t do anything. She couldn\u2019t rage at the audience.</p><br/><p>However, the most awkward thing happened. There was a contestant that was chosen by Zhao Li only, but the contestant immediately rejected her.</p><br/><p>Even though she didn\u2019t say anything, everyone understood that this contestant either didn\u2019t respect Zhao Li at all, or she was afraid that she\u2019d get scammed by her.</p><br/><p>After all, her reputation wasn\u2019t good so no one would be willing to be her student.</p><br/><p>Every contestant that has been selected by her before even had the thought of dying. They originally wanted to hold Zhao Li by her leg and take flight. However, they were thrown off mid-flight.</p><br/><p>In particular, Zhang Chi was the most remorseful. She just wanted to go back in time to let Zhao Li choose once more.</p><br/><p>She swore that if she were to be given another chance, she would definitely choose Master Lin and not Zhao Li.</p><br/><p>After being abandoned by her student, Zhao Li\u2019s expression became gloomy. Everyone could tell that she was unhappy.</p><br/><p>She was extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>The show ended.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was getting ready to leave, the deputy stage manager rushed over in a hurry. Before he said anything, he grabbed hold of Lin Fan\u2019s hand, with an expression of gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I can\u2019t thank you enough for not putting Zhao Li in a spot during the show. If not, my show wouldn\u2019t be able to go on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could the deputy stage manager not be grateful? He knew Master Lin\u2019s personality was one of fearlessness. If he wanted to make a scene, nobody would be able to stop him.</p><br/><p>Hence, when the competition ended, he waited for him to thank him face to face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I was actually thinking of making it difficult for her, however, after I thought about it, I decided to forget it. You guys have a good television lineup here in Shanghai, and I wouldn\u2019t want to make it difficult for you guys as well.</p><br/><p>The deputy stage manager thanked him profusely, \u201cThank you, Master Lin. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>From a distance.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li looked at the deputy stage manager talking to Lin Fan. Flames could be seen in her eyes. She clenched her fist tightly.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong stood beside her, and said, \u201cI think that you should go and talk to him, or else it\u2019d be a huge problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li sneered, \u201cTalk to him? Where\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that. If he were to give you a bad time on stage, it\u2019d be hard for you to get off. Moreover, this would definitely be on the news, and by then, it\u2019ll be too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li became depressed. She knew that what Liu Ying Dong said made sense. However, it was impossible that she would bow down to that fellow.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll first take my leave.\u201d The deputy stage manager said contently. He knew the answer now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles and waved at him, \u201cHave a safe journey home.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing the deputy stage manager leave, Lin Fan also prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d Zhao Li shouted from behind.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cTeacher Zhao, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was momentarily silent, \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t quite understand you.\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously. He was putting up a confused act.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li looked at Lin Fan. Put up a show! Continue to put up a show! Right now, she was in a bad situation, and so she had to calm down her tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit defeat. But right now, both of us are mentors. Before today, we haven\u2019t even seen eye to eye before, but is there a need to direct everything at me?\u201d Zhao Li said.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy for her to have reached where she was right now. She would definitely not abandon everything thus far even if they asked her to do so.</p><br/><p>She originally thought that being on good terms with Ying Jin would bring her further in her career. But who would\u2019ve thought that Ying Jin would be made miserable by this b*stard in front of her?</p><br/><p>At this time, most of the news online were regarding the dirty secrets. If she wanted to let this news die down, she would have to wait quite awhile.</p><br/><p>But during this time, who knows what could happen?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said innocently, \u201cTeacher Zhao, please don\u2019t wrongly accuse me. I, Lin Fan, has never targeted anybody. You must be mistaken. However, I never expected that you, Teacher Zhao, being a mentor, would have such an unbearable dark history. What kind of influence do you think this would have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that nothing is happening to you right now. Before long, something big would happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li stared at Lin Fan, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll just explain it to you. Right now, Ying Jin is trying to make some public relations, but you, on the other hand, aren\u2019t doing anything. When Ying Jin\u2019s public relations are done well enough, the tides would turn, and by then, you wouldn\u2019t be able to run away. Hence, I suggested that you should find a way to explain yourself. From what I can see, the underhanded methods used were led by Ying Jing. Hence, you should quickly turn the tides again in order to lessen the damage to you. You might even be able to get some sympathy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zhao Li\u2019s expression turned sullen. She didn\u2019t expect that this fellow would ask her to backstab Ying Jin. How much hate would she get in return?</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao. You are too foolish. If I wanted to mess with you, do you think you would be able to get off the stage?\u201d Lin Fan asked rhetorically. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I won\u2019t say any more. You can go and think about it. With your current position, it\u2019s nearly impossible for you to be on par with Ying Jin. If she were to threaten you, there\u2019d be nothing you can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Lin Fan immediately left.</p><br/><p>He felt rather evil that he would actually put the idea to drive a wedge between them.</p><br/><p>If Zhao Li were to stab Ying Jin in the back, that would be very pleasurable.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t know that if it\u2019d be successful. But he was rather confident that it would be.</p><br/><p>What does friendship mean in times of personal danger like this? One would definitely want to protect oneself before all else.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li stood rooted to the ground and just stared at Lin Fan. She was convinced by Lin Fan but she wasn\u2019t foolish.</p><br/><p>If she were really to do that, she wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to go to either.</p><br/><p>But what that fellow said made sense as well. Ying Jin was, in fact, making public relations. Even though the effects weren\u2019t obvious, but if one day the public relations were to be successful, she was afraid that only she\u2019d be left.</p><br/><p>But till then, who would be able to help her?</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong walked about from the dark, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li shook her head, \u201cHe didn\u2019t say much.\u201d</p><br/><p>She shouldn\u2019t talk about this matter for now. She would think about it when she got back.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t to say that such a matter didn\u2019t happen within this circle before. There were many examples of backstabbing.</p><br/><p>However, this time around, the person that she wanted to backstab was very powerful. She was a senior in the music industry, Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t turn the tides around, she was afraid that there would be a very tragic ending for her. She had to think about it carefully. She couldn\u2019t be careless.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Li experienced a little bit of a headache. All she could think of was going back early to think about it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got down from his car whilst humming. He was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, something bad happened.</p><br/><p>There were ten over burly men standing in front of him. They were all glaring intently at him.</p><br/><p>Whatever was coming wouldn\u2019t be good.</p></div>\n</div>"}

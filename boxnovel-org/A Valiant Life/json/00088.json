They just come here asking for $10,000.\"</p><br/><p>\"The only ones who didn't ask for money are those who said some unbelievable things.\"</p><br/><p>\"How so?\"</p><br/><p>\"Heh, they say that a fortune-teller is the mysterious man. Funny, ain't it?\"</p><br/><p>\"That really does sound funny. Why would someone with so much ability be a fortune-teller?\"</p><br/><p>Vice-president: \"Keep searching. We have to draw him into the association no matter what.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sir, is it necessary to search like this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it is. I've watched this video at least a hundred times. Even though it's just a few seconds long, I can tell from it that this man knows true kungfu. This is a real talent. There's nobody in this association who can do something like that,\" the Vice-President answered firmly.</p><br/><p>\"That can't be. That's a little exaggerated.\"</p><br/><p>The association members wouldn't believe it.</p><br/><p>The Vice-President said, \"You don't understand. Such effective usage of kungfu in a real combat situation isn't something that can be achieved just through tough training, but it's something that is honed through experience and struggles.\"</p><br/><p>\"I understand. We'll keep searching.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the reporters.</p><br/><p>The reporters tasked with this job went straight to the internet and put up a reward for information. Anyone who provided legitimate information would be rewarded $10,000.</p><br/><p>\"Any news?\"</p><br/><p>\"There's news, but we're in the process of elimination. There are too many people that are just giving fake information for the reward.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone, work a little harder today. If we find him, I'll bring you guys for a good break.\"</p><br/><p>\"Long live the chief editor!\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Chief editor, come take a look,\" one of the workers called out.</p><br/><p>He instantly drew everyone's attention.</p><br/><p>\"Let me see.\"</p><br/><p>\"This picture was sent by an online friend. I just did a side-by-side comparison with the man in the video. The level of similarity is at least 90%.\"</p><br/><p>\"Zoom in\"</p><br/><p>The worker zoomed in on the image, then placed it side-by-side with the video.</p><br/><p>\"Do a software testing of his face. We can't get this wrong.\"</p><br/><p>\"The testing is done. The level of similarity is at 95%.\"</p><br/><p>\"Quick! Ask your friend who this man is. We need first-hand information.\"</p><br/><p>The chief editor banged the table in excitement as he let out a wide smile.</p><br/><p>\"I'm asking. He doesn't seem to be online,\" said the worker.</p><br/><p>\"Keep asking! We must find out as soon as possible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Roger.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>A group of people was busy looking for Lin Fan at Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, you're really amazing.\"</p><br/><p>\"How could we not have noticed that you had such ability?\"</p><br/><p>\"That Han Lu is still asking for a challenge. Hasn't he taken enough of a beating?\"</p><br/><p>\"I've seen the video. It was absolutely ferocious!\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you all talking about? What was ferocious?\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother, could it be that you don't know?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nope, I don't.\"</p><br/><p>\"God d*mn, it's about Han Lu. You really don't know?\"</p><br/><p>\"I really don't. Hurry up and spit it out.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's better if you check out Weibo news yourself. To not know such a viral piece of news, I've suddenly lost my respect for you.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>He couldn't even continue with his fortune-telling. He was surrounded by a huge crowd. These days, news spread too quickly. Even a slight disturbance would stir up huge waves on Weibo.</p><br/><p>The townspeople consisted of many young people, as well as many middle-aged people who kept up with the latest news.</p><br/><p>These middle-aged people, in particular, were brought up in a world of Chinese martial art fables. Now that Chinese martial arts were made obsolete, they were unhappy. However, Master Lin had suddenly appeared out of nowhere and ferociously struck back. It was a dominant return of Chinese martial arts. This made them extremely excited.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd and raised both his arms, \"If I told you that that wasn't me, would you believe me?\"</p><br/><p>\"No!\"</p><br/><p>Alright!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan now knew that these people wouldn't believe him. He also didn't know who was the guy who shot the video. If only he knew who it was, Lin Fan would've given him an award for the best videographer for shooting his face so clearly.</p><br/><p>\"Let's not talk about this and continue with the fortune-telling,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The truth can't be hidden anymore. Since it's come to this, maybe it's better to just step up and fight. I'll just do it so they'll be satisfied. There's no point in keeping this up.</p><br/><p>The worst part was that Lin Fan was afraid of fighting. He knew nothing about the third page of the Encyclopedia. If he were to challenge a professional fighter and get beaten up, he wouldn't know what to do.</p><br/><p>\"Fortune-telling can wait!\"</p><br/><p>\"Master, you have to tell us. How did you train your martial arts to such a high level?\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you accepting any disciples? I'm very serious! I won't cause any trouble for you.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The crowd all had something to say. Lin Fan was left dumbfounded. This situation was scary.</p><br/><p>Eventually, after a tremendous effort, he finally managed to disperse this fiery group of people. However, he couldn't relax just yet. Fraud Tian came up to Lin Fan with a look of suspicion on his face.</p><br/><p>\"What have you done now, kid?\" Fraud Tian was very curious. Something wasn't right. The townsfolk didn't even want to have their fortunes read anymore. They were just surrounding this kid, asking him questions non-stop and they were all related to fighting too.</p><br/><p>Just by looking at this kid's physique, you would think that if he got into a fight, he would get beaten up half to death.</p><br/><p>\"I see some disdain in your eyes,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"You don't say. I wouldn't dare to talk about anything else but with regards to fighting,</p><br/><p>I'm sure that you're not any good,\" Fraud Tian sneered.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the video on his phone, \"Take a look.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed, \"Sure, I'll take a look, but there's no way you can convince me.\"</p><br/><p>However, by the time Fraud Tian reached the end of the video, his expression had turned serious.</p><br/><p>He finished the video, then replayed it again.</p><br/><p>Then, he replayed it a second time.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was astonished.</p><br/><p>Then, a third time.</p><br/><p>Absolutely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>A fourth time.</p><br/><p>He couldn't believe it.</p><br/><p>A fifth time.</p><br/><p>A grave expression appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>He replayed it for a total of 10 times.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian put the phone down and looked at Lin Fan with a face full of shock.</p><br/><p>\"That's you in the video?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled then grabbed the phone. With a smug face, he said, \"Not too bad, eh? I didn't even use my full strength. The opponent was already down, so it was pointless.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stared blankly at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed it.</p><br/><p>Although the fighting only lasted a few seconds, just from these few seconds, you could tell that his ability was not average.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had watched the video a total of 10 times. His final conclusion was that it was...abnormal.</p><br/><p>He was clearly using the kicking technique of the Ba Gua Zhang, followed by a palm strike and finally, finishing with Pi Zhang chop.</p><br/><p>Although it looked simple, to do it at such a level was not simple at all, especially against someone with such a strong physique who was in a charging motion. It should've been almost impossible to stop his momentum.</p><br/><p>\"When did you train to such a level? And, how is it even possible at this age?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Hehe, this is called hiding one's true abilities. I'm not as stupid as to let you see through me.\"</p><br/><p>\"It can't be. If you were so strong, that time...why did you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, you were there, weren't you? Against some small fries, if I were to raise my hand, do you think they would still be alive?\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was shaken. He himself was a Ba Gua Zhang practitioner, but this kid was so much better than him.</p><br/><p>Hea had started training at the age of three and had been training for decades. He had taken countless beatings to achieve the strength and ability that he possessed.</p><br/><p>This kid is still so young, how is this possible?</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan knew what he was thinking, he would surely have an answer:</p><br/><p>\"Because you're so friendly to me, that's how I managed to pick up this skill.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

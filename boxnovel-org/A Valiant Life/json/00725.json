Life returned to normal and nothing much was happening.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had one extra person whom he was talking to on Weixin, and that person was Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>They would exchange a few texts at night.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute was doing well. Lin Fan\u2019s Encyclopedic Knowledge had grown quite a bit. However, he was still short of three names in order to complete his Encyclopedic Task.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan remembered that he hadn\u2019t contacted his old disciple Zhao Ming Qing in quite a while, and so, he started to become a little worried. Zhao Ming Qing hadn\u2019t called in in a long time and he didn\u2019t know if anything had happened to him.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a while, Lin Fan decided to give him a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, how are you doing? I haven\u2019t heard from you in quite a while,\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll be back soon. There are just too many communities in this mountainous region and some of them have very complicated illnesses which require a long time to heal, and so I haven\u2019t been back in quite a while,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said over the phone, his tone apologetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, is that your teacher calling you?\u201d a voice could be heard over the phone.</p><br/><p>Without asking, Lin Fan knew who the other person over the phone was. Zhao Ming Qing had met him while providing medical aid at the mountainous regions. He was an American Doctor who had abandoned his medical practice back in the states and came all the way to China to provide medical aid to the people living in the mountains.</p><br/><p>It seemed that both of them had formed a deep friendship over the course of time that they were together.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, alright. Go do what you do and come back soon. Make sure to take care of yourself and don\u2019t overwork. You aren\u2019t a spring chicken anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was touched after hearing his teacher\u2019s concern for him. \u201cI will, teacher. Alright, I\u2019ll see you soon, I\u2019m currently trekking up the mountain now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan opened his phone and looked at the news.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Satellite TV Network\u2019s \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 had already started showing on television.</p><br/><p>Before the competition, the identities of the teachers were a hot topic. The netizens were all discussing who would become the teachers for the competition. The organizers of the program had their own plans but they hadn\u2019t announced it to the public yet, which aroused a lot of speculation from the public.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Shanghai Satellite TV network started their broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first season of the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. Ten days, four teachers, one prize\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, it\u2019s broadcasting. It\u2019s finally broadcasting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are the teachers? Don\u2019t tell me Ying Jing is inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^, have you been living under a rock? It has already been announced long ago that Ying Jing will not be a teacher in this show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look, the teachers for this show are Huo Jian Xiang, Li Ying Dong, Zhao Li and Lin Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, that\u2019s just too awesome. I never thought that Shanghai Satellite TV Network would invite the king of pop Huo Jian Xiang. I\u2019m definitely watching this show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat king of pop? That was twenty years ago when he was in his prime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy favorite Li Ying Dong is inside as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Ying Jing couldn\u2019t make the cut to become a teacher. Shanghai Satellite TV Network got Zhao Li to be one of their teachers and compared to Ying Jing, I think she\u2019s way better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys blind? Master Lin is on this show too. I can\u2019t wait to see Master Lin in this program.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. I also can\u2019t wait for Master Lin\u2019s appearance. I feel that the show is much more meaningful with his appearance in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Master Lin? He just wrote a few songs. He pales in comparison to the other three teachers in the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, pales in comparison? Are you blind? From my research, Shanghai Satellite TV Network paid Master Lin twenty million dollars to appear in the show. It is much more compared to the other three teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuo Jian Xiang: 18 million dollars. Li Ying Dong: 16.5 million dollars. Zhao Li: 19 million dollars. Compared to Master Lin, it is much lesser. This just proves that in the eyes of Shanghai Satellite TV network, Master Lin is much more popular than the other three teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, is that even real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The internet had been discussing the details of the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 for a few days. However, it was true that the show was indeed popular.</p><br/><p>The Shanghai Satellite TV Network had a strong and robust team. It wasn\u2019t a hard thing for them to make program popular.</p><br/><p>For the other three teachers who were in the show, they didn\u2019t feel that they were being treated fairly. They had been in the field for at least ten years, with the oldest of them having twenty years in the music scene. Now, they heard that the person who was replacing Teacher Ying Jing was getting paid more than them for a first appearance.</p><br/><p>From their point of view, it was completely illogical. From what they understood, Ying Jing had been offered thirty million dollars to appear in the show, and it was way higher than their offers. After hearing about Master Lin\u2019s offer, they simply couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>Who had Ying Jing\u2019s ability? At the same time, she had such a huge reputation in the music scene, so her appearance on the show would warrant such a price. However, what successes did Master Lin have to bring to the table to warrant getting paid more than them?</p><br/><p>All he did was become famous on the internet and painted a few Chinese paintings which have become national treasures. Why was his appearance fee higher than theirs?</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive. Appearance fee of twenty million dollars. How much money is that?\u201d Fraud Tian said, looking in awe.</p><br/><p>They knew that Lin Fan was about to be a teacher on the program, but they never thought that his appearance fee would be greater than the other teachers on the program.</p><br/><p>Twenty million dollars. It was a sum of money most people wouldn\u2019t even be able to earn in their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about there. Nothing much really,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly, waving him away. His nonchalant demeanor made Fraud Tian want to go up to punch him.</p><br/><p>However, he never thought that the other three teachers would be the three that were selected. They could be considered veterans in the music scene and all three of them had songs which were appealing to the masses.</p><br/><p>What made Lin Fan surprised was that his appearance fee was higher than all three of them. If he guessed correctly, they probably won\u2019t be too happy about it.</p><br/><p>Such a young lad and not even in the music industry. Who could accept such a thing?</p><br/><p>Looking at Weibo, he realized that Ying Jing was a little unhappy about it. That b*tch had secretly posted a few posts on Weibo which had attracted the attention of quite a few users on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout the tiger in the mountain, the monkey has crowned himself king.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were discussing madly in the comments. For the people who knew what was going on, they definitely knew what Ying Jing meant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even think twice about insulting Ying Jing, as he immediately left a comment under her post.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jing the tigress, when will you return to the mountain? I feel like vanquishing dragons and tigers.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan had posted that comment, a few netizens rolled on the floor and started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin is so humorous. He keeps on hating on Ying Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis b*tch Ying Jing looked for this herself. Who doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin really didn\u2019t give her any face at all. She must be speechless right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis run of the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 is a must watch. I can\u2019t wait for all the drama to happen, and I bet my two steamed buns that it\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also bet my deep fried breadstick with two tea-leaf eggs that that\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^, you guys are so crude and foul. I can\u2019t stop imagining it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After seeing Lin Fan\u2019s response, Ying Jing\u2019s face turned black again. She had never met someone this preposterous in her years spent in the music scene.</p><br/><p>It was as if he wasn\u2019t afraid of heaven or earth, and that no one could ever face up against him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

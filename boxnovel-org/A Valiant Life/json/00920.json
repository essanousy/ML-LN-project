Initially, he was a little p*ssed off but when he saw the display on the phone, he became curious.</p><br/><p>It was from Liu Xiao Tian. For Liu Xiao Tian to call him so early, there must have been a reason. He wouldn\u2019t just call him for no rhyme or reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Inspector Liu. What is it?\u201d Lin Fan asked upon picking up the phone.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the call, Liu Xiao Tian seemed a little excited. \u201cMaster Lin, this is huge\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuge? What\u2019s huge? Does this even have anything to do with me?\u201d Lin Fan was curious. For a police officer to tell him that something huge had happened, it must\u2019ve been quite something.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian appeared to still be in shock. \u201cIt does. It has a lot to do with you. Master Lin, you\u2019ve done us a great service once again.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cGreat service?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard those words, he suddenly became more awake.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cWhat great service?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed. \u201cRemember that old man from yesterday? We interrogated him last night and discovered something huge. Thereafter, we even arrested over ten of his accomplices. They\u2019re all locked up here now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little confused. \u201cPlease elaborate. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was silent for a moment, putting his thoughts together. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll explain it to you slowly. That old man called himself the person-in-charge of IOA Human Genome Corporation but according to our investigations, there is no such corporation overseas. Moreover, during the interrogation, we discovered that this old man is an international con artist. He even brought over ten accomplices with him to Shanghai this time and disguised himself as a wealthy person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cHe disguised himself as a wealthy person? Then why did he try to scam me? I don\u2019t think I have much to scam, do I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t read the fortune of the old man and he had been thinking that the old man was a multi-level marketer all along. This was pretty f*cking awesome.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When he heard that, Liu Xiao Tian couldn\u2019t help but start laughing, \u201cMaster Lin, let me warn you in advance not to laugh at this. That old man was rather disciplined with his mouth and he didn\u2019t reveal anything. But those accomplices of his were all terrified. Amongst them, only that old man is a foreign Chinese. According to their confession, they would look at the news in search of outstanding talents from various industries. Then, this old man would disguise as a wealthy person and try to lure these people using various outrageous ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf those people are successfully lured, they would follow him overseas. When that happens, they would\u2019ve fallen for the trap. They came looking for you because your Chinese medicine ability is amazing. They wanted to lock you up and have you develop new medications specially for them. And then they would give you a bit of food for every medicine you develop or something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he groaned in his heart. He felt that these people\u2019s methods were quite profound.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the situation now?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian replied, \u201cI\u2019ve already reported this incident to the higher-ups. Also, I\u2019ve managed to find out quite a lot from the interrogations. It seems that many cases of disappearances in the past were because of this old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of them is a financial genius. Back then, he got scammed into following the old man to America. Thereafter, he\u2019s been locked in a small room. With multiple people supervising him, he has been forced to earn money for them. Now, we\u2019ve already contacted the international police to rescue him from his location. There\u2019s no news as of now but it shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan could already understand how this old man worked. However, it was quite incredible.</p><br/><p>To scam talents from various industries into following him to America and then locking them up and having them earn money for them.</p><br/><p>But he really wanted to know just how that financial genius had been tricked.</p><br/><p>However, thinking about that old man\u2019s performance, it probably would have been able to trick most people.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected a small incident to be connected to such a crime. It was rather unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. I didn\u2019t expect that my casual report would help you to catch such a big tiger. Alright, that\u2019s enough talk for today. I have to go back to sleep for a while more.\u201d After finding out the truth, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t interested in knowing any more details.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. Inspector Liu, since I\u2019ve unintentionally cracked a big case, do you think I can still get a Good Citizen Award?\u201d asked Lin Fan with a laugh.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was quite interested in this award. Hanging it up on the wall of his shop made it look really nice.</p><br/><p>Also, he would be able to tell others indirectly, \u2018Look, I\u2019m a good citizen. A good Samaritan!\u2019</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had seen this coming. Then, he became annoyed. \u201cMaster Lin, you must be trying to take every Good Citizen Award in Shanghai for yourself. No, there will be no more Good Citizen Awards for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan whined helplessly, \u201cWhat a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they chatted for a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Looking at the time, it was still early. Lin Fan put his head down and went to sleep again.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached, Zhao Zhong Yang immediately came over to him. \u201cBrother Lin, how\u2019s the situation regarding that old man from yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cLook at the news for yourself in a few days. I can\u2019t explain it clearly but I can understand now why he didn\u2019t want Fraud Tian to join him\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was very curious.</p><br/><p>He really wanted to know what that incident was all about.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask why. You\u2019ll know once you see the news in a few days. Right, where\u2019s the doggy?\u201d Lin Fan looked all over but couldn\u2019t find the doggy.</p><br/><p>During this period of time, he hadn\u2019t been paying much attention to the doggy. After all, Elder Dog wasn\u2019t just any dog. He could even be said to be a godly dog.</p><br/><p>He would disappear for whole days and only return at night.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan knew the reason for that. Elder Dog must have gone out to do good deeds.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog would also bring his group of puppies around to roam the streets and check out the scenery sometimes.</p><br/><p>As for whether they would get bullied by people, that was needless to say. With Elder Dog\u2019s current power, it was good enough that he didn\u2019t bully people.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He went out early in the morning,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that Elder Dog was becoming less and less like a dog. He was becoming similar to a human. And it wasn\u2019t the first or second time that he was feeling this.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Noontime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to the riverbank to fish once again. He had to make good use of the angling major class of knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, can I please get something fun?\u201d Lin Fan held the fishing rod in his hands as he felt a little frustrated.</p><br/><p>Although the things he fished up were pretty good, the main point was that they weren\u2019t what he wanted. In fact, they were very different from what he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s coming\u2026\u201d At that moment, a peculiar feeling came from his fishing rod. He was fantasizing in his mind what it could possibly be.</p><br/><p>He lifted his fishing rod. When he saw what was biting on the bait, a smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>He grabbed it with his hand a took a look.</p><br/><p>100-year-old ginseng.</p><br/><p>Another good item had reached his hands.</p></div>\n</div>"}

This night, to Wang Ming Yang, had been a tragic incident. For him to get this drunk, Lin Fan really had to give him a little credit.</p><br/><p>When he wakes up the next day, he probably wouldn\u2019t know what had happened that night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had methods to ensure that Wang Ming Yang wouldn\u2019t get a headache when he woke up but thinking about it, he decided to just forget it. He would just let Wang Ming Yang have a headache the next day. It would serve as a good reminder for the future.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang was driving. \u201cMaster Lin, where do you want to go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>What had just happened was nothing much to Lil\u2019 Wang. As for those three pampered sons, Lil\u2019 Wang felt that they were nothing much. He had been to many places with Elder Zheng and had seen numerous notable young masters, however, it was the first time he had seen people as idiotic as those three.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment, then replied, \u201cLet\u2019s find a hotel for now. Chief Wu, you\u2019re familiar with this area so you can choose a place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was still having lingering fears. To him, what had just happened was simply too terrifying.</p><br/><p>Up until the point when they left, he still hadn\u2019t completely recovered from his daze. Even now, he was still thinking about that incident. When he heard what Lin Fan said, he quickly opened his mouth and said, \u201cI have a hotel that\u2019s under my name. Let\u2019s go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. The priority now was to find a place for Wang Ming Yang to settle down so he can go to sleep early and not go into a drunken frenzy again.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was still feeling nervous. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMaster Lin, what happened today, is it really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Don\u2019t dwell on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, everything will be taken care of by Elder Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Elder Zheng?\u201d asked Wu Yun Gang.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang chuckled, \u201cForget it, it\u2019s better not to say. You don\u2019t have to worry about this. Nothing will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang saw that he didn\u2019t want to talk about this so he didn\u2019t ask too much. However, he had etched this \u2018Elder Zheng\u2019 into his memory. It seemed that this Elder Zheng had a lot of authority in Beijing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave Elder Zheng a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, thank you for tonight,\u201d said Lin Fan gratefully. If it hadn\u2019t been for Elder Zheng, with just Lin Fan\u2019s abilities, even though he wouldn\u2019t have lost out, it would definitely have been troublesome.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the call, Zheng Zhong Shan couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. As long as everything\u2019s fine, then it\u2019s good. In Beijing, if you come across any unlawful situations, you can look for me. You\u2019re one of us now. If something happens, how could I not help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Lin Fan started chuckling, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019m hanging up. My friend has gotten pretty drunk tonight. I need to take care of him. Later on, I\u2019ll get Lil\u2019 Wang to go back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, I can let Lil\u2019 Wang accompany you all. If you need anything, you can give him instructions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Lin Fan was very grateful towards Elder Zheng. Although they hadn\u2019t known each other for long, Elder Zheng was really capable of getting things done.</p><br/><p>After that, they exchanged a few more words, then hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, this leader of yours is really too kind-hearted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang smiled and couldn\u2019t help but say boastfully, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve been with Elder Zheng for almost ten years now. Elder Zheng has always been this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>They reached the hotel.</p><br/><p>After parking the car, Lil\u2019 Wang immediately got off and opened the back door. He carried Wang Ming Yang off the car while Lin Fan and Wu Yun Gang hurried inside to get a room.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Ming Yang was muttering some gibberish. Nobody knew what he was saying.</p><br/><p>The room was opened.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang placed Wang Ming Yang down on the bed. \u201cMaster Lin, if there\u2019s anything, you can give me a call. I\u2019ll come here as quickly as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. Please go back and rest. I won\u2019t have any problems here.\u201d Since Lil\u2019 Wang was so courteous, Lin Fan, naturally, had to be courteous as well. This Lil\u2019 Wang was a pretty good person indeed. Moreover, he was strong-willed.</p><br/><p>After sending Lil\u2019 Wang off, Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang, who was lying on the bed, then at Wu Yun Gang. he said, \u201cChief Wu, if we just let him sleep like this, do you think it\u2019s not too good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was taken aback. Then, he asked in a puzzled manner, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be anything not good about this, right? Ming Yang is drunk right now, I think a proper rest would be best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d The situation had been resolved and Wang Ming Yang had already been taken care of, so Lin Fan could relax now. However, he definitely could not let Wang Ming Yang just sleep here so comfortably while himself and everyone else were working like dogs. For this guy to just lie down comfortably like he wasn\u2019t even involved was definitely not right.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was a little dumbfounded. Especially when he looked at Master Lin\u2019s smile which seemed to be full of hidden meaning, somehow, he felt like he had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what do you mean then?\u201d asked Wu Yun Gang very carefully.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was silent for a moment, then, he let out a wide grin. \u201cStrip him naked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu Yun Gang was flabbergasted and it was as if he had lost his senses. What was Master Lin talking about? Stripping Wang Ming Yang naked? What was he trying to do? Could it be\u2026could it be\u2026?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to imagine it.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrip him naked. As for tomorrow, I\u2019ll do the talking\u2026\u201d Lin Fan wanted Wang Ming Yang to remember this incident for the rest of his life and forever be fearful of getting drunk.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang looked at Wang Ming Yang and felt pity for him. Moreover, he never thought that Lin Fan would think of such a treacherous plan.</p><br/><p>In a certain apartment.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang had sent Elder Zheng back. In the living room, Lil\u2019 Wang said, \u201cElder Zheng, the matter has been resolved. However, although Master Lin didn\u2019t say it, I reckon that if Master Lin goes back to Shanghai, his friend would suffer a retaliation in Beijing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng didn\u2019t bother too much about this. He nodded and said, \u201cAlright then. Go and find out just who Jiang Hai is. Also, pass them a message from me: Know how to differentiate bad from good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lil\u2019 wang nodded.</p><br/><p>As long as Elder Zheng had spoken, there were very few people in Beijing who would go against it.</p><br/><p>As for those little kids from that night, they probably didn\u2019t know who they had just offended.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>In a certain room.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was lying there and he suddenly felt quite cooling. At first, he didn\u2019t come to his senses but suddenly, his eyes opened wide and he had received a shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, my head hurts.\u201d Wang Ming Yang sat up and rubbed his head. His head felt as if it had been filled with concrete. It felt extremely heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where am I? What the heck happened to me?\u201d Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><br/><p>Who the heck had stripped him naked?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he drinking together with Yun Gang? But why would Yun Gang strip him naked?</p><br/><p>This situation seemed a little complicated.</p><br/><p><em>knock knock</em></p><br/><p>He heard the door being knocked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had one hand on his head as he started to look for his clothes. \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wu Yun Gang looked at each other. The two of them hadn\u2019t left the previous night. They had gotten a room just next door.</p><br/><p>At that moment, it was 9 o\u2019clock and Wang Ming Yang should have woken up by then so they came over to knock on the door.</p><br/><p>As for the previous night\u2019s incident, they didn\u2019t know how much of it Wang Ming Yang recalled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

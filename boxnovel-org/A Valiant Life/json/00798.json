Then, he asked worriedly, \u201cWe didn\u2019t forget anything, did we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ve bought everything we need to buy,\u201d said a young and beautiful lady.</p><br/><p>However, she was the same as the man as she seemed gloomy as well.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui said, \u201cHusband, if we don\u2019t succeed this time, what will we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng laughed bitterly, \u201cWhat else could we do? The company\u2019s returns aren\u2019t enough. As a department head, I need to take full responsibility. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll get discharged from the company and I\u2019ll have to start over again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui said, \u201cDon\u2019t be too stressed. We can start over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng laughed forcefully, \u201cThe outcome isn\u2019t certain yet, so we don\u2019t need to be too negative about it. But if I really get discharged, we have to hide it from Dad and Mom for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I know.\u201d Tian Yu Hui nodded.</p><br/><p>She had known Li Feng since university. After graduating, they got married. Her husband\u2019s job was pretty good. He was a manager in a foreign enterprise and his salary was high. It was enough for them to make a living in Zhongzhou. On the other hand, her job was to keep the house neat and orderly and to take care of his two parents.</p><br/><p>But they hadn\u2019t expected that towards the start of the new year, something like this would happen.</p><br/><p>The company wasn\u2019t getting enough returns and her husband\u2019s department had to take responsibility. In foreign enterprises, the competition was intense and there were many backstabbers as well. Eventually, they received news that after the new year celebrations, her husband might get discharged from the company. They might separate that department and rebuild it again.</p><br/><p>When they found out about this, it was like a bolt from the blue. But at home, the two of them pretended like nothing had happened. All they could do now was buy some things and gift them to the leader in hope that he would give him one more chance. However, they still didn\u2019t know how things would turn out.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>They reached an isolated villa.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui and Li Feng carried the things. These things had cost them tens of thousands. As they carried the items, they felt heavy. Their hearts were restless as well. There was an indescribable, stifling feeling.</p><br/><p>Li Feng stood at the door and took a deep breath before pressing the doorbell.</p><br/><p>Before long, someone opened the door.</p><br/><p>Li Feng immediately smiled, \u201cChief Zhu, happy new year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu was a pot-bellied man, balding from the top of his head. At that moment, he looked at Li Feng emotionlessly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words kept the two of them outside the door. But to Li Feng, it didn\u2019t matter right now. He could only fill his face with smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Zhu, it\u2019s the new year, isn\u2019t it? My wife and I brought some things here to pay you a visit.\u201d Li Feng could feel the opposition\u2019s coldness towards himself.</p><br/><p>But in his situation, if he didn\u2019t plead with Chief Zhu, what else could he do?</p><br/><p>Was he supposed to just wait until the new year celebrations were over for him to be discharged?</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cCome in then.\u201d</p><br/><p>After entering the house, Li Feng put down the items.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu propped his legs up as he sat on the sofa. \u201cLi Feng, you have to understand that this happened because of a problem in your department. And as the department head, you have to take full responsibility. You understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Li Feng nodded. He kept standing there. Without Chief Zhu\u2019s permission, how could he sit?</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui was standing behind Li Feng the whole time. Seeing her husband like this, her heart felt sore. There was an indescribable bitterness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your wife?\u201d Chief Zhu took a glance at Tian Yu Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my wife.\u201d Li Feng nodded.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui went forward. \u201cNice to meet you, Chief Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw Tian Yu Hui. He hadn\u2019t expected his subordinate to have such a beautiful lady as a wife. And she was very young too.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very beautiful. You have pretty good luck, kid,\u201d said Chief Zhu.</p><br/><p>Li Feng replied, \u201cThank you for the compliment, Chief Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>But at this moment, Li Feng suddenly felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Li Feng was considered above average in the company.</p><br/><p>But he knew about the behavior of the higher-ups. The common practices in the company were not good.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu liked playing around with the female workers in the company. And the company\u2019s Vice-President, Shan Cun He liked married women even more. Not that Li Feng had heard what Chief Zhu said, he suddenly felt his heartbeat quicken.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Li Feng pulled his wife back. \u201cChief Zhu, do you think there could be a chance for redemption?\u201d Then, he took out the bag that he had packaged in black plastic packaging and placed it on the table.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu looked at Li Feng in astonishment. \u201cWhat are you trying to do? Bribe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng quickly shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. I just want to thank Chief Zhu for looking after me these past few years. But I really cannot do without this job. I hope that Chief Zhu could help me put in a good word so that I can make amendments for my mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Chief Zhu\u2019s expression became a lot warmer. Then, he just stared at Li Feng for a moment and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Chief Zhu lit up a cigarette. \u201cDon\u2019t say that I\u2019m not giving you a chance. It will depend on whether you can seize it. Tonight, Vice-President Shan Cun will be organizing a banquet at Joy Hotel. Bring your wife there. As for how it turns out, it will depend on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng said, \u201cCan I go alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu stopped for a moment, then looked up at Li Feng. \u201cAre you trying to bargain with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui was standing behind. As fingers were being pointed, she became a little nervous. Although she didn\u2019t know the exact situation, it sounded like things weren\u2019t very good.</p><br/><p>Li Feng didn\u2019t think anymore. He bowed and said goodbye, \u201cThank you, Chief Zhu but I won\u2019t be going.\u201d After saying that, he picked up the black plastic bag from the table and started to leave the place with his wife.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhu\u2019s face turned cold. \u201cI gave you the chance, Li Feng. It\u2019ll depend on how you take it. Go back and think about it. Once you\u2019ve decided, call me at 7.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, Chief Zhu. There\u2019s no need to consider. I\u2019m still young. If I start over, perhaps I can develop even better.\u201d Li Feng shook his head. Then, he pulled his wife and left immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d said Chief Zhu unhappily as he saw Li Feng leave.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui looked at her husband worriedly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng patted his wife\u2019s head and smiled forcefully. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. No need to think too much. After the new year celebrations, I\u2019ll go and find a job. Just be a good, beautiful wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about I go out to work as well? It would help to split the load,\u201d suggested Tian Yu Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Don\u2019t you trust your husband? I just saw a message that Uncle Lin and his family are back. Just in time to spend the new year happily. Leave the money earning to me,\u201d said Li Feng with a smile. Then, he started the car and headed home.</p><br/><p>As for those presents, he would just give them to Chief Zhu. After all, he had been under Chief Zhu for many years. Also, he would send him a message for the Chinese New Year.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that his Dad and Uncle Li were chatting so cheerfully and helplessly took out his phone to look at the news. He occasionally replied to Aunty Li.</p><br/><p>*knock knock*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the sound of the door being unlocked could be heard.</p><br/><p>Uncle Li, who had been chatting happily with Papa Lin, smiled and said, \u201cLooks like the children are back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got up. When he saw who had come, he was all smiles. \u201cBrother Li, Sister-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Lin Fan, we haven\u2019t met in so long.\u201d Li Feng smiled brilliantly when he saw Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He had grown up with Lin Fan when they were young. However, he was a few years older than Lin Fan, therefore, he graduated earlier that Lin Fan. They would basically meet once or twice a year.</p><br/><p>Moreover, their families had been neighbors for almost ten years.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Then, he asked, \u201cBrother Lin, can I start a broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAsk them if they mind. If they don\u2019t mind, you can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re not celebrities. Just do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting their approval, Zhao Zhong Yang was over the moon. He immediately unlocked his phone and changed the headline.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe national table-tennis players have gathered at Cloud Street. Those that are passing by, do not miss out.\u201d</p><br/><p>After starting the broadcast, a large group of viewers came.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Brother Yang. Which national players are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, isn\u2019t that Cui Guo Bin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Xu Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, there are so many of the first team players. What are they doing? Are they trying to challenge Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously not. Master Lin is awesome. Who would dare to play against him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held his phone and pointed it towards them. \u201cCome, please introduce yourselves to my fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin had never been in a broadcast before but he had been on several TV shows. He smiled, \u201cHi, everyone. I am Cui Guo Bin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The broadcast room went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really Cui Guo Bin. Why are they at Master Lin\u2019s shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m filled with anticipation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song also greeted the viewers, \u201cI am here at Master Lin\u2019s shop to get him to treat my old injury. Master Lin said it\u2019s easily curable. I wouldn\u2019t be as tired when I play in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they\u2019re there to treat their illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Xu Song has an old injury. It always comes back. It came back during the previous Asia championships. That\u2019s how he got humiliated by the Japanese athlete. If he were to recover from it, he would definitely be able to fight for the top spot again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s found the right person. Master Lin is a godly doctor. There\u2019s nothing he can\u2019t treat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould he be having a friendly match with Master Lin? We\u2019re so excited to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>A lot of people started entering the broadcast room. Although the table-tennis players weren\u2019t celebrities, a lot of people loved table-tennis. Furthermore, the broadcasting company also found out about this particular broadcast.</p><br/><p>They immediately pushed Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s broadcast to the top of the platform so that people could see it easily.</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Zhong Yang was a famous broadcaster of the company, it wasn\u2019t a steady job. He didn\u2019t have a programme that was dedicated to him. However, his broadcasts were always shockingly good.</p><br/><p>After all, he was always with Master Lin and the people he dealt with were naturally extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin was really concerned about Xu Song. He asked, \u201cMaster Lin, does he need to do anything for the treatment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be giving him a tuina massage. Then, I\u2019ll be giving him a Chinese medicine prescription. It\u2019ll be done after one or two more treatments,\u201d Lin Fan said and smiled. If Xu Song was willing to rest for another six months, other doctors would have been able to treat it effectively with the given modern technology.</p><br/><p>However, which passionate athlete would be able to accept that?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pressed onto Xu Song\u2019s leg and massaged it with an ancient tuina method. The mystical boost of the Encyclopedia was also activated. That improved his blood circulation greatly and it was really effective.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin and the others sat beside him and looked. They didn\u2019t notice any difference.</p><br/><p>However, they knew that he was a godly doctor after all. If they could tell what he was doing, they would have become godly doctors by now.</p><br/><p>After twenty minutes, Lin Fan stopped. Then, he wrote the prescription on a piece of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. When you return back, go and get your medicine from any Chinese Medical Hall. Consume your medicine regularly and rest for another week. Then, your injury would be gone,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Xu Song felt a weird burning sensation on his leg but it felt really good.</p><br/><p>The other teammates looked at him in disbelief, \u201cMaster Lin, that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin glared at him, \u201cWhat is it? Master Lin is a godly doctor. He wouldn\u2019t do anything wrong, would he?\u201d Then, he looked at Xu Song, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song was stunned, \u201cBrother Cui, I feel much better. My legs have a nice burning sensation. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m in a sauna.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s awesome. Master Lin\u2019s treatment is always shockingly good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I just tried to massage myself but I don\u2019t feel anything. I just feel my hands getting tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how can you compare yourself to Master Lin? Master Lin is a godly doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, if Xu Song\u2019s old injury gets fixed, he would definitely be even better. That stupid Zhenping Yiming would be doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Stop talking about him. According to what I know, that fella became more honest after he went back to Japan. The Japanese news reported that he didn\u2019t want to play table-tennis anymore. I think he feels really defeated after being defeated by Master Lin. He\u2019s probably going to change his profession.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as what the person in the broadcasting room said, Zhenping Yiming really got defeated by Lin Fan. After returning to Japan, he didn\u2019t receive anything but mockery.</p><br/><p>He was really proud when he won the Asia championships. However, he got thrashed by non-athlete on TV. That was such a joke.</p><br/><p>Xu Song felt much better about his injury. He believed that he would be undefeatable as long as his leg healed. He was prepared to teach the Japanese team a good lesson after he recovered.</p><br/><p>Of course, he was really grateful for Master Lin. Although he hadn\u2019t recovered, he believed that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t let him down since he was a godly doctor.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cMaster Lin, you should take a picture with them. I\u2019ll take it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ll post it on Weibo too. If not, the manager would think that I brought my teammates out to play and skipped training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat beside Cui Guo Bin and the other teammates stood behind them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay cheese!\u201d</p><br/><p>*snap*</p><br/><p>After taking it, he sent the picture to all the table-tennis athletes and everyone started to post it on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Some of the athletes felt that they needed to depend on Master Lin\u2019s popularity to boost their own reputation.</p><br/><p>Xu Song posted the picture on Weibo, \u201cThank you, Master Lin, for treating my leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin also posted, \u201cI came to Shanghai to beat Master Lin in table-tennis.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, when he said that, all the netizens just laughed.</p><br/><p>Master Lin\u2019s table-tennis skills were insanely good. If they didn\u2019t watch the TV programme, they would have thought that Master Lin was a pushover. However, everyone felt that Cui Guo Bin and the rest were just asking for it.</p><br/><p>At noon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brought them out for lunch. They were guests after all and he had to entertain them. Fraud Tian was really happy. He didn\u2019t really care about anything but good food.</p><br/><p>They had a good meal.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s find a place to practice our skills. Shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Cui Guo Bin and smiled, \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about it? That Japanese that you thrashed is someone that we can thrash too. If you don\u2019t believe me, we can have a match. I\u2019ll show you the true power of our national team. How does that sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song covered his face in shame. Brother Cui must have had too much alcohol. He was bragging too much.</p><br/><p>They had analyzed Master Lin\u2019s capabilities. How could he forget about that after drinking?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a typical match. They were doomed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s have some fun then.\u201d He didn\u2019t have anything on in the afternoon and he was okay with spending his time with the national table-tennis team.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he could showcase his talent and do some exercise.</p></div>\n</div>"}

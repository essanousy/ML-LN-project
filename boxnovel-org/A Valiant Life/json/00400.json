The netizens were even more stunned when the user, 'The old man that loves drawing' said that the drawing was worth millions of dollars.</p><br/><p>Master Lin wasn't a reputable artist and those that didn't know anything about art probably wouldn't buy the artwork. However, those that knew about art didn't look at reputation when they were buying artworks. They cared more about the meaning of the artwork. Although it was being viewed online and they couldn't really feel the emotions of the artwork, they could tell that this was a special piece of art just by looking at it. It was a valuable artwork.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, my first artwork in my life and it's been given to the kids. I feel like everything was worth it.\" Lin Fan chuckled. He was teaching the kids how to draw and although there were quite a number of them, that wasn't a problem at all. Drawing was a time-consuming skill and he believed that his ability would make these kids interested in Chinese art.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi looked at each other. They didn't believe that it was Master Lin's first drawing. They felt that it was unbelievable. The most valuable artworks of the famous artists were their first and last pieces of art. Although Master Lin wasn't famous, they believed that he could easily become well-known for his magnificent artworks. Master Lin was so much better than others in terms of his drawing skills and the meaning in his drawing was literally out of this world.</p><br/><p>\"These kids\u2026\" Tao Shi Gang shook his head helplessly. At the same time, he wanted to meet Master Lin even more. He had been studying Chinese artworks for his whole life to improve his ability. He had actually met someone younger than him who was more capable and obviously, he wanted to meet him.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi was extremely excited. \"Brother Tao, let's buy tickets to Shanghai tonight. I can't wait to meet and interact with this grandmaster.\"</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang smiled. \"Alright, let's pack up. When we meet this young grandmaster, we can stay there and slowly interact with him, Anyway, it's been a few years since I've been to Shanghai. The previous time when I went there, Teacher Qing Tian was still alive. However, in the blink of an eye, he has passed away for a few years now. I ought to pay my respects to him.\"</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi nodded. They didn't know a lot of people and had a small network. Needless to say, there were even fewer people that they looked up to. Today, they had met a young and capable grandmaster that was worthy of a visit. They obviously couldn't wait any longer.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>As for the first drawing that had gotten ruined by the kids, it wasn't possible to be retained. To the kids, it was as if they had discovered the New World. All the children wanted to touch it and obviously, the ink on the drawing was smudged. It was a painful sight to the professionals as it meant that the drawing was ruined. However, Lin Fan felt that it was worth it because his drawing had helped to develop the children's curiosity.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped. \"Alright, alright. Today is our first lesson. Pick up your brush and follow my steps. Also, remember my techniques. You have to draw a good base artwork first and you should start with the tree barks.\"</p><br/><p>Some of the children were a little too young and they needed more time to learn. Those that were older were easier to manage. Furthermore, it naturally wasn't a problem for a teacher like Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the lesson, Lin Fan received a call from Zhao Ming Qing. Zhao Ming Qing sounded extremely excited on the phone. It was obvious that the book, 'Various Types of Typhoid' had had a great impact on him. The content of the book was clear but there were parts that he didn't understand after thinking for a long time. Hence, he wanted to ask his mentor.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, if it's possible, can you just tell me over the phone?\" Zhao Ming Qing asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"I'm busy now. Just continue to read it and make notes at the parts which you don't understand. I will explain it to you slowly tomorrow. Although I can explain it clearly over the phone, I need you to personally experience it.\"</p><br/><p>He wanted to give his disciple the best.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, teacher.\" Zhao Ming Qing nodded and hung up. Then, Lin Fan continued to teach the children how to draw. The netizens in the broadcast room were enjoying it. It was because Lin Fan would sometimes draw something with the brush and it would create a spectacularly different effect. To average artists, that was brilliant. However, to Lin Fan, his knowledge came from the Encyclopedia and he was emotional after seeing his own strokes form an artwork.</p><br/><p>Until 6 PM in the evening.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was prepared to go home. Although he hadn't gained any Encyclopedic Points, he believed that he would gradually earn some if he continued teaching.</p><br/><p>The kids had enjoyed the session tremendously and were extremely interested in Chinese art. To be able to let these children be so interested in Chinese art within such a short timeframe, it definitely meant that the teacher was awesome.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>His life every day was the same, he would go to Cloud Street in the morning to sell scallion pancakes and leave for the Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He could take care of the fortune-telling for the shop and besides, he was pretty reputable in the vicinity of Cloud Street. However, if they knew that Wu Tian He was the director of the nation's Metaphysics Society, who knew what they would think?</p><br/><p>Although Wu Tian He was reputable, it was still a small area. To outsiders, they definitely wouldn't know who he was.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at the situation and was stunned. \"Teacher, you're teaching these children to draw?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah.\" Lin Fan nodded. Then, he smiled. \"Don't be in too much of a hurry to go back home. I'll give you an artwork to bring home with you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said firmly, \"Thank you, teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Then, there were two strangers who came.</p><br/><p>\"May I know if Master Lin is here?\" Lin Fan stopped and looked up. It was two old men. \"You are\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang immediately went forward. \"Master Lin, I'm 'The old man that loves drawing' from the broadcast.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Oh, so you're Master Tao. May I know why you're here\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>He was curious. Could they be there to challenge him?</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang said, \"This is my good friend, Yue Qiu Ju Shi. We watched Master Lin's broadcast yesterday and the artwork was stunning. Hence, we flew over from Beijing to meet Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi looked at Lin Fan in awe. He was young but so capable. It was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood there as he said, \"Teacher, since someone's here, you can entertain them first.\"</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi looked at Zhao Ming Qing in disbelief. This man looked like he was about the same age as them. Had he just addressed him as 'teacher'?</p><br/><p>\"What's the relationship between the two of you?\" Tao Shi Gang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn't feel like it was a problem. He smiled. \"He is my teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi looked at each other in shock. They had initially thought that this old man was Master Lin's mentor but they hadn't expected the relationship to be reversed. However, they didn't think too much about it. Their main objective there was to have a good discussion with Master Lin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

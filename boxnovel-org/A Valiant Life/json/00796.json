And right in front of them were packets of sweets. Every one of the children was smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>They had bought their new clothes long ago but the children weren\u2019t in a hurry to wear them. They were only going to wear the new clothes the next day.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin looked at these children and a smile appeared on her face. \u201cI have never experienced such a thing. It\u2019s so lively.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan brought some tea over. \u201cUncle, Auntie, please have some tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Mama Lin was smiling and giggling as she watched the television. Then, she looked into the distance, \u201cWhat is the brat doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin has many friends. He\u2019s probably on the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>The sound of fireworks rang from outside.</p><br/><p>The Children\u2019s Welfare Institute had a very big backyard. Fraud Tian was bringing the kids to launch the fireworks. Whenever the dazzling fireworks soared into the sky, a series of cheers would be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Teacher Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Director Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you will have time to carry on as a mentor for the second season of \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, we\u2019ll see when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Then I shan\u2019t disturb you further, Teacher Lin. See you next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the people of Shanghai TV, this year had been much better than the last. The reality show, \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice, had broken the record for variety show ratings. This put them in the spotlight.</p><br/><p>And to the staff, the year-end bonus was really moving.</p><br/><p>All this was attributed to \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. And the fact that they were able to achieve such high ratings was all thanks to Teacher Lin\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>Another call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy New Year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m going to bring my whole family to pay you a New Year visit tomorrow. It will also be a good opportunity to see the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This disciple of his was good at everything but he was just too old-fashioned. His disciple really respected this Master-Disciple relationship. It was as if he really believed in the saying, \u2018He who teaches me for one day is my father for life\u2019.</p><br/><p>Outsiders would feel that this was very strange. After all, Zhao Ming Qing was old enough to be Lin Fan\u2019s grandfather.</p><br/><p>But people who knew the situation all knew that Zhao Ming Qing was really lucky to be his disciple.</p><br/><p>One by one, he received quite a number of calls.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan, Wu Yun Gang, Yue Qiu Ju Shi, etc\u2026</p><br/><p>Basically, anyone who was familiar with Lin Fan gave him a call.</p><br/><p>In these one or two hours, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang nonstop. Just from answering calls, his phone\u2019s battery was left with less than ten percent.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little helpless. Knowing too many people was not a very good thing either. However, it felt pretty good that he had been able to meet so many people in a short half a year. At least it showed that his life hadn\u2019t been too much of a failure.</p><br/><p>When the last call had been taken, Lin Fan put down his phone and let out a deep breath.</p><br/><p>This was really tiring. Phone calls, one after another, really made life difficult for him.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had to answer these calls. The callers all had good intentions, how could he turn down their good will?</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Before he had rested for long.</p><br/><p>Another call came. However, the display showed that it was Wu Huan Yue, so he could only answer it.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was with her parents. When Lin Fan answered the call, she started walking out of the living room.</p><br/><p>Her parents looked at each other and then at their daughter who was walking out of the living room.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and listen to who Huan Yue is talking to,\u201d said Mama Wu softly.</p><br/><p>Papa Wu shook his head, \u201cIf you want to go, then you should go. Our daughter is on the phone. Why should we eavesdrop?\u201d</p><div class=\"czldf5c98e1e934b33\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you concerned about our daughter at all? Our daughter has gone through a huge change in this half a year. She has even become a celebrity\u2026\u201d Mama Wu didn\u2019t finish her sentence. What she meant was that she was afraid that her daughter might receive bad influences outside.</p><br/><p>Papa Wu was silent for a moment and he felt that it was possible. Then, he sneakily hid at the side.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cBrother Lin, this phone of yours is too hard to reach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it can\u2019t be helped. Too many people have been calling me. I\u2019ve basically been on the phone the whole time. How are things at home?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty good. I haven\u2019t been back in a long time. Happy New Year, Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cSame to you. Let\u2019s all have a good New Year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Papa Wu listened for a while before coming back slowly. Then, he went to his wife\u2019s side. \u201cOur daughter is talking to a man. He\u2019s called Brother Lin or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Wu was a little surprised. Then, her eyes squinted as she smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Wu was taken aback. \u201cWhat\u2019s good about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? If he takes care of her, that would be great.\u201d Mama Wu glared at her husband. Why was his brain unable to comprehend it?</p><br/><p>When Papa Lin heard this, he understood. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. Then we can relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after, Wu Huan Yue hung up and went back to the living room.</p><br/><p>Mama Wu tried to look casual as she asked, \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue felt that her parents\u2019 expressions were a little strange but she still calmly replied, \u201cI was talking to a friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Wu said, \u201cOh. If there\u2019s a chance, you should bring him back for a visit. Your Dad and I aren\u2019t the type that will make things hard for you. However, you have to be careful and get to know him properly first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue blushed. \u201cMom, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t expected that her Mom would think of this. She felt very helpless. Although she wanted it very much, this matter had not reached a conclusion yet.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>The children got out of bed. They took out their new clothes and happily put them on.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lil\u2019 Fatty, do you think I look good with my new clothes?\u201d A kid who had mucus flowing from his nose asked Lil\u2019 Fatty excitedly.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty was a little fat. He couldn\u2019t quite pull his pants up but he used all his energy to pull them. When he finally successfully wore his pants, he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, not bad. Looks pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>To every child, the New Year was the happiest time because they had new clothes. On top of that, they could receive red packets.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest had woken up long ago.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was holding a large bag in his hand.</p><br/><p>The children saw Lin Fan and immediately ran over ecstatically. \u201cWe wish you a happy New Year, Uncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, here\u2019s your red packets.\u201d Lin Fan took out red packets from the bag, smiling. Each of them contained a hundred dollars. Although it wasn\u2019t much, it was enough to make the children happy.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was holding a small bag. His face was dark and dull and his tears were flowing down his face. As he saw the red packets being given out, his heart ached very much.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have much money but he still gave each child fifty dollars. With over three hundred children in the Welfare Institute, he lost over ten thousand dollars just like that. How could this not make him heartbroken?</p><br/><p>Of course, it was painful but he still felt very happy.</p><br/><p>Every time he heard the children shouting \u2018Happy New Year, Grandpa Tian!\u2019, that smile on his old face was brighter than anyone else\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had not been married and he did not have any children of his own. Now that the children were all crowding by his side, it made Fraud Tian feel something that he had never felt before.</p><br/><p>He gave out those red packets very decisively without a shred of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m here to pay you a New Year visit.\u201d At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing arrived with his family.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing and instantly smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re here, Ming Qing.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Papa Lin and Mama Lin saw this, they stared blankly with their mouths gaping.</p><br/><p>Question marks appeared in their heads. What was going on?</p><br/><p>What did this old man just call their son?</p><br/><p>Teacher?</p><br/><p>Did they hear it wrongly?</p></div>\n</div>"}

How awesome</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<div class=\"cha-words\"><br/><p>Wu You Lan was a little unwilling when she saw the news. \u201cBrother Lin, do you really think you won\u2019t get the award?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan replied with a smile, \u201cWhy are you caring about that? There\u2019s no need to think about it. If I won\u2019t get it, then so be it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was talking to Wu You Lan, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s call came.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan\u2019s student, Zhao Ming Qing was naturally elated that his teacher had been nominated for the Nobel Prize, so he immediately called to ask about it.</p><br/><p>However, when Lin Fan said that he wouldn\u2019t receive the award this time, Zhao Ming Qing seemed to be in disbelief. After all, he felt that if his teacher didn\u2019t receive it, there was no one else among the nominees whose achievements could compare to his teachers.</p><br/><p>To him, it seemed that his teacher was just saying these things because he was humble.</p><br/><p>After chatting with Zhao Ming Qing on the phone, Lin Fan received several more calls from other good friends who congratulated him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>After all, the leukemia prescription incident was something that everybody knew about, not only within the country but even overseas.</p><br/><p>And Lin Fan responded to those calls one by one. Eventually, he stopped saying that he wouldn\u2019t receive the award. Since everyone felt that he would receive it, he just acted as if it was possible that he might receive it.</p><br/><p>A few days later, an invitation letter came.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan just tossed the invitation letter into the drawer, pretending that it didn\u2019t exist.</p><br/><p>In a certain state in America.</p><br/><p>Hall was in the hospital, accompanying his wife by her side. Most days, he would come to the hospital after working in the research lab. Looking at his wife on the sickbed, his weathered eyes were filled with affection and love. It was the same love he had had for his wife when they had been young.</p><br/><p>When the nurses saw the scene in the ward, they envied the love between the two of them. They hadn\u2019t seen this kind of situation in a long time.</p><br/><p>After staying at the hospital for a while, Hall left the ward and started walking to the hospital exit. He decided to go to the cafe that had been opened by his old friend and spend some time in quiet isolation.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He wondered when he had started becoming so depressed after discovering his wife\u2019s illness.</p><br/><p>Most of the time, he would be in the research lab. Perhaps he didn\u2019t want to see his wife suffering.</p><br/><p>As he was walking inside the hospital, the doctors who saw him were all very respectful.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Hall, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hall would put on a thin smile to face them.</p><br/><p>The cafe.</p><br/><p>When Hall reached, the shop owner, who was Hall\u2019s friend, Jimmy, patted him on the shoulder. \u201cMy old buddy, what would you like today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet me a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very soon, the coffee came. Jimmy sat facing him. \u201cBuddy, don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on being nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. I think you\u2019ll definitely receive the award,\u201d said Jimmy with a smile. He felt very proud of this friend of his.</p><br/><p>Hall didn\u2019t seem to care much about it. What he cared more about was his wife. But it was depressing. Even though he was a medical researcher, he couldn\u2019t help to treat his wife\u2019s illness.</p><br/><p>At that moment, workers were moving things into the shop opposite the cafe which had just been renovated.</p><br/><p>Jimmy realized that Hall was looking at them. He smiled and explained, \u201cThis is a newly-opened Chinese medicine shop. I think that I\u2019ll probably have to smell that awful smell of Chinese medicine while I make my aromatic coffee in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hall shook his head. \u201cA Chinese medicine shop. That\u2019s medicine from China. This school of medicine is controversial because no one can prove its legitimacy scientifically.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jimmy didn\u2019t understand much about this but he responded, \u201cIt\u2019s just an outdated and crude form of medical treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Jimmy realized that Hall was ignoring him and had no idea what was going on. \u201cHall, what is it? What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Hall stood up immediately and, with a furious look on his face, he opened the door and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cB*stards.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Jimmy was stunned. He had no idea what had happened but he chased after him. He knew that this old buddy of his had been stressed and acting abnormally since his wife had contracted the illness.</p><br/><p>The Chinese medicine shop.</p><br/><p>The owner was a Chinese man. At that moment, he was directing the workers on where to place the items. When he saw someone come in, he said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we are arranging our items right now. We aren\u2019t open yet. Please come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Just as he said that, Hall slammed the poster that had been placed outside the door onto the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey you, don\u2019t you know that you\u2019re scamming people?\u201d Hall bellowed furiously. He was so angry that his face had turned red.</p><br/><p>The owner was startled. \u201cMy dear guest, what do you mean? Why am I scamming people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hall pointed at the advertisement. \u201cLook, what are you saying? Leukemia can be cured using Chinese medicine treatment? That\u2019s a blatant lie!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the owner saw that, he instantly understood. \u201cMy dear guest, that is not a lie. It\u2019s the truth. Leukemia can already be cured. The developer of this prescription is a Chinese medicine master from China.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. Hall is a scientist who is nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. If leukemia can be cured, how could he not know?\u201d Jimmy yelled as he entered. Although he was quite old, his eyes were full of vigor.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The owner was taken aback. \u201cNobel Prize in Medicine? Master Lin, who developed this prescription, has been nominated as well. I think you\u2019ll be able to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be\u2026?\u201d Jimmy couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>The owner felt helpless. He had opened this shop planning to use that as his flagship product. He wanted to take advantage of a problem that existed in the area. The results of research in China hadn\u2019t been spread outside of the country. Over here, there were very few Chinese medicine shops, so he thought that his shop would definitely become very popular.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t expected to come across such trouble. All he could do was try to explain things to them.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>One month later.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve received a place in the broadcast for this year\u2019s Nobel Prize Award Ceremony. I\u2019ll be able to watch it on the Internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting in front of the computer for a long time now. I wonder if Master Lin will be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course he will. If he doesn\u2019t go, how will he receive his prize?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Medicine will definitely go to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right. Go and look at Weibo. Master Lin isn\u2019t even going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had posted a selfie. It was a photo of himself acting cute in the shop.</p><br/><p>Then, the comments came. The netizens erupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Is this for real? Master Lin, are you trying to overturn the sky? Have you given up on the award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God. F*cking awesome. He\u2019s f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already thinking about the moment when they call Master Lin\u2019s name and he\u2019s not there. How shocking would that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only say that I am in awe. Even if he won\u2019t get the award, he\u2019d definitely have received the invitation letter. Who on Earth would choose not to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin is just so domineering. He wouldn\u2019t go just because he\u2019s invited.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

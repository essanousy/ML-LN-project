The hard times for Elder Dog are over and the good times are beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the right thing to say. It\u2019s just that his good deeds have finally been discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Hong is really in luck. She has gotten such a good son-in-low thanks to Flowers. And it\u2019s even a famous dog.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Hong is really clever. Her puppies\u2019 values have immediately increased.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Little Boss. We have to celebrate tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Little Boss. If we don\u2019t celebrate, Elder Dog won\u2019t be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard the shop owners\u2019 praises and couldn\u2019t help but feel helpless. He looked at Elder Dog, who seemed to be talking to his little brothers, scolding them for being slow and being caught by those stupid people. They had embarrassed their big brother.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those dogs lowered their heads, looking ashamed.</p><br/><p>They felt undeserving of their big brother\u2019s teachings after being captured by those stupid humans.</p><br/><p>However, when the shop owners\u2019 dear pets came, those dogs who had been scolded dashed towards them to look for their own buddies.</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog saw this, he barked a few times and went to look for his own children to play as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s call it a day. When we bring the prize back, we\u2019ll have a good celebration,\u201d said Lin Fan. He had to let this matter sink in for a bit. The ceremony was going to happen in a few days.</p><br/><p>But he still felt that it was inconceivable that Elder Dog had been chosen. This kind of award ceremonies had very heavy atmospheres because there were many touching and emotional things involved.</p><br/><p>Would it be good for a dog to go there?</p><br/><p>But even after thinking about it, he still couldn\u2019t understand. Perhaps it was really because Elder Dog\u2019s deeds really deserved this award.</p><br/><p>Actually, he counted it, there were several great deeds that Elder Dog had done. As for those minor good deeds, they were countless.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog\u2019s nose was very sensitive. He was also very sensitive to situations. From the previous year until now, he had done many things each day.</p><br/><p>Some of them, even Lin Fan didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>However, the Internet had recorded them. Then, Lin Fan went to take a look on the Internet.</p><br/><p>News from 20th December. Elder Dog smelled a gas leak from a certain home. He knocked open the door and dragged the family of three to the staircase entrance before knocking open the neighbour\u2019s door to get help.</p><br/><p>He really hadn\u2019t known about this incident as he hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the news.</p><br/><p>15th January. Elder Dog discovered a hostage situation at a bank. He battled the two criminals and successfully apprehended them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had some impression of this news but he hadn\u2019t paid much attention to it.</p><br/><p>This website which recorded all of Elder Dog\u2019s deeds seemed to have been set up by one of Elder Dog\u2019s fan groups. There were basically incidents recorded each day. The longest interval between two incidents was only several days.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look and was a little curious. Then, he raised his head and looked outside. Could it be that there was someone who camped at Cloud Street just to follow Elder Dog around? That would really leave him helpless.</p><br/><p>But with Lin Fan\u2019s current powers that enveloped the whole of Cloud Street, he didn\u2019t sense anyone sneaking around. It seemed that that idea wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>The only possibility was that, with today\u2019s interconnected society, there was nothing that could escape the lenses of cameras as well as the phone cameras of the public.</p><br/><p>How valiant. How amazing.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog\u2019s public limelight was also quite valiant. He was almost at Lin Fan\u2019s level.</p><br/><p>As Elder Dog\u2019s owner, if he didn\u2019t work harder and he let Elder Dog catch up with him, he would become inferior to a dog.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>The comments on his Weibo had erupted. When the netizens saw the news about Elder Dog, they had been shocked.</p><br/><p>Initially, this kind of event wouldn\u2019t have drawn much attention on the Internet.</p><br/><p>But this year\u2019s event had drawn so much attention that it exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>It had even become a trending topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! This is crazy. A dog has been chosen. Has the programme crew lost their minds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, this is a humiliation for the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSharing the stage with a dog? Sorry, but I can\u2019t accept that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you retarded? Can you even go on stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo those who are criticizing this decision, please go and look up the news on the Internet about Cloud Street\u2019s Elder Dog. Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t tell you. If you compare yourselves to Elder Dog, you\u2019ll realize that you can\u2019t even match up to a dog..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little arrogant. Can you even match up to this dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit that I can\u2019t. That\u2019s just the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 The two bosses above me are really awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCloud Street had Master Lin. Now, it even has an Elder Dog. This Cloud Street is defying nature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People(Animals). A f*cking dog suddenly appeared. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, very little people would have cared about this. But because a dog had suddenly appeared, they were all dumbfounded. They felt that it was inconceivable. What people had even more trouble understanding was how the programme\u2019s crew chose a dog. Although there had been an Internet poll involved, the final decision had laid in the programme crew\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>To let a dog go on stage on such a sacred and solemn programme, was it fair to the others?</p><br/><p>Indeed, an Internet celebrity soon appeared to start ranting about this incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding a dog being chosen as one of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People, I have something to say. The programme crew must have had their brains shot. They should be gotten rid of. A dog that belongs on the dinner table is actually receiving the award. I can only laugh. The \u2018Touching China\u2019 series has become more and more entertainment and business-oriented.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, but I am not touched at all. I was only moved by this programme crew\u2019s lack of IQ.\u201d</p><br/><p>This Internet celebrity had become famous because of his rants. When he posted these words, it immediately drew the attention of many netizens. Many netizens supported him and felt that he was right.</p><br/><p>And this Internet celebrity was very pleased. He felt that his words were definitely correct.</p><br/><p>He watched as his number of followers increased and was delighted. It seemed that his next advertisement commission would increase by a significant amount.</p><br/><p>Of course, some people who knew about Elder Dog were maniacally refuting this below. Seeing Elder Dog being shamed, they couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>Before this Internet celebrity had become excited for long, something that shocked everyone happened.</p><br/><p>That Internet celebrity\u2019s Weibo was blocked.</p><br/><p>And the Weibo officials suddenly released a public notice.</p><br/><p>\u201c@IamtheBigToxicMouth, hello. Your words have made the princess of Weibo very displeased. You don\u2019t understand Elder Dog\u2019s life, so don\u2019t flame him as you like. Weibo\u2019s boss\u2019s daughter is a fan of Elder Dog and she has always paid attention to Elder Dog. Today, our boss\u2019s daughter has given the word to crush you with authority. Please do not use Weibo ever again. Weibo will not accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The initially furious netizens saw this and went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! 6666\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis authority has been used beautifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you have authority, you can do as you like. And it feels great too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScums like these say that they won\u2019t ever use Weibo again but eventually sneakily start using Weibo again. Sigh. He deserved it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When that Internet celebrity saw this, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p><em>Is this still the same Weibo that allows freedom of speech? My 800,000 fans\u2026</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

Just that name \u2018Lu Li\u2019 was enough. Not just Shanghai, but even the whole country knew this name.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s mega-entrepreneur, with deep roots grown into Shanghai. When he saw this photo, he was startled.</p><br/><p>That day, during that opening ceremony, he had seen the people sitting below the stage but back then, he hadn\u2019t paid much attention. After all, how could there have been such major figures in attendance for the boring opening ceremony of a teaching block?</p><br/><p>But now, he understood that on that day, probably a majority of the people in attendance had been these entrepreneurs.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the people sitting around saw the change in Chen Shi\u2019s facial expression and wondered what had happened. To them, this leader was really strange. He had had a normal expression at first but just within a short period of time, his expression had changed numerous times as if he was acting in an opera. It really made them very curious.</p><br/><p>The secretary, who had been standing behind him, sighed. Although he couldn\u2019t see the leader\u2019s face, he could already imagine it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>That facial expression had probably turned strange a while ago.</p><br/><p>After all, these were all entrepreneurs of Shanghai. If they went against these entrepreneurs, the result would be needless to say. They all knew how that would end up.</p><br/><p>In a city, the most important thing was its economy.</p><br/><p>Initially, he hadn\u2019t known that these people were the entrepreneurs of Shanghai, so he had thought that, with his authority as a government leader, he could show these people his dominance. But now, he understood that he could forget about that. These people were probably capable enough to show their dominance to even his superiors.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, what exactly is that?\u201d someone couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi swallowed his saliva. The words that he had prepared to say had all vanished into nothing.</p><br/><p>*Cough cough* He coughed lightly to release some of his embarrassment. Initially, he had wanted to criticize those people but now, he decided that it was better to forget about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, there isn\u2019t much to share. We\u2019re mainly here to talk about Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s incident. In my opinion, Master Lin\u2019s behavior is something that we could all learn from.\u201d Chen Shi racked his brain for a moment and found a more suitable reason.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>To him, this reason was just nice. It wouldn\u2019t make anyone feel awkward.</p><br/><p>The employees heard this and were stunned. They all knew about the incident at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute but what Chen Shi just said made them a little confused.</p><br/><p>Hadn\u2019t they previously discussed to get Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute regulated? How had the situation turned into this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, when I went to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, I told Master Lin about our Education Department\u2019s wishes but Master Lin rejected it. He didn\u2019t agree with our opinion, so I feel that we should respect Master Lin\u2019s decision and we, the Education Department, mustn\u2019t sit idly by either. We have to give him our greatest support.\u201d Chen Shi\u2019s face wasn\u2019t flushed nor was his heart beating madly. He seemed to say this with a lot of sincerity.</p><br/><p>The employees who were sitting there were all dumbfounded. They instantly felt confused. What the heck did the leader mean? To them, this was completely different from what they had discussed previously.</p><br/><p>The secretary who was standing behind couldn\u2019t help but sigh. <em>A leader is a leader after all. His skin is so thick that it\u2019s scary.</em></p><br/><p><em>But it\u2019s still a fortunate thing. At least Leader\u2019s brain isn\u2019t stupid.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Chen, aren\u2019t we, the Education Department, going to be responsible for Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s education from now on? Why has there been a change all of a sudden?\u201d a small official asked in a confused tone.</p><br/><p>When Chen Shi heard that, his expression gradually changed. <em>Is this guy blind? Can\u2019t he see what\u2019s the situation right now? Could it be that he can\u2019t even tell what kind of people his leader is dealing with?</em></p><br/><p><em>To ask such a retarded question.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In his heart, Chen Shi knew that if he acted impudently and offended that group of entrepreneurs, the outcome would be obvious. Perhaps he would die without even knowing how he died.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need to discuss this matter any further. The outcome is already set. We should believe in Master Lin. I believe that, under Master Lin\u2019s leadership, Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute will definitely be able to give the children the support that we wouldn\u2019t be able to give,\u201d said Chen Shi in a formal tone. Compared to how he had behaved the previous day, it was like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>This made Chen Shi\u2019s secretary completely dumbfounded. <em>A leader is a leader after all. When he speaks, the standard is just so high.</em></p><br/><p>The employees didn\u2019t know what the leader had gone through and had no idea why he would suddenly change his mind like that.</p><br/><p>But now, the outcome was already decided and it wasn\u2019t something that they could change anymore.</p><br/><p>Of course, Chen Shi didn\u2019t agree with this decision either but he had no choice. Besides resolving the matter like this, what else could he possibly do?</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached, all the shop owners surrounded him.</p><br/><p>They had all seen the previous day\u2019s incident. The people who had attended the ceremony were all big shots, people that they might never have the chance to meet in their lives.</p><br/><p>But these big shots had actually attended the children\u2019s welfare institute\u2019s teaching block opening ceremony.</p><br/><p>This made them feel that Master Lin was really too awesome.</p><br/><p>They had to worship him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBoss, those news reporters are all awesome. They dared to use such headlines. Aren\u2019t they afraid of causing problems?\u201d asked Elder Liang doubtfully.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surprised. \u201cWhat problems could there be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang replied, \u201cThat guy is a leader, isn\u2019t he? For the reporters to report about him like that, wouldn\u2019t there be problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. What could possibly happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, a call came.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the phone display, he answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m back,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing, \u201cThe matter in Beijing has been settled. There are basically no problems left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had faith in Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s medical ability. <em>Just look at who\u2019s the one who taught him. How could he be average?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good. What gifts did they prepare for you?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cGifts? There were no gifts. After treating him, I just came back.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he snapped, \u201cF*ck, what is this? You went all the way there and they didn\u2019t even give you any gifts? And you came back just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

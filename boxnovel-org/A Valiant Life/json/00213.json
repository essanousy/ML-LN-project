Lin Fan nodded. \"Sigh, I never thought that it would turn out just as you said.\"</p><br/><p>It was all as Wu Tian He had predicted. It wasn't the first time he had come across such a situation. \"Sigh, those children must be suffering.\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang was broadcasting. He didn't know the full situation so he asked. When Lin Fan described the situation, everyone was astonished. They had never thought that something like this would happen.</p><br/><p>Even the guys in the broadcast room were stunned.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, there are actually parents like these. That's too heartless of them.\"</p><br/><p>\"They don't deserve to be parents.\"</p><br/><p>\"Guys, don't scold them. Put yourselves in their shoes. It's not such an easy choice to make.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, that's heartbreaking. I don't know what else to say.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just sat there, stroking his chin and thinking about things. This matter left him reflecting. He felt that he should have been able to do something but he didn't know what.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \"I think we could do some more meaningful activities, like going to the Children's Welfare Institute to gift the children some toys or play around with them. We should help to bring them some joy, maybe it'll help them forget this tragic incident.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up. \"Hey, that isn't a bad idea. Our shop is only busy in the morning anyway. We're usually pretty free.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, then stood up. \"I've already thought of a name for our group. We'll be called 'Master Lin's Happiness Squad' from now on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was reluctant. \"That sounds a little weird.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan started laughing, \"I think this name is not bad at all, what do you guys think?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian just went with the flow. He would never go against Wu You Lan's wishes. \"It's good, it's very good. This name has character.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed, \"I think it's not bad too.\"</p><br/><p>As for Wu Tian He, it was needless to say. If he didn't support his own daughter, who would he support?</p><br/><p>Several days later, Lin Fan had kept in contact with Liu Xiao Tian throughout. During this period, Liu Xiao Tian had been working his a*s off. Without solving this problem regarding the children, he couldn't eat happily or sleep soundly. However, the good thing was that they had finally finished making arrangements with the newly built Children's Welfare Institute. A few hundred children could move in.</p><br/><p>Most of the parents that they had managed to contact took their children back, apart from a few due to reasons on the parents' side as well as reasons regarding the children's physical well-being. The rest of the cases were settled satisfactorily. However, there were still 650 children, who either were not able to find their parents or were unclaimed by their parents, that moved into the Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>The personal information of these children had already been distributed to each province's police stations, where specialists continued to search for their parents. Perhaps results could be attained soon.</p><br/><p>However, on the bodies of these 650 children, there were disabilities, some more serious than the others. Hence, the largest issue that they faced was whether their parents would claim them. This was another troublesome reality.</p><br/><p>On that day, Cloud Street's shop owners saw that Master Lin's shop was very busy. Wang Ming Yang had called several trucks and there were many children toys in them, along with some food ingredients. The shop owners were puzzled.</p><br/><p>One of them asked, \"Master Lin, what are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled and replied, \"Those children who got kidnapped by the human traffickers have already settled in at the Children's Welfare Institute. We're going there to give them some gifts and also host a meal for the children, hopefully, it'll bring some joy to them.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were stunned. They thought of the delicious food of Master Lin's and their hearts started beating faster. However, when they thought of the fact that Master Lin was cooking for the children, they immediately abolished that previous thought. Those kidnapped children were already so pitiful, how could they possibly try to steal the children's food.</p><br/><p>However, regarding such a meaningful activity, the shop owners were quite interested, so they looked at Lin Fan and asked, \"Master Lin, can we go with you?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was busy working, looked up and smiled. \"Sure, we were just lacking manpower. But you may not be able to eat my dishes over there.\"</p><br/><p>The shop owners waved their hands and said, \"That's not a problem. Such a meaningful activity, we have to join in. We'll notify the rest right now and see if they want to join.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the shop owners from afar and a wide smile appeared on his face. There really were a lot of loving people. This thing was the least he could do.</p><br/><p>These presents and these ingredients had been bought by Lin Fan himself. He earned so much money but had nowhere to spend it, so why not use it meaningfully?</p><br/><p>Not long after, to Lin Fan's shock, all the surrounding shops had been closed by their owners. He hadn't expected this. He had thought that there would only be a few people joining and he hadn't expected everyone to be so proactive.</p><br/><p>A clock shop's owner said with a smile, \"Master Lin, today is the 20th. We feel that this is a meaningful thing. Why, not on the 20th of every month, we close our shops for a day and visit the Children's Welfare Institute as volunteers? Let's make this day a special date for Cloud Street. What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan said anything, the other shop owners started discussing happily, \"This is a great idea! We should have our own culture on Cloud Street. It's settled then. From now on, the 20th of each month will be Cloud Street Volunteer Day. We'll all close our shops for that day.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd, then smiled. \"Looks like I won't be able to get away without tiring myself out today. Everyone is giving their all, so I have to as well. Let's go all out today.\"</p><br/><p>The shop owners said, \"Little Boss, just do your best. Don't tire yourself out too much.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin must be fired up today.\"</p><br/><p>Just like that.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street Volunteer Day on the 20th, it was passed down over time and even became a special culture of the street. Of course, these only happened much later on.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed, \"Brother, you really have the ability to rally supporters.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved this hand, \"How was that my ability? It's because everyone is too kind. Hey, where's your girl?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \"You can't steal a brother's girl, you know? I never thought that you would be thinking of my girl.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"F*ck off. I'm just asking out of concern.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"She got a role in a movie and went to Zhongzhou. She might only be back in a few months. This woman\u2026 Even though she's with this diamond of a young man like me, she still wants to face some struggles on her own, so I let her be.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said seriously, \"Wait patiently. If you miss this chance, you may not find a better woman that's destined for you.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said earnestly, \"Don't worry. Just because of those words from you, I won't leave her even if I'm beaten to death.\"</p><br/><p>The vehicles started moving one by one, towards the Children's Welfare Institute. The shop owners each drove their own private cars as they followed behind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He saw Elder Wang sitting there, listening attentively as if he was afraid that he would lose out if he missed out on anything.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan felt helpless. A grown man actually still believed in this kind of thing.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou explained a bunch of theories. Lin Fan didn\u2019t really understand but he realized that these members were really listening with keen interest. Some of them were even writing notes in their notebooks. It was as if they fully understood what she was saying.</p><br/><p><em>Could it be that my IQ is low? </em>Lin Fan was surprised. Other people were so immersed in listening while he still couldn\u2019t understand anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, let me recommend a few items that will increase the effectiveness of absorbing mysterious elements,\u201d said Teacher Zhou. Then, she gestured to the assistant to bring the items up.</p><br/><p>The first was a flower vase only as big as a palm.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou explained, \u201cAccording to scientific theories, this flower vase has a very mystical function of affecting the magnetic fields around it. It can change the magnetic fields around your body. However, its effectiveness is still rather low. Students who have attended two classes can buy it.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAs for the price, we\u2019ll talk about it later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she took out a Buddha amulet necklace. This Teacher Zhou started to hype it up again and she was exceptional at doing it. This necklace required one to have attended ten lessons in order to buy it.</p><br/><p>And the price would be revealed later on as well.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, these people\u2019s schemes were way too deep.</p><br/><p>They were so deep that it was scary.</p><br/><p>Outside!</p><br/><p>In a sedan, a middle-aged man with spectacles was seated at the back. The driver at the front handed him a cigarette. \u201cTeacher Ma, it\u2019ll be your turn to lecture soon. I hope that you will be able to make those people become more absorbed in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Ma lit up the cigarette. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve been doing this for so many years, how could I slip up?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cOf course you won\u2019t. Teacher Ma has cooperated with us for so long and you\u2019ve managed to shock every crowd.\u201d The driver was sucking up to him. Then, he received a message on his phone. \u201cTeacher Ma, it\u2019s time. You can go up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Wait a while for me to finish this cigarette. Tell those members to wait. If they want to learn the real stuff, they\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d Teacher Ma casually smoked his cigarette. After finishing, he opened the car door and headed inside the hotel.</p><br/><p>On site.</p><br/><p>The place had gone into a maniacal state again.</p><br/><p>The members were following Teacher Zhou and doing some rather difficult actions. For example, taking deep breaths and absorbing the mysterious elements into their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold your breaths. Can you feel the anxiety in your spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, start to take in deep breaths. Big breaths. Use all your strength to breathe as deeply as possible. Do you feel the icy sensation in your body? Your spirit has completely relaxed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve already made it so that you can easily absorb the mysterious elements. When your spirit completely relaxes, close your eyes and normalize your breathing. Do you feel that a blurred image has appeared in your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard these and looked at the surrounding members, he was stupefied.</p><br/><p><em>Are these people stupid? Anyone would feel these things if they did this.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Soon after, Teacher Zhou said, \u201cAlright, the first lesson ends here. Let us invite Teacher Ma into the room.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the members simultaneously looked over at the door as if they were anticipating something.</p><br/><p>They already knew that in the afternoon lesson, a teacher would be coming. This was a true teacher who would be able to teach them even more useful knowledge.</p><br/><p>*Creak!*</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>Teacher Ma entered. Under Teacher Zhou\u2019s lead, the members started clapping in a frenzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s invite Teacher Ma forward. I\u2019ll be doing a brief introduction of Teacher Ma. He\u2019s a first-class Chinese medicine master from the Chinese Medicine Association. He\u2019s also the Vice-Chairman of the Health Association. More importantly, he is the founder of the Ma Family Breathing Technique\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After listing a bunch of titles, the members were all dumbfounded. They only felt one thing, which was that this Teacher Ma was really amazing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the person who had just come in and was a little doubtful. Then, he took out his phone and did a search.</p><br/><p>With one look, he was impressed. It turned out that this person was really a veteran. On the Internet, he had many teaching videos. Lin Fan compared the person on his phone to the person in the room and they were indeed the same person. This guy was also really on the name list of the Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, students,\u201d Teacher Ma said calmly as he stood there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Teacher Ma,\u201d the members replied simultaneously.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Teacher Ma was very pleased with this situation. This was what real students should be like.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I\u2019m going to talk about the theory of the existence of mysterious elements and the kind of mystical sensation that you should feel when you absorb them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think everyone has heard about the five elements of the body: Gold, wood, water, fire, and ground. In Chinese medicine, these really exist. Amongst them, the gold refers to real gold and silver, which means fortune. Fortune is everywhere, but where exactly is it? Actually, it is within the mysterious elements. As long as you can absorb these elements effectively, you would possess fortune. When that happens, become millionaires or billionaires will be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, you all know about the current boss of Yang Tai Insurance Company, right? Perhaps some people may not know, so let me tell you. He\u2019s a senior disciple of yours. He used to be very poor but after he absorbed the mysterious elements around him, he accumulated large amounts of gold energy. That\u2019s how he managed to create such a huge business. Of course, your abilities are not there yet. But with hard work, you will also become like him someday.\u201d</p><br/><p>The members\u2019 hearts had started thumping furiously. They hadn\u2019t thought that the boss of Yang Tai Insurance Company had such a backstory.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Teacher Ma continued his bragging again, \u201cI\u2019m a first-class master from the Chinese Medical Association. And you all know about Master Lin who has been very popular on the Internet recently, right? He\u2019s from the association too. I once went to have tea with Master Lin and we were chatting about this. He kept on praising this method, saying that whoever thought of this technique must be a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe even continued to probe me about this spiritual breathing technique\u2026\u201d Teacher Ma was speaking expressively as if it had really happened.</p><br/><p>Looking at all those eager faces below the stage, he felt as if he had taken over the world.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, he realized that a certain face was very eye-catching. It kept drawing his attention. When he took a look, his heart started racing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was standing there as he kept nodding profusely as if to tell Teacher Mu to carry on and that he was speaking very well.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ma You Min was a member of the Chinese Medical Association. Naturally, he recognized the most famous member of the association, Master Lin. He had always faced obstacles in his profession and hadn\u2019t been able to progress, so he resorted to scamming people with such tricks.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, when he saw Master Lin, he suddenly panicked.</p><br/><p>In his view, Master Lin kept smiling at him and even nodded at him as if to say \u2018Your speech is brilliant. Carry on, I\u2019m listening.\u2019</p><br/><p>*Gulp!*</p><br/><p>He started to stutter with his speech.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou was a little confused as she looked at Ma You Min. <em>What\u2019s going on? You\u2019ve said this speech countless times, how could you stutter?</em></p><br/><p>Then, something that left Teacher Zhou dumbfounded happened.</p><br/><p>Ma You Min suddenly changed the direction of his speech. \u201cMy dear students, what I\u2019ve just said are all nonsense. Mysterious elements do not exist. We were just scamming you of your money. I, Ma You Min has lied to people for so many years and my heart has been tormented. I do not wish to trick you anymore. This flower vase or whatever is only worth ten dollars. We lied to you. Don\u2019t believe us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou lost her mind when she heard this. \u201cTeacher Ma, what nonsense are you spouting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma You Min didn\u2019t bother about her. He pointed at her and said, \u201cShe\u2019s the mastermind behind this. Every time she invites me over, she says that I get twenty percent of the profits from what I trick you all into buying. This isn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The members were all stupefied. They felt as if they had misheard him.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou yelled sharply, \u201cHe\u2019s gone mad. Hurry up and kick him out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma You Min immediately stepped off the stage and went in front of Lin Fan. he said respectfully, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m really innocent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they all turned over and stared at the person who was standing there.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang was even more shocked. \u201cLittle Boss, when did you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cCarry on. I feel like your speech was pretty good. The police are outside, waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>When Ma You Min heard that, he instantly collapsed to the ground in terror.</p><br/><p>That Teacher Zhou panicked as well as she scurried to the door. But when she pushed the door open, she realized that the outside was filled with police officers.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had been eavesdropping the whole time. Then, he looked at Teacher Zhou and said, \u201cThe things you say are really unbelievable. I can\u2019t even understand it. Follow us back to the station and explain to us slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

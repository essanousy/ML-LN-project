The sports reporters really didn\u2019t want to say more. They felt that these answers were too scary.</p><br/><p>In the end, the sports reporters backed off. They had completely given in.</p><br/><p>The entertainment reporters shook their heads as they saw the sports reporters leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys really don\u2019t understand Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If they understood Master Lin fully, they would know how true what Master Lin said is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to give Master Lin a thumbs up. He answered perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that the entertainment reporters hadn\u2019t left and he was curious. \u201cWhat are you all doing? This is sports news. Could it be that you want to report it too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Master Lin, as long as it\u2019s news, we will report it. But they\u2019ve already asked all the questions. Why don\u2019t you just say a few words and brag a little,\u201d said one of the reporters.</p><br/><p>They had really interviewed Lin Fan too many times. Each time something happened, they would be there. Hence, they were used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d Lin Fan was helpless. Since it was like this, he decided to say everything at once. It would also be a way of making things clear for these reporters.</p><br/><p>After all the reporters left, he finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the shop owners laughed. \u201cLittle Boss, your words really shocked those sports reporters. They probably think you were just boasting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cWhat can I do about it? I wasn\u2019t even boasting. I was just speaking the truth. Sometimes, even when I speak the truth, no one believes me. They would rather believe it if I lie to them. These days are tough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into laughter. They had already long gotten used to such situations.</p><br/><p>Back at the shop, Wu You Lan was lying down and playing with her phone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you playing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019m buying tickets. I\u2019m thinking that we should organize an activity for our shop, like going for a vacation or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian heard that, his eyes lit up. \u201cThat\u2019s a good suggestion. I strongly approve of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang chuckled cheerily as well. \u201cActually, I want to go out to play too. We haven\u2019t been out together before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The usually-quiet Wu Tian He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m already old. Going out to explore would help me to relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that everyone agreed to it and he thought about it. \u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go. You Lan, pick a good place and we\u2019ll go when the time comes. Put it at a later date. Don\u2019t make it so rushed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan heard that and smiled elatedly. \u201cOkay, okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t expected Brother Lin to really agree. She felt delighted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. From the opening of the shop until now, he had indeed not gone out to play with everyone before. It wasn\u2019t right of him as the boss. In order to be a good boss, he had to bring his employees out to play.</p><br/><p>Nighttime!</p><br/><p>In hundreds of thousands of households, families were watching the television.</p><br/><p>In a certain household.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Dad, change to the sports channel. Let\u2019s watch football,\u201d said the son.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, I thought that you didn\u2019t like watching these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>The son replied, \u201cDad, you must not know this. I heard that Master Lin played in this match and he was really awesome. We have to take a look and see just how awesome he was.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the father had to agree to the son\u2019s request. Then, he changed the channel to take a look.</p><br/><p>Such scenarios were going on in various households. Due to the spread of the news, everyone was very curious as to what the match was like.</p><br/><p>Although they hadn\u2019t watched it live, watching it on television was not bad either.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sports channel will be broadcasting it tonight. It will be broadcasted on the broadcasting platforms online too. Has everyone prepared your melon seeds and beers?</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know the outcome of the match but I\u2019m still thrilled. I want to see just how awesome Master Lin\u2019s goalkeeping is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis match has been said to be a match like no other. I\u2019m thrilled as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here. I never thought that Master Lin would become a goalkeeper. I was nearly scared to death when I heard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Thinking about how badly the Yokohama F. Marinos have been beaten, I really want to laugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the match began. Everyone sat there as they watched. The first ten minutes were very normal and nothing much was going on. But when that goalkeeper got injured, everyone knew that the important part was coming.</p><br/><p>Even the commentator\u2019s voice started to tremble as if he knew what was going to happen. The commentator hadn\u2019t shown much emotion initially but at this moment, his voice was suddenly filled with tremendous fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the audience in front of your televisions, the Golden Flowers goalkeeper has stepped off the field. Now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pfft!*</p><br/><p>The audience watching the match all spat out water from their mouths. <em>What kind of genius is this? He\u2019s so excited that the Golden Flowers goalkeeper got injured. Isn\u2019t he afraid of being beaten to death?</em></p><br/><p>The show carried on. Meanwhile, the citizens who were watching the match were discussing with their friends.</p><br/><p>But near the end of the match, everyone was completely silent. Their jaws had dropped and their eyes were gaping.</p><br/><p>With this expression, they just sat there until the match ended and they still hadn\u2019t recovered.</p><br/><p>A full five minutes or perhaps even ten minutes had passed before some people regained their senses. And when they regained their senses, the first thing they said was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, all of them charged to the Internet and started posting their comments.</p><br/><p>To them, it was simply as if they had seen a ghost. It was terrifying. It was simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t seen it personally, they definitely wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, Master Lin\u2019s performance had been like a god\u2019s. With him defending the goal, scoring was just a dream. In their hearts, they even felt that Tanaka Hiroshi was really pitiful.</p><br/><p>Because that guy had shot so many balls but, in the end, he had just knelt to the ground and he had even started to doubt his life.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>The sports reporters reported their interview with Master Lin. Most of them felt that Master Lin was too arrogant and they criticized him negatively.</p><br/><p>According to common logic, people would start flaming Master Lin online.</p><br/><p>But something that the sports reporters hadn\u2019t expected happened.</p><br/><p>In the end, they were the ones who were flamed online. Moreover, the comments really left them speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Master Lin said is completely right. He is number one in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Master Lin is being so humble again. After watching the match yesterday, I think he might even be number one in the universe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said. I think so too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo these sports reporters even know how to write? Coach Wu Ze\u2019s vision is great. He was able to see Master Lin\u2019s ability with one look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one in the world. He has proven it with his actions. Let\u2019s see if anyone can prove otherwise.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Anyway, it\u2019s a good thing that we cracked the password. Whatever this computer contains must be important since the hacker paid special attention to it. There must be something special,\u201d Shen Jie Yun said in a serious tone.</p><br/><p>Whatever important document, he had to be the first one to report it.</p><br/><p>After the people standing around heard what he said, they nodded in agreement. Now wasn\u2019t the time to wonder why the password was so easy, but what was inside the computer.</p><br/><p>If there were any confidential documents of national importance, it would blow up to become a huge case.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Shen Jie Yun said, walking up. He wanted to handle this personally. Both his hands were laid on the computer. \u201cNow, let us access the hard drive of the computer to look all the documents that the hacker downloaded recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>The specialists from the Internet Safety Department all fixed their gaze on the computer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Computer Guru\u2019s computer looks rather simple. There\u2019s nothing much on it. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. He hacked so many banks. Why aren\u2019t there any tools or software on his computer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he deleted it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it looks like he did that.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the screen, the numbers continued crunching, and the people standing around all looked on intently.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the computer gave a beeping sound, and Shen Jie Yun exclaimed excitedly. \u201cFound it. He downloaded 8 gigabytes of data yesterday. This is huge! Such a huge document. I wonder what it contains!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVideos. This folder contains videos. Could it be\u2026could it be\u2026\u201d The people from the Internet Safety Department were all watching on in anticipation, anxious to find out what was inside the folder.</p><br/><p>They had met this kind of situation before where they found a video folder and whatever it contained was revolutionary. The folder had contained a video which explained a revolutionary new weapon system.</p><br/><p>Inside contained scientific data and records. If anyone had analyzed it, they would have been able to duplicate the results.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun heaved a sigh. His hands maneuvered the mouse as his body started trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you\u2019ve gotta stay calm. Open it quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. The anticipation is killing me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe really is the Computer Guru, to have been able to download such a large classified file without getting detected. His skills are just too superior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, the wait is killing me! Quick, open it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, whatever we see later stays here. None of this information gets out of these four walls,\u201d Shen Jie Yun said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t you worry boss. This isn\u2019t the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been professionally trained, and our loyalty lies with the nation. We will definitely protect national secrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting assurance from his men, Shen Jie Yun nodded his head, clicking open the video.</p><br/><p>The illustration popped up.</p><br/><p>The screen was momentarily black.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a few Japanese words appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a Japanese file, could it be\u2026?\u201d the people standing around were all shocked. They had never imagined that the secret file that the Computer Guru kept was a Japanese file, and looking at the situation, they were speculating that it could be a top-secret scientific experiment or even national secrets.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, a song blasted through the speakers. This song sounded rather familiar, almost as if they had heard it before.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, this song sounds familiar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKinda sounds like\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe show called ***. It\u2019s the opening song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The video changed scenes.</p><br/><p>The black screen vanished, and in its place were a pair of slender legs. The camera panned upwards, showing a scene of a pretty girl.</p><br/><p>One of the colleagues exclaimed in excitement. \u201cI know who she is! She\u2019s from the company k99 in Japan, Jing Xiang Zhi. She went out to sea for awhile to take this movie. I think\u2026\u201d Just as the colleague was about to continue talking, he suddenly decided to shut up.</p><br/><p>Because he realised that something wasn\u2019t right in the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun looked at the movie as it continued to roll, his face in a daze. He turned around, looking at the rest of his men. \u201cI want your opinions. Do you think I over thought this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you shouldn\u2019t say things like this. You are a professional and this Computer Guru\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Computer Guru isn\u2019t like the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Boss. You shouldn\u2019t blame yourself for this. This really wasn\u2019t your fault. The Computer Guru\u2019s skills were so superior, it wasn\u2019t wrong to think of him like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this\u2026\u201d Shen Jie Yun looked at the video. The meaning was clear. The video was for his own personal viewing.</p><br/><p>Elder He was a password cracking specialist, and apart from computers, he did nothing else, staying at home almost all the time. As he looked at the video, he realised that something was different. \u201cEh, this one is the uncensored version. She only had the censored ones before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother He, you realised it too? Where did the Computer Guru download this from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is good stuff. Do you guys have a USB thumb drive? Since I travelled so far just to get here, I might as well copy this video as consolation,\u201d Elder He said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want a copy too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, come. One by one.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bunch of people who ever only spent most of their time on their computers. When they saw the new porn video released, all of them suddenly became excited. For them, apart from their computer job, they relied on all these videos to get them through the night.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The internet was exploding with crazy reactions from everyone.</p><br/><p>\u2018The master hacker has been caught, and he is Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018In the name of justice, to expose scammers, Master Lin broke the law and was taken in by the police. The outcome is still unknown.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A shocking thing is happening across the country. Scammers are surrendering themselves to the authorities by themselves.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018An analyst\u2019s take on Master Lin\u2019s case.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Hacking the bank and police servers will result in a hefty jail sentence.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The morning working crowd were all shocked and astonished at what had happened as they scrolled through the headlines on their way to work.</p><br/><p>They felt that something was starkly different.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo was crowded with activity.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is this real? Master Lin just got taken in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did they arrest Master Lin? What he did was a good deed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. The person I respect most is and always will be Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I never thought that Master Lin was a highly skilled hacker. Who can beat him in hacking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the guys from the Internet Safety Department were defeated by him and their identities were all exposed. Is there anything else that needs to be said? This guy is just freaking awesome. \u201d</p><br/><p>This case had made all the netizens astonished. They had seen other related news before of malicious hackers who hacked into some place and were then caught and taken away.</p><br/><p>From their viewpoint, those hackers were already something special, and Master Lin took it a step further. Awesome was not enough to describe it. It was heaven-defying to have been able to hack into all the national banks and the police servers. No one in history had ever done it before.</p><br/><p>Even the international hackers who were \u2018highly skilled\u2019 couldn\u2019t compare to Master Lin at all.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang rushed over, grabbing Fraud Tian by the shoulders. \u201cWhat happened to my bro? Why was he taken in by the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what to say. Just watch the news. I don\u2019t know how this one will turn out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was flabbergasted. It was as if he had seen a ghost, as he started to become even more anxious as the time passed.</p><br/><p>Hacking into the national Bank and police servers. This was huge.</p><br/><p>Even he didn\u2019t have the ability to get Lin Fan out of this problem.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wang Ming Yang panicked, as he went around asking for the story and for new developments.</p><br/><p>He had tried to call Lin Fan\u2019s cell phone, but he couldn\u2019t get through. He was anxious and was completely at a loss for what to do.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It seems like all hope is lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>A news article appeared from a coastal news publication company.</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned when they saw it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that can\u2019t be. Is it true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this must be false. How can Master Lin be infected? Go eat sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is true. It\u2019s the latest news. Everyone, don\u2019t wait anymore. Master Lin was infected. I\u2019m afraid we will not get to eat scallion pancakes anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis publication company is spouting rubbish. I have been waiting outside the academy and I did not hear this at all. You must be asking for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a lot of people expressed their views on this. Many people believed in what the news article reported.</p><br/><p>They were simply oblivious to the sly methods used by the media to generate hype and uncertainty. In the end, they were the ones being cheated.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the netizens started to send their well-wishes for Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The shop owners of Cloud Street were stunned when they saw the news.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was furious. \u201cThis publication company must be sick. How can they say that about Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen added, \u201cIt\u2019s too much. Little Boss is trying to save the world and someone is trying to use him to create fake news. He must be heartless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \u201cThese people are heartless. They would do anything to increase their viewership. It\u2019s not professional at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters of Shanghai were agitated after reading that.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this is literally bullsh*t. They\u2019re tarnishing our reputation as reporters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we have to protest against it. They are maligning Master Lin. They should know how impactful it would be if Master Lin were to succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. What\u2019s the name of this company? I\u2019m going to start a war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and protest against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters of Shanghai gathered together and expressed their views on the article. They did not want people to damage the reputation of their beloved Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in a certain office located in a coastal city.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHAHA!\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire office laughed after seeing what was happening online. They felt that they had succeeded in making an impact on the netizens.</p><br/><p>Everyone was making reports about whether Master Lin would succeed, but they thought about it in a different way. They wanted to gain as much viewership as possible.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they wrote the article in a very convincing manner.</p><br/><p>Of course, it only managed to convince those that were not well-informed.</p><br/><p>For example, they used a picture of Master Lin embracing Yuan Yuan. Then, they stated that nobody would dare to embrace someone who had AIDS. Hence, the only possibility was that Master Lin had AIDS too.</p><br/><p>Also, they said that Master Lin had AIDS because he was willing to eradicate it fearlessly.</p><br/><p>Those netizens who were not well-informed believed the news article. After all, the news article was well written.</p><br/><p>Then, a group of reporters entered the room anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, it\u2019s not looking good. The reporters in Shanghai are trying to get us to write a public apology,\u201d said a reporter. They really did not expect this at all. They were not even talking about the Shanghai reporters. Why did they do that?</p><br/><p>The Director continued smoking and did not seem like he was affected by it at all. He just sat back in his chair and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just let them be. Don\u2019t you think we\u2019re doing great with this article?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the public viewership numbers?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters had been taking note of those numbers. \u201cDirector, the news article was re-posted a lot since we published it. It\u2019s viewed by more than 100,000 people and it\u2019s still increasing. We might even hit 500,000 soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director smiled and lightly tapped his cigarette. \u201cThat\u2019s a little too low. I think we will hit at least 500,000 people and possibly even a million people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was stunned after hearing that. \u201cDirector, is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not imagine how crazy it would be for them to hit a million views.</p><br/><p>However, he was still worried. \u201cDirector, do you think it will cause any trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director waved his hand. \u201cNope, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just our deduction, and it\u2019s not like we confirmed anything. We clearly stated that it was just a possibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter\u2019s forehead was filled with sweat. He did not expect the Director to say that. The statement about it being a possibility was written in a small font and people would not have noticed it if they did not look closely.</p><br/><p>However, it was the first time that he had received a high viewership rate like this. In the past, they never achieved anything like this before.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>There was a commotion outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, something\u2019s wrong. Someone\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director was stunned after hearing that. He wondered who it was. When he saw the person that came, his heart skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>Why did the police come?</p><br/><p>The policeman was holding a piece of paper which was a printed copy of the article that was published. \u201cWas this written by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director felt that something was wrong. He hesitated for a moment and wanted to say that he did not write that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t have to ask. According to sources, you wrote this. Just follow us to the police station. We are charging you for slander and causing a negative impact online.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a reporter, how could you permit false articles like this to be written? Don\u2019t you know the impact of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter\u2019s face turned pale after hearing that. He did not expect his Director to be taken away just like that.</p></div>\n</div>"}

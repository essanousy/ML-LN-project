In the past, he had had his doubts about Chinese medicine but now, they had gradually been dispelled.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Of course, in the end, with the reporters witnessing, the two of them took a photo together and the award was presented.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan was very young, Edward did not underestimate him at all.<em>This is a genius. A true medical scientist.</em></p><br/><p>The reporters rushed to capture photos of them.</p><br/><p>For the Nobel Foundation Chairman to personally come to China to present the award to Lin Fan, such a situation had never happened before.</p><br/><p>The reporters had a hot topic to report the next day now and just thinking about it made them excited.</p><br/><p>Finally, Lin Fan sent Edward off.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He had a pretty good impression of this old man. Thinking of how this old man had traveled thousands of miles in order to bring the award over and had even apologized to him, Lin Fan felt that he was very sincere.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang hurriedly unlocked his phone and started a broadcast. He held the trophy with both hands. \u201cAwesome. I\u2019m already this old and I haven\u2019t even touched something like this before. I didn\u2019t think I would be able to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to find a good place to put this thing,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to bring it home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of bringing it home where no one will be able to see it? Of course, I have to put it where people can see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian cursed in his heart. <em>This guy definitely wants to show off. But forget it. Show off then.</em></p><br/><p>Placing it in the shop felt pretty good to Fraud Tian too. It would show that he was someone who worked in a shop with a Nobel Prize.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It might even give him some luck with the ladies.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, what are you making a ruckus about today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a good mood. I don\u2019t want to watch you. Master Lin didn\u2019t get the award, so my heart is aching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what the f*ck? What is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like a trophy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the comments in the broadcast room and laughed cunningly. \u201cBrothers, do you understand now? Do you know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens saw Zhao Zhong Yang trying to build up suspense and they became impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending rockets. Hurry up and tell us before we beat you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stop watching.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve reported you already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Brother Yang, if you keep on being like this, we won\u2019t be good friends anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw that it was about time, so he turned the trophy around and exclaimed giddily, \u201cSee this? This is the trophy for the Nobel Prize in Medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the netizens in the broadcast room saw this, they instantly lost their minds.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What the f*ck is going on? Where did this trophy come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, hurry up and tell us. Is this Master Lin\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Are you stupid? Of course it\u2019s Master Lin\u2019s. Did you think it was Brother Yang\u2019s? With his IQ, how could he get this trophy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cYour words are hurting me badly. Let me tell you, if this continues, I\u2019ll stop the broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. Brother Yang, Daddy Yang, it was our mistake. We were wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSending rockets over. Brother Yang is so dashing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded contently. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it. Alright, I\u2019ll tell you guys then. Is this trophy Master Lin\u2019s? Do you know why it\u2019s here? The Nobel Foundation Chairman personally delivered it here. Is that cool or what?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Zhong Yang said that, the netizens in the broadcast room went crazy.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 That\u2019s way too f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOther people have to go to the venue to receive the ward while Master Lin just sits at home and waits for people to deliver it to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bringing glory to our country. Brother Lin has found a great person to cling on to.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the broadcasting officials saw the content of Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s broadcast, they immediately put it on the highly-recommended page without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Brother Yang shows you the Nobel Prize trophy\u2019</p><br/><p>When this title came out, it instantly drew the attention of many netizens. To them, this broadcast title was enticing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cAlright, now, let\u2019s turn the lens over to Master Lin and let him express some of his thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting there and drinking his tea. When he saw the situation with Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s broadcast, he felt helpless. <em>This guy broadcasts from morning to night, isn\u2019t he tired? And those netizens watch the broadcast from morning to night as well, don\u2019t they have to go to work?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHello, dear brothers.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand at the camera as he drank his tea.</p><br/><p>To many netizens, Master Lin was really a god. Average people wouldn\u2019t be able to reach his status.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Netizens that had been watching the broadcast for a long time recalled that in the past, Master Lin hadn\u2019t been so awesome. He would just come to the shop to sell scallion pancakes and do some fortune-telling. But now, he had completely taken flight.</p><br/><p>His fan count on Weibo had gone past 10 million. He had flamed various famous celebrities, conquered leukemia, and now, he had reached the pinnacle of the medical world by receiving the Nobel Prize in Medicine.</p><br/><p>Even if Master Lin wasn\u2019t scared, people who had been watching him had already become scared.</p><br/><p><em>Is he still a f*cking human?</em></p><br/><p>He was simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please share your thoughts. How do you feel about getting the award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I really admire you. I won\u2019t submit to anyone else but you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my idol!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at these comments, Lin Fan laughed subtly. \u201cThoughts, eh? I have no thoughts. This is a very normal thing. It\u2019s just a Nobel Prize, isn\u2019t it? If I want to, I can actually get many more awards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c6666\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop watching. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI promised my mommy that I wouldn\u2019t kill anyone today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, ever since Brother Yang started following you, he has started to show off to us. He wasn\u2019t like this in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cEnough jokes. To be able to receive the Nobel Prize, I am very happy. It is an honor as well. As for what I said earlier, don\u2019t record it. Otherwise, if it is spread, people will say that I\u2019m arrogant and cocky. But actually, even if you do spread it, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m already used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s words are really nice to hear. I love hearing Master Lin brag.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan Brother Yang stop broadcasting from now on? Just let Master Lin interact with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang charged forward as he looked at the comments in the broadcast room. His heart suddenly felt cold and he even felt like crying.</p><br/><p>His own army of fans had been completely taken over by Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>After broadcasting for a while, Lin Fan passed the phone back to Zhao Zhong Yang. He felt that the next day would probably be insane.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news was out.</p><br/><p>The news about Nobel Foundation Chairman, Edward, personally coming to Shanghai\u2019s Cloud Street had been reported.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2018Nobel Foundation Chairman personally brings the prize to Shanghai to present it to Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin and Edward chat happily.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin performs his godly Chinese medicine techniques on site. He points out all the problems with Edward\u2019s body. Edward is in awe of Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The first person in history to have the Nobel Prize delivered to him by the Nobel Foundation.\u2019</p><br/><p>These news headlines were domineering and they instantly stole the spotlight.</p><br/><p>Recently, there had been a celebrity\u2019s divorce case that had gone viral but unfortunately, when the news regarding the Nobel Prize came out, the celebrity had to take a step back.</p><br/><p>Initially, that celebrity had wanted to use his relations to snatch the headlines but he was warned against it.</p><br/><p>If it had been other people, perhaps it would have been possible. However, this incident involved Master Lin.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people who dared to snatch the headlines from Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Although they would not get beaten up, they were afraid of getting caught by Master Lin. if that were to happen, it would be a real mess.</p></div>\n</div>"}

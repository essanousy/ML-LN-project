Then, he posted them on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Whenever the netizens saw a new video, they clicked it instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Master Lin is too ferocious. That line he said was brilliant. He\u2019s a hooligan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s not right. How is Master Lin a hooligan? There must be some kind of misunderstanding. But these association people are probably getting angered to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. They can\u2019t win him in a fight and they can\u2019t even win him in an argument. I feel like Beijing association is now facing its most embarrassing situation in history. I wonder if they will surrender in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very likely. Just wait. I\u2019d dare to guarantee that the Beijing association will definitely surrender.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were debating in a frenzy. They were really supportive of Master Lin crushing the Beijing association.</p><br/><p>On-site, the atmosphere suddenly became stifling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d Vice-President Jiang didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. He could swear that there was something wrong with this Master Lin\u2019s brain. How could any normal person do something like that?</p><br/><p>President Chen looked at the situation and his head started to ache. He even had an urge to puke out blood.</p><br/><p>What the heck was this? If they don\u2019t handle this well, they wouldn\u2019t know where to hide their shame in the future.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look at the time. It was not early anymore. Later on, he would have to take a plane back and he would probably only get back at night. Hence, he didn\u2019t want to waste any more time here.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say the word. Take back the order and I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, the surrounding association members\u2019 jaws dropped. He wasn\u2019t giving them a chance at all. He was leaving them with no way out. He just demanded the Beijing association to take back the order.</p><br/><p>They had no idea what the President would do. If the President were to agree, he would lose his face.</p><br/><p>But if he were to disagree, who knew what this Master Lin would do?</p><br/><p>Would he really crush the association?</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, President\u2026\u201d at that moment, shouts came from outside.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao rushed in with his men. They had been taught a lesson by Master Lin previously and their bodies had been aching very much. But now, they had recovered and they felt perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao was really furious. He hadn\u2019t expected someone to come and attack the Beijing association and even beat them up.</p><br/><p>And later on, someone had even come to take pictures of them. It was truly abominable. He couldn\u2019t stand it at all.</p><br/><p>Now that he was rushing over, it was to report this incident. However, when he reached the conference hall, he saw that figure.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one who groaned. Even all those association members behind him groaned as well.</p><br/><p>They could not forget that terrifying scene. It had simply been too scary.</p><br/><p>Initially, they had felt that they were quite powerful. But when they went against Master Lin, they couldn\u2019t even touch his sleeves before being beaten to the ground helplessly.</p><br/><p>When Vice-President Jiang saw who had come, he instantly gained some confidence. \u201cDirector Huang, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and get this man out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Hao was flustered and exasperated but he didn\u2019t go forward. Instead, he stayed far away as he shouted, \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding association members didn\u2019t dare to go forward either. They stayed close behind Huang Hao.</p><br/><p>They swore that they would definitely not go forward this time. If they did, they would get beaten. Their difference in strength was too great. They couldn\u2019t compete with Master Lin at all.</p><br/><p>When Vice-President Jiang saw that Director Huang was only standing there and talking instead of going forward, he became impatient. \u201cDirector Huang, what are you standing there for? Hurry up and chase him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Huang Hao heard the Vice-President\u2019s order, he yelled angrily, \u201cLin, hurry up and leave. This isn\u2019t a place where you can act unbridled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him and took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2026\u201d Huang Hao trembled violently and took a step back, clearly afraid. And his men did the same as well.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t want to go against Master Lin anymore. They weren\u2019t on the same level at all. If they were to make a move, it would definitely end tragically.</p><br/><p>President Chen stood next to the leader and was speaking softly. Now that this had happened, they felt ashamed. As the headquarters, they were being attacked by this Master Lin and no one dared to retaliate. If the leader hadn\u2019t been around, it wouldn\u2019t have been too bad. But the main problem was that the leader had already seen everything.</p><br/><p>They had nowhere to hide their shame.</p><br/><p>But this Beijing leader was a big supporter of Master Lin. Although the current situation didn\u2019t seem right, he eagerly wanted to chat with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, if there\u2019s a problem, let\u2019s discuss it properly. With me around, I\u2019ll make sure this matter is settled fairly.\u201d The middle-aged leader was all smiles.</p><br/><p>Here in Beijing, his appointment didn\u2019t amount to much at all.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, although this Master Lin had no authority, he was f*cking awesome.</p><br/><p>Right now, the ten artworks were still placed in the museum for everyone to see. The number of daily visitors was at an all-time high.</p><br/><p>Some master artists would even come personally just to view those ten artworks.</p><br/><p>Even a leader wouldn\u2019t dare to offend such a cultured man like him.</p><br/><p>And Master Lin even knew Chinese medicine and he had conquered several troublesome illnesses. That had raised his reputation even more. Who would go against Master Lin for no reason?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the leader\u2019s gaze turned to the association president. \u201cPresident Chen, you must have made some kind of bad decision that angered Master Lin so much. You should review it properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>When President Chen heard this, he was dumbfounded. He even thought of dying.</p><br/><p>We made <em>a bad decision?</em></p><br/><p><em>That\u2019s unreasonable! He\u2019s the one attacking us!</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected this leader to take his side but he was an honest man. He wouldn\u2019t push the blame to the other party. Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It\u2019s very normal for the association president to be transferred but I just don\u2019t like this transfer so I came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen and rest seemed to calm down a little. He turned to Lin Fan as his expression seemed to say \u2018It\u2019s good that you know\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, the leader waved his hand. \u201cI think that may not be the case. Any human would commit mistakes. Even those in high positions cannot guarantee that every decision they make is right. Hence, President Chen\u2019s decision may not be right.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Chen had not expected this leader to stand on Master Lin\u2019s side. It was completely unreasonable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard that and waved his hand. \u201cLeader, you should stop talking. They weren\u2019t wrong regarding this matter. Transferring our president is within their authority. But protesting is within my authority as well. Right now, I am very displeased with this transfer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say it. Are you going to change your order or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the place turned silent. Everyone looked at each other, not knowing how to reply.</p></div>\n</div>"}

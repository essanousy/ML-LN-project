They had already dominated the internet sphere.</p><br/><p>What Godly Doctor brat? He just collapsed at the first blow! How much could one person do against them? From what they knew, it was like taking candy from a baby.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s mood was good.</p><br/><p>However, Professor Yang was still worried. He felt uncomfortable on the inside, and he couldn\u2019t figure out what was causing it.</p><br/><p>One of the Specialists smiled at him, \u201cProfessor Yang, what\u2019s the matter? What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang shook his head. \u201cNot sure, I just feel that something isn\u2019t right, but I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh? What couldn\u2019t be right now? Do you think that brat can change everything by himself? Look at all the comments online! They are all in favor of us! However, that brat does have some fans and they did help to speak up for him. But compared to the millions of people using the internet, the number of fans he has can\u2019t even compare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe argument has fallen in our favor. What is there to worry about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can we say? We continue to promote our cause. His name has already been trampled on by us. However, we cannot be too narrow-minded and have to continue to do what we are doing, promoting the book with our names to all the Chinese Medicine institutions. Furthermore, I\u2019ve already discussed with some people. When they promote the book, I asked them to single out his name and to say all the bad things about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this tactic is just brilliant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, this kid looks like he has accepted his place. Looks like someone is scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave it like this. We need to add some fuel to the flames.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang sat down at one corner. He was forgetting something but he didn\u2019t know what!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Newspaper Office.</p><br/><p>The journalists made their way back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe got ourselves a huge piece of news!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll those Senior Professors were the ones who purposely defrauded Master Lin, and we have video graphic proof.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the Editor in Chief finished watching the video, his facial expression turned solemn. \u201cThese people are just too despicable. I thought that journalists were good at distorting truths, but these guys are just way craftier and sneaky. No, this cannot happen. Master Lin is the pride of Shanghai and we must get this video out to protect him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t do that. Master Lin instructed us not to upload the video if the Senior Professors made an official apology. He said that if this video were to get out, the impact would be huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Editor in Chief gave a serious look. \u201cPay attention to the situation online. If any of those Senior Professors decide to come out to slander Master Lin, upload the video immediately. Put it on the biggest billboard and let the whole world see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Editor in Chief\u2019s instructions was handed down to every single newspaper office in the nation.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s first Chinese Medicine Institution.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was panting with rage in his office.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, this is the new material handed to us by the Ministry of Education. Let us do an introduction to it.\u201d the headmaster of the school came over, showing Zhao Ming Qing the new books.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was in a bad mood. The new teaching material was perfect, albeit the authorship of the book, and that made him really angry. \u201cYou can give an introduction to the book, but remove all the names of the authors except for Lin Fan\u2019s name.\u201d</p><br/><p>The headmaster said worried. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a good thing to do. These books were issued by the Ministry of Education.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn. I\u2019m the director of this institution and I say that you bring it back and get the authorship changed before you do the introduction. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><br/><p>The headmaster nodded. Alright, since the director has spoken, so be it.</p><br/><p>Online.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Master Lin still keeping silent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, it has been quite a long time. All these old farts are just despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Master Lin may have admitted defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish? If Master Lin admits defeat, I\u2019ll eat my own d*ck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t rubbish. Have you seen what kind of people the Senior Professors are? They have connections throughout the whole industry and no one would dare to say anything against them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he a member of the Chinese Medicine Association? How come there is no one inside to help voice out Master Lin\u2019s problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys know about it? Everyone knows them and holds them in high regard. Helping Master Lin would be as good as betraying a friend, and so the best solution was to keep quiet, as if the problem didn\u2019t happen at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, as the member of the twelve most loyal fans of Master Lin, I simply cannot take this. I already wrote hundreds of comments on the Weibo pages of the Senior Professors and I\u2019m ready to do more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The current situation was really messy. Most people didn\u2019t know what was going on, but the fans of Master Lin continued to remain loyal and trusted him absolutely. The only problem was that they were outnumbered by the other netizens and couldn\u2019t scold the senior professors enough to make an impact.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin was just one person, and he was against a group of powerful men- he would definitely be crushed.</p><br/><p>The internet was still siding on the side against Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, there isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s really minor,\u201d Lin Fan said over the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a small issue. Your dad already said those guys are Senior Professors! How could you fight with those Senior Professors?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s mother said over the phone, worried about her son.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong. Your son just wrote some educational material and all of them decided to add their names to the authorship of the books without my approval, and so a conflict broke out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of that? You were the one to write the book, why do they have to sign their names as well?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s mother asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cThey wanted to ride on my prestige and popularity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? These buggers dare to cheapen the hard work of my son? Don\u2019t worry son, your father and I are your biggest supporters. Don\u2019t be scared of them, but of course, don\u2019t break the law again.\u201d Mother Lin said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Don\u2019t you worry,\u201d Lin Fan helplessly said. Could it be that all they thought of him was him loving to break the law?</p><br/><p>Thereafter, Lin Fan opened his Weibo, and he couldn\u2019t stand the sight of it.</p><br/><p>The group of Senior Professors continued to bash Lin Fan online and they had a lot of supporters. Although some of them didn\u2019t bash him directly, their posts conveyed the meaning that Lin Fan was wrong, narrow-minded and only cared about his fame.</p><br/><p>And this problem was getting out of hand.</p><br/><p>There were even a few bigshots who came to criticize Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has the skills of a fine doctor but no morals. He isn\u2019t suited to be in this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>That comment was rather critical, but Lin Fan just brushed it off. This b*stard, I\u2019ll let you have your fill now. You will regret it later.</p><br/><p>\u201cEditor in Chief, should we post the video now? All those Senior Professors are getting out of hand. We have to play our trump card.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, it is time. Didn\u2019t Master Lin say it? If they apologize, he\u2019ll let them go, but if they don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Every single news agency started getting into motion.</p><br/><p>They had been waiting impatiently, their hands holding on to the important evidence that Lin Fan had sent them, yet unable to expose it. This was slowly killing them on the inside.</p><br/><p>But now, those Senior Professors were getting out of hand. All they ever did whole day was rant about Lin Fan online, and it was time to take action against them.</p><br/><p>Once they released the video for everyone to watch, it would be over for the Senior Professors, and as if it wasn\u2019t enough, the Editor in Chief took up the pen himself to write the news article, preparing for a huge storm.</p></div>\n</div>"}

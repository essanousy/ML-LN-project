If this matter were to be blown up, who knew what consequences it would bring?</p><br/><p>\u201cStudents, please keep quiet,\u201d the headmaster immediately tried to calm the people down upon reaching the scene.</p><br/><p>Those students that were holding the banners looked at the headmaster and started talking to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe want Jin Shan Ping to leave the school. She has gravely affected our psychological health.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Whenever I think of her face, I will have nightmares. That will affect my energy level for the next day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe want the school to expel her and give us a pleasant learning environment again.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the ladies said, \u201cHeadmaster, if she were to continue staying in school, we will withdraw from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others also agreed with what she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can only choose her or us. Whenever I see her face, I get goosebumps all over my body. If I were to see her in the toilet at night, I would be shocked to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The headmaster looked at the students and furrowed his brows. They really had no leniency. They had received a lot of reports about this matter. In the end, they had a meeting and they decided to expel her. Although the official statement had been announced, nothing was confirmed yet. They still had to speak to the student to get her understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, shut up,\u201d the headmaster said loudly and sternly.</p><br/><p>The students kept quiet and they just waited there.</p><br/><p>After asking the teachers, the headmaster knew which hostel Jin Shan Ping stayed at. He brought some people there and hoped to be able to discuss it with her.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping sat in her room feeling really uneasy. She heard everything that was said outside. She really didn\u2019t want to leave the University because he wanted to finish her studies.</p><br/><p>However, she felt that nobody wanted to give her the opportunity to finish it.</p><br/><p>*knock knock*</p><br/><p>After hearing the sound of the door being knocked, she trembled in fear. She felt that something bad was about to happen. However, she still opened the door. When she saw the people outside, she felt as if she couldn\u2019t breathe anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, headmaster and teachers,\u201d Jin Shan Ping greeted respectfully.</p><br/><p>When the headmaster and the teachers saw Jin Shan Ping\u2019s face, they felt as if the air had become still. It was horrifying. It was indeed horrifying.</p><br/><p>They went into the room.</p><br/><p>The headmaster said, \u201cYou should\u2019ve understood what had happened by now. We\u2019re all helpless about this. Because you really affected the other students and they\u2019re unhappy about it. Therefore, I am going to have to expel you. Do you understand that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping was anxious after hearing that, \u201cHeadmaster, can you not expel me? I really want to finish my University education. I didn\u2019t cause fear in any student. I always wore a mask and a hat whenever I go out. Furthermore, I have never left my hostel at night before.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was so emotional that she almost knelt down in front of the headmaster.</p><br/><p>The headmaster felt that her face looked scarier with every look at her. He was horrified and he couldn\u2019t look at her anymore.</p><br/><p>Then, he finally understood what the students were feeling. Gradually, he began to side the students that made a big fuss out of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t say anything now. This matter has been decided. Just pack up and leave by this week.\u201d The headmaster didn\u2019t say anything else. He just wanted to leave the room as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>It was as if it would affect his mood if he stayed any longer.</p><br/><p>The headmaster walked out and announced the final outcome to the students.</p><br/><p>When the students heard that, they laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, nice! It feels amazing. We finally won!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live, my school!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the headmaster saw that, he nodded happily. He finally resolved this issue.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those students that didn\u2019t support the decision just stood there helplessly. They couldn\u2019t have done anything and they just sighed.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping felt as if her life was over. She felt that she had lost it ever since that incident three years ago. Now, she was only struggling while death was waiting for her.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know if what she did that time was worth it but she knew that her life was hopeless now.</p><br/><p>Despair and sadness filled her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when most of the students were cheering, a voice came.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, why is she outside? Ugh, my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so scary. Don\u2019t let us see your face. It\u2019s too horrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost. Get lost now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the students that were carrying the banners, covered their eyes. While the other students scolded and shouted. They felt as if they were being hurt.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping lowered her head after being abused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have caused the inconvenience. I really want to continue studying. Can you give me a chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, get out of our school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, whenever I see you, I can\u2019t continue studying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was scrolling through Weibo. He didn\u2019t really continue reading about the school\u2019s incident. However, someone sent him a private message.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the message and realized that it was a video. His calmness slowly disappeared as he watched the video.</p><br/><p>After watching it, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He immediately cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so loud that it shocked everyone in the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gasped, \u201cWhat the, what happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately stood up, \u201cDon\u2019t care about me. F*cking hell, I\u2019m so angry. Looks like I have to do something about this today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Everyone just stared at each other curiously. They didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>He was infuriated after watching the video. How could the students do that to her?</p><br/><p>The mockery in the video was too infuriating.</p><br/><p>In the end, he posted it on Weibo without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: I won\u2019t say anything else. I\u2019ll have to be a busybody today. Nobody shall stop me.</p><br/><p>The netizens who were active on Weibo didn\u2019t know what had happened. Who made their precious one so furious? However, when they watched the video, they were furious too.</p><br/><p>*F*ck, that\u2019s too much. Count me in. I am going to skip class to go to that stupid University to take a look at these idiotic students.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I\u2019m not in Shanghai. If I was in Shanghai, I would rush there too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the leaders in school mentally unsound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating. It\u2019s really infuriating. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers and sisters of Shanghai, let\u2019s go to Jin He University now to take a look. In the past 30+ years of my life, it\u2019s the first time I want to do something about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re such bullies. They can\u2019t bully her like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we support you. All the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

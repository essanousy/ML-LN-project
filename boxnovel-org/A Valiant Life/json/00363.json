He thought that nobody would've been able to find him but it seemed like he had to protect himself better.</p><br/><p>Hangzhou was a good place.</p><br/><p>Although the weather was a little hot, had bought a new set of clothes as well as a mask, a cap and a pair of sunglasses. He wanted to cover himself up. If someone were to find out about his identity, then he'd surrender himself.</p><br/><p>At a big hospital in Hangzhou.</p><br/><p>He just walked around the hospital and they had no problems with it. It was a normal sight in the hospital because of albino people who had to cover their bodies up to prevent exposure to the sun.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had experienced the hospital environment for a few times now and it wasn't a good feeling. One would feel low and depressed in hospitals because there seemed to be a form of repression.</p><br/><p>He looked around and some of the people there had minor illnesses while others had major illnesses. Life is always changing and people have to take care of themselves. If one contracts an illness, it'd be disastrous. A minor illness can cause suffering and a major one can cause the person to break the bank too.</p><br/><p>Based on his past experiences, he already had an idea of what he was going to do. The secret 'weapon' was in his backpack</p><br/><p>He looked around but didn't find anyone suitable. He was extremely cautious. He didn't have any professional medical certificates and if he was arrested, he'd definitely suffer a tragic fate.</p><br/><p>Then, from the lobby came a loud noise.</p><br/><p>\"Move away, let the doctor come over.\"</p><br/><p>There was a commotion in the lobby and everyone was gathered there. Patients were sitting in the wheelchairs. There were limited wheelchairs and some people were left lying on the ground. There was blood all over and bits of metal pieces on their bodies. It was a horrific sight.</p><br/><p>\"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>\"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>A lot of people were shocked at this sight. Those people had been badly mutilated and it was a painful sight.</p><br/><p>\"It was a car accident. The bus collided with a big lorry. The passengers were heavily injured and some of them are losing their breath.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the nurses were so anxious that they started to tear up. The doctors had already been informed but the number of casualties was simply too great and they couldn't operate on all of them. They could only choose those that were more heavily injured.</p><br/><p>Some of the family members came and when they saw their affected family members, they were horrified. \"Doctor, please save my husband.\"</p><br/><p>\"Doctor, come over quickly! My son has been vomiting blood! Please come over now!\"</p><br/><p>The doctors were extremely busy. There were too many casualties and the family members were extremely emotional. It was an obstruction to their treatment.</p><br/><p>Then, a doctor shouted, \"Send this patient to the operating theatre now. We have to perform a surgery right away or else it would be too late.\"</p><br/><p>\"Quick, quick\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned at the sight. It was too horrific. Then, he didn't think much about it and quickly went to the toilet with his backpack.</p><br/><p>In the toilet, Lin Fan quickly opened the backpack and took out the medical attire and accessories. He changed into it and went to the lobby.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me\u2026\" Lin Fan pushed and went to the patients.</p><br/><p>When he just reached, a family member immediately grabbed him. He was extremely emotional. \"Doctor, please look at my son. He said my son can't be saved. Please, save my son.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. He went over to the patient and saw that his heart had already stopped. However, as long as one was treated within a certain timeframe, there was a high chance of him being saved. It was because the human body has its own defense mechanism and it can protect itself in times of stress. To an average person, it looked like he was dead. If they missed the opportunity to treat him then it'd be over.</p><br/><p>A doctor that was treating another patient shouted over to Lin Fan, \"He is hopeless. Quick, come and save those that still can be saved!\"</p><br/><p>The family members were infuriated when they heard that. \"What did you say? My son isn't dead.\"</p><br/><p>The doctor shook his head. It was a helpless situation but he couldn't say much.</p><br/><p>Then, a nurse came over and looked at him. \"May I know which doctor you are?\"</p><br/><p>She felt that she had never seen a doctor with such a physical appearance before. Furthermore, he had covered himself up and it seemed a little weird.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stared at her. \"Why are you asking me that? Quickly save the people here. Go over there. Leave this youngster to me.\"</p><br/><p>The nurse anxiously nodded. She couldn't have thought of anything else in such a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>The family member said, \"Doctor, please save my child.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Don't shake me. If you continue shaking me, then I can't save him. Stand aside and wait. Don't interfere with my work.\"</p><br/><p>The family member nodded. He was drenched in sweat and trembling with fear. \"Doctor, I won't disturb you anymore. Please save my child!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the patient and there were a lot of superficial injuries but they weren't fatal. However, there was a metal piece that was embedded in his abdomen.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took out several tools from his robe. There wasn't any anesthesia and he could only use the acupuncture needles to numb the area first. Then, he looked at the abdomen and touched it. Trying to save a life in a badly supported environment was precisely when the Encyclopedia's mysterious power had to come into play.</p><br/><p>It looked like his liver had burst and if Lin Fan was to operate on him immediately, it would also have been problematic. If they opened up the abdomen and couldn't stop the blood flow, it would result in a large loss of blood. Furthermore, the liver is one of the most important organs in the human body. It couldn't be removed and even if it was, the person wouldn't be able to preserve his own life.</p><br/><p>And this wasn't even the most difficult thing. The problem was that the patient would die if he was operated on in such a state.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan immediately shouted at the teenager's family member, \"Go look for a nurse and get me a type A blood bag.\"</p><br/><p>The family member immediately nodded and rushed to find a nurse. They had to find a blood bag.</p><br/><p>Luckily he had prepared a lot of acupuncture needles this time. He pierced them at several acupuncture points of the teenager. This was to prevent heavy loss of blood as the metal piece was going to be taken out later</p><br/><p>The family member managed to get a nurse over with a blood bag.</p><br/><p>\"Blood transfusion\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The nurse said, \"What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"I'm asking you to transfuse blood. Why are you asking such stupid questions?\"</p><br/><p>The family member said, \"Quick, the doctor asked you to transfuse blood. Just do it. Or else I'll take it out on you.\"</p><br/><p>The nurse was pretty experienced but she had never been in such a situation before. She anxiously transfused blood for the teenager.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The surrounding people were stunned when they saw the situation. It was horrifying, so much so that they didn't know what to say.\"</p><br/><p>Mysterious powers of the encyclopedia, I'm depending on you this time. Lin Fan took a deep breath and looked at the family members. \"I'm going to take out the metal piece now. Don't touch me or he will lose his life. Don't blame me if that happens.\"</p><br/><p>They nodded. \"We definitely won't touch you.\"</p><br/><p>The teenager was considered to be heavily injured and there was a 99% chance of him dying. Even the nurse felt that there was no chance of saving him.</p><br/><p>His liver might have even been split into two by the metal piece. What use could there be?</p><br/><p>*splatter*</p><br/><p>Blood spurted out and the nurse's eyes widened. It was as if she had seen a ghost. She almost fainted from the shock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately placed the needles on the two sides of the wound. He gently shook the needles. If they had been in the operation theatre, he would've performed a surgery too. However, he didn't have the equipment to do it and it wasn't safe to do it there. Hence, he could only save his life first.</p><br/><p>\"Go, bring him to the operating theatre and perform a surgery. This teenager has been saved. The recovery of this person depends on the hospital's surgical capabilities now,\" Lin Fan said. The mystical boost of the Encyclopedia was insane. The teenager's life was no longer in danger.</p><br/><p>\"How could it be?\" The nurse was in disbelief. She knew what was happening and she didn't believe that the teenager was okay now. It was impossible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted the teenager's face. \"Wake up\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The teenager suddenly opened his eyes and everyone was shocked. However, his hands and legs were motionless.</p><br/><p>The family members immediately went forward. \"Son, you're not dead! Doctor, what happened to my son?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"He's fine now. Quick, bring him to the operating theatre. I have already numbed his entire body. He just regained consciousness but he won't be able to move for two days.\"</p><br/><p>The nurse said, \"Doctor, what shall we do with the needles on him?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at her and said, \"Just pluck them out during the surgery. Quick, go now.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned when they saw what had happened. It was too f*cking unreal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

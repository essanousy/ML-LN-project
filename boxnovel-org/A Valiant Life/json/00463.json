His children didn\u2019t even pay his medical bills and he has to owe the payment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang has been hospitalized a lot of times. His life savings have practically all been given to the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Elder Wang have a medical insurance card? Why does he still spend so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMedical insurance card? That\u2019s rubbish. Elder Wang has been eating imported medicine. These medications aren\u2019t cheap. A small box would cost a few thousand dollars. Who could afford it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind, let\u2019s see if Elder Wang benefits from the setup outside. If it is really useful, he\u2019d benefit so much from it. They dare to give free treatment outside a hospital, I\u2019m pretty sure it isn\u2019t a scam. There are a lot of free treatment avenues online but it depends if Elder Wang could visit them with his current illness.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what to feel. He didn\u2019t expect it to have developed this way. Even those with flu came to visit him. However, he didn\u2019t make a fuss about it since they were there to give free treatment. Flu was an illness too. He just let Zhao Ming Qing attend to them. Although he couldn\u2019t treat them with acupuncture, he could prescribe them with some medicine. However, Lin Fan told him a small trick. Those with cases of flu that weren\u2019t so serious, he could just insert a needle and give them a massage. There was no need for medicine.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was ecstatic when he heard about the trick. He had gained new knowledge again.</p><br/><p>Even Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were excited too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. He wondered where the essence of Chinese medicine had gone to. This little trick was literally everywhere in the Encyclopedia. But nobody knew about it.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>An elderly man in his sixties came. He was wearing typical clothes and he was looking around. He walked over curiously when he saw Lin Fan\u2019s setup. He coughed several times and it sounded pretty serious.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little more sensitive to coughs because he used to be like this. Could this person that came over be suffering the same illness as him in the past?</p><br/><p>\u201cLung problem,\u201d Lin Fan said when he saw him walking towards them.</p><br/><p>It was useless to describe it profoundly. He just had to be straightforward about the person\u2019s condition. At the same time, it helped them to be less worried.</p><br/><p>When he read the man\u2019s fortune, he realized that the man was rather miserable. He was alone in the hospital and his children didn\u2019t care about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Wang Xi Zhu asked carefully.</p><br/><p>It was the first time he had approached a voluntary medical booth like this and he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I can tell. Come, have a seat,\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and welcomed him.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu seemed a little unsettled. He asked, \u201cIs the treatment free?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it is free. We don\u2019t charge any fees here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Wang Xi Zhu heaved a sigh of relief and sat down.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing asked, \u201cYour lung problem is similar to my past Lung problem. I was suffering from it for a few decades.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu was stunned, \u201cI can\u2019t tell that you\u2019ve had this disease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s been cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Wang Xi Zhu congratulated him in envy. He envied healthy people the most. One could accomplish more with a healthy body. They wouldn\u2019t have to lie on the hospital bed like him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, come and have a look\u2026\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded and began to check on him. He was quite familiar with the procedure. \u201cTeacher, his condition is a little more serious than mine. The problem is not just with his lungs. Other body parts are also problematic. It\u2019s just easy to be overlooked because of his lung problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s medical skills were indeed superb. He could tell about his condition after looking at him for a while. This information could be inferred from looking at his face, tongue and pulse.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu wasn\u2019t hopeful of having his illness treated. \u201cCan you guys treat my illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was in the past, Zhao Ming Qing would\u2019ve answered with a no. Because he didn\u2019t even manage to treat his own condition. However, it was different now. His mentor was there and he could definitely treat him since he had managed to treat Zhao Ming Qing himself successfully.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYes, we can treat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu said, \u201cOh, I knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to treat it.\u201d But suddenly, he realized what Lin Fan had said and was in disbelief, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan repeated, \u201cI said, it\u2019s curable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu didn\u2019t believe him. Then, Lin Fan said, \u201cHere, pass me your hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed onto Wang Xi Zhu\u2019s hand and pressed onto it, \u201cDo you feel anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu nodded, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s a numbing feeling. It\u2019s like I feel a little better now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, stand up,\u201d Lin Fan said. Then, he grabbed onto Wang Xi Zhu\u2019s shoulder with one hand. He placed the other hand on his lung area and pressed onto it. He changed the way he was pressing and asked, \u201cHow do you feel? Do you feel like there\u2019s a warm feeling being circulated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d Wang Xi Zhu answered ecstatically.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand at Zhao Ming Qing to get him to bring the acupuncture needles. Then, he said, \u201cLater, I will be placing a needle there. It will be a little ticklish. Just tell me if you feel anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu was extremely happy and when he saw the needles in Lin Fan\u2019s hand, he didn\u2019t flinch. He was full of anticipation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan inserted it and gently swirled it around. The mystical boost of the Encyclopedia was starting to activate.</p><br/><p>This time, without Lin Fan\u2019s prompt, Wang Xi Zhu immediately said, \u201cI feel it. I feel the ticklish sensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually, people started to gather around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, those are acupuncture needles. I\u2019ve seen them in dramas before. It\u2019s a professional Chinese medical tool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see Chinese medical Doctors use it to treat patients. What\u2019s wrong with this elderly man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he looks like he\u2019s enjoying it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people started to record what was happening with their phones. Although they didn\u2019t know what was happening, they felt that it was remarkable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t notice these people. He just smiled, \u201cNot bad, right? It\u2019s good that you\u2019re feeling this. Later, the needle will be slightly longer, will you be scared? However, it\u2019ll still feel good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu stood there and closed his eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t look. Doctor, do whatever you want. I\u2019ve never felt so good before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore if he closed his eyes. Then, he waved his hand at Zhao Ming Qing. Everyone was a little frightened when they saw the needles of different thicknesses and lengths.</p><br/><p>He placed one needle after another.</p><br/><p>The treatment was a little complicated. It required multiple insertions of acupuncture needles. Basically, he had to have more than ten needles on his body for the treatment.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk stared at them in shock.</p><br/><p>Some of the more timid ones covered their mouths. It was too scary.</p><br/><p>It was especially scary when the elderly man\u2019s body was covered with a lot of needles.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing wasn\u2019t afraid at all while Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were extremely anxious. They forcefully swallowed their saliva. It was the first time they had seen this.</p><br/><p>Then, the townsfolk started to record whatever they were looking at.</p><br/><p>Because it was simply too shocking.</p></div>\n</div>"}

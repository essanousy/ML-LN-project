If anyone of you screws up, I\u2019m going to teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Yao was known for his strictness in work. He didn\u2019t care if he was dealing with rich investors. He demanded only perfection and nothing else.</p><br/><p>In the past, there had been a female actress that had been pulled into the production by a rich investor. She had been late for a particular scene and she got badly scolded by Wang Ke Hao. He had even threatened to fire her and said that the show could still go on without her.</p><br/><p>In the end, the investor had had to speak to Wang Ke Hao so that she could continue acting. However, what Wang Ke Hao said to him had caused the investor to tell the actress to stop acting in the film.</p><br/><p>\u2018With this girl in the film, my film will lose millions of dollars.\u2019</p><br/><p>The investor had been so shocked that he quickly asked the actress to stop going for this production.</p><br/><p>Every investor feared film directors. Furthermore, Wang Ke Hao was a household name. His films would always rake in millions of dollars.</p><br/><p>Although he had somewhat lost his prowess, he couldn\u2019t be underestimated.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, alright, we\u2019re ready.\u201d Wang Ke Hao trusted Master Lin a lot and what Master Lin had just done was simply spectacular.</p><br/><p>The engine started revving.</p><br/><p>The car charged forward and ran into a road obstacle which caused the car to flip and roll. To Lin Fan, these stunts were simple. It was just troublesome to have the protection gear around his head. However, he still had to do it. If not, Wang Ke Hao wouldn\u2019t allow him to execute the stunt.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao stood up and applauded after watching that. Then, something shocking happened.</p><br/><p>The car flipped and spun 720-degrees in the air. Then, it landed heavily. It was a stunning drop. Furthermore, it stopped perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d Wang Ke Hao was thoroughly convinced. It was even better than he had expected.</p><br/><p>He had filmed everything in one take and he felt that it might even be possible to win the award for the best stunt.</p><br/><p>The other workers ran over to the car after it stopped. However, Lin Fan walked out of the car even before they reached it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao ran forward and held Lin Fan\u2019s hand. \u201cMaster Lin, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine. That was simple. How was it, Director Wang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was brilliant. I\u2019m really satisfied.\u201d Wang Ke Hao nodded and smiled.</p><br/><p>Zheng Long and Li Meng Hua were dumbfounded. They felt that it was as if everything had been done with CGI effects. They felt that Master Lin was simply extraordinary. It was as if he knew how to do everything.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Master Lin had a lot of connections and he could resolve things extremely easily; especially the Haojiang incident.</p><br/><p>Their friends in Haojiang had even called over to find out who had actually managed to resolve it so easily.</p><br/><p>All they could do was laugh and avoid the topic.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re satisfied. However, Director Wang, please be careful when you\u2019re handling the Welfare Institute matters. After all, we don\u2019t want anything to happen here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao patted his chest and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master Lin. I won\u2019t bring any trouble to the Welfare Institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Lin Fan said and nodded. Then, he chatted for a while longer and went to the guardpost. Han Lu was the person appointed to guard the entrance of the Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Han Lu looked at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, this production team should be fine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I agreed for them to use this area. I\u2019ll go and speak to the kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to focus more on developing the children. However, he was there to resolve another issue. The Welfare Institute contained a section of land with bungalows made of bricks and tiles.</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \u201cMaster Lin, the workers of the Welfare Institute lived in these buildings in the past. After the Welfare Institute faced financial problems, the workers left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the buildings and realized that they were all built in the 90s. However, they were still well preserved.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang, if I rebuild them into a residential area for teachers, what do you think of that?\u201d Lin Fan asked. He wanted to change the layout of the Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>In the future, the kids would definitely grow up.</p><br/><p>Some of the places wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to be shared. This could become a dormitory. They would be split according to gender and a room would have four or six people.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, that could help to attract teachers to work in the Welfare Institute. They could stay there indefinitely and that was a practical benefit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that his reputation couldn\u2019t possibly last through the years. He definitely needed another way to attract teachers.</p><br/><p>Director Huang thought about it for a moment, \u201cThat is possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Then, Lin Fan thought of something. \u201cDirector Huang, actually I thought of something. Although it doesn\u2019t seem very realistic, I would like to try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang looked at Lin Fan and asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, I feel like I can build an apartment block and it can house the kids in the future too. Although I am confident in developing every child here, I think there will be anomalies. Furthermore, they will get married in the future and get houses. We are like their parents. We have to think about their future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, I am prepared to develop this for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang was stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, that\u2026 There are so many children here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Director Huang could finish, Lin Fan interrupted, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We can continue building if there aren\u2019t sufficient units.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang was speechless. She felt that she couldn\u2019t align her thoughts with Master Lin\u2019s. There was a long way to go before the kids would move in.</p><br/><p>However, she was really in awe of Master Lin. He was truly thinking of the future of the Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>No other welfare institute would be able to house the kids and think about their future.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cLook, these kids are orphans. When they grow up, they will be capable. They can continue staying here and the Welfare Institute would definitely not be closed down. They would recall their past and help other kids in the future. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hundred years later, we will be gone but there would still be people to continue this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he was thinking really far ahead. Although it made sense, it was a difficult feat. However, he believed that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if he worked hard.</p><br/><p>Director Huang looked at Master Lin and she was speechless. Then, she smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, as long as you\u2019re willing, I will help you as best as I can.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

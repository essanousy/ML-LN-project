He wanted to prevent people from seeing how disfigured he had become from the incident.</p><br/><p>After looking at it, he didn\u2019t care about it anymore. Korean celebrities coming to China was a normal occurrence. Perhaps Jin Xuan Ming would be replaced soon after he returned to Korea. Through this, he understood something. Those hardcore fans were too incorrigible. They only cared about looks. Just because Jin Xuan Ming got disfigured, they abandoned him.</p><br/><p>Pitiful, how pitiful.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and smiled. Then, he kept his phone and shouted, \u201cI\u2019ll be going out for a while. Please look after the shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cThis fella seems so busy every day. Seems like there\u2019s a lot to be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang smiled, \u201cBrother Lin would be busy these days. I guess he will be heading to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation.\u201d</p><br/><p>His guess was accurate. Lin Fan really was headed to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation. He had to teach a few hundred children how to draw. He hadn\u2019t been teaching them recently and he needed to earn Encyclopedic Points for himself.</p><br/><p>He had already thought about when he should head there. He wanted to go there at the end of the month.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation, the children\u2019s smiles were extremely sincere. They must have missed him a lot when he wasn\u2019t around.</p><br/><p>Han Lu was fixed at the children\u2019s welfare organization and the kids liked him a lot too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Han Lu, \u201cIf you want to learn, I can teach you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why Han Lu stayed at the children\u2019s welfare organization for so long. If he really wanted to learn baguazhang, he didn\u2019t mind teaching him along with the children.</p><br/><p>Han Lu smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, there\u2019s no need for that now. I didn\u2019t stay at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation to learn baguazhang. I really want to do something with my life. During your absence, I taught them some things too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s good too. Director Huang is alone here and this place isn\u2019t secure. Now that you\u2019re here. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to give his all for the Encyclopedic Points. However, he just didn\u2019t know if he had the ability to train these kids properly.</p><br/><p>He clapped, \u201cAlright, children, take your accessories and tools. We\u2019re going to start drawing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children loved drawing, they were especially attracted to it when they saw what this Uncle drew previously. They wanted to draw what they were thinking of.</p><br/><p>However, it was pretty difficult to teach these children how to draw. However, it was a joyous thing to do and the children remembered the things that he was saying. That was pretty comforting to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopedic Points + 1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopedic Points +1.\u201d</p><br/><p>He received two Encyclopedic Points that day. It was obvious that some of the children had already understood what he was teaching. However. He only received two points. He believed that he could probably earn a few hundred Encyclopedic Points when all the children learn about Chinese arts.</p><br/><p>He was busy until 6 pm and the children were extremely happy. They learned new knowledge in the midst of having fun. They knew more about Chinese arts now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at their artworks. Although they looked awful, it was a good first step.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up as per normal and went to Cloud Street. Then, he went to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation. As for Zhao Ming Qing, he was probably busy with the prescription. However, nobody would have dared to interfere in his matters, given Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s status.</p><br/><p>There was some time until October 1st but it was good to prepare early for it.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan felt a little sorry when he realized that he was going to leave the townsfolk again even though he just returned. If they weren\u2019t in a good mood, they might just explode in rage.</p><br/><p>If he told Fraud Tian and the others about his imminent departure, they might even feel like dying. Hence, he felt that it was better for him to tell them about it when the day came.</p><br/><p>By then, it would be too late for them to react to it. He would already have left.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Dan looked at the small trucks driving around and smiled, \u201cWhich of our shops struck a fortune? There are so many trucks here. I believe they must have ordered a lot of goods.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned, \u201cImpossible. Recently, none of the shops ordered goods. Let me see which one is it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stood at the entrance and looked ahead. Then, he turned back, \u201cI think it\u2019s not a delivery of goods. They seem to be moving away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoving away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He felt that something was wrong. Everyone wanted to set up business on Cloud Street but didn\u2019t get any chance to do so. Now, someone was thinking of leaving. Did something bad happen?</p><br/><p>No, he had to take a look.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang, Elder Liang and Sister Hong, all of them are out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, what happened?\u201d Sister Hong asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just saw a truck. Therefore, I came to have a look. I thought someone ordered so many goods. However, Fraud Tian told me that someone is moving away. Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cThat\u2019s Elder Chen\u2019s clothing shop. What is he up to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t receive any notice. If something happened to Elder Chen, he would\u2019ve told us about it. Let\u2019s see what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen\u2019s shop was nearly at the end of the street. It was near his own shop. However, Lin Fan remembered that he was a decent man and he would participate in activities. However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand what was happening. He didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>The workers were moving things in and out of the shop.</p><br/><p>A young man stood at the entrance and directed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Elder Chen?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The young man looked at him and said, \u201cI am his nephew. He\u2019s been hospitalized and won\u2019t be setting up this shop in the future. That\u2019s why I came here to move the things away for it to be rented to another person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s feeling unwell? Why did it happen so suddenly? Wasn\u2019t he in a pink of health?\u201d Sister Hong asked.</p><br/><p>The young man looked like he didn\u2019t want to say much. \u201cI just came to help. I don\u2019t know much about what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me call Elder Chen and see what happened,\u201d Elder Zhang said. Then, he took out his phone and called him but his phone was switched off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get through,\u201d Elder Zhang said helplessly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the young man, \u201cAre you hiding something? Our relationship with Elder Chen has always been good. If there\u2019s a need, we can definitely help.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

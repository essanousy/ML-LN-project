Those who were following this matter felt rather apprehensive. He didn\u2019t know if this guy had some sort of mental issue or not. First, he scolded Ma Qingzhou on Weibo, and now, he publicly announced that he was going to Qingzhou. Wasn\u2019t that just suicide?</p><br/><p>Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren rushed into the room anxiously, \u201cGodfather Ma! That b*stard has announced on Weibo that he\u2019s coming to Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou had already been pissed off by the other party. Right now, when he heard that he was coming to Qingzhou, he momentarily laughed out loud that this guy had the guts. \u201cI want to see if he is able to safely and peacefully leave Qingzhou. Get to the airport now. Ask them to pay more attention. If there\u2019s any news on that b*stard, inform me immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Ren nodded.</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma had a large influence in Qingzhou. If he wished to get information from the airport, it naturally wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>Qingzhou was some distance away from Shanghai. Even if he were to take the plane, it would take at least 3 hours.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>There was an incoming call.</p><br/><p>The call was from Chief Qin. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted. There wasn\u2019t much in common between the two of them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up the call, \u201cChief Qin, is something the matter? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin replied, \u201cMaster Lin, I heard that you are going to Qingzhou? I read on Weibo that you are having some problems with Ma Mu Feng? I\u2019m afraid it isn\u2019t safe to go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you so much for your concern, Chief Qin. However, there won\u2019t be anything wrong. I don\u2019t believe that he\u2019d be able to do anything to me.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect that Chief Qin would call him out of concern. This is somewhat unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he knew Lin Fan was some kind of genius and wanted to establish a better relationship with him?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, our police department has some understanding on Ma Mu Feng. It is true that he does have a huge influence over in Qingzhou. If you do go over there, I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019d be too dangerous for you. Let me give you the phone number of the leader of the Qingzhou Police Department. We were once comrades. If you are to be met with any danger, you can just call him up. He\u2019s trustworthy,\u201d Chief Qin said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cOkay. Thanks for your concern, Chief Qin. You can relax. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them talked for a while before putting down the call. He still couldn\u2019t believe that Chief Qin would be concerned with him. Not before long, he received a message.</p><br/><p>It was the phone number of Chen Chang Ping.</p><br/><p>He saved the number just in case he needed it on his trip to Qingzhou. When facing such an evil tyrant, it was a must to have martial arts skills. However, he still had to rely on the police force to deal with the matter.</p><br/><p>Not long after ending his call with Chief Qin, a call from Wang Ming Yang came in.</p><br/><p>Immediately after picking the call, Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shouting, which can cause others to tremble in fear, could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! What are you trying to do? How can you still dare to go to Qingzhou? Are you looking to die? Where are you now? Hurry up and get back here!\u201d Wang Ming Yang was a little blind. Was his own brother trying to die? Is it very fun to provoke Ma Qingzhou? There would definitely be a tragic ending if he were to go unaccompanied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so anxious? Do you not trust me? It\u2019s only Ma Qingzhou, what can he do?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect such a huge reaction from Wang Ming Yang, but he was also somewhat impatient, \u201cYou can relax. Nothing would happen to me. I\u2019ll put down the call for now. I\u2019m about to reach the airport.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, hello?\u201d Just as Wang Ming Yang was about to say something, the busy tone could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Just what is he trying to do? Does he not know that it\u2019s dangerous?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was rather anxious. However, he knew that whatever his brother said he would do, he would definitely carry it out.</p><br/><p>However, whenever he thought about the horrors of Ma Qingzhou, he immediately thought of the dangers his brother would be in.</p><br/><p>Even though he wouldn\u2019t lose his life, but he would definitely be taught a terrible lesson.</p><br/><p>But what can he do now? He had already left. Saying anything now would be too late.</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. These people were just too gutless. They can actually be scared like this. It was merely just going to Qingzhou to meet Ma Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Right now, he just wanted to see what kind of a monster Ma Qingzhou is.</p><br/><p>Not before long, the time had come.</p><br/><p>He boarded the plane.</p><br/><p>The airport security stared at Lin Fan for a moment. He was trying to recognize this man. Suddenly, his expression turned to one of joy. There was a certain shock in his voice. They couldn\u2019t believe it!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded. He didn\u2019t think that he would be treated like a star, receiving the love from others.</p><br/><p>The security trooper whispered, \u201cMaster Lin, are you really going to Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all following him on Weibo. Anyone who followed Master Lin on Weibo would know what\u2019s going on.</p><br/><p>Moreover, in the beginning, they didn\u2019t know who this Ma Qingzhou was. But after researching on him online, they found out that Ma Qingzhou was indeed very bad.</p><br/><p>So much so that using the word \u2018bad\u2019 to describe him was an understatement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security trooper intentionally slowed down his inspection process just so he could speak a few more sentences to Master Lin. However, no matter how he delayed the time, there was only so much he could say.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the best!\u201d the security trooper whispered.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. At this moment, he felt that the burden on him was increased. He didn\u2019t know how many citizens were waiting for his arrival.</p><br/><p>On the plane.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t a celebrity. He was well-known in Shanghai, but outside of it, nobody recognized him. Even if they did hear about him before, they probably didn\u2019t know how he looked like.</p><br/><p>At Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou already got the news that Lin Fan boarded the plane.</p><br/><p>In an interesting and appealing tea room.</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou sat there, with a middle-aged man opposite him. The two of them were talking about something.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Ma, the Godly Doctor from Shanghai is coming to Qingzhou. What plans do you have in mind?\u201d the man sipped from his teacup before putting it down and asking the question.</p><br/><p>A flicker of anger could be seen in Ma Qingzhou\u2019s eyes, but it very quickly dissipated. Instead, he gave out a nervous laughter, \u201cOf course it is to warmly welcome our honored guest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, too, want to meet this person. I\u2019ve never seen such a crazy person before. We probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to him in Shanghai, but right now, he\u2019s actually coming over to Qingzhou. It\u2019s as if the newborn calf isn\u2019t scared of the tigers. I\u2019m not too sure if Qingzhou\u2019s water levels would drown him,\u201d the middle-aged man laughed. However, a wave of cold air could be seen from his laughing expression.</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou joined in the nervous laughter. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he doesn\u2019t know how deep the water is at Qingzhou. However, he still has some use. I need him to treat my illness. I can\u2019t wait any longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man laughed, \u201cGodfather Ma, what do you think of this plan. Right now, when he arrives in Qingzhou, we treat him well first. We would let him think highly of himself and allow him to treat your illness. Then at that moment, we shall\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou had a gloomy expression, but there was momentarily a flash of killer intent in his eyes, \u201cwe shall force him to kneel down!\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was shocked. He didn\u2019t expect Godfather Ma\u2019s killer intent to be so strong. At the same time, he was also getting the chills. He was actually joking together with Godfather Ma. If he were to offend Godfather Ma, his fate would end up the same as the b*stard.</p><br/><p>Death without a reason and nobody would dare to question him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

At that moment, the door next to them was opened from the inside. The medical personnel was looking suspiciously at Lin Fan. They wondered why 'Doctor Mao' came out alone and why the rest of the people weren't coming out yet.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the operation failed?</p><br/><p>That can't be it, right?</p><br/><p>Once they started thinking about this possibility, the medical personnel who were watching the door suddenly looked like they were about to cry.</p><br/><p>\"Doctor, how's my daughter?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a group of people surrounded Lin Fan. The little girl's parents, in particular, had their eyes gleaming with anticipation. They were hoping to hear good news from the doctor. Although they knew the chances were not high, they really needed the good news.</p><br/><p>At that moment, it wouldn't have been good for Lin Fan to remove his mask because he remembered how he had been a little careless in Suzhou. He was lucky that he had not been recognized. This time, he was extra careful.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was thinking about all these, things seemed dark and gloomy to the little girl's parents. The doctor isn't speaking, does this mean the operation failed?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a series of earth-shaking wailing sounds erupted in the waiting area. The little girl's parents sat paralyzed on the ground, in each other's embrace. \"My little girl\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you all crying about? The operation was a huge success. She's already fine. As long as she is properly nursed from now on, she will recover completely.\" Lin Fan came back to his senses and said, \"Go in and take a look.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" At that moment, the crowd in the waiting area was astounded. The little girl's parents looked up at the doctor in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>\"That's him\u2026\" Doctor Mao, only wearing his underpants, was leading the security guards, nurses and other people as they came down from the stairs and the lift. They had blocked off the exits.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! He came so quickly.\" When Lin Fan saw this, he was stunned. This guy was too ferocious. He had actually been able to break out of the door. If Lin Fan had still been in the middle of the operation when he got caught, that would have been dangerous. He didn't believe that these guys would have let him complete the operation. They would surely have restrained him and affected the operation.</p><br/><p>Now that everything was fine and the operation was complete, it didn't matter much that they had come. But the problem now was that Lin Fan had to escape.</p><br/><p>The little girl's relatives and parents were shocked. Their gaze fell on the bare-bodied Doctor Mao, then at the neatly-dressed, mask-wearing 'Doctor Mao'. What on earth was going on?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and waved. \"Goodbye, everyone. It can be considered fate that your daughter met with a godly doctor. No need to look for me.\" Then, he immediately ran forward. It was the second floor and in front, more than one meter above, there was a window. It was already open. Lin Fan leaped up and through the window.</p><br/><p>With his track and field skills, high jumping and running, it was not a problem at all.</p><br/><p>The real Doctor Mao cried out in shock, \"Hurry up and go downstairs to chase him!\" Then, he pointed at the nurses and said, \"You all will follow me to the operating room to check on the patient.</p><br/><p>Then, the little girl's parents suddenly understood. Who they had thought was Doctor Mao was actually not Doctor Mao and their daughter was still inside. When they thought of this, their faces turned pale. With a loud scream, they ran into the operating room, \"God! My daughter\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Landing on the ground floor from the second floor, Lin Fan patted his body. While there was no one around, he stripped out of the operating clothing and threw them into the bushes. Then, with the mask still on, he quickly mixed into the crowd and headed out of the hospital.</p><br/><p>This hospital was really not bad. The operating room was just on the second floor, so jumping down was not an issue at all. If those security guards thought that they could catch him, they could keep dreaming.</p><br/><p>\"Where is the guy?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know. Look everywhere. We have to find this b*stard.\"</p><br/><p>\"He even dared to make a move on such a cute little girl.\"</p><br/><p>\"He was playing with a life on the line!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters who had been held up by the security guards downstairs heard about what had happened and were instantly appalled.</p><br/><p>\"What? Someone impersonated Doctor Mao and performed an operation on a little girl? Is this a joke?\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn't they identify the doctor before the operation?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's a loophole in the hospital. If something really happens to the little girl, we definitely won't let this hospital go easy. No matter what we have to do, we'll expose them!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, we absolutely have to expose them! I only hope the little girl is safe.\"</p><br/><p>\"I think the chances of the girl's survival are slim. Even an experienced doctor said that the operation's success rate is very very low. Now that someone else impersonated him and did the operation, how could she still survive? She must be suffering.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>In the operating room.</p><br/><p>\"MMM MMM\u2026\" Those nurses who had been tied up by Lin Fan saw that people had come and they kept struggling. They had been scared stiff but even in the face of all this, they had still been observing the apparatus and when they saw that the condition of the little girl was completely normal, they were shocked. They didn't understand what was happening. Who was that guy? Why did he impersonate Doctor Mao? And if he has such an ability, why is he afraid of being caught?</p><br/><p>Also, how did he do that thing with the three long silver needles? Why is it that, when he placed them into the little girl's head, nothing went wrong at all? In fact, it seemed to have helped her.</p><br/><p>The bare-bodied Doctor Mao saw the scene inside the operating room and was dumbfounded. He stood at his original position as his whole body trembled. \"Where are the surveillance staff who are supposed to monitor the operation? Are they all dead? So much happened in here, how could there not have been any response at all?\"</p><br/><p>After a series of angry snarls, he quickly went to the operating table and looked at the little girl's state, while the other medical personnel helped to untie the nurses.</p><br/><p>Despite Doctor Mao's snarls, the nurses knew that this couldn't be blamed on anyone. The video cameras were there to record everything in the operating room in case something went wrong with the operation so that if an evaluation was needed in the case of a medical accident, they could have proof. Hence, there was no staff designated to surveilling the video camera recordings.</p><br/><p>After all, the operation was long and dry. Whether the doctor had any issues or not, no one else would understand.</p><br/><p>Doctor Mao quickly checked the little girl's body. The little girl's parents stood by the side, crying miserably. They didn't dare to believe that such a thing would happen to their own daughter.</p><br/><p>The nurses were untied, then the socks were removed from their mouths. They yelled, \"The girl is fine! She's very healthy and there aren't any problems at all. In fact, the operation was a perfect success! That man that impersonated Doctor Mao was brilliant. We don't know why he ran but his medical skills are truly amazing. You all don't need to worry. The little girl is just sleeping.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" At that moment, the crowd, which had initially been very worried, instantly became stunned. How could that be? The man that impersonated Doctor Mao wasn't here to hurt her, but to save her? And his medical skills are superb? The operation was a success?</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

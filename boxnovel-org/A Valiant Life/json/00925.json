As Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s person-in-charge and at such an important moment, he had to speak about some great ideals.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was a group of reporters standing at the back. Their lenses had been adjusted and aimed at the stage.</p><br/><p>For this kind of ceremonies, typically, only the reporters from the local news agencies would come or there might not even be any reporters at all. These reporters would typically be paid by the organizers to attend the ceremonies, then the organizers would also buy a space on the Internet to post the news.</p><br/><p>After all, to reporters, such matters didn\u2019t generate much public interest. Posting the news on their websites would just be a waste of space.</p><br/><p>But to them, this ceremony was quite impressive.</p><br/><p>After all, entrepreneurs like these usually had all their time occupied by meetings and various kinds of matters. They definitely wouldn\u2019t be very free. But now, the entrepreneurs at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s teaching block opening ceremony were all staying there all the way.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The information that the reporters inferred from this made them very impressed.</p><br/><p>How close must they have been to Master Lin to behave as such?</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, quieten down. Let our dear Master Lin say a few words on stage,\u201d shouted He Cheng Han with a laugh as he sat below the stage.</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they quietened down. Then, they fixed their eyes on Lin Fan in anticipation.</p><br/><p>They wondered what Master Lin was going to say and they were all quite curious.</p><br/><p>Some people knew Master Lin very well while others hadn\u2019t known him for long and hadn\u2019t spoken much with him. However, this was a relationship and it was meant to be slowly built.</p><br/><p>Hence, they were very willing to join such an event.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cleared his throat as he stood on stage. The reporters below the stage rapidly took photos.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThere are many people who came this time and even I was very shocked but I am also extremely grateful. After all, for you all to come here and send your good wishes, that means that you show respect for me. Right now, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for attending my small little opening ceremony amidst your busy schedules,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>*Clap clap!*</p><br/><p>Applause sounded.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re being a little too courteous. How many of us here haven\u2019t asked for your help before? You usually just run your little shop and even though we want to support you, we never have the chance. Now, that chance has come. How could we not seize it? Isn\u2019t that right, everybody?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Well said, Elder He.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was echoing what He Cheng Han had said and the atmosphere had taken a leap.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at He Cheng Han. \u201cElder He, you have quite a lot to say today. Shall I reveal your little secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>When He Cheng Han heard that, his expression changed dramatically as he anxiously waved his hand. \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t. The reporters are all here. I need some face too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know what exactly Master Lin knew, he respected Master Lin\u2019s fortune-telling ability. If Master Lin really wanted to find out something, it wouldn\u2019t be hard at all.</p><br/><p>Master Lin could even read out eighteen generations of his ancestors if he wanted to.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHaha, are you scared, Elder He?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I not be? Once Master Lin speaks, it can\u2019t just be some insignificant matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I think you should just say it. Let\u2019s see what kind of little secret our Elder He has.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled as he gestured for them to calm down. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s leave this for next time. There are many children here today and we have to mind our words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he continued, \u201cActually, I didn\u2019t want to say much this time because I felt there wasn\u2019t a need to. However, now that everyone has come to support us, it would be too cold of me not to say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNanashan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute has been taken over by me. My life\u2019s greatest wish is to nurture these children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once those words were delivered, thunderous applause filled the place.</p><br/><p>At that moment, some people arrived outside.</p><br/><p>When Director Huang saw them, her expression slowly changed. Then, she came to Lin Fan\u2019s side. \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s Leader Chen from the Education Department.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was curious. \u201cWhat are they here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t really want to interact with these people but since they were here, he naturally had to go and receive them.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please wait a moment,\u201d said Lin Fan. Then, he put down the microphone and walked towards those people.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan went over, Leader Chen greeted him with a smile before he could even speak, \u201cHello, Master Lin, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Leader.\u201d Lin Fan replied with a smile. Although he didn\u2019t know why the opposite party was here, if they were here to congratulate them, Lin Fan would naturally be more than happy to welcome them.</p><br/><p>When the reporters saw who had come, their cameras shifted over.</p><br/><p>As reporters, they definitely knew who this leader was. After all, he frequently appeared on the news.</p><br/><p>Also, this was Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s teaching block opening. Since he was here, he was probably here to congratulate them.</p><br/><p>To the reporters, this had originally been a small matter but so many big shots had come. This had been completely unexpected and it made them very excited.</p><br/><p>After all, the topics of interest were many.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi\u2019s arrival naturally didn\u2019t draw much commotion. After all, those that were here were all entrepreneurs. They didn\u2019t need to bootlick others. Moreover, the department he managed didn\u2019t have anything to do with them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went up on stage and spoke for a while more. Then, he felt that the only person that had anything to do with this event was Chen Shi, so he said with a smile, \u201cLeader, would you like to come up and say a few words?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chen Shi had been sitting below and listening respectfully the whole time. At that moment, when he heard that, he couldn\u2019t help but nod. He felt that this Master Lin really knew how to do things.</p><br/><p>Then, he stood up and nodded at the crowd with a smile as a way of acknowledging them.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know who most of the people here were, he felt that, as a government personnel, he naturally had to gain the respect of others.</p><br/><p>On stage.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi picked up the microphone and cleared his throat. \u201cGreetings, dear guests. Let me first do a self-introduction. I\u2019m Chen Shi from the Education Department. The education of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s children is something that we have always been concerned about. Now that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute has had someone as capable as Master Lin taking over, I am at ease. I also have no worries about the children\u2019s future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people below the stage applauded. He was praising Master Lin, so of course, they had to applaud. It was just for show.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, if no one applauded, the scene would become a little awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Master Lin and our department\u2019s joined efforts, I believe that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute will become even better\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had thought that this guy\u2019s words were pretty good at first. Although he had had some slight conflict with this department in the past, for him to say such words, it was pretty good. But suddenly, Chen Shi\u2019s last sentence made Lin Fan feel that something wasn\u2019t right.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Lin Fan was saying all sorts of morals and values. He felt that he was speaking nonsense. But when he saw Lin Fan's card skills and tricks, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>He had seen a lot of gambling movies and sometimes he would dream of possessing such skills. Now that he finally witnessed it, he was stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>He immediately created an account without any hesitation and donated his remaining $100 as a gift.</p><br/><p>Then, he wrote a long message to ask Lin Fan to take him as a disciple. He felt that he would definitely be noticed by him. However, when he saw the comments on the screen, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"God of Gambling, please take me as your disciple.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, I'm completely in awe. As long as I learn a trick from you, I'd be contented.\"</p><br/><p>\"I just sent ten rockets. All I'm asking for is to be noticed by the God of Gambling.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang realized how small his $100 was as compared to the other donations. It didn't even appear on the screen at all. But he realized that the God of Gambling really existed and he decided to focus on the broadcast. He would risk everything if Lin Fan asked for a disciple. He was determined to succeed.</p><br/><p>The broadcast was extremely crowded and Zhao Zhong Yang remarked, \"There are so many people that want you to be their teacher. That's too crazy.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was helpless but he wasn't anxious. He wanted to take it slow. He couldn't instill fear in them just like that. Anyway, he had many tricks up his sleeve and he didn't feel the urgency to rush it. He wanted to broadcast every single day as he believed that this would help him complete his task.</p><br/><p>At 11 am.</p><br/><p>\"That's all for today's broadcast. Please watch out for the next broadcast,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\"No, God of Gambling. You only barely started.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, I'm not done watching.\"</p><br/><p>The viewers didn't want him to leave at all. They were having a really good time watching the broadcast. They were sad when he said it was going to be stopped.</p><br/><p>The broadcast ended.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh, \"How did it feel?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. He just looked at Lin Fan unblinkingly and gave him a thumbs up. \"I have to say I'm impressed. That was insane.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not asking if it was awesome. Do you think I'll be able to help them?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang hesitated for a moment. \"I think it depends on them. They'll need more time to think it through.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"I think so too. Since it won't work after one broadcast, I'll do it repeatedly. I don't believe they're so stupid to continue gambling. Let's go for lunch and continue later.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Continue later? Aren't you tired?\" Zhao Zhong Yang asked.</p><br/><p>\"Why would I be tired, I just have to sit there.\" All he wanted was to complete the gambling task. Initially, he had thought that he would have to go to Macau to complete it. But it looked like he didn't have to do that. This was the best way to do it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded. \"Alright then.\"</p><br/><p>He couldn't reject Lin Fan's request. Furthermore, he was extremely curious because he couldn't figure out how Lin Fan had done it. Also, he enjoyed watching him when he sat beside him.</p><br/><p>They ate at a random restaurant nearby. While they were eating, Fraud Tian and the others called after they read Lin Fan's Weibo. They were curious and didn't know what Lin Fan was up to.</p><br/><p>When they found out Lin Fan wanted to start a broadcast, they were even more curious.</p><br/><p>At 2 pm.</p><br/><p>There were a few more people in the house now.</p><br/><p>The shop was still in the midst of renovation and they had nothing to do. Hence, they came over to watch Lin Fan's broadcast.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian exclaimed, \"D*mn, I've been with you for so long but I never knew you're capable of that.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"There's more that you don't know about.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan sat at the table as she fiddled with the cards. \"What can you broadcast with these cards?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied excitedly, \"You just haven't seen it. When you see it, you'll know how awesome Master Lin is.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as he started the live stream. Although it was his first time doing a live stream, it attracted a lot of people.</p><br/><p>The viewers were willing to watch it even though there were some non-gamblers.</p><br/><p>Because the visual effects were too insane to miss. It was extremely shocking.</p><br/><p>At a certain company.</p><br/><p>Zhou Hang was busy with work but his phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>'Your favorite broadcaster is broadcasting\u2026'</p><br/><p>He only cared about one broadcaster and he immediately looked around. When he realized that his boss wasn't around, he immediately went to the broadcast website.</p><br/><p>Zhou Hang was quite interested in gambling but since watching Master Lin's broadcast, started to doubt it. Because the tricks that Master Lin had presented were too scary. It had made him fearful.</p><br/><p>Especially that sentence that he had said. 'The moment you sit at the gambling table, you've lost.'</p><br/><p>He thought about it carefully and realized that it was indeed true. He was always busy with work and he could meet up with friends after work to chat with each other and even meet new friends. This was especially helpful to his future.</p><br/><p>Meeting a new friend was an indescribable asset. But ever since he had started gambling after work, he realized that he only knew a couple of friends. These friends weren't true friends at all. They were constantly after each other's money.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he found a sentence said by Master Lin to be very true as well. Which was to not gamble with people you're close to.</p><br/><p>It could either be yours or his victory. He might not want to leave when you want to stop gambling and you might not want to leave when he wants to stop gambling. Furthermore, it'll result in lending and borrowing of money which will complicate matters. In the end, you might even lose out.</p><br/><p>Master Lin's dazzling skills made Zhou Hang feel as if he was the God of Gambling. He could get any card he wanted. Furthermore, Master Lin even pointed out that people used this trick but he just wouldn't teach it to anyone.</p><br/><p>He started to think that Master Lin was just trying to gain popularity before teaching it to people and charging them fees. But now, he felt that Master Lin was trying to get people to quit gambling.</p><br/><p>There was a wealthy man who donated a hundred rockets to Master Lin just to learn a single trick from him.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin didn't even teach him anything. The wealthy man was anxious and wanted a refund from him. But there wasn't a need to care about it since he hadn't been forced to donate at all.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin really refunded him half the donation and paid the taxes. As for the other half, he asked him to approach the company for it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he just laughed and felt that Master Lin was being a joke.</p><br/><p>Soon, it was 5 pm in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Master Lin ended the live stream but Zhou Hang felt that there was so much more that he wanted to see. At the same time, he knew all the cons of gambling since he had experienced them before. Then, he switched on his phone and sent a WeChat message to his friends on WeChat.</p><br/><p>\"I'm going to quit gambling. I'm going to find a new job too. If you wish to catch up with me, it's best that we talk about things over tea.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was always a first time for everyone. Initially, he had been pretty nervous but thankfully there weren't a lot of people present and he felt more relaxed.</p><br/><p>\"What's the meaning of this?\" Lin Fan was puzzled by the four people kneeling on the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at his four children and sighed. \"It's all because of the four of you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing lowered his head. \"Dad, I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't call me dad. I don't have children like you.\" Zhao Ming Qing was furious. He was already old and it wasn't easy for him to get angry. However, this time, it was obvious that his children had done something to cause the discipleship ceremony to turn out like that.</p><br/><p>\"Ming Qing, don't be angry. What happened?\" Lin Fan was curious. Could there be a hidden meaning?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \"Teacher, they thought I met a conman and I don't even know what these four children did. Li Xing, tell me, what did you do?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing was the oldest sibling and he had to answer for it. \"Dad, we've not been supportive of you having a mentor. He's so young. How could his medical skills be compared to yours? We all thought that you've been conned. Therefore, we called our Aunties and Uncles to stop them from coming. It'd be shameful.\"</p><br/><p>\"What did you say? Say that again. Shameful? Who'd be shameful?\" Zhao Ming Qing had been rather appeased but after hearing his words, he was infuriated. Then, he looked around as if he was looking for something to use to teach them a lesson.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi couldn't take it any longer. \"Husband, the children meant well. Don't be so angry.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up. You've always been lenient with them. Look at how they've turned out. Do you even know what it means to respect your mentor?\" Zhao Ming Qing was furious while Elder Mu tried to appease him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing couldn't accept it and felt that his mentor had been unfairly treated. They couldn't understand the talents of his teacher. It was his great fortune to have met a teacher like him. These people actually ruined a grand ceremony. If it was told to the public, people would definitely laugh at him and his mentor.</p><br/><p>\"Ming Qing,\" Lin Fan said. It felt rather weird calling an old man over seventy years old by his first name but he believed that he would be used to it soon.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing came to Lin Fan. \"Teacher, I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"It's okay. Forget it. It's not a big thing. It's normal anyway. After all, I'm too young and your children meant well. Let's just ignore this and I won't care about this. Since you take me as your teacher, I will impart my skills to you and you have to be serious in learning. The secrets of Chinese medicine are difficult to teach by mouth. I'll teach you personally when I'm free.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's rather late now and I'm pretty tired. I'll be heading back first to rest.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \"Teacher, I'll send you back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"It's okay. You're already so old. You don't have to send me back. The ceremony is already completed. Don't take it too seriously from now on. I'll be leaving now.\"</p><br/><p>He stood up and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing sent him to the door personally and his children were still kneeling on the ground. They knew that it was just the beginning and things were far from over. But they really didn't believe that he wasn't a conman. They believed that it was temporal and he would definitely be exposed one day.</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, it's all because of me,\" Zhao Ming Qing said guiltily. It had been supposed to be a grand ceremony and it had become like this. He was extremely saddened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't older than Zhao Ming Qing but he was his mentor. He patted Zhao Qing Ming's shoulder. \"Alright, it's nothing much. I think it was a traditional and grand ceremony. You can go back and have a rest.\"</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, have a safe trip!\" Elder Mu waved his hand.</p><br/><p>After sending him off, Zhao Ming Qing's face turned as black as thunder. \"Scumbags. I have to kill these four rascals.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu tried to persuade him, \"Elder Zhao, what are you doing? Your children are so old already. You shouldn't resort to violence.\"</p><br/><p>\"They're still kids in my eyes regardless of how old they are. My mentor is now their grand teacher. They don't even know basic respect. They deserve to be beaten.\" Zhao Ming Qing was an understanding man but he was extremely strict with his own children. He went to the lobby and took a duster from the staff. Then, he said, 'Miss, I'll borrow this duster for awhile.'\"</p><br/><p>The person nodded as she had to agree to the requests of customers.</p><br/><p>Back in the hall.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing and the others looked at each other. \"Sigh, we're dead this time.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi said, \"Quickly run away now. When your dad comes back, you'll be doomed.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing shook his head. \"Mum, you don't have to say anything else. We'll take it this time. When dad realizes that he has been conned in the future, he'll remember today.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing's voice came.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Zhao, listen to me. Forget about it.\" Elder Mu said.</p><br/><p>The door got pushed open.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood there furiously. His teacher had been there and he hadn't wanted things to turn out ugly even though Lin Fan didn't mind. He hadn't wanted to let him see this scene as it was supposed to be a grand ceremony. Now, he couldn't tolerate it anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Qun Fang, stand aside,\" Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Qun Fang heaved a sigh of relief. If her dad really started to beat them up, she wouldn't have dared to grumble. However, she was already married and he felt that she should be disciplined by her husband's side only.</p><br/><p>The three brothers looked at their sister and it was a little awkward. She was so lucky. She didn't even think of being beaten up together or even say anything nice to appease him.</p><br/><p>They knew that they were doomed when they saw their sister's nonchalant expression.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood in front of his children. \"Do you know what wrong you've done?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing was already in his twenties but he was like a kid kneeling in front of his dad. \"Dad, this\u2026\"</p><br/><p>*Smack!*</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing swung the duster at Zhao Li Xing's back. Then, he said firmly, \"You're already so old and you think you can handle things yourselves. Do you remember teaching your younger brothers the rules when you were young?\"</p><br/><p>\"I remember,\" Zhao Li Xing said. He just nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\"Recite it now.\" Although Zhao Ming Qing was old, he suddenly raged and beat the three of them with the duster.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi couldn't watch any longer and she shook her head at Elder Mu. However, she didn't say anything as the children had gone overboard this time.</p><br/><p>\"One should listen to the orders of one's parents and one shouldn't be lazy to execute the task\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said sternly, \"I tolerated all of that.\"</p><br/><p>\"I tolerated all of that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He continued hitting them until he broke down. Zhao Li Xing and his two brothers closed their eyes when they saw that. They felt heartbroken. \"One should listen to the teachings of one's parents.\"</p><br/><p>\"One has to be responsible for their parents.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, a lot of people came.</p><br/><p>When they saw what was happening, they were stunned. Then, they gasped, \"Elder Zhao, what are you doing? Why are you hitting your sons? Stop!\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu heaved a sigh of relief when he saw them. Finally, somebody was there to salvage the situation. Although it was a little late, it wasn't too late.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

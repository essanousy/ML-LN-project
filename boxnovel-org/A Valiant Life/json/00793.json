He immediately went forward. \u201cDad, Mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old couple saw their son and were beaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you could have just told us your address,\u201d said Papa Lin with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I do that? If people find out that I do that, they would scold me to death.\u201d Lin Fan smiled back. However, his hands did not stop moving. He took their luggage and started walking towards the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to Shanghai in so many years. When I came here back then, it was to do volunteer work with your Mom,\u201d said Papa Lin with a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, later on, I\u2019ll bring you and Mom to take a look around. Shanghai has changed a lot in these recent years. It\u2019s even better than Zhongzhou now,\u201d said Lin Fan as he placed the luggage in the back of the car.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin looked at the car. \u201cSon, this car looks very expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. That guy, Ming Yang, gave it to me,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. Then, he saw his old man taking out his phone and taking a picture. Lin Fan laughed, \u201cWhat are you doing, Dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin glared at the old man. \u201cWhat else could he be doing? Your Dad is definitely going to send this to his chat groups. He wants to show off again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much about that. \u201cMom, as long as Dad is happy, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin refuted, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me taking a photo of my son\u2019s car. I raised him up and now he\u2019s become capable. Can\u2019t I show off a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, show off if you want. Lil\u2019 Fan, you should tell your Dad off. He keeps showing off to people. Then, people come to him to borrow money. Without saying anything else, he just lends money to them. He even says that if he doesn\u2019t lend them money, people will think that you\u2019re looking down on people just because you\u2019ve become rich now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even have that much money to lend and we don\u2019t even know when they\u2019ll return the money,\u201d Mama Lin complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, why are you saying all this in front of our son? Other people have come asking us for help and they\u2019re really having difficulties. How can we not help?\u201d said Papa Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cMom, just go with what Dad says. Money is just superficial. Don\u2019t let it cause you worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He understood his dad. His dad could never save money and he never became rich in his life but when his friends wanted to borrow money, he would rarely refuse. Moreover, when he went to other people asking for money, he would look very ashamed and if those people complained just a little, he would return without taking any money at all.</p><br/><p>Just because of this, Lin Fan had seen many arguments at home when he had been young.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and your Dad are the same. Why don\u2019t you tell him to go and look for his friends to borrow money now? If he can borrow twenty thousand, I\u2019ll be convinced.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin said, \u201cWho says I won\u2019t be able to borrow that? Are you looking down on me? Those friends won\u2019t withhold anything from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that his parents had started arguing again and laughed helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Dad, Mom, let me bring you to my shop to take a look.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t want his parents to really start arguing, so he hurried them into the car.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin was looking at his chat groups on his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Elder Lin, Lil\u2019 Fan is really incredible. I asked my daughter. She said that this is a Hummer and it costs several million dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin: \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive! Sigh, no wonder it feels so comfortable sitting here. Next time, I\u2019ll call all of you along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, my child is always idling about every day now. Could you ask Lil\u2019 Fan is there are any suitable paths for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin: \u201cAlright, no problem. I\u2019ll ask later on. But if this turns out well, you have to treat me to wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it just asking one question?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where has Elder Lin gone for the New Year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Shanghai to spend the New Year at his son\u2019s place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin is really living a good life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw his Dad using his phone the whole time through the mirror. He asked curiously, \u201cDad, who are you talking to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo some of your Uncles and Aunties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cIt\u2019s just some yatter. Nothing proper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin said, \u201cSon, let me ask you something. Could you help your Uncle Wang\u2019s son find a job?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Mama Lin heard this, she was in disagreement. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? Wang Lao Zhong\u2019s son always idles around and he even stole things from his workplace last time. He got caught and fired because of that. Now you\u2019re asking our son to introduce him to a job? Aren\u2019t you afraid of our son being affected?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin wasn\u2019t an idiot. When he heard his wife say this, he felt that it was indeed not a good idea after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. This kid is a little dishonest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard all this and felt a little helpless. \u201cDad, I can introduce him to a job but he should be a little more reliable. If he\u2019s so notorious for his misdeeds, even though I\u2019ll be able to get him a job, he\u2019d just bring trouble to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin replied, \u201cRight, right. Your Dad didn\u2019t think this through. I\u2019ll quickly reject him and say that there\u2019s no job available.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and didn\u2019t say much about that. \u201cOh right, is Uncle Li\u2019s family spending the new year in Zhongzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin replied, \u201cMmhmm. Your Uncle Li is spending his new year in Zhongzhou this year. On the second day of the New Year, we\u2019ll be returning to Zhonghou and visiting your Uncle Li. In the past, when things happened to you, your Dad was frightened out of his wits. If it wasn\u2019t for your Uncle Lin\u2019s comforting, who knows how frightened your Dad would have been?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin said, \u201cYou\u2019re saying it as if you weren\u2019t frightened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cIn my view, the only reliable friend that you\u2019ve ever made in your whole life is him. And you still always showing off in front of him. It\u2019s good enough that he hasn\u2019t broken off connections with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know? That\u2019s me and Elder Li\u2019s way of communicating. Moreover, why would Elder Li break off connections with me just over this small matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was too lazy to say anything to his Dad.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t changed his whole life. He was like this when he had been young and he was the same even when he was old.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your personality, you\u2019d be lucky if you\u2019re not cheated. Luckily, our son isn\u2019t like you. Otherwise, things would be horrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin was upset. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is wrong. When we were young, you agreed to be with me and you even said that you like this personality of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you were thick-skinned back then. On a snowy day, you stood outside my house at midnight with a flower that only God knows where you got from. You scared my Dad and Mom into thinking that you were a thief and they beat you half to death. You forgot about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pfft!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan burst out laughing, \u201cDad, you were like that when you were young?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin\u2019s face turned red. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to your Mom. Can\u2019t you say better things in front of our son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan listened to his parents\u2019 bickering and didn\u2019t say much else. However, thinking about that story, he found it very hilarious.</p><br/><p>Of course, he knew what kind of personality his dad had.</p><br/><p>His dad was weird. Even after he grew old, it was the same.</p><br/><p>But still, it was pretty good. How hard it must have been for him to maintain himself.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, Mom, we\u2019ve reached. Let\u2019s get off the car,\u201d said Lin Fan as he stopped the car in front of the shop.</p><br/><p>In the shop, Wu You Lan saw the car. Then, she became a little nervous. Her manner was a little rushed.</p><br/><p>Then, she took out a mirror and took a close look. Everything was fine. There was nothing wrong.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin and Mama Lin emerged from the car.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan immediately went forward. \u201cUncle, Auntie, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin\u2019s eyes lit up as soon as she saw Wu You Lan as if she had discovered The New World.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung lady, you are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cAuntie, I\u2019m Brother Lin\u2019s staff. I\u2019m Wu You Lan but you can call me You Lan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Brother Lin\u2019s parents for the first time, she felt very nervous.</p><br/><p>She was afraid that Brother Lin\u2019s parents wouldn\u2019t like her.</p></div>\n</div>"}

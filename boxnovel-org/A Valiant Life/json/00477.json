These guys were exactly like the guys who came here a while back, wearing singlets and with tattoos all over their bodies. Their demeanor was also the same, with the same evil intentions.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi furrowed his eyebrows in annoyance. \u201cGodly Doctor, how about we go into the hospital? If you go inside to hold your clinic and they still come to disturb us, I can guarantee that they will be charged in court.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Lin Fan waved him away.</p><br/><p>The justice senses of the reporters were tingling as all of them began pointing their cameras towards the thugs. \u201cWhat do you guys want? If you\u2019re looking to get treatment, queue up. If you\u2019re here to cause trouble, we will take your pictures and post them online.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Hu stared at the journalists with an air of arrogance. \u201cCome, continue taking your pictures. We will just stand here and prevent you from running your clinic. It\u2019s also just nice that I haven\u2019t been in the news for quite a while, so I might become popular from this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were all stunned. These guys weren\u2019t the same as before.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao nodded his head in approval as he saw what was going on from his limousine. Wu Tao pointed at the mafia as he said to his henchmen, \u201cLook, these guys aren\u2019t scared at all, only you guys are. Are your faces made of gold?\u201d</p><br/><p>His henchmen continued to keep their heads low and they stayed silent. There was no guilt, but their hearts continued racing. How could they really be like them? The mafia did that for a living. These henchmen could never be like them.</p><br/><p>However, they sometimes admired how thick-skinned the people in the mafia were, to the point of getting almost anything they wanted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up at Brother Hu, shaking his head.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu laughed coldly. \u201cBrat, what are you shaking your head at? I tell you, no matter how many times you shake your head, you will never be able to stop me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>The patients gathered up their courage and started scolding the thugs from the mafia. \u201cWhat do you guys want over here? We are just here to get treated by the Godly Doctor. You guys have no sympathy at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Hu turned around, glaring at the reporters. \u201cIs sympathy worth anything? What does this have anything to do with sympathy anyway? Are there any rules saying that we can\u2019t stand here to keep cool under the shade here? Is this your house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can stand at the side to stay under the shade,\u201d the patients replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are happy standing where we are. What does this have to do with you?\u201d Brother Hu replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what should we do?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing whispered to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, let me handle this,\u201d Lin Fan smiled at him reassuringly.</p><br/><p>Martial Art wasn\u2019t the only method of solving conflicts, although it did provide a good temporary method of instilling fear into the foes. But was he the kind of person to use force as he pleased?</p><br/><p>Unless Lin Fan was absolutely pissed, he would never resort to physical force.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stared at Brother Hu, sighing. \u201cI was shaking my head not because I was helpless, but I just wanted to say how pitiful you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Hu stood there, shocked. \u201cMe? Pitiful? Keep dreaming, brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really pity your kids, to experience your lifestyle of crime at such a young age. Although you regret it a little, you never got to make up for it. Don\u2019t you think so, Zhang Hu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Hu wanted to retort with an angry statement, but in that instant, he was stunned. \u201cYou know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you personally but I know a lot of things about you. For instance, I know about your three-year-old daughter who has an issue in here. As for the reason, I trust that you know it,\u201d Lin Fan said, shaking his head and pointing towards his brain.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu was frozen stiff by what Lin Fan said. After Lin Fan had mentioned his own daughter, his heart exploded with a violent rage, and just as he was about to grab the table with both his hands to flip it, he stopped in his tracks after hearing what Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe child is innocent. If your attitude is better, I promise I will take a look at her. I trust that you will make the proper decision as her father,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu\u2019s daughter was born to a woman who was a drug addict. Even after she had gotten pregnant, she didn\u2019t stop her habit. After Brother Hu had found out about it, he flew into a terrible rage. And after the child was born, the doctors all said that because of the drug intake, the child\u2019s mental abilities were stunted and she had learning difficulties.</p><br/><p>She would grow up to be different from the rest. She would have impeded intelligence, be slow of speech and have all the other problems that came with mental retardation.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu grabbed onto the table, his mind in internal conflict, not knowing what to do.</p><br/><p>He knew that he wasn\u2019t a good man, but he absolutely loved his daughter. Ever since his daughter had been diagnosed with her condition, he had tried to exert his power and dominance even more, because he didn\u2019t want anyone to hurt her and he made sure that no one would say anything bad about her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, before turning towards the patients, asking, \u201cTell him who I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Godly Doctor,\u201d the patients unanimously said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed the Godly Doctor. If your kid has any ailment, you better send him to the Godly Doctor. If you miss your chance, you won\u2019t ever have another shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you\u2019re not the greatest of people, I still agree with what the Godly Doctor said. The child is innocent. You guys didn\u2019t even think about the kid and still continued to take drugs during pregnancy. It is no wonder her growth was stunted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever the Godly Doctor said just now, I have experienced it before. I have a cousin who took drugs while pregnant and the child came out mentally retarded. The child is really pitiful. He\u2019s eight years old and still doesn\u2019t know what 1+1 is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The patients continued talking, causing Brother Hu to become even more confused.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu looked at his subordinates, who had gone through thick and thin with him. One of his men spoke up. \u201cCan you really heal Brother Hu\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been with Brother Hu for many years and naturally knew about Brother Hu\u2019s daughter. They respected Brother Hu for being such a loving father even though his daughter was mentally retarded and wasn\u2019t lively at all. She didn\u2019t even know how to handle simple problems, causing them to feel really helpless.</p><br/><p>This problem didn\u2019t require Lin Fan to answer. The patients all opened their mouths saying, \u201cWhat kind of person is the Godly Doctor? He is the Godly Doctor! Do you even need to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, replying calmly, \u201cChinese Medicine and Metaphysics are related in certain ways. I could tell all this from looking at your Yin and Yang as well as your five elements and from your appearance as well. If you want, you can bring your child here and I will treat her. If you still continue to create a ruckus here, I can guarantee that you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs what you said true? What happens if you can\u2019t heal my daughter?\u201d Brother Hu looked at Lin Fan, asking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started getting a little annoyed. \u201cCareful with your tone. I am treating your daughter because she is innocent. If you so much as step across the line, I won\u2019t be so friendly with you guys anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Hu hadn\u2019t been talked to in this manner for quite a long time, but he changed his tone. \u201cGodly Doctor, can you really heal my daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t I said already? Bring your daughter here. What else do you want to ask?\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu didn\u2019t say anything else as he turned to his brothers. \u201cGo, fetch my daughter. And hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Brother Hu.\u201d His men turned and ran. Whatever trouble that he had been about to cause, he decided against it. Compared to his daughter, there was no comparison.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan signaled to the patients. \u201cNext patient!\u201d</p><br/><p>The patients all queued up neatly, while Brother Hu stood at the side, lighting up his cigarette, face full of worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are so many patients here and you\u2019re smoking? Please extinguish your cigarette,\u201d Lin Fan nagged.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu looked at Lin Fan and immediately stepped on his cigarette to extinguish the flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any public morals? This is a public space, not a rubbish dump. Can\u2019t you throw it in the bin over there?\u201d Lin Fan nagged again.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu heaved a heavy sigh, picking up his cigarette butt. He walked over to the bin, tossing it in.</p><br/><p>What kind of situation was this?</p><br/><p>This made Brother Hu feel a little embarrassed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

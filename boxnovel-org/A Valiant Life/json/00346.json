In fact, deep in each of their hearts, they had the tendency to cause trouble. When someone stood out and everyone started crying out, this tendency to cause trouble was stimulated.</p><br/><p>They went into battle with their brooms. Everyone blocked off the entrance to Cloud Street. Those seven guys had dumbfounded looks on their faces. They had been doing these things for a long time but they had never seen something like this. In the past, people would surround them too but they had mostly been there to spectate the scene. If you had asked the spectators to come forward to have a go, they would never have dared to do it. However, that day, it was as if they had seen a ghost on Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Out of the seven men, a sturdy-looking, dark-skinned man pointed at Lin Fan and exclaimed, \"What are you trying to do? Don't you know that you're breaking the law?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the seven men. \"I'm not going to bully you. Just obediently pick up all the things and then scram off from Cloud Street.\"</p><br/><p>\"My a*s! You must be dreaming. You're good. I'm going to call people here right now. These obstructions of yours are against the law. You even surrounded us. Looks like you want to start a rebellion.\" The man took out his phone and said, \"Gather the people at Cloud Street. There are people obstructing us here. Quick\u2026come quickly.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk had taken their phones and started recording the scene long ago.</p><br/><p>\"These guys are really too arrogant. They're simply tarnishing the name of our government.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! Nowadays, many places' enforcement officers have resorted to friendly law enforcement but these guys still dare to use violence.\"</p><br/><p>\"Record their faces.\"</p><br/><p>\"We'll post these videos onto the Internet and let even more people see them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Snatch their ID's away to prevent them from running. Otherwise, those departments will refuse to admit their fault.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The seven men looked at Lin Fan and the rest. \"You all are finding trouble for yourselves. Do you know how big of a crime you're committing by doing what you're doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right. You're the mastermind. We've already remembered your face. Don't think that you're awesome. Just wait and see.\"</p><br/><p>These people continued to talk big without any fear of Lin Fan and the Cloud Street shop owners. They really didn't believe that these people would dare to do anything to them.</p><br/><p>One of the younger men glared at Lin Fan aggressively and said, \"If you think we'll pick up these peaches, let me tell you that that's impossible!\"</p><br/><p>*Thump!*</p><br/><p>The man stepped again and again on the peaches, smashing them into pieces and splattering them all over the floor. Then, he stared provokingly at Lin Fan as if to say 'What are you going to do to us?'.</p><br/><p>The man even walked up to Lin Fan's face and placed his face right in front of Lin Fan's. He said, \"Come, I'm putting my face out. Hit me.\" Then, he growled angrily at Lin Fan, \"If you have any balls, then hit me!\"</p><br/><p>The volume of his shout was loud and it was full of dominance. The surrounding townsfolk were scared stiff. Even the shop owners reacted the same. They had all been shaken by this guy's dominance.</p><br/><p>\"You don't dare to hit me, right? Let me tell you, even if you had ten guts, you wouldn't dare. I'll say it out now, if any of you dare to move, there will be a place reserved for you in jail.\" Then, the man grabbed the old man's arm and said, \"Follow me back. You must've thought that with people helping you, you could defy the law and do whatever you want.\"</p><br/><p>When the other six men saw this, they instantly started smiling. This kid really proved himself to be someone who had lived on the streets before. His dominance was still as great as before and he had managed to scare all the people of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When the enforcement officers became serious, these people had no choice but to be scared stiff. Those uniforms that they were wearing were enough to scare them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath. There was anger written on his face. Suddenly, his hands moved. He grabbed that man's arm and with a shoulder throw, he threw that man onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\"Beat them.\" With a single command from Lin Fan, the surrounding shop owners all raised the brooms in their hands and charged towards the other six men.</p><br/><p>When the seven of them saw this, they were flabbergasted. \"You dare\u2026\"</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>In an instant, the whole scene had become messy. The six men were getting hit all over by the brooms. They were writhing in pain.</p><br/><p>\"Stop\u2026\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The shop owners backed off.</p><br/><p>The seven men's faces were all red. When those brooms had hit their bodies a moment ago, they had been crying out like girls. At that moment, one of them lay on the floor, looking at Lin Fan in shock.</p><br/><p>They had never thought that these people would really dare to hit them.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk's blood had started boiling as well. F*cking awesome. This is really f*cking awesome! They had never seen anything like this before.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! These Cloud Street shop owners handled it beautifully.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! Who would believe this if he or she didn't see it personally?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nowadays, everyone is too protective of themselves. When they come across any situation, they just stand and watch from the side. If someone dared to go up and say a few words of justice, that would already be pretty good. This old man doesn't seem to be related to them at all, yet they started fighting for justice. I have to say that they are awesome.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brothers, I already know how this is going to end. Master Lin will definitely be taken away. These few people must be temporary workers.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is actually quite a funny problem. Whenever something happens, they hire low-quality temporary workers. I don't understand this. They already know it's low quality, why do they still hire temporary workers?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because these temporary workers are efficient. Even if something happens they can just be dismissed. There won't be any loss at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"That makes sense.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gave Lin Fan a tug and said, \"Stay calm. Don't cause anything big.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yep, I know. I'm not going to do much.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked at the seven men and said, \"I'm not going to speak any rubbish with you all. One peach is three dollars. You stepped on them. If it adds up to a hundred dollars, then give us a hundred dollars. After that, pick up the rest and scram.\"</p><br/><p>The seven of them had been beaten senseless. That young man who was full of vigor hooted, \"You're dreaming! Let me tell you that this isn't over.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance at him, then said, \"Continue hitting them.\"</p><br/><p>The shop owners charged at them once more while cursing them.</p><br/><p>\"Bunch of dogs! You're still so arrogant!\"</p><br/><p>\"We don't care what happens elsewhere but this is our Cloud Street. We won't let you off so easily!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! If you ever appear at Cloud Street again, we'll curse you once everytime we see you.\"</p><br/><p>Just as the shop owners were about to reach them, a middle-aged man among the seven men shouted, \"Don't hit us! I'll pay...I'll pay.\"</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man's face was filled with rage but at that moment, he had no choice. He took out a hundred dollars.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the money. \"These hundred dollars are for the peaches. The old man was injured by you guys. Five hundred dollars for his medical fees.\"</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man said angrily, \"You can't be too arrogant. We've been hit buy you all too.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"I'm telling you to pay for the old man's medical fees. We hit you and we'll settle that later on. You understand?\"</p><br/><p>In the end, the middle-aged man grudgingly took out six hundred dollars.</p><br/><p>\"Go, pick up the peaches,\" said Lin Fan. then, he thrust the money into the old man's hands. \"Take the money. Next time you come to Cloud Street, no one will bully you.\"</p><br/><p>The old man had been moved to tears. His dark hands wiped the corner of his eyes as he said, \"Thank you. Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \"There is no need for thanks. If you have to thank us, thank everyone.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the seven of them bent down and shamefully picked up the peaches, then placed them back into the basket. They had never thought that something like this would happen that day but it would certainly not have such a simple ending.</p><br/><p>After everything had been kept.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the seven men and pointed at the street entrance. \"Now, hurry up and scram. Don't ever appear on Cloud Street again. Otherwise, we'll give you a beating everytime we see you. These words were said by me. You can call whoever you want over.\"</p><br/><p>The seven men stared at those despicable shop owners. They had never thought that these owners would be so united. Also, they had called for reinforcements. Why weren't they there yet?</p><br/><p>The seven men just left shamefully.</p><br/><p>The shop owners started crying out in joy.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and scram!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't ever appear here again, or we'll show you something good!\"</p><br/><p>\"They really think too highly of themselves. All they know is to bully the weak but they're scared of the strong. Next time, they can come and look for us for a fight.\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder who spoiled them. Just because someone doesn't listen to their orders, they start hitting people. They're really 'f*cking awesome'.</p><br/><p>Those shop owners' words made the seven of their faces turn so gloomy it was scary. That was the most shameful day of their lives.</p><br/><p>They couldn't take it.</p><br/><p>But for now, they had no choice. They didn't have the ability to argue back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

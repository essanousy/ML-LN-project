Are these people be so despicable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said this from the start. Our country has some very corrupted people who take advantage of their seniority. Whenever they see something good, they want a share of it and they\u2019re always looking to gain some fame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already knew that Master Lin was writing new teaching materials but I never thought that this would happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t there several senior specialists on there that are from around here? They\u2019ve written quite a number of teaching materials. Do you think that they used this kind of method to sign their names on those too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t those senior specialists and senior professors said anything? Have they been made a fool by Master Lin? It couldn\u2019t be that they thought that Master Lin would just swallow this humiliation, right? I think they must all be flabbergasted right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been observing the situation on the Internet the whole time. Although things looked peaceful and nobody had come out yet, those people must have been thinking of ways to resolve this.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>In the early morning.</p><br/><p>Those senior specialists who hadn\u2019t said anything yet suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang\u2019s Weibo: \u201cIt is normal to sign our names on teaching materials. Master Lin\u2019s teaching materials had gone through tens of our professors\u2019 audits and among them, ten professors found some parts that weren\u2019t entirely correct, so they made changes to the teaching materials. Making changes to teaching materials and then signing our names on them is a very normal thing. However, Master Lin doesn\u2019t agree with this. We think that it is a shame that Master Lin has misunderstood us. We are deeply apologetic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Wang\u2019s Weibo: \u201cThe contents of the teaching materials are very good. Tens of us professors conducted an audit over several days and found problems within them. Eventually, we made changes to the teaching materials but we never thought that Master Lin would misread this as us robbing him of his hard-earned achievements. This is a misunderstanding. We hope that Master Lin can understand that this is actually a very normal thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, gradually, many more professors stepped out and spoke as well. Of course, they were all supporting Professor Yang and the rest.</p><br/><p>There were even some with more heated statements, all criticizing Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Professor Zhang: \u201cThis is a real shame. Initially, when we saw the contents of these teaching materials, we were stunned by Master Lin. It\u2019s a shame but we never thought that he would care so much about fame and wealth. We senior professors painstakingly conducted the audit but in the end, we have to endure such scoldings. This is heartbreaking. Simply heartbreaking.</p><br/><p>The people who had good relationships with these senior professors stepped out and supported them as well. At the same time, they expressed their detest for Lin Fan\u2019s behavior.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin is really ridiculous. These old professors painstakingly did the audit and even corrected his mistakes for him. This is their hard work as well and it is perfectly normal for them to sign their names.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I really am. I never thought that this godly doctor cared so much about personal fame and wealth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, you\u2019re all f*cking stupid. All these old guys are trying to steal Master Lin\u2019s achievements. And they\u2019re even shameless enough to act pitiful. This is too disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI support the senior professors and I look down on this Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you all really not differentiate between right and wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, the public opinion on the Internet had split into two groups. Some people supported Lin Fan and some supported those senior professors. They had actually managed to turn the situation around.</p><br/><p>In life, everything depends on putting on a show.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had a look of fury. \u201cThese people are too despicable. They\u2019re basically speaking blind words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cThis isn\u2019t easy to deal with. These are all senior professors and they all have high standings in society. If you mess with them, you\u2019ll mess with all of them and it might be dangerous. Why aren\u2019t you worried at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to worry about? This is just the beginning. I still have to sue them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan gave a call to Wang Ming Yang. he didn\u2019t understand the law too much so he decided to get help from Wang Ming Yang. He couldn\u2019t let off any of those old guys. He didn\u2019t need any compensation from them but he needed their apology.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang erupted when he found out about this incident. These old guys dared to bully his own brother. They were basically looking for a fight. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s afraid of who.</p><br/><p>In a certain conference room.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang and the rest were laughing. There had been a turn of events.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this kid wanted to challenge us. I wonder where he gets his confidence from.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe refused to give in when we were nice to him but now it\u2019s gotten even worse for him. For us to sign our names is already giving face to him. He really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the medical world, having superb medical abilities isn\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is whether you know how to do things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true. So what if you have great medical abilities? This kind of situation is not uncommon. Who was that guy who was known as the Divine Surgeon twenty years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Bin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. That Chen Bin really didn\u2019t know what was good for him. And where is he now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had forgotten about this incident. I think it was Professor Yang that handled him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang laughed, \u201cHandled him? That\u2019s called sending him to the village. I arranged for him to be sent to the village hospital and he never got promoted back here again. He has probably retired by now. It was just a small move to take a little bit of pension.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I remember that. That\u2019s similar to this kid. He didn\u2019t agree with us and had to do things the correct way no matter what. Now, he\u2019ll regret it for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut those village people really should thank us for sending a good doctor to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true but what use is a bit of thanks?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were split into North and South Sectors. Many people cooperated with them but there were also people who were unwilling to follow them. In the end, those that don\u2019t agree with them were always suppressed.</p><br/><p>Some talented people write teaching materials but when they reach the hands of the auditors, the teaching materials don\u2019t pass. If they didn\u2019t want to let the teaching materials pass, they could come up with a thousand reasons:</p><br/><p>In order to maintain a harmonious society, we can\u2019t use this.</p><br/><p>This has too much content that is similar to other books, there are too many references, so it cannot be distributed.</p><br/><p>They could come up with as many reasons as they liked.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters came to Cloud Street. This matter had a large impact. Although only a day had passed, as long as the matter involved Master Lin, the reporters had to come.</p><br/><p>However, there has been quite a lot of news involving Master Lin lately. Just after getting out of prison, another incident has emerged. What a restless person.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian took a glance. \u201cThe reporters are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the reporters, a smile appeared on his face. \u201cI\u2019ve waited very long for you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters rushed forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can you tell us about how the senior professors signed their names on the teaching materials written by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the truth? Or did you copy these teaching materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, may I ask\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The questions came one after another.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and took out his phone. \u201cMy dear reporters, after you watch this video, you will know the truth. I don\u2019t need to say anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters looked at his phone, wondering what kind of video it was.</p><br/><p>It started to play.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang was sitting on the stage. \u201cMaster Lin, this is what we\u2019ve decided after deep consideration\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This scene was when Professor Yang just started talking to Lin Fan. But Lin Fan had clearly told them that he was taking a video. He didn\u2019t expect that they would not mind. He didn\u2019t know if it was because they were big-hearted or something else.</p><br/><p>But it was good because he had attained this evidence.</p><br/><p>This time, he would definitely be able to sue them.</p><br/><p>In the conference room.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang, after a moment of silence, said, \u201cWhy do I keep feeling as if I\u2019ve forgotten something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was puzzled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang shook his head. He couldn\u2019t figure it out but he felt as if his heart was stifled up.</p></div>\n</div>"}

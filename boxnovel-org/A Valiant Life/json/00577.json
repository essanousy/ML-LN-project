He was the one that cracked the major human trafficking case and they definitely knew who he was since then.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhere are the few students locked at?\u201d</p><br/><p>The policeman replied, \u201cThey\u2019re inside. We\u2019re investigating the situation. Master Lin, how is the boy who jumped down?\u201d</p><br/><p>The policemen were concerned about the boy\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is okay. He is not in any danger anymore,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>They heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cThat\u2019s good then. Thank God he kept his life. School violence cases like this are common and I wonder why.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t say much. Why? It was obviously just a way that teenagers used to protect themselves.</p><br/><p>The times have changed and some laws have to be changed to meet the changes.</p><br/><p>In the past, teenagers who were 13 or 14 years old were still watching animated cartoons and they didn\u2019t think so much about these things.</p><br/><p>However, the Internet has been so developed these days and teenagers may even know more things than adults now.</p><br/><p>Inside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at those few students and they looked fearful. However, one of them looked calm and was trying to argue with the police officer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not involved. I only whacked him. I didn\u2019t ask him to kill himself. Why did you arrest me?\u201d Li Yang said calmly.</p><br/><p>The police officers shook their heads. This type of students was no different from the thugs outside.</p><br/><p>They just changed the location that they were messing in. They treated the school like the society outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the situation here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer replied, \u201cWe can only detain them for fourteen days. The situation depends on how their family members choose to settle with the victim\u2019s parents. If they can resolve it privately, then they wouldn\u2019t have to be detained for fourteen days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they only caused physical injuries. They caused him to commit suicide. His injuries should be considered to be a serious case. Shouldn\u2019t they be locked up for a few years and not just detained for fourteen days?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>The police officer was a little embarrassed, \u201cWe can\u2019t help it. The law states that those who are not of legal age cannot be punished so severely. Furthermore, there isn\u2019t any similar case in history that we can use to decide on the punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInitially, they could be sent to some disciplinary homes but these students are not even fourteen years of age. The law states that those who are not fourteen years old are to be disciplined by their parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cLook at them. Do you think they look like they\u2019re not fourteen years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer shook his head helplessly. Their identification cards were there and that was evidence. They couldn\u2019t have done anything about it.</p><br/><p>Then, some people came.</p><br/><p>A group of parents came in and were extremely frantic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, how are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are these police officers trying to do? My son is not even fourteen years old yet. You guys handcuffed him. Do you want him to be traumatized by this? What if he has flashbacks of this in the future? Are you going to be responsible for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to sue all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>These parents that entered were furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, save me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, save me. I don\u2019t want to stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those students were shouting for their parents.</p><br/><p>The police officers tried to manage the situation. Some of them were even stopped by the parents.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head but he was just looking at one of the males.</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t cause any trouble. He calmly handled the situation.</p><br/><p>Li Yang saw the person that walked over and said, \u201cDad, save me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man nodded and asked a police officer, \u201cWhere is your inspector?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan guessed that these parents were gathered by this man to make the situation more complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lin Fan said sternly. \u201cYour kids were violent to another student and caused him to commit suicide. He almost died and you guys can still make a big fuss out of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, the parents shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. My son will never do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It must have been a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son is a very kind boy. He wouldn\u2019t even bear to kill a chicken. How could he show violence towards a student?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be maligning him. Quick, release my kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer replied, \u201cMaster Lin, this matter isn\u2019t as simple as it is. We can only let them out quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to say anything else. Anyway, he couldn\u2019t have spoken to them about it. Even if this matter was real, they wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, those kids looked innocent and fearful. They looked as if the incident didn\u2019t happen.</p><br/><p>After a while later.</p><br/><p>Li Yang\u2019s father appeared with the Inspector of the police station, Inspector Wang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d Inspector Wang said.</p><br/><p>The parents kept quiet. It was obvious that they wanted their kids to be released as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Inspector Wang added, \u201cWe are currently investigating this matter. Your children caused physical harm to another student in school. That has been confirmed. According to the rules, we have to conduct further investigation. What you can do now is to speak to the parents of the victim and seek forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The parents didn\u2019t agree to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, what if he doesn\u2019t want to forgive us? My son is not even fourteen years old. Could he end up in jail? The law didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, my child is so young. How could he be locked here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe admit our mistakes but you have to release our kids to let us discipline them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inspector Wang was frustrated, \u201cSend them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officers went forward and asked them to leave the police station.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to release all of them now. The online discussions couldn\u2019t be of any help. Furthermore, the educational department was also involved in this matter. The situation was still unknown to many of them.</p><br/><p>Then, Inspector Wang looked at Lin Fan, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cInspector Wang, how are you going to resolve this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inspector Wang sighed, \u201cSigh, Master Lin, you don\u2019t know how difficult this matter is. Right, this is Li Yang\u2019s dad. Li Hu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu stretched out his hand and smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Master Lin\u2019s reputation. I didn\u2019t expect you to be so young. I really didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Li Hu and shook his hand. Then, Lin Fan gently sniffed. \u201cYour hand smells weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu was a little embarrassed and guilty. Then, he smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re humorous. What do you mean by my hand smells weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Lil\u2019 Yang is wrong for this matter. I will discipline him sternly. At the same time, I will speak nicely to the victim\u2019s parents. I hope we can be forgiven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sneered, \u201cHe\u2019s probably like that because of you. Since the older generation is involved in vices, it is normal for the younger generation to turn out like that. Your \u2018stern disciplinary measures\u2019 will probably not change anything. I think he should be thrown behind bars for a few years to learn from his lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu was furious but he held it back, \u201cMaster Lin, I don\u2019t really catch what you are saying. This matter is indeed infuriating. My son turned out like that because I am bad at educating him. I will be going to the hospital to talk to the victim\u2019s father. I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that Li Hu was already overthinking but he wasn\u2019t bothered by it. He knew that something was up with him.</p><br/><p>If he was an honest man, he would definitely be okay to settle this matter slowly.</p><br/><p>If he was a dishonest man, he would definitely make things difficult for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cInspector Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Inspector Wang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cI suggest Inspector Wang stay away from this type of person. You might be in trouble because of him and it will be too late to regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inspector Wang was stunned. However, when he wanted to ask him about it, Lin Fan had already left.</p></div>\n</div>"}

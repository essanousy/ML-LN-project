It is impossible for this so-called pill to be able to cure leukemia! I hope that the news media are able to report the truth, rather than to report fake news just to be able to capture the world\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yellow Sea First Class Hospital: @Yangtze River First Class Hospital, I support this!</p><br/><p>These two hospitals were related, so naturally, they would support each other.</p><br/><p>Moreover, in the entire history of medicine, such a situation was simply impossible.</p><br/><p>The other hospitals also sounded out their concerns regarding this issue.</p><br/><p>After all, this was considered as an unbelievable thing. After all, how long has leukemia been researched for?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Even if medical technology did take off, such a disease was incurable. It was established to a point where it could only be maintained.</p><br/><p>For it to be treated just like a cold is simply a lunatic\u2019s dream.</p><br/><p>Forums!</p><br/><p>Tieba!</p><br/><p>All these platforms reported the same news.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan also became a target of the reporters.</p><br/><p>The local doctors were almost bowing down to Yang Yuan. They wanted to know just who this magical boy was.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao still couldn\u2019t figure it out despite thinking about it throughout the night. At the same time, the hospital ran thorough checks on Yang Huan. They simply had to come to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>Completely recovered!</p><br/><p>There was a type of cell in his body that were eating up the mutated cells. This completely stunned them.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They felt as if it was a complete waste of time to spend such a long time studying medicine.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest also saw the news. They looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys think? Could the mysterious man who gave this little friend the pill be that fella?\u201d Fraud Tian felt that this was a possibility.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded his head, \u201cI have a feeling that the chances are very high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan also nodded her head, agreeing with that statement.</p><br/><p>From what they knew, Brother Lin was something that liked to stick his nose into other people\u2019s business. Furthermore, he was rather compassionate. It was possible that he gave this little friend the pill.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he also got this little friend to promise that he would keep this secret. Who else but him could have done such a thing?</p><br/><p>Wuxiang Taoist Temple.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up and washed up as per normal.</p><br/><p>He had already decided that he would officially start to strategize on how to break down the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019.</p><br/><p>He thought about it last night and realized that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 would often shut his mouth and not speak a word. Even though it might have been hard to break him down, but as long as he could find a way, then it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the morning, the temple usually had no visitors. It was evident that they were all resting.</p><br/><p>It was only until 8 or 9 am when there would gradually be more visitors.</p><br/><p>Whenever Lin Fan walked past a priest, they would always bow towards him.</p><br/><p>He walked till he came by a courtyard.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was currently playing Weiqi on his own. It was evident that his attention was divided.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw this situation and his heartfelt apprehensive. He wanted to befriend him in the shortest time possible and that required him to adapt to his taste. But he didn\u2019t know how to play Weiqi.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he could only exchange it from the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>Although it would consume some Encyclopedic points, it was no matter to him. After all, you only reap what you sow.</p><br/><p>If he were really to befriend him, and if he were to get lucky the next time, he would get the xianxia class of knowledge. Then he would have gotten back everything that he had invested.</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was a priest beside the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 who was watching with great interest.</p><br/><p>He had a blind adoration for the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019. In his eyes, his master had the best chess skill. None of those chess saints or chess masters on television could be compared to his master.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Lin Fan walked over while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 has a refined and elegant attitude of the mind, playing chess all alone early in the morning. Shall we play a few sets?\u201d</p><br/><p>The priest nodded at Lin Fan. It could be considered as a greeting. But regarding the request of this benefactor, he felt as if he was inviting his own disgrace. His master had exceptional skill in chess. He was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for long.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, he saw that the other party had a great sense of self-confidence so he didn\u2019t say anything. He just allowed the other party to see how good his master was.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 brushed his beard. He couldn\u2019t help but smile and nod his head. He spread out his hand, signaling for Lin Fan to take a seat.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t hesitate anymore. He exchanged for the Weiqi minor class of knowledge from the Encyclopedia. Although it consumed a few hundred Encyclopedic points, he didn\u2019t have any regrets.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 didn\u2019t say anything but indicated that Lin Fan take the first move.</p><br/><p>Please go first!</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 had a lot of confidence in his chess skills. He meticulously studied the art of chess for over ten years. He believed that there was a fine distinction between himself and the chess saints that appeared on public television.</p><br/><p>But as a discipline of Taoism, he didn\u2019t have a heart of greed, hence he didn\u2019t chase any sort of fame.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. It was important for him to close the gap between himself and the other party. However, if he wanted him to take him seriously, he had to show his true abilities.</p><br/><p>He was thinking that in order to be an intimate friend, this was the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d just make a move!\u201d Lin Fan picked up a piece and made his move.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 laughed, evidently showing that he did not take Lin Fan seriously as an opponent. His every action and move had a manner of casualness. It was as if he had already seen though Lin Fan\u2019s chess strategy.</p><br/><p>The priest at the side pursed up his lips and sniggered.</p><br/><p>In a while, this benefactor would know how amazing his master\u2019s chess skill was.</p><br/><p>He was already thinking of the scenario in which the other party would be racking his brains to think of a way to break his master\u2019s strategy.</p><br/><p>As time flowed by.</p><br/><p>Gradually, there was something amiss about the situation at hand.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019s\u2019 initial calm expression slowly became one of worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest friend, this move of yours is good. Impressive and majestic, hiding a secret move. Respect, respect.\u201d Lin Fan had already thought of his sequence of moves.</p><br/><p>Since he wanted to be close friends with the other party, he had to praise the opposition. No matter how good the other party might be, such praises are essential.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest friend, your move is good, but I have a way to counter it.\u201d Lin Fan ended his praise. He made his move with no hesitation and countered it with a single move.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 began to take this seriously. He realized that he had finally met a strong opponent. He observed the situation and carefully considered for a moment before making his move.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful! Priest friend, your move is simply too beautiful. I\u2019m afraid that even the nation\u2019s top chess players would find this hard to counter. However, I have a move in response to this. Priest friend, you have accidentally landed in my trap,\u201d Lin Fan gasped. He couldn\u2019t stop praising him. After which, he took a piece and made his move.</p><br/><p>There was a strange expression on the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019s\u2019 face. Although he still looked calm and composed, his moves were getting slower.</p><br/><p>But in fact, he was screaming on the inside.</p><br/><p>Before long.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan crushed the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 with an absolute advantage.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest friend, your chess skills are simply exquisite. Playing against you is immensely enjoyable. Come, let\u2019s play another round.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>It felt as if the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 didn\u2019t want to play another round. However, when he saw the enthusiasm of the other party, he finally gently nodded his head. Furthermore, he was feeling rather unconvinced.</p><br/><p>The priest beside them was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>What did I just witness?</p><br/><p>My own master was crushed by someone else?</p><br/><p>This doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p></div>\n</div>"}

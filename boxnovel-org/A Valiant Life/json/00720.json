As he was leaving, he took a hateful glance at Lin Fan. He etched this man, who had disrupted his momentum, into his memory. However, he wouldn\u2019t be able to return to Haojiang again and his heart felt unwilling.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao instructed the person next to her to make a report at the police station to add Zhang Yuan to the blacklist and prevent him from entering Haojiang again.</p><br/><p>This kind of thing was illegal as cheating was a crime in Haojiang. Moreover, the Yun family was very influential in Haojiang. Getting Zhang Yuan banned from the place was not an issue.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yun Xue Yao turned her beautiful gaze to Lin Fan. She had an unusual gleam in her eyes. She had developed a great interest in this man. She was still puzzled over how he had managed to change the card so mysteriously.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming went forward immediately. \u201cLady Yun, this is Teacher Lin of Shanghai. He specially came over from Shanghai to help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was beaming. She extended her hand as she said, \u201cTeacher Lin, thank you very much for lending us a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook Yun Xue Yao\u2019s hand. It was smooth and silky and her fingers were slim. It felt pretty good. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter. Now that the matter has concluded, it\u2019s about time for me to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not expected himself to resolve the matter so quickly upon arriving. He had just arrived and now, it was time to leave again. This made him feel a little helpless. After all, he wasn\u2019t familiar with things here and it would be a little pointless for him to stay.</p><br/><p>After hearing that Teacher Lin wanted to leave, how could Ye Zhen Ming just agree? If other people in his profession heard about this, he would be scolded for sure. \u201cTeacher Lin, how can you leave when you\u2019ve just arrived? I haven\u2019t properly hosted you yet. Stay a few more days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Teacher Lin helped us to resolve a huge matter. We have to give you proper thanks. Please stay for a few days.\u201d Yun Xue Yao was almost at the same height as Lin Fan when she wore her high heels. She was considered quite a big shot amongst women.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed softly. He felt that this lady was not simple as she kept staring at him. Moreover, those eyes of hers were unique. It was as if they could electrify. Her beauty was threatening. Her snowy skin, red lips, and her one-sided wavy long hair had a seductive beauty to them.</p><br/><p>Although she was young and her flavor had not developed, her beauty was already stifling and it made it hard for one to look straight at her.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan was not like a typical man who would lower his head shyly when faced with a beautiful lady. He looked straight into her eyes as if it was a challenge. Whoever looked away first would lose.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao didn\u2019t think much at first but she suddenly realized that Lin Fan seemed to be challenging her to a staring contest. She couldn\u2019t help but be unwilling to lose and the two of them just stood there staring at each other.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming and Ou Xing Yun exchanged glances. They felt as if the atmosphere was a little strange.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t understand why Teacher Lin and Lady Yun were staring each other for so long. However, they didn\u2019t say anything. They just stood silently at the side. However, Lady Yun had stunning beauty and Master Lin was young and outstanding. They grinned in their hearts. Could it be that a connection had developed between the two?</p><br/><p>Of course, these were just their private thoughts. After all, the two of them had only just gotten to know each other ten minutes ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone pushed open the door to the private room from the outside. An old man entered, accompanied by bodyguards.</p><br/><p>When Ye Zhen Ming and Ou Xing Yun saw him, they lowered their heads respectfully. \u201cGreetings, Mr. Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Yun Tai Nian nodded.</p><br/><p>He was already eighty this year but he was still hale and hearty. In his younger days, had been known as Henchman Yun, then Brother Yun and Elder Yun. In the end, he just preferred when people called him Mr. Yun.</p><br/><p>Because he hadn\u2019t been educated much in his life, his dream had been to become a knowledgeable intellectual when he was young. However, things turned out against his wishes and he had to start earning a living for himself in his early years. Cutting and slashing, through rain and storm, until he reached his mid-life when he finally settled down.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s face was slightly red as she slowly looked away from Lin Fan and at the old man. \u201cGrandfather.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Tai Nian looked at his granddaughter affectionately. \u201cDon\u2019t be so reckless in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, grandfather.\u201d Yun Xue Yao shook her head. Thinking back, she had indeed been too reckless. If it hadn\u2019t been for this Teacher Lin, she would have lost.</p><br/><p>Yun Tai Nian already knew the rough situation. He was amazed by this young man\u2019s techniques. He had been immersed in casinos for his whole life and he had seen all kinds of experts.</p><br/><p>There were people adept at hearing dices and people adept at changing cards or hiding cards.</p><br/><p>However, he had never heard of someone changing the cards with the flick of a hand. Moreover, the initial card actually ended up in the poker box. It was simply inconceivable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the old-timer in front of him with slight shock. That man\u2019s fate was rather impressive. For him to have built such a huge empire, it wasn\u2019t without reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yun, I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you for a long time,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Yun Tai Nian smiled, \u201cMaster Lin\u2019s name is quite widely known as well. Those ten pieces of Chinese artworks are very fascinating.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was apparent that Yun Tai Nian had done his research on Lin Fan before coming. And after he found out about Lin Fan\u2019s identity, he had been shocked. He had never thought that there was still such a young man in the world.</p><br/><p>Hia abilities were outstanding and on top of that, they were very broad.</p><br/><p>Every category of ability that he possessed was at a level above what anyone could hope to achieve even if they worked their whole lives for it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yun Tai Nian wanted to draw Lin Fan to his side. \u201cThis is the first time Master Lin has been to Haojiang. My Yun family, naturally, has to warmly welcome you. I wonder if Master Lin would be able to honor us with your presence and visit my humble home.\u201d</p><br/><p>They interacted on equal terms. Yun Tai Nian did not act as a big shot towards Lin Fan despite his impressive status and reputation.</p><br/><p>However, if he had acted as a big shot towards Lin Fan, Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t have given him any face. Lin Fan would have just left.</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted and laughed merrily for a while.</p><br/><p>The others stood at the side and did not interrupt. However, some of them were very curious about Lin Fan. They rarely saw Mr. Yun converse so long with a young man.</p><br/><p>Mr. Yun wouldn\u2019t even treat the up-and-coming youngsters of Haojiang this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, during this period, bring Master Lin around Haojiang. You can let go of your responsibilities a little,\u201d said Yun Tai Nian.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, grandfather.\u201d Yun Xue Yao nodded. Ever since she had taken over the family\u2019s casino business, she had not gotten much rest. Now that she would be able to accompany this Master Lin, who had done her a great favor, she was very willing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need for the trouble. I can look around by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Tai Nian smiled and said, \u201cHow could we allow that? You saved Xue Yao. It is only right that she brings you around Haojiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Yun Tai Nian had said that much, Lin Fan naturally didn\u2019t refuse.</p><br/><p>That was fine too. It would be pretty good to go out and have a look around.</p><br/><p>He would treat it as a sightseeing tour.</p><br/><p>Yun Tai Nian left.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming came forward. \u201cTeacher Lin, did you see through how that Zhang Yuan cheated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao and the rest were very curious too. They also wanted to know how it happened exactly and how the opposite party had cheated.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged and smiled, \u201cI didn\u2019t see how he cheated either. However, I cheated. It\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t see through my cheating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming thought that this made sense. When he and Teacher Lin arrived, Zhang Yuan had already opened his cards. There was no way he could have seen Zhang Yuan\u2019s cheating technique.</p><br/><p>They really wanted to know how Zhang Yuan had done it. However, the situation did not allow for this. Zhang Yuan did not give them the chance at all. Or rather, Teacher Lin did not give Zhang Yuan the chance as he had just killed him off with one blow. As for how Teacher Lin had cheated, they did not ask.</p><br/><p>This was a taboo. Even if they were familiar with each other, they could not ask.</p><br/><p>This secret could only be buried in his heart.</p></div>\n</div>"}

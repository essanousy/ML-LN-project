He couldn\u2019t believe what he just saw. His friend had just done something extraordinary. When it came to striking someone, he didn\u2019t hold back at all.</p><br/><p>However, the situation didn\u2019t seem too good.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fans cried out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s kick had been extremely vicious. The opposition immediately collapsed to the ground and he slid at least 10 meters away as the floor was slippery. He laid there motionlessly like a dead pig.</p><br/><p>\u201cDumb f*cker.\u201d Lin Fan clapped his hands together. He was ever ready to hit someone when needed. He was never bothered by the consequences. He always thought that he could just face the music after everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The celebrity staff gasped. \u201cHow could you hit him? How could you hit him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The celebrity staff went crazy. She hadn\u2019t expected things to become like that.</p><br/><p>The reporters were all stunned. They quickly took pictures and videos. It was a big piece of news!</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming was already an outdated celebrity back in Korea and he suddenly became famous in China. It was crazy as his concerts could earn him a few hundred thousand dollars. Those local celebrities that were trying to be successful couldn\u2019t possibly match up to him.</p><br/><p>The reporters knew that his fame was temporal but he could possibly bring millions of dollars back to Korea with him during this period of fame.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and didn\u2019t run away. Anyway, he had already kicked him. Lin Fan had wanted to let it go since he was a celebrity but he actually scolded Lin Fan. Those netizens that scolded him didn\u2019t know about his real identity but this celebrity actually scolded him in real life. If he was Chinese, Lin Fan would have hit him a little softer but he wasn\u2019t. How could he let him off just like that?</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd and security didn\u2019t even affect Lin Fan at all as he was extremely furious.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s security officers were infuriated when they saw their celebrity get hit. They stared at the Chinese man with a fearsome look. They mumbled something and made hand gestures as they walked towards Lin Fan. It was as if they wanted to teach him a lesson.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there without any expression.</p><br/><p>Those hardcore fans were shouting, \u201cKill this man to avenge oppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy oppa, please be okay.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>cries</em></p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang carried a suitcase and charged from behind. \u201cBro, let me help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the security officers turned around and kicked Wang Ming Yang, who fell straight to the ground. \u201cD*mn, that fucking hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was rather fit but he couldn\u2019t match up to the physique of these security officers.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, you dare to hit my friend? You can forget about staying alive today.\u201d Lin Fan couldn\u2019t take it any longer as he watched Wang Ming Yang collapse onto the floor. He immediately struck back.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t bothered by where they were. He just wanted to kill them all.</p><br/><p>He started to use his Ba Gua Zhang skills.</p><br/><p>Jumping Palm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stuck out his hand and struck it at one of the bodyguards\u2019 chin. He viciously struck upwards with his other palm ferociously pressed onto the opposition\u2019s chest. He dealt a heavy blow and the bodyguard fell to the ground. Then, he stomped on his face and scolded, \u201cYou dare to bully my friend? I\u2019ll make you blind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately struck at the others. He meant what he said, which was to make all of them collapse onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that is amazing\u2026\u201d The reporters went wild. It was such an extraordinary sight.</p><br/><p><em>Snap snap</em></p><br/><p>The cameras were snapping away and they didn\u2019t want to miss anything.</p><br/><p>It was definitely a big piece of news.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was destroying them single-handedly and there were more and more spectators. They were all stunned when they saw this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands and packed up. Then, he went to Wang Ming Yang and helped him up. \u201cYou can\u2019t even fight, why did you go forward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang rubbed his chest in pain. \u201cI know I couldn\u2019t do it but you already went forward. I had to do something too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself in the future. Just watch when I fight. I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d Lin Fan said and shook his head. However, he felt rather happy.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. If I stand aside and watch, I\u2019d be a coward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Then, the airport police officers came over. The entire team of policemen came and surrounded the area.</p><br/><p>The airport staff went forward to explain the situation truthfully.</p><br/><p>The leading officer nodded and looked at Lin Fan. \u201cDid you hit this man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fa nodded and answered honestly, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Wang Ming Yang raised his hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t involve yourself in this. If you are to be arrested like me, who\u2019s going to bail us out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang pointed outside. \u201cYun Gang can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, bring them away.\u201d The leader of the team waved his hand. They immediately brought Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang away and said, \u201cActually, we know about it already. You did a great job. However, you have to follow us. Otherwise, the fans would create trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll gladly cooperate,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>The leader of the police team nodded. It was the first time he had encountered something like this. He was extremely impressed with the young chap\u2019s actions. However, it wasn\u2019t right to hit someone and he had to pay a price. They had to handle the matter objectively.</p><br/><p>The airport medical team came out and checked on Jin Xuan Ming. The celebrity staff was extremely anxious. They were worried about Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan interrupted, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to check on him. He just broke a rib. It was just to teach him a lesson so that he won\u2019t talk trash in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The celebrity staff turned around and said furiously, \u201cYou think you\u2019re right to hit someone? You\u2019ll be punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just a broken rib. It\u2019s considered a light injury. There won\u2019t be criminal duties to serve. I will just be punished lightly. If I broke two ribs, it would raise the classification one level higher and you could appeal for criminal punishment. If you\u2019d like that, I can break one more rib for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d The celebrity staff was stunned. She hadn\u2019t expected this person to be so ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cPolice officer, let\u2019s go,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly as if he wasn\u2019t bothered by this matter at all.</p><br/><p>The surrounding reporters were extremely excited when they saw what had happened. The passers-by also held their phones and started to take videos and pictures.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s going to be another breaking news! Korean celebrity, Jin Xuan Ming, got beaten up badly. If this is posted online, it\u2019d be law-defying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s going to be well-received. These two gentlemen are awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it\u2019s because Jin Xuan Ming was being cocky and arrogant. He treated the airport like it was his own house. The bodyguards pushed people violently and spewed vulgarities. Therefore, he got beaten up so badly. Perhaps he might be thinking about dying now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the airport.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang raised his hand when he saw Wang Ming Yang and Master Lin. \u201cHere\u2026 Here!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he realized that the situation was a little abnormal. Why were there police officers? He quickly went forward to find out more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cChief Wu, I\u2019m sorry. Wang Ming Yang and I can\u2019t take your car. We have to take the police vehicle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cBrother Wu, please remember to bail us out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was stunned. \u201cPolice officer, what did my friends do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer replied, \u201cThey beat someone at the airport. It\u2019s considered a case of trouble-making.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey hit someone?\u201d Wu Yun Gang was stunned. Why would they hit someone even before leaving the airport? Then he continued to ask, \u201cWhy did they hit someone? Could there be a misunderstanding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cChief Wu, we\u2019ll leave first. If you want to find out, just proceed inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

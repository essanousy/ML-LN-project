When he first saw that b*stard, he had been surprised. This b*stard was really too patient and persistent in trying to become his apprentice. However, this time, he felt like the situation was a little different.</p><br/><p>\"Not trying to be my apprentice anymore?\" Lin Fan quietly asked.</p><br/><p>Han Lu shook his head and replied, \"Not anymore. I realized that volunteering here is my calling in life. I'm teaching these children shadow boxing again.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave him a pat on the shoulder and said, \"Very good. It's very noble of you and I support you completely.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu nodded and said, \"However, if Master Lin has any advice and wants to change anything, feel free to tell me. I definitely won't reject it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Relax, I have nothing to change,\" Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Wang Yang Ming pat Lin Fan on the shoulder and said, \"Have you signed it yet?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \"Don't worry, we'll settle this later.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han was waiting for the workers to arrive to instruct them and conduct the unloading of the stuff. They had brought a lot of things with them like computers, clothes, toys, books, etc. They definitely could not organize them properly by themselves.</p><br/><p>\"This goes here. Don't put the books too high up and push the bookshelves against the wall so the children don't knock into it while playing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Take note of the wiring when installing the computers. I don't want any exposed wires. This is to prevent electrocution.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are toys over there. Make sure every child gets one.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The whole scene was extremely busy. Everyone was all busy with something. Even the shop owners were all busy playing with the children.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath and said, \"I'm going to go to the kitchen. It's going to be a busy day ahead.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled and said, \"I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. I told them that your cooking is uncomparable in deliciousness but they didn't believe me. Time to let them see for themselves.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \"What makes you think you are going to get to eat it.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang suddenly realized. \"Oh yeah, there are so many children here. They are definitely the priority but I'm sure they won't mind if I take a bite or two.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly laughed, saying, \"Stealing food from children, you're really something.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's your fault for making such delicious food.\" This sentence was not one of flattery but the truth. His own brother's skills were really off the charts. Lin Fan's food was the most delicious, none came close to it. If he were to become a chef and open a restaurant, becoming the best and most famous in the world was not a problem. Of course, Wang Ming Yang knew that he did not want to open one so it was just a fantasy.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>In the commercial vehicle outside, Jin Yang who had been stripped completely had a very gloomy expression. He said, \"Disgusting. It's really too disgusting. That b*stard had the nerve to do that to me.\"</p><br/><p>His manager was also furious, saying, \"How could he do something like that? You are a public figure. I don't even want to think about what kind of impact the video will have once it is circulated.\"</p><br/><p>*Pa!* Jin Yang smacked his phone while inside the car and he said, \"Now what are we going to do? I've become a laughing stock.\"</p><br/><p>The manager replied, \"I'll have to bring this up to the company and let them handle it. However, when the word spreads on the news tomorrow, regardless of the situation, there's going to be huge consequences. You see, I keep telling you to work out but you never listen and now that you've been stripped and your figure is shown to the world, all that fake boasting you've been doing on your Weibo has been exposed.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang was silent for before he said, \"Who knew that something like this would happen. No, I won't avoid this problem. I'm going to give a call to Sister Zhang and let her handle this. She has a large number of contacts in Shanghai. Also, if I have a public relations disaster, she would be the one affected the most.\"</p><br/><p>His manager nodded and said, \"Seems like the best way.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, inside the building, a group of people was gathered together and the children were all in pairs. Ever since the news of human trafficking groups had been released to the public, many children had been claimed one after another. However, there were still many children left in the Children's Welfare Institute and at the same time, there was a steady flow of children coming in.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, that smells heavenly. Where is that smell coming from?\"</p><br/><p>\"Could it be our meal for today? Wang Ming Yang said that we are in for a treat today and I have no idea what he meant by that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Food is ready\u2026\" The shop owners said as they came out of the kitchen with exquisite and delicious food.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled and told the group, \"Don't try and steal the food. It's all for the children. However, you can sample a bit. Master Lin's amazing cooking is not something that you can buy with money.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han asked with surprise, \"Are you sure? You're making this out to be a little unbelievable.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled and said, \"Unbelievable? Just wait till you try it, then you'll understand.\"</p><br/><p>In the kitchen, Lin Fan was meticulously preparing dish after dish. The whole kitchen was filled with the fragrance of his cooking. To the Welfare Institute workers who smelled the fragrance, it was a torture to be in this kitchen and only be able to see but not eat the food.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there were many sounds of surprise coming from outside.</p><br/><p>\"This is really amazing.\"</p><br/><p>\"This amazing taste. I've never tried anything like this in my lifetime.\"</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang saw this scene, he started to laugh. \"It's just like I said. Master Lin's cooking is not like anyone else's. If you all want to eat this again, it's only available here. However, control yourselves a bit, the food is meant for the children and if you all eat them all, what are they going to eat?\"</p><br/><p>The children impatiently looked at them and said, \"Uncle, I want to eat some too.\"</p><br/><p>\"Auntie, I haven't eaten yet.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the entire canteen was filled with laughter. The children also slowly started to come out of their shells and came out to try this delicious food.</p><br/><p>Time slowly passed by and Lin Fan was starting to feel tired, so he went outside and pulled out a cigarette.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Hano came from behind and said, \"Master Lin, you smoke too?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"I don't usually do it. Only when I'm tired, I'll smoke a stick. Why did you come out? Aren't you supposed to be inside playing with them?\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han smiled and said, \"I came out to thank you. I'm really grateful for what you did for my son last time.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \"It's nothing. It was just a small issue.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, outside the Children's Welfare Institute, a limousine came to a halt. A middle-aged lady came out from the car and there were also many commercial vehicles following along. From the vehicle, there were a few bodyguards that came out and those bodyguards looked very well-trained.</p><br/><p>Sister Zhang did not say a word but she had a very fierce outlook, giving the impression that she was a very powerful woman. She opened her mouth and said, \"What are you guys doing? Do you all not know you are public figures? You guys should know how big of an impact something like this will have, especially on the company. Where are those people?\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang nodded and said, \"They are over there.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Zhang looked gave Jin Yang a glare and said, \"I'll handle this. Regardless of the circumstance, I will find a solution.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sister Zhang, I'm not happy with this. We can't just let this go simply,\" Jin Yang said.</p><br/><p>Sister Zhang replied, \"We'll discuss this later. Don't you worry, you are our company's actor. We won't let you lose out.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang felt very assured after hearing Sister Zhang say that. Other people may not have known who she was but he did. She was a big woman with many connections.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

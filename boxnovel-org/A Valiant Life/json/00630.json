He was really asking for it.</p><br/><p>Then, Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s tone changed. \u201cGodly doctor, are you referring to $600 million instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re smart. I meant $600 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room was stunned.</p><br/><p>He was really trying to rip him off.</p><br/><p>Even if all the people there combined their net worth, they\u2019d probably not even reach $600 million.</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He and the others looked at Lin Fan and felt that he was mentally unsound for requesting $600 million. Was he really trying to get himself killed?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s furious expressions and smiled, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Master Ma, is your life not even worth $600 million?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you this. You won\u2019t be able to sustain for long. If I don\u2019t treat your illness, you\u2019ll probably only live for three more months. Furthermore, don\u2019t even think about getting another person. Besides me, nobody else can heal your illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Three months?</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He and the others looked at each other. They finally knew useful information.</p><br/><p>If Ma Qing Zhou didn\u2019t get himself treated, he would only have three months to live. Furthermore, these three months would pass really quickly.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou looked worried. He didn\u2019t want to die in three months. He had so much to do.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the others and thought that perhaps the others would want him to only live for three months.</p><br/><p>However, $600 million was way too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, $600 million isn\u2019t a lot but it definitely isn\u2019t a small amount. I admire you a lot,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou said it forcefully. Even if he gave him $600 million, he had to be able to survive to spend it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMaster Ma, you don\u2019t have to admire me. I am only helping my friend to get what he deserves. Furthermore, the money doesn\u2019t belong to you and you\u2019ll definitely not feel secure having it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ma Qing Zhou looked at Lin Fan and didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDo you remember Wang Ming Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Ma Qing Zhou hesitated for a moment. Wang Ming Yang was involved in some investments in Qingzhou but he infuriated him and Master Ma snatched the land over from him.</p><br/><p>The matter was blown up but Wang Ming Yang was a foreigner and even if he was a dragon or tiger, he would have to crawl in Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect the godly doctor to be Wang Ming Yang\u2019s friend and that he was there to take the money from him.</p><br/><p>Then, he understood why the godly doctor decided to come to Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>After considering for a moment.</p><br/><p>He finally had an idea. He was going to pay $600 million but it was only a temporary arrangement.</p><br/><p>When he recovered fully, he would capture Lin Fan and call Wang Ming Yang to ask for the money back.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, Ma Qing Zhou smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you $600 million,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou said.</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He and the others were dumbfounded when they heard that Master Ma was going to pay $600 million. They were in utter disbelief that he actually agreed to his crazy request. However, when they thought about how Master Ma only had three months to live, they knew that he was willing to pay whatever amount he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right, the $600 million was based on the past. Now, you must have earned a lot from that plot of land. I won\u2019t let my friend be at a disadvantage. However, it won\u2019t be a lot. I\u2019ll just charge you $1 billion. Transfer the money to my friend now. This is his account number, I\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect Master Ma to be so straightforward. He felt that he should have asked for more. Anyway, he was a shameless man and he just wanted to rip him off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ma Qing Zhou was stunned. The rage in his heart was indescribable.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect this fella to be negotiating prices with him. It was the first time something like this had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, $1 billion it is then. Liu Ren, immediately wire the money over,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Liu Ren nodded. Then, he looked at Lin Fan and shook his head. He felt that Lin Fan was doomed.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The guests sitting further away didn\u2019t know what had happened. However, they saw Master Ma standing up a couple of times and he looked furious each time he stood up.</p><br/><p>Then, he always sat down after standing up.</p><br/><p>They wondered how the situation was like.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it. The godly doctor asked for $1 billion from Master Ma.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Is that real? $1billion? He dared to ask for that amount of money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but Master Ma agreed to pay him $1 billion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is over. This godly doctor is dead. If he can leave Qingzhou in one piece, I will write my name backward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking rubbish? $1 billion and Master Ma is willing to let him off? This fella has no brain at all. His medical skills are useless in this context.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, it\u2019s a pity. I wanted to meet the godly doctor to ask him to look at my body. I didn\u2019t expect it to turn out this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those guests didn\u2019t want to be involved in this. Everyone did illegal deeds in Qingzhou before.</p><br/><p>Even if they didn\u2019t kill someone before, they must have ordered someone to be killed. If not, they would request for the arms or limbs of the victim.</p><br/><p>Especially those that were working in the real estate and construction business were capable of ruthless methods like these.</p><br/><p>For someone like Ma Qing Zhou, the change in the supply of funds wasn\u2019t a problem at all. At the same time, Ma Qing Zhou had a lot of liquid assets while others had a lot of fixed assets.</p><br/><p>His daily income was absolutely crazy.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou looked at Lin Fan, \u201cGodly doctor, can you see my illness now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said and smiled. He was just waiting for something</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou nodded.</p><br/><p>To Wang Shan He and the others, they didn\u2019t expect them to be witnessing a $1 billion dollar deal. If they didn\u2019t see it happen, they wouldn\u2019t believe it at all.</p><br/><p>People started to understand how much money Ma Qing Zhou exactly had.</p><br/><p>It was indeed a terrifying figure.</p><br/><p>However, a lot of people were arrested because of these illegal funds.</p><br/><p>At Shanghai!</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was prepared to leave his office. Then, his phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw his phone, Wang Ming Yang was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Where did the money come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was shocked. As a billionaire, he would\u2019ve seen a lot of money before. However, the amount of money in his card suddenly increased by $1 billion. It was a little crazy.</p><br/><p>Receiving money for nothing would make someone very restless.</p><br/><p>Then, someone called.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, did you receive the money yet?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, what are you doing? Did you transfer the money to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just took it from Ma Qing Zhou. Didn\u2019t he ruin all of you? $600 million became $1 billion dollars. Although it seems like a small figure, we have to settle for this,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was furious when he heard that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! What do you mean by you got it from Ma Qing Zhou? Bro, what are you doing? No, I have to return the money. You can\u2019t be in trouble,\u201d Wang Ming Yang felt that this matter was too much. Didn\u2019t he know how Ma Qing Zhou was like?</p><br/><p>His own brother wanted $1 billion from him and thought that he could return to Qingzhou in peace.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, please don\u2019t. I will head back tomorrow. Please take care of the money. I still have something to attend to. I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>*beep beep*</p><br/><p>The phone was hung up.</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang wasn\u2019t excited at all. He was nervous and worried.</p><br/><p>Taking money from Wang Qing Zhou was more like sending oneself to a lion\u2019s den. It was too dangerous.</p></div>\n</div>"}

But he was in a terrific mood. It seemed that tonight\u2019s gathering had made him very happy.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, as long as his family was happy, it was fine. As for other stuff, there was no need to think too much.</p><br/><p>This time, fortunately, his message on Weibo hadn\u2019t attracted everyone. Otherwise, that would really be hard to manage.</p><br/><p>After staying at home for a few days, he was prepared to head back to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin and Mama Lin sent Lin Fan to the airport.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin couldn\u2019t bear to part with him. \u201cSon, just staying away for a while is enough. Come back to Zhongzhou in the future, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin said from the side, \u201cWhat do you know? Our son is doing so well outside, why should he come back? If we miss our son in the future, we can go to Shanghai to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDad, Mom, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve spoken to Mayor Zhang a few days ago. I\u2019ll have to go back to my roots eventually, won\u2019t I? I\u2019ll spend a few more years in Shanghai and I\u2019ll come back. Don\u2019t worry. In the future, I\u2019ll have to take care of you guys in your old age. How could I leave forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Be safe out there. Especially now, safety is very important. When your dad and I found I that you went to Huang Yun Town that time, we were scared to death. If anything happened to you, what would we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I am aware of the situation. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019m not confident of, I definitely won\u2019t do it.\u201d Then, he looked at the time. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s almost time to check-in. I have to go. You and dad should go back earlier. There\u2019s no need to worry about me. If there\u2019s anything, call me. I\u2019ll come back immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin waved. \u201cGo on, go on. One man is enough in the family. If you ever bring a wife back in the future, your mom and I will be very happy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, then didn\u2019t say more. He walked towards the airport. After spending just a bit of time at home, it was time to go back to Shanghai. He couldn\u2019t quite bear to leave.</p><br/><p>However, he had to spend some time away from home to broaden his horizons. It was also a way of making his life fulfilling. If he didn\u2019t go anywhere his whole life, it would be a shame.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When the shop owners saw Lin Fan, they all gathered around.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why didn\u2019t you tell us that it was your dad\u2019s birthday? We would\u2019ve gone as well,\u201d said Elder Liang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! We only found out after seeing Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he was scared stiff. If they had gone, this birthday banquet would have been crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. It was not much.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the shop owners, anything that concerned Little Boss concerned them as well. Since it was Little Boss\u2019s father\u2019s birthday, they had to go as a courtesy.</p><br/><p>Now that Cloud Street had become so busy and lively, it had a lot to do with Little Boss. Simply said, the current Cloud Street wouldn\u2019t exist without Little Boss.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk who were queuing to buy scallion pancakes were clamoring.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, hurry up and sell the scallion pancakes. When you were away, we were all dying of eagerness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Without queuing for a day, my heart feels all empty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you haven\u2019t sold scallion pancakes for a few days. Could you compensate for it? For example, you could sell thirty servings today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Making scallion pancakes is very tiring. I can only muster ten servings a day. And it\u2019s already very draining.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people queuing felt a deep resentment. It was a tragic story. They waited for Little Boss\u2019s scallion pancakes every day and their hearts itched very much.</p><br/><p>After selling the scallion pancakes, Lin Fan went to the children\u2019s welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had arrived earlier. He had already talked to his buddies through the phone about developing the uncultivated land in the welfare institute. Also, there were technical staff with him.</p><br/><p>When Director Huang saw Master Lin bring a group of people over, she asked anxiously, \u201cMaster Lin, what is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you the last time? We\u2019re going to open a dormitory building. We\u2019re here to look at the site and gauge it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Director Huang was startled. It was as if she didn\u2019t dare to believe it. She hadn\u2019t expected that it would be realized so soon.</p><br/><p>The children who passed by all dashed over when they saw Lin Fan. These children were now living very fulfilling lives.</p><br/><p>Apart from studying every day, they were able to cultivate their interests and hobbies.</p><br/><p>After taking the perfect-grade little intelligence pills, these children were all extremely smart. They learned everything exceptionally quickly.</p><br/><p>To their teachers, these children were geniuses. They were geniuses among geniuses.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan played around with the children for a bit, then waved his hand. \u201cGo on. Go and play yourselves. Uncle has things to do. Be obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the children replied before dashing away into the distance.</p><br/><p>In the past, when these children had just come to this welfare institute, they had still had scars in their hearts and they couldn\u2019t open up at all. But now, after being cared for, they had become lively and playful.</p><br/><p>To them, this was their home, their only home. If they had to leave this place, they would probably start wailing miserably.</p><br/><p>At the site.</p><br/><p>The technical staff started to survey the place. Wang Ming Yang was looking also as he calculated in his heart. \u201cBrother, if we develop this place, the money will flow out like water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about all that. I don\u2019t understand that at all. But the quality of it must be ensured. After all, this is the welfare institute\u2019s future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted Lin Fan on the shoulder and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cBrother, you worry too much. I\u2019ve worked in this industry for so long and I\u2019ve been able to make it to where I am because I\u2019ve been using high-quality materials all the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright. If I don\u2019t believe you, who would? I was just saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the teachers\u2019 group.</p><br/><p>Director Huang sent a WeChat message: \u201cAnnouncement for everybody. Master Lin has already brought people to survey the land. The construction of the dormitory building is starting. Although the welfare institute cannot guarantee too much, we definitely won\u2019t disappoint you all. Therefore, we hope that all teachers can teach the children well. Master Lin won\u2019t neglect you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Director Huang sent this message, the group suddenly entered a momentary deep silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Master Lin is really building the dormitory block?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean that we will have rooms to stay in Shanghai in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that real, Director? You\u2019re not lying to us, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Director Huang looked at these questions on WeChat, she was helpless. \u201cOf course it\u2019s true. Why would I lie to you? Master Lin is a man of his word. Everything he promised you all back then will definitely be realized. The biggest repayment you can give Master Lin is to teach the children well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. We will work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! I\u2019m so motivated now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel way too fortunate to be a teacher in the welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teachers had never dared to imagine such a thing.</p></div>\n</div>"}

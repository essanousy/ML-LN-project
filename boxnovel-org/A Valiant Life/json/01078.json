Boss, please sit. Let this lowly man give you a massage,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang with a laugh. He quickly moved aside to let the boss sit on the chair. Then, he placed both hands on Lin Fan\u2019s back and squeezed. \u201cBoss, is it comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm, it\u2019s alright. But your hands are a little rough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang rolled his eyes. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t get overboard. Such a big boss is giving you a massage but you\u2019re still saying that my hands are rough. Let me tell you that these are hands of gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t talk any more nonsense. He took out the piece of paper and said, \u201cHere, take a look. Ten songs in total. Get Huan Yue to practice them properly and sing them well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang saw that paper and took over it excitedly. But with one look, he couldn\u2019t understand what was on it at all. He hurriedly took out his phone and called a specialist.</p><br/><p>Right now, Eastern Han Group had many specialists. After all, Wu Huan Yue wasn\u2019t the only celebrity they had. Even some small celebrity singers needed to have songs.</p><br/><p>Very soon, a specialist arrived. When the specialist saw Lin Fan, he greeted Lin Fan respectfully. After all, Master Lin had a fearsome reputation in their industry. Everyone knew that any song composed by Master Lin would be a classic. Moreover, he would come up with a bunch of songs each time. It was simply scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, take a look. How are these songs composed by my brother?\u201d Wang Ming Yang passed him the piece of paper. That specialist was shocked. This was something really valuable.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t that Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t trust Lin Fan. But as someone who didn\u2019t understand these things, he had to see the specialist\u2019s expression of shock in order to truly feel his brother\u2019s awesomeness.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his gaze was fixed on the specialist\u2019s face as he observed him closely. He wouldn\u2019t miss a single detail.</p><br/><p>The specialist looked at the paper very closely. However, his expression slowly changed and it didn\u2019t seem quite right. He started humming lightly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by that at all. He had full confidence in these songs.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Wang Ming Yang retracted his gaze. He had already seen what he had wanted to see.</p><br/><p>Even the specialist had let out a look of shock. That meant that there were definitely no problems with these songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, Chief Wang, this\u2026\u201d The specialist started speaking in shock but before he could finish, Wang Ming Yang interrupted him, \u201cI already know what you want to say. You can go back to work. Tell everyone to get ready. Huan Yue will be coming back tomorrow. Get her to familiarize herself with the songs. Then, we\u2019ll start recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>The specialist felt that he had many things that he wanted to say but suddenly, his throat was stifled. He was unable to express himself. He had no choice but to leave.</p><br/><p>However, he had truly been deeply shaken.</p><br/><p>These songs were simply too good. If he had been the one composing, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to compose such songs. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve this standard in his lifetime.</p><br/><p>After he left, Wang Ming Yang patted Lin Fan on the shoulder. \u201cBrother, I really admire you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan appeared indifferent as he didn\u2019t think much of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ve just started admiring me. Get used to it. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going to make a move. I\u2019ll leave the rest to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang pulled Lin Fan back. \u201cDon\u2019t. Why are you in such a rush? Right now, the news on the Internet is really going viral. I have to retaliate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you plan on doing that?\u201d Lin Fan knew how Wang Ming Yang was. If he were to retaliate, things would really get out of hand. But it was fine. This time, it was the other party that had come looking for trouble.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stroked his chin. \u201cI have to think about it. I could dig out whatever dark past this Wang Mei Tian has but it would take some time. Forget it. We\u2019ll just announce publicly that our Master Lin has written another ten songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever you say. As long as you\u2019re happy. But don\u2019t brag too much,\u201d said Lin Fan. Then, he didn\u2019t stay any longer. He just left.</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian looked at the news on the Internet as well as her own Weibo and couldn\u2019t help but let out a wide smile.</p><br/><p>This time, this promotion tactic had been very successful. Although there were quite a lot of people scolding her, it didn\u2019t affect her at all.</p><br/><p>If one couldn\u2019t even endure such criticism, then one should just be an average person instead of a celebrity.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it didn\u2019t matter even if these people were scolding her. They were still bringing traffic to her Weibo and increasing her fame.</p><br/><p>Right now, it was the era of overnight successes. There were many celebrities that had become famous overnight.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t respect those celebrities because their fame expired very quickly. They had only become famous due to certain events. Without subsequent events to sustain their fame, they would very quickly disappear.</p><br/><p>But she was different. She wanted to rise up as a star singer and she wanted people to boost her popularity too. As long as she could raise her fame, she wouldn\u2019t have any problems sustaining it.</p><br/><p>Looking at those comments, they were all horrendous. Yet, they made her feel great.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this motherf*cker is shameless. She\u2019s doing all this to generate hype. How scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to compare yourself to Wu Huan Yue? Did you take your medicine today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^if you continue flaming my Mei Tian, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, these fans are really scary. This person who hypes herself up actually dares to speak ill of Master Lin. She must have lost her mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think Master Lin is someone you can use to generate hype?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? Wu Huan Yue? Before my Wang Mei Tian, they are worse than sh*t. They\u2019re just envious of my Mei Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^How old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does my age have to do with you? Let me tell you that I\u2019m already twelve this year. If you have the balls, come and look for me at my school. I\u2019ll murder you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian looked at these comments and was filled with delight. <em>Look, I even have twelve-year-old fans. This makes me so happy!</em></p><br/><p>Since she had won that competition, she had gained many fans. Moreover, she would occasionally post some sexy photos on Weibo, which attracted many fans as well.</p><br/><p>To her, gaining fans was too easy. Moreover, she had already gotten people to invade Wu Huan Yue\u2019s fan groups as imposters.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue\u2019s fan group.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, when will Huan Yue release a new album? Wang Mei Tian is already releasing her album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Wang Mei Tian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a singer who sings as well as Wu Huan Yue. I heard that this new album of hers was composed by ten masters. Its quality is exceptionally high. I\u2019m already excited about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that for real? Then I have to take a look as well. But when will Huan Yue release an album? I\u2019ve waited for so long and I can\u2019t wait much longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Huan Yue is now busy shooting films. Shooting films is more profitable. Do you think she still has time to sing for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, their invasion had gradually begun.</p></div>\n</div>"}

That day had had a pretty big impact on him. Although it wasn't a big matter, his heart couldn't help but feel uncomfortable. The matter hadn't been handled perfectly enough and he had a kind of indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>\"Brother, why do you seem so moody?\" When Lu Li stepped into the house, a young and energetic lady came forward.</p><br/><p>Lu Li's face was straight and he appeared quite stern. He was always stern in front of his little sister. Their father was already old and couldn't take care of this girl. As an older brother, who was older than his sister by fifteen years, he had a heavy burden to carry in the shape of her education.</p><br/><p>\"It's nothing. After you graduate, come and work at the organization. I've already made arrangements for you,\" said Lu Li in a tone that was not easy to reject.</p><br/><p>Lu Fei Fei looked at his older brother and said, \"Bro, stop pretending. I can see it. Your expression is clearly unhappy. Hurry up and tell your little sis, did some big incident happen? Or did your girlfriend get stolen by someone? But I don't think that would happen. Judging by Big Bro's qualifications, no one should be able to steal your girlfriend. I know. You must have done something wrong. Did you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I think you're looking for some punishment.\" Before his sister was done talking, Lu Li was ready to give her a punishment.</p><br/><p>Lu Fei Fei cried out in fear, \"Dad, Mom, Bro wants to hit me. Save me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li looked at her silly little sister and couldn't help but shake his head. Then, he sighed. Let's leave the situation at that.</p><br/><p>The rules of this home were rather strict.</p><br/><p>Unless there was some big event, they had to come back for dinner together every day. This was a rule and a default agreement.</p><br/><p>According to their father, after a day of work, they had to come back to spend time with family to chat and share about the day's happenings.</p><br/><p>At the dining table.</p><br/><p>Lu Fei Fei wasn't governed as much. As the family's youngest daughter, her father and mother treated her like a treasure. In her father's words to Lu Li, as his only sister, if he didn't treat her well, she would get married to someone else's family and he wouldn't be able to see her much anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Dad, when I came home, I realized that Big Bro was a little unhappy. Something must have happened today. I think you can question him a little,\" said Lu Fei Fei as she giggled. As for her Big Bro's glare, she totally ignored it.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhong Ming asked, \"Is that so? How did things go today?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li shook his head, \"Although things have been handled, it didn't go perfectly. The Cloud Street shop owners are all going to move.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Zhong Ming was a little shocked. \"How could that be? Were things not handled well enough?\"</p><br/><p>\"No,\" replied Lu Li. Then, he started to explain the full situation in detail, leaving no stone unturned.</p><br/><p>\"Oh!\" After Lu Zhong Ming heard everything, he didn't say a word. But Lu Fei Fei giggled without any hesitation and said, \"So even my Big Bro has days where he loses out. That owner is pretty awesome. I like him.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li glared at her. This little brat just wanted to see him get humiliated.</p><br/><p>\"Since it's their choice, then just respect it. Has the internal situation been thoroughly checked? You can't completely put an end to people using connections but this type of unsuitable people given unsuitable appointments will have a large impact on the company. You need to be cautious,\" said Lu Zhong Ming.</p><br/><p>Lu Li nodded. \"I know that. That's why I've already asked someone to check. Whoever was involved in this will go through stringent questioning.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Zhong Ming had nothing much else to say. His business had already been handed over to his son so he should let him handle things. He just needed to provide some guidance once in a while. \"Small matters can have a big impact. Don't let your guard down.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached his doorstep, he realized that there was a child opposite from his place with his head down and playing with his phone. Lin Fan became curious.</p><br/><p>\"It's so late, why are you standing outside your door? Asked Lin Fan in a concerned tone.</p><br/><p>The kid was in junior high. He raised his head and said, \"I didn't do well in the exams and my parents had to go to school. My Mom punished me by making me stand outside the door. She had me face the wall and reflect.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Seeing the kid like that, he didn't seem like he was sad about not scoring well for his exams. He was playing with his phone so leisurely.</p><br/><p>\"It's so late. You should get some rest. Why don't you sleep at my place?\" said Lin Fan, without meaning anything else.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, the kid was suddenly stunned. A shiver went down his spine as he raised his head. Under Lin Fan's gaze, he banged his door vigorously. \"Mom, open the door! I've learned my mistake\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. What's going on?</p><br/><p>The kid suddenly recalled a news article that he had seen recently that was similar to his current situation. Another kid was been punished to stand outside the house. A man saw him and tricked him into going into his house and then he did that\u2026</p><br/><p>Under the dim lights of the corridor, the kid realized that Lin Fan really looked like he had bad intentions.</p><br/><p>He had initially planned to stand outside and play his phone games for a bit until he was tired, then admit his mistake and go back to sleep. But now, things seemed to have gotten dangerous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless. Without saying anything, he opened the door and went straight into the house.</p><br/><p>Then, he leaned on the door and listened carefully. The door opposite his really opened. Then, that sh*tty brat cried out in shock that a man was trying to trick him into entering his house\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless. \"...\"</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Tian Hong Commercial Street.</p><br/><p>Because they were moving, there were naturally things that had to be done. Lin Fan, together with the shop owners, came to Tian Hong Commercial streets to take a look.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \"It's really not bad. The newly built environment is really good, much better than Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \"Indeed. The surrounding residential buildings are many as well. This location is not bad. Moving here from Cloud Street wouldn't be a loss at all. And because Little Boss is here, we won't have to worry about anything.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Hong smiled. \"Moving here is the mark of a new beginning for us.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Bin followed them. He smiled and said, \"Master Lin, do you think this is fine?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scanned the place roughly and smiled. \"It's really not bad at all.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Huang said, \"Master Lin. I know about yesterday's incident. I really respect you. Even when Chief Lu gave such a good deal, you didn't choose to stay. It seems that you have taken a liking to this place of ours. That's something that our Qi Ming Organization is very proud of!\"</p><br/><p>\"You're too courteous, Chief Huang. I already agreed with you on the conditions. Of course, I couldn't change my mind,\" Lin Fan laughed as he said. The environment there was really not bad. It was much better than Cloud Street. As for the visitor flow and whatnot, he wasn't worried at all.</p><br/><p>Chief Huang laughed and said, \"If Master Lin can keep his promises, then I will as well. We've brought the contract here. Master Lin, you guys have probably not found a renovation company yet, so I've brought a few for you to choose from.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's good thinking, Chief Huang,\" said Lin Fan courteously. The shop renovations would require some time. It wasn't something that could be done overnight. Judging by the situation, it would probably take about half a month.</p><br/><p>This period of time, to him, didn't matter. But to the rest of them, each day that they delayed was a day lost.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \"Little Boss, please choose a shop.\"</p><br/><p>When he brought that up, the shop owners who had been glancing around all gathered closely. They wanted to be neighbors with Little Boss and they had to fight for it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw the situation before him and of course, he knew the meaning behind it. Then he laughed, \"The one in the middle then.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the surrounding shop owners immediately grabbed hold of the workers, fighting over the rights to rent the shops next to Master Lin's.</p><br/><p>When Chief Huang saw this scene, he was stunned too. He had never thought that Master Lin was that popular.</p><br/><p>But he was pretty glad about it too.</p><br/><p>Within the first day, all the shops had been rented out.</p><br/><p>It was a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>It was also the best case scenario for Chief Huang.</p><br/><p>The contracts were signed.</p><br/><p>They were three-year contracts.</p><br/><p>And, the conditions had all been written very clearly in the contracts to guarantee that a similar incident would never happen again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

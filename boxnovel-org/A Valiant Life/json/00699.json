Could this news be fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be fake? There are pictures. What else does she have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue is my favorite singer. She looks so pure and innocent and she is my female idol. I didn\u2019t expect this to happen at all. Furthermore, it was with a man and another woman. That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell. You can never judge a book by its cover. She looks so innocent but she\u2019s actually so dirty-minded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this man? He must have had a good time. I wonder what happened yesterday night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it anymore. My heart hurts. I am going to delete all her songs. I feel disgusted listening to her voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mum, Wu Huan Yue. Don\u2019t you feel sorry for Master Lin? Master Lin wrote so many songs for you and you did this to him. F*ck your mum! Brothers, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s flame her on her Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe industry is indeed one that stains even the purest of people. Look at these women, I wonder how many people have taken advantage of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue\u2019s group of backup fans.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m not going to be a fan of Yue Yue. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she\u2019s like that. I regret being her fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her agent quickly replied, \u201cDon\u2019t leave. This may not be true. Everyone, don\u2019t be affected by it.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how hard she tried to explain the situation, it was useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be? There are pictures as evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I am a fan of Master Lin and Wu Huan Yue. How could she do this to Master Lin? Master Lin wrote so many songs for her and she went to have a threesome with another woman and man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting. We have to stop her.\u201d</p><br/><p>A lot of people started to leave the group.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Gradually, hundreds of people left the group that had two thousand people at first. The others also started to leave the group. Those that remained in the group were probably not awake yet. They probably still didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at the news on the Internet and was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect it to happen at all. Then, he looked at the picture of Wu Huan Yue and sighed.</p><br/><p>If it was another celebrity, he would have started to scold him or her. However, he couldn\u2019t possibly scold Wu Huan Yue. Furthermore, he knew who the man in the picture was. It was definitely his brother.</p><br/><p>He was speechless. Bro, why were you having a threesome? You should\u2019ve said it. I could\u2019ve arranged a good location for you. How could you bring two women into your house? This is infuriating.</p><br/><p>Huan Yue hadn\u2019t expected this to happen. She wasn\u2019t heartbroken because her career had just been ruined. It was because the matter wasn\u2019t like what the Internet had reported.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t tolerate the hateful messages of the public.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said in a grievance.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang consoled her, \u201cHey, I know that\u2019s not what happened. However, that\u2019s the Internet for you. We can\u2019t stop the others from saying what they want. Even if we say it, who would believe us? Nobody would believe us. I\u2019ll think of a way to resolve this. I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t just publish an official message to improve public relations this time. It would be insufficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>If a celebrity did it with his or her spouse, it wouldn\u2019t be that bad. After all, the celebrity could still get married to him or her.</p><br/><p>However, the current situation wasn\u2019t like that. It was a threesome. To a celebrity, that was suicidal.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, what made the situation worse was that other celebrities started to raise awareness, Especially Ying Jin, which made things even worse.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang massaged his head as he was having a bad headache.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue lowered her head, \u201cHow about I withdraw from the industry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Let me think about this. It\u2019s because you rose to fame too quickly and people are jealous. Now that something like this has happened, a lot of people are trying to bring you down with it. Don\u2019t think too much about it. Just ignore the messages online. As a strong celebrity, you have to be able to tolerate these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded but she was feeling really uncomfortable. She looked at some of the posts on Weibo. There were all sorts of hateful messages. It wasn\u2019t something that she could tolerate easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, how are your backup fans?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said sadly, \u201cMost of them have left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang thought for a moment before picking up his phone. \u201cHow\u2019s the public relations group? Have they thought of something yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Dai Jun Ming, as the king of the paparazzi, started to laugh. He had become famous again.</p><br/><p>Then, a lot of people started to post on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have uncensored pictures so that we can see who the other two people are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re all waiting for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you capture any other shots? Like their positions in bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue is so pretty and has such a good figure. It was definitely intense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ I\u2019m hard from reading that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dai Jun Ming laughed before posting something.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll post the uncensored picture tonight at 12 am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many people were stunned by the shocking news.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan arrived at his shop and realized that Wu You Lan looked rather pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what\u2019s wrong? Why do you look so frail and haggard? Did something happen?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what had happened online. He hadn\u2019t read the news before coming to the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said worriedly, \u201cBrother Lin, Huan Yue is in trouble. We stayed over at your place the night before yesterday. People took pictures of us and posted them online. The entire internet is scolding Huan Yue now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He was in disbelief, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he took out his phone and opened Weibo. Wu Huan Yue\u2019s news was the top one on the trending list.</p><br/><p>However, what was the fourth one on the list about?</p><br/><p>\u2018Did Master Lin get cuckolded?\u2019</p><br/><p>F*ck you mum, I don\u2019t even have a girlfriend. How could I be cuckolded?</p><br/><p>He looked at the other top searches.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ying Jin suggested banishing Wu Huan Yue from the music industry.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand what was happening. What did this matter have to do with Ying Jin?</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t in a rush as he opened these trending searches. He looked at the messages on his Weibo and was furious. What were these people doing? The messages were ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\u2018Let\u2019s have a moment of silence for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis type of woman isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018green cuckolding hat\u2019 descended from the Heavens. You can\u2019t hide from it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s flame Wu Huan Yue on her Weibo to seek justice for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI realized that Master Lin has been feeling low lately. He hasn\u2019t been posting a lot on Weibo. I was afraid that something like this might have happened. He must be hiding this because of Wu Huan Yue\u2019s career. It has to be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is such a good man. We\u2019re all heartbroken for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, we have to avenge Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After reading some of the posts, Lin Fan was dumbfounded. What were they talking about?</p><br/><p>Then, he opened some of the top searches.</p><br/><p>What threesome?</p><br/><p>Who censored the pictures? Wasn\u2019t the man in the picture him?</p><br/><p>The situation was abnormal. Why did they censor the picture? Didn\u2019t that create a false alarm?</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan was prepared to make things clear although he didn\u2019t know why the person censored his face. Perhaps it was to protect him. However, as Justice Fan, he had to do something about this. He couldn\u2019t just let people on the Internet scold a lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe man in the picture is me. We only shared an apartment as friends. We\u2019re all pure. Do not think of it that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the post was published, the Internet went crazy again.</p></div>\n</div>"}

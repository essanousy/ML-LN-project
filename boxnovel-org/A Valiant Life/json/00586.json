However, I can\u2019t find some of the ingredients, so I can only replace them with other ingredients. I don\u2019t know how it will turn out.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also what Lin Fan felt most helpless about. Some of the ingredients for the little intelligence pills simply could not be found. Although he found other ingredients to substitute them, he didn\u2019t know if they would be able to produce the perfect-grade little intelligence pills.</p><br/><p>However, he believed that there was definitely a chance.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at his teacher in astonishment, \u201cA pill that can increase one\u2019s intelligence? This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say it out but to him, this didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><br/><p>There were some brain-enhancing liquids on the market. These were promoted as brain-enhancing and having the ability to raise one\u2019s intelligence but to Zhao Ming Qing , that was simply not possible.</p><br/><p>Although everyone\u2019s brains are generally the same, they develop differently. Some people have higher intellects while others have lower intellects. Also, the more the brain is used, the smarter it becomes. Could this pill really raise one\u2019s intelligence?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t explain the effects of the little intelligence pill in-depth because even if he did, it would be hard to believe him.</p><br/><p>The little intelligence pill was a pill that belonged to the mythical class, after all.</p><br/><p>Although it didn\u2019t have an exceedingly large effect, it could enhance one\u2019s intelligence and allow one to learn exceptionally fast. It wouldn\u2019t cause someone to have photographic memory, but if one were to keep using his brain and develop his potential, he might be able to attain photographic memory in the end.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, if this pill enters the market, wouldn\u2019t that be something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Only I can create this pill. No one else can learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if someone else were able to create this pill, he wouldn\u2019t allow these pills to spread. It was just for him to help people around him gain convenience. It wasn\u2019t to be enjoyed by others.</p><br/><p>\u201cLight the fire for me. I\u2019ll put the ingredients in.\u201d Lin Fan couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \u201cAlright, Teacher.\u201d He wanted to see what would be crafted as well.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had a kind of blind faith in his teacher, but this alchemy thing was a little absurd to him. In ancient times, alchemy was used to produce poisonous substances. He wondered what exactly his teacher would concoct.</p><br/><p>The construction of the alchemy furnace was extraordinary. Who knows how the ancient people managed to think of something like that.</p><br/><p>The ingredients were added.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLight the fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this storehouse, the old man and the young man were on the path towards medicinal pills. They had immersed themselves in alchemy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, in particular, couldn\u2019t remove himself from it. He was completely engrossed.</p><br/><p>The fire blazed. Smoke emerged from the furnace.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing watched curiously. \u201cTeacher, will this really work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said confidently, \u201cIt will. It definitely will.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a certain amount of time, changes started to occur in the furnace.</p><br/><p>A pill rolled out from the little hole at the side of the furnace.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s face beamed with joy.</p><br/><p>They did it.</p><br/><p>It really was useful.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at the pill. His expression changed. \u201cTeacher, what is this? Did we succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up the pill and was a little saddened. It was only a normal-grade little intelligence pill. However, it was still much better than the ones created by the pressure cookers. Still, it was far from as good as the perfect grade pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe did succeed but this pill isn\u2019t very highly graded. Let\u2019s continue.\u201d It was a good start and that meant that things would get better.</p><br/><p>This proved that using an alchemy furnace produced better grade pills than using a pressure cooker. It was significantly better.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing asked suspiciously, \u201cTeacher, there aren\u2019t any toxins inside this pill, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNope. This was formed by condensing the essence of the medicinal ingredients. It won\u2019t contain any toxins. What we need to create now are perfect-grade little intelligence pills. Although these normal ones do have an effect, they\u2019re far from enough. Let us continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver outside had waited for a long time.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked in through the door crack. A helpless expression appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Elder Zhao had become the disciple of a young man. But the fact that the two of them suddenly started talking about alchemy made him dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t say much. He felt that it was undoubtedly just a fantasy.</p><br/><p>Then, he went back to his car to play with his phone again.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhao Ming Qing had done this. His emotions were complicated. He was excited, nervous and thrilled, all at the same time. When the first pill had come out, his heart had started racing. He had never expected it to really work.</p><br/><p>However, his teacher said that it was only normal-grade and still far from their objective. Then, he knew that they had a long way to go.</p><br/><p>Another pill was formed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cAnother normal-grade. It won\u2019t do. Keep going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded.</p><br/><p>Time kept passing by. The two of them worked tirelessly in the storehouse. Zhao Ming Qing kept lighting the flames while Lin Fan went around the furnace, checking on the conditions inside. The Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost was added in.</p><br/><p>Without the original ingredients, he could only rely on luck.</p><br/><p>However, these normal-grade little intelligence pills were actually quite effective too.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan had to create the perfect-grade pills because this was related to the task.</p><br/><p>Another pill!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is a lot purer than the previous ones,\u201d said Lin Fan in surprise as he fiddled with it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, could it be that after crafting so many, the medicinal strength is still remaining inside the furnace, creating even better grade pills as we continue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes gleamed, \u201cThat does make sense. Let\u2019s carry on and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing had read about this in an ancient book.</p><br/><p>He had studied Chinese medicine for ten years but this was the first time he had gotten involved in alchemy. He would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t curious. That moment when the pill took shape, in particular, made him incomparably delighted.</p><br/><p>Another pill came out the furnace.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked closely at it. \u201cMing Qing, it seems that what you said is really true. The more we craft, the better the pills become. This one is much better than the last.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cThen we shouldn\u2019t be too far from the perfect-grade pill that you talked about, right, Teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to say. Lin Fan said, \u201cLet\u2019s try it first. If we really are able to craft the perfect-grade pill, that would be best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The driver looked at the sky. It was getting late. It was almost eight o\u2019clock. Elder Zhao and Master Lin had been crafting for almost eight hours and they hadn\u2019t even come out yet. This\u2026sigh.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>A series of joyous sounds emanated from the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, we\u2019ve succeeded. Look, Ming Qing, we\u2019ve succeeded!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, is this the perfect-grade pill that you talked about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Look, how is it? This is the result of our long hours of hard work. You were right. The medicinal strength was preserved inside all along until we finally produced a perfect-grade pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver sneakily took a look. When he saw the scene inside, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The old man and the young man were in each other\u2019s embrace, crying tears of joy. This was a little f*cking scary.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to look. He really didn\u2019t dare to look.</p></div>\n</div>"}

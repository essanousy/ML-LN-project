He was extremely fit and muscular after the training he had gone through.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He loved kids and he felt that it was difficult for him to say such bad things to a cute kid.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had to act according to the script. He was supposed to act as an arrogant and wealthy man. He was a pro at it and his expressions were really scary.</p><br/><p>However, he was actually a careful and attentive gentleman.</p><br/><p>He reprimanded Lil\u2019 Fatty loudly and continuously. Those applicants at the entrance of the welfare institute could hear him loud and clear.</p><br/><p>They looked at him and some of them wanted to stand up for Lil\u2019 Fatty. However, when they saw the luxurious car and the muscular man\u2019s expressions, they were afraid to do so.</p><br/><p>Han Lu looked at the situation outside and opened the door. \u201cApplicants, please head into the interview room. Please note the time.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Some of the applicants turned and went into the building without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Some of them were feeling shocked after seeing what happened. They felt that it was better to just mind their own business and that the kid\u2019s parents would take care of the matter.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui looked at them and she couldn\u2019t tolerate how Lil\u2019 Fatty was being scolded. She went forward without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>At the same time, some of the other applicants were also infuriated. They hadn\u2019t expected this man to say such awful things to a kid.</p><br/><p>Han Lu shouted at those who were walking towards the kid and the man, \u201cAre you guys coming in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease hold on,\u201d someone said.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief. When he had seen Zhao Tian Shan\u2019s expression, he had felt that perhaps he might have gone overboard with it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, he was relieved that the applicants still bothered to offer help despite how fearsome the man looked.</p><br/><p>Then, next to the car.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui protected Lil\u2019 Fatty and said angrily, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? He\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Tian Shan replied, \u201cWho are you? What does this have to do with you? Get lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re bullying a small kid. We can\u2019t take it.\u201d Jiang Hui was petite and studious but she wasn\u2019t afraid at all when she was facing Zhao Tian Shan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you asking for trouble?\u201d Zhao Tian Shan had practiced really hard for this scene and he acted pretty well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat me up then,\u201d Jiang Hui said without any fear.</p><br/><p>The other applicants who had followed her also added, \u201cYou have no morals at all. How can you be so vulgar towards a kid? Now, you\u2019re even threatening to hit someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, even if the kid didn\u2019t watch the cars carefully before crossing, he can be easily taught about it. Your vulgar reprimanding has no use. Did you see this signage? The welfare institute is nearby. Please reduce your speed and give way to children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, we\u2019re all here. Just hit us.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBeing impatient and rude to a kid shows how bad your character is. It doesn\u2019t matter how much money you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Tian Shan was stunned by what the group of girls said. How could they say such things?</p><br/><p>Those applicants that had entered the building shook their heads when they saw what was going on outside. They felt that these people were clueless about the modern society and being a busybody could cause people even more trouble.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the man was definitely wealthy. After all, the rich call the shots.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I guess all of you are here to apply to be a teacher. I am very close to the management team of this welfare institute. I want to see how you\u2019re going to secure this job,\u201d Zhao Tian Shan said.</p><br/><p>Indeed, their faces all changed after he said that.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? I don\u2019t care about not being employed but I have to address this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person in charge of the welfare institute is Master Lin. He is so morally upright and kind. How could he have a friend like you? If you\u2019re really his friend, he probably hasn\u2019t seen through you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I believe Master Lin wouldn\u2019t have a friend like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lying down with his legs raised. He didn\u2019t know how to describe the feeling of being praised by someone.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, Zhao Tian Shan saw that the act was about to be done and pointed at this group of applicants. He said furiously, \u201cAlright, you\u2019re powerful then. Don\u2019t let me see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He drove off and left.</p><br/><p>After he drove off, the applicants heaved a sigh of relief. They had been really afraid earlier.</p><br/><p>They were relieved that the man was finally gone.</p><br/><p>Their hearts were still pumping quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle kid, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine. Thank you, everyone. I will be returning home. I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty didn\u2019t say much and left.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui and the others looked at the time and rushed to the welfare institute. However, they also glared at Han Lu since he was the security guard at the entrance.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Han Lu felt that their glare was a little disdainful.</p><br/><p>He was stunned as he didn\u2019t understand what had happened.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui and the others really looked down on Han Lu. How could he let something like this happen? Also, he should have gone to help them since he was a security guard. How could he protect the kids well if he was like this?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was really satisfied with the results. The applicants all had fantastic qualities and, even if they couldn\u2019t really teach, their good morals would have secured them a job.</p><br/><p>There were going to be a few more waves of applicants.</p><br/><p>They just had to repeat what they had done in order to select the eligible applicants.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was busy writing down what was happening in his notebook.</p><br/><p>He recorded the color of their clothes and hairstyle, along with other features. Then, he downloaded the pictures of the girls from the video and matched them with the applicants\u2019 faces.</p><br/><p>Inside the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>A group of applicants was waiting.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it started?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI received information saying that it should start at 8.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got 8:30.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got 9.\u201d</p><br/><p>The applicants told each other their timeslots and were stunned. They wondered what was happening.</p><br/><p>They thought about it but still couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we came here, there was a kid crying outside. I wonder if the police found his parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, we saw a kid when we came here too. He almost got hit by a car\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

They talked about the some of their knowledge and experience of martial arts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really couldn\u2019t quite understand all this but since they were so passionate in sharing, he definitely couldn\u2019t express that he wanted to leave. He just wore a smile on his face as he listened.</p><br/><p>After sending this Elder Huang off, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this old man really knows how to talk,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded. \u201cYeah. You were the one who invited him for dinner, of course he would talk to you about all this. But honestly, if you want to complete their martial arts, it would be a big process. I think you will have a lot to do when you go back to Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAre you stupid? I won\u2019t possibly do it on the same day that they arrive in Shanghai. I\u2019ll make them stay at the association for a period of time and take in the atmosphere of the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Jiang Fei heard that, he was very excited. \u201cPresident Lin, do you also feel that getting these experts to come to the association is a great thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm. I feel that it\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel as well,\u201d said Jiang Fei. He hadn\u2019t expected that President Lin had the exact same thoughts as him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like we don\u2019t have much to do today, do we? The meet was only in the morning. What shall we do in the afternoon? Shall we go to Kunlun Mountain to take a look? What do you all think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going. It\u2019s too d*mn cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head as well. \u201cI\u2019m not going either. It\u2019s a little scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang really wanted to go but then, he thought about it and decided against it. It was best not to wander around this place. They would be returning to Shanghai the next day and they definitely needed a good rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go alone then. Since I\u2019m already here, it would be a waste not to go and take a look,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He was curious about what was up with this Kunlun Mountain. Could those mythical things really exist?</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Lin Fan strolled around Kunlun Mountain randomly. It was a dangerous place to others but to him, it wasn\u2019t much different from anywhere else.</p><br/><p>After searching for the whole afternoon, he hadn\u2019t seen any strange or mystical things. Needless to say, he hadn\u2019t found any supernatural things either.</p><br/><p>If he could find a monster, that would be pretty good. But after searching for half the day, he hadn\u2019t found a single thing.</p><br/><p>At the guesthouse.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei took out his phone excitedly. He was going to make a call to President Niu to report the situation.</p><br/><p>Shanghai. President Niu was busy working.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang. When he saw that it was from Jiang Fei, he started to wonder how the situation was at Kunlun Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Niu.\u201d Upon answering the call, Jiang Fei\u2019s excited tone rang out. It seemed as if there was something amazing that he wanted to report.</p><br/><p>President Niu smiled. \u201cHow was the exchange meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei eagerly said, \u201cIt was great! This exchange meet was really great. Our association is going to explode in popularity.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Niu was startled. He didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t quite understand what Jiang Fei meant. This time, the association had gone there mainly just to make an appearance and to record this incident so that they would be able to publish some news when they return and describe the state of the exchange meet. It was to let the public have some understanding of martial arts.</p><br/><p>But hearing Jiang Fei\u2019s tone, it was as if something amazing had happened.</p><br/><p><em>Could it be Master Lin?</em></p><br/><p>That was all he could think of. Besides Master Lin, he really couldn\u2019t think of anyone who would be able to bring splendor to the exchange meet.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei coughed lightly and calmed his emotions. \u201cPresident, Master Lin is really incredible. He defeated several martial arts inheritors in the arena and that isn\u2019t even the important part. The important part is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the phone, only Jiang Fei\u2019s voice could be heard. Meanwhile, President Niu was completely stunned. Even though he knew that Master Lin was incredible, he hadn\u2019t expected this at all.</p><br/><p>A single person had performed everyone\u2019s martial arts styles. Moreover, many of the techniques had not been recorded before.</p><br/><p>To him, it sounded like something out of a legend.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, this is the situation right now. From now on, a lot of people will come to our association and I feel that we have to make the necessary preparations. If we can get those inheritors to join our association, it would be very beneficial to our association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, are you listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Niu regained his senses and said, \u201cI am. Okay, okay, okay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Three \u2018okay\u2019s in a row. Besides that, he had no idea what else to say.</p><br/><p>It was really too stimulating for his heart. He was completely speechless.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan returned. He felt a little regretful. He had thought that he would be able to find something amazing but in the end, there was nothing at all.</p><br/><p>He had indeed been overthinking. How could there be such mystical things?</p><br/><p>At the beginning, he had come across a cave and thought that there might be some creature that humans had not discovered before. Then, he entered the cave and went all the way in. Besides a wall at the end, there was nothing else.</p><br/><p>So he turned around and went out the same way.</p><br/><p>He had already explored the place. Since other people said that this was a mythical place, he decided that he would carry on these myths.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s broadcast video had been recorded and posted onto the Internet.</p><br/><p>The caption was very domineering.</p><br/><p>\u2018On Kunlun Mountain, Master Lin claims the throne as an unparalleled being.\u2019</p><br/><p>The reporters saw this video and were astonished. Then, they quickly started to download the video and edit it to prepare to release it in a big article.</p><br/><p>This topic was pretty good. It was worth publishing.</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin\u2019s exhibition of true kung fu shakes the entire stadium.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Breaking! Master Lin makes a bunch of old men submit using his abilities.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018At an experts\u2019 gathering on Kunlun Mountain, Master Lin\u2019s grace dazzles everyone.\u2019</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw these articles, their jaws dropped in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! This is way too domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! He\u2019s unparalleled. Although this video has been edited, it\u2019s simply too spectacular.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is trying to defy nature. I watched for half an hour. Master Lin did not stop at all. That\u2019s way too domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^What were you watching? The original video is three-hours long. I stayed up through the night yesterday to watch it and I didn\u2019t miss a single second of it. I almost kneeled down in admiration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBegging for the full video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Tiger Fist inheritor is really unlucky. Initially, he thought that he could show off but he didn\u2019t expect to be completely crushed by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy actually dared to act unbridled in front of Master Lin. Isn\u2019t that just asking for death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I already knew that Master Lin was incredible but I never thought that he was this incredible. He\u2019s too strong, isn\u2019t he? I feel like the title of number one in the world can only belong to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of meet is this? Why do I not know about it? Also, those people\u2019s martial arts seem different from what we see on the Internet.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

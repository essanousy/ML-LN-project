Then, he gave Godfather Liu a call. \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, how was the talk with Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu didn\u2019t quite understand that youngster\u2019s attitude but according to the words they had just exchanged, he felt as if Lin Fan was going to forget about it.</p><br/><p>Then, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve talked already. He didn\u2019t expect that I had hidden those things inside. He\u2019s probably a little afraid as well so he agreed to forget about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s good. You have to be careful. Resolving this matter is not that easy. I\u2019ve already taken care of things. You must not admit that those things are yours. No matter what, you have to push the blame away. You have to find someone to take the blame for you. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be difficult to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. But who would be willing to take this blame?\u201d Godfather Liu was in a tough spot.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin said, \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, you have to remember that there is nothing that can\u2019t be resolved with money. If there is, that just means you don\u2019t have enough money. So you should think of a solution yourself. Remember, you have to resolve it by today. Otherwise, things will go bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Godfather Qin.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Godfather Liu started to get to work.</p><br/><p>However, when he thought about losing those drugs, his heart ached very much. Thirty-something kilograms. It was worth a hundred million dollars and it was gone just like that. How could his heart not ache?</p><br/><p>But he knew that if they find out that the drugs belonged to him, a death sentence was inevitable.</p><br/><p>Now, his greatest headache was finding someone to take the blame. Who would be willing to do that?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A piece of news was published. And this was official news.</p><br/><p>\u2018The great rotting meat and hidden drug case has been cracked. After two days of investigations, the culprit has been arrested.\u2019</p><br/><p>But when everyone saw this news, they were all dumbfounded. This was different from what they had imagined.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome. The case has been cracked. I have to give this quickness a \u2018like\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people are way too unbridled. Thirty-something kilograms? How many people were they going to sell the drugs to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTerrifying. But luckily, we have our righteous police uncles to protect us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy will probably be executed by a firing squad.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Northeast\u2019s media and news workers saw this news, they were all stunned. Because this was not what they had expected.</p><br/><p>The manipulator behind this was definitely not this guy. It was that Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>But although they felt that way, there was nothing they could do. They didn\u2019t dare to say too much.</p><br/><p>As for media reporters from other places, they didn\u2019t know the truth of this incident. Hence, they could only report that the case has been cracked.</p><br/><p>In the hotel.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had just got out of bed. He was opening his Weibo and about to see the news.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, he was drawn in by the comments on his own Weibo page.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what thoughts do you have about this conclusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like this conclusion is a little strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere have you gone, Master Lin? Come out and give some comments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When he saw these comments, Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed. The case had been cracked so quickly?</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t possible. With Godfather Liu\u2019s capabilities, he definitely wouldn\u2019t crumble so quickly.</p><br/><p>Then, he took a look at the news. With one look, he erupted on the spot.</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>They were so dishonest that they could describe a black thing as white. Did those people who got interrogated have sh*t for brains? They even took the blame for something like this.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan felt that this society needed him to save it. How could he allow this to happen?</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately opened his Weibo. His fingers swiftly pressed the keyboard as he typed, making a pattering sound.</p><br/><p>Looking at what he had written, he posted it contentedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cWho f*cking came to this conclusion? Do you have sh*t in your brains or did you get bribed by the Northeast\u2019s Godfather Liu? Thirty kilograms of drugs. Calculate for yourself how much money that is worth. Could that person who took the blame have had that much money? Also, how could he have placed so many goods inside? In my opinion, even if you\u2019re dealing with corruption and trying to cover up, you can\u2019t deal with it like this. Can you still uphold the word \u2018Righteousness\u2019?\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He sent a long post with several hundred words.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the netizens boiled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I just knew that Master Lin was going to erupt for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. There is definitely something more to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, they\u2019re real animals. We have to report this. There\u2019s actually someone that dares to risk universal condemnation and cover up for the mastermind. This is simply despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On Weibo, countless Internet celebrities saw Master Lin\u2019s Weibo and immediately reposted it.</p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>When Godfather Liu saw that conclusion, he heaved a breath of relief. It had been beautifully resolved.</p><br/><p>He had listened to Godfather Qin and frequently paid attention to Weibo. The first Weibo page he looked at was that kid\u2019s. Suddenly, when he saw Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo, he was completely dumbfounded. Then, he burst out in rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom! Do you really want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at this long Weibo post, his face instantly turned green with rage. This was simply outrageous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to stir things up again immediately. He could not accept such a conclusion, nor did he want to.</p><br/><p>The relevant personnel who had been handling this Godfather Liu matter saw the post and frowned. Then, they quickly instructed people to tell Weibo to block this Master Lin.</p><br/><p>However, when the Weibo person-in-charge was informed about this, he couldn\u2019t resist bursting out cursing.</p><br/><p>Block your mom.</p><br/><p>Was the current Master Lin still the same Master Lin from before that they could bock?</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately acted like he didn\u2019t know anything and just ignored them.</p><br/><p>*Ring Ring*</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang. It was an unknown number.</p><br/><p>When he answered the phone, a gloomy voice came from the other end.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I hope that you will mind your own words. It\u2019s best if you quickly remove your Weibo post. Don\u2019t cause trouble for yourself.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he exploded. What kind of situation was this? There was actually someone who dared to threaten him. Then, without hesitation, he immediately scolded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have sh*t to do with you. I\u2019m free to say what I want. Also, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know who you are. Do you think that with just a little authority, you can blur out black and white? Just you wait. I\u2019ll expose you. I\u2019ll f*ck you up, you piece of trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The opposition was clearly infuriated.</p><br/><p>Beep Beep!</p><br/><p>Lin fan immediately hung up, not wanting to speak any more rubbish with that person.</p><br/><p>Then, he started to think about what he should do regarding this matter. Was resolving it with force the only thing he could do?</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan was thinking about this, Godfather Liu was talking to Godfather Qin on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Qin, that kid really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him. He has spoken on Weibo. How do you think this should be resolved?\u201d asked Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen it. He really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him. But the conclusion is already out, there\u2019s nothing he can do,\u201d said Godfather Qin. Then, he thought for a moment. \u201cBut if we let him continue making noise, it will be troublesome. Okay, I\u2019ll make arrangements to talk to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was taken aback. \u201cGodfather Qin, what\u2019s there to talk about with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin smiled, \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, you should learn from me. There\u2019s no such thing as eternal enemies, but there are only unchanging benefits. As long as he is human, he has desires. You and him don\u2019t have too big of a grudge between you guys, so you can arrange to come out and have a chat. Satisfy his requests and you\u2019ll gain a friend. Gaining a friend is always better than getting rid of an enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu thought for a moment, then said, \u201cGodfather Qin, I\u2019m afraid that he won\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, how would you know if you don\u2019t try?\u201d Godfather Qin laughed confidently. Then, he hung up and prepared to personally give Lin Fan a call.</p></div>\n</div>"}

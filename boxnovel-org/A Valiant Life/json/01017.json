It was a shame but he wasn\u2019t disappointed at all. It wasn\u2019t that there were too few suitable people but he was just unlucky, so he hadn\u2019t come across them yet.</p><br/><p>When he returned to the shop, Chief Qin\u2019s side had already replied very swiftly with an apology for the incident. Also, they had dealt with that police officer who had received the call from Lin Fan earlier.</p><br/><p>This kind of swift action made Lin Fan rather pleased.</p><br/><p>Then, a call from Liu Xiao Tian came very soon. That child had been kidnapped by those people. The three men had pleaded guilty.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, they had matched the child with the lost children database and found her parents.</p><br/><p>Her parents were in a rural area several kilometers from Shanghai and it was quite far. Back then, her parents had traveled to Shanghai to make the police report with the help of kind-hearted people. That was why they were in the database.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sometimes felt that his individual power was quite minute. However, when he came across such things, he couldn\u2019t just ignore them. As for those incidents that he didn\u2019t come across, he hoped that other people would be as meddlesome as him and do as he would. Giving a heads up to the police would be a pretty good choice.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still in his sleep when he was suddenly awoken by a phone call. When he saw the phone display, he was dumbfounded. <em>What the heck does Fraud Tian want? It\u2019s only six in the morning. Can\u2019t he let me sleep?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHello. Fraud, if you don\u2019t give me a proper explanation, you\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Before he could finish, he was flabbergasted by what Fraud Tian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain my a*s. Someone has splashed dung all over our shop.\u201d On the other end of the call, Fraud Tian was dumbfounded as well. He had come to the shop early in the morning and was greeted with this scene. He had been completely stupefied.</p><br/><p>Someone had actually come to mess up their shop. They were simply asking for death.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the half-awake Lin Fan heard that and was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Wait for me. I\u2019ll come immediately.\u201d He hung up and got off the bed to look for his biggest knife. He was going to fight with them to the death.</p><br/><p>He washed up and dressed up before driving off towards Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners were all covering their noses as they brought various tools over to clean up the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich b*stard did this? If I find out, I\u2019ll beat him to death.\u201d Elder Liang was trembling with rage. Someone actually dared to mess up their Master Lin\u2019s shop. That was simply asking for death.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong was incomparably mad as well. \u201cSurveillance cameras. Someone, go and check it. See what exactly happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already checking but we haven\u2019t found it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck the earlier tapes. I think this definitely happened around 3 or 4. There was no one around at that time. They definitely did it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stood there looking at the shop as his whole body trembled. \u201cIf I, Fraud, find out who did this, I\u2019ll use my Ba Gua Zhang and beat them until they lose all their teeth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it could have been done by the accomplices of those people caught by Master Lin yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s possible. That\u2019s really possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk were drawn over by the scene as well. When they saw it, they were dumbfounded and didn\u2019t know what to say. It was way too crazy. It was a ferocious revenge.</p><br/><p>Then, some people used their phones to take photos of the scene and post it on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone took revenge by messing up Master Lin\u2019s shop last night. They splashed manure on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they added the photos as well. It was a cruel sight.</p><br/><p>In an instant, some people who were looking through Weibo early in the morning saw the situation and they erupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too brutal. They even dare to mess up Master Lin\u2019s shop. I think they must be sick of life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. Look, this is what happens when you\u2019re too meddlesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^You\u2019re f*cking stupid. How can you call Master Lin meddlesome? Did your mom not teach you how to speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like those guys from yesterday have accomplices. These accomplices are taking their revenge. I\u2019m afraid Master Lin will not live in peace from now on. This kind of thing can\u2019t be defended against.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. It\u2019s really despicable. These people should just f*cking die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing meddlesome people get their retribution, I feel amazing. Even if he\u2019s awesome, even if he\u2019s the world\u2019s savior, let\u2019s see who will save his shop now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, the Internet is too dangerous. Sometimes, when I see these comments, I feel like I\u2019ll go crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the scene!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the scene, he could already smell a nose-piercing stench from the distance. Then, he walked over with a black face.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian saw Lin Fan and said, \u201cLook. What the f*ck is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \u201cLittle Boss, don\u2019t be angry. We have to find out who did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cYeah. These guys are too lawless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said, \u201cThe police is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian found out that someone had splashed manure on Master Lin\u2019s shop, he had rushed over with his men immediately. He was furious about this matter as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we will definitely get to the bottom of this for you,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve encountered such a situation. Looks like someone is taking revenge for yesterday\u2019s incident.\u201d Lin Fan smiled as if he hadn\u2019t expected this.</p><br/><p>But he was a little happy. He wouldn\u2019t have to open his shop temporarily. He wouldn\u2019t have to make scallion pancakes either. It seemed that he would have more time to do what he wanted to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found it on the video. It was at 3:40 last night when a group of people with masks did it,\u201d the people who were checking the surveillance cameras shouted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went over to that side. There were many surveillance cameras along Cloud Street. When he looked at the computer screen, he saw four completely covered people coming to the shop entrance. They even started by kicking the door a few times before opening the bag of manure they had prepared and splashing it on the door.</p><br/><p>After doing that, one of them faced the surveillance camera and raised his middle finger as if to say: \u2018Lin, f*ck your mom!\u2019</p><br/><p>Everyone who was watching it was filled with rage. They felt that they had been challenged.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cI\u2019ll pass down the order right now to check every surveillance camera. We have to see where these people went.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for too much trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was taken aback. He thought that Master Lin wanted to forget about it.</p><br/><p>But how could Master Lin just forget about it?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy, where are you?\u201d Lin Fan hollered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog heard Lin Fan\u2019s call, he dashed over from afar. He had stayed overnight at his wife\u2019s home the previous night, so he hadn\u2019t been in the shop.</p><br/><p>He had stayed far from here mainly because the smell was too f*cking pungent. His sense of smell was really perverse.</p><br/><p>It was several hundred times or even several thousand times more sensitive than that of professional search dogs. As for how sensitive it was exactly, it was hard to say.</p></div>\n</div>"}

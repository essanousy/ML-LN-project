He smiled, \u201cElder Dog, I will bring you to see something fun later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked, \u201cWhy did you bring me back to your house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me? Why would I harm you?\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog didn\u2019t really trust Lin Fan and he felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t think of what was wrong.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, nobody was here. If someone were to see a person communicating with a dog, they would definitely think that this person was crazy. However, that was the truth. They were really communicating with each other.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Animal training knowledge is a xianxia minor class of knowledge. If he could become close to Elder Dog, he could slowly train him to become a super Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>His strength would increase.</p><br/><p>He would become faster.</p><br/><p>His body would become sturdier.</p><br/><p>He would know how to use magic.</p><br/><p>Of course, he should forget about the magic. He didn\u2019t even know any magic and obviously, Elder Dog wouldn\u2019t be able to learn it.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was that after conquering Elder Dog, he would definitely be 100% loyal to him.</p><br/><p>However, Elder Dog was probably already 100% loyal to him. The rural dogs of China were really loyal to their owners. They wouldn\u2019t betray them after an argument or because they were hungry.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, Elder Dog, come over here.\u201d Lin Fan waved to Elder Dog. However, when Elder Dog saw that, he was so afraid that he started to back away. He didn\u2019t dare to go forward.</p><br/><p>He felt that something tragic was about to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I hurt you?\u201d Lin Fan immediately carried Elder Dog and was thinking of ways to train animals.</p><br/><p>He could use a spiritual stone but if there wasn\u2019t a spiritual stone, he could use the blood of a living thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn it, where would I be able to get a spiritual stone?\u201d Lin Fan cursed. Even the Encyclopedia\u2019s departmental store didn\u2019t have it. He only had the first level of the departmental store and everything they sold was messy.</p><br/><p>However, he could use the blood of a living thing.</p><br/><p>Whose blood shall he use?</p><br/><p>Then, he smiled as he looked at Elder Dog. Then, he immediately went to the kitchen to take a knife and entered the living room.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog wasn\u2019t dumb. He whimpered in fear after seeing his owner take a knife.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t struggle. I\u2019m not castrating you. It\u2019s for your own good. If we succeed, you wouldn\u2019t be a rural dog anymore. You\u2019d become a super dog. When that happens, you\u2019ll be powerful. Can you imagine that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog whimpered. He couldn\u2019t imagine it and didn\u2019t want to imagine it. He just wanted to live safely.</p><br/><p>He was satisfied with sleeping and eating every day.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took the knife and held onto one of Elder Dog\u2019s legs. Then, he took a deep breath, \u201cTake a step forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he did that, the knife cut Elder Dog\u2019s legs and blood started trickling down his leg.</p><br/><p>*bark*</p><br/><p>Elder Dog had been cut. Although it wasn\u2019t really painful, he still struggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, please let me go. I don\u2019t want to be eaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s hand was stained with fresh blood. He immediately started to draw on the floor. He followed the instructions of the Encyclopedia and had to draw a diagram for animal training.</p><br/><p>It was almost complete. Then, Lin Fan placed Elder Dog in it. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Just lie down and don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Elder Dog didn\u2019t want to listen to him. He just moved about in joy.</p><br/><p>In the end, he had no choice but to use a rope to tie Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was tied up and he couldn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded with satisfaction. There was only one step to go. Then, he did some hand gestures as if he practiced it a lot. Suddenly, a bright light lit up the diagram on the floor and it covered Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia\u2019s Mystical Boost was being activated.</p><br/><p>A magical energy flowed through Lin Fan\u2019s body and floated into the diagram.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped and shouted, \u201cCome out now my magical dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the light disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan looked at the floor and was stunned.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was still being tied up and his body was still the same. He was still the same Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. Did I fail?\u201d Lin Fan stared at the ground in confusion. It didn\u2019t make any sense. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong at all. Why did he fail?</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt something in his heart. It had something to do with the relationship between Elder Dog and him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog, how do you feel?\u201d Lin Fan asked in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, nothing much,\u201d Elder Dog whimpered.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I succeeded!\u201d Lin Fan stood up in joy. He didn\u2019t say anything just now. He communicated with Elder Dog with his heart and thoughts. He didn\u2019t expect Elder Dog to have been able to listen to him.</p><br/><p>That proved that the animal training had succeeded.</p><br/><p>However, what made Lin Fan feel helpless was that something was wrong. Since he had completed, Elder Dog should\u2019ve become much stronger. However, he still looked the same.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan realized that the wound on Elder Dog\u2019s leg had disappeared. It was as if he was never injured.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan untied Elder Dog. To Elder Dog, he felt as if he was much closer to Lin Fan now.</p><br/><p>After researching it for a moment, he still didn\u2019t understand what had happened. Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore. He was prepared to train him slowly.</p><br/><p>It looked like the task wasn\u2019t easy to be completed.</p><br/><p>He opened up the Encyclopedia\u2019s departmental store and did a search. He finally found something useful.</p><br/><p>Righteous Pet Food: The pet will become stronger and more righteous after eating it.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points needed: 100.</p><br/><p>Evil Pet Food: The pet will become stronger and more evil after eating it.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points needed: 100.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect the Pet Food to be split into two different categories. It was a little weird.</p><br/><p>However, as the pet of Lin Fan, he had to become a righteous pet.</p><br/><p>He immediately traded a bag for 100 Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>However, when he traded it, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Why was it so black?</p><br/><p>100 Encyclopedic Points were spent and there was only one piece. It was the size of his thumb.</p><br/><p>That was ridiculous.</p><br/><p>When he placed the Righteous Pet Food in his palm, Elder Dog Nicholas barked ecstatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to eat it. I want to eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately threw it at Elder Dog. \u201cEat it slowly. It\u2019s so expensive. It\u2019s going to be a waste. Go and take a shower.\u201d Then, he walked towards the bathroom. He was just thinking about how illogical it was.</p><br/><p>When he was prepared to sleep, Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog licking the Pet Food, he hadn\u2019t swallowed it yet. He looked to be enjoying it slowly.</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>When everyone was asleep.</p><br/><p>In the quiet night, Elder Dog managed to swallow the Righteous Pet Food.</p><br/><p>In that instant, he raised all four legs and they started to twitch.</p><br/><p>Even Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what was happening to Elder Dog. He was still dreaming in deep sleep.</p></div>\n</div>"}

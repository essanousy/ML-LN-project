Although he didn\u2019t smoke often, he would occasionally have a smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourteen dollars,\u201d said the boss.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a $20 note, then picked up another bottle of milk from the side. He needed to replenish his body a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have another bottle of Tianshu Milk,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He opened it and drank one mouth of it. Immediately, he felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Then, he took another mouth and tasted it carefully. Again, he felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>The shop owner looked at this customer in front of him and muttered in his heart. <em>Is there something wrong with this guy? It\u2019s just a bottle of milk, isn\u2019t it?</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed as he said, \u201cBoss, something\u2019s wrong with this milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss looked at Lin Fan helplessly. He felt like this guy was going to ask for a refund. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s something inside that\u2019s in excess.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>When the boss heard that, he burst out cursing in his heart. <em>Why don\u2019t you just say the milk is spoiled? Something inside is in excess? Your mouth is really powerful.</em></p><br/><p>But the boss didn\u2019t dare to offend someone like this. \u201cForget it, forget it. I\u2019ll give you another bottle of milk. This is from Mengniu. It\u2019s produced locally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened it and took a gulp. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with this milk. But there\u2019s a problem with that milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the boss heard that, he didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. <em>What the heck is wrong now?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAre you here to pick a quarrel? I\u2019ve sold these two brands of milk for years. Tell me, what\u2019s the problem here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, then took another bottle of Tianshu Milk from the shelf. He took a gulp and tasted it carefully. He even waited for a moment before taking a few more sips. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem. There\u2019s a problem with this milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss looked at this person and even took out his phone as he was about to call the police. He felt that this person was either crazy or he was here to scam him. In his mind, he was thinking. <em>Could it be that there\u2019s a new scamming tactic now?</em></p><br/><p><em>In the past, there were car scams, child scams, hospital scams, and now, there\u2019s a milk scam?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, which company does this Tianshu belong to?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The boss looked at Lin Fan alertly. \u201cThis is a Japanese company. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a red-colored note and put it on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll take this box of Tianshu Milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a parent brought her child into the store. \u201cBoss, give me a box of Tianshu Milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d replied the boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment,\u201d Lin Fan interrupted. Then, he looked at the parent. \u201cDon\u2019t buy Tianshu Milk. There\u2019s something wrong with it. If you drink it, it\u2019ll be bad for your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was a little angry now. \u201cYoungster, are you here to pick a quarrel? What\u2019s wrong with my milk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s a problem with your milk. I\u2019m saying that there\u2019s a problem with this milk manufacturer. Sigh, forget it. Buy it then. One box won\u2019t kill you. You\u2019ll find out soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d When the boss heard that, he instantly erupted. He had an urge to kill this guy. <em>Saying that drinking one box won\u2019t kill you, wouldn\u2019t that scare my customers away?</em></p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the parent heard that and was stunned. \u201cBoss, give me Mengniu Milk then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that from the customer, the boss calmed down a little. At the same time, he swore to himself that if this guy said that there was a problem with Mengniu milk too, he would fight to the death with this guy.</p><br/><p>After that guy left, the boss cursed, \u201cMoron, don\u2019t let me see you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, that big brother looked like Big Brother Lin,\u201d said the child as he pulled his mother\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The parent asked curiously, \u201cBig Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child replied, \u201cI\u2019m talking about Master Lin. Our teacher really likes him. She shows us photos of Big Brother Lin every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss immediately denied it, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. How could Master Lin be so idiotic?\u201d</p><br/><p>The parent nodded as well. She felt that this boss made sense. How could Master Lin be so idiotic? Then, she bought the box of milk and left happily with her child.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian saw Lin Fan carrying a box of milk back. He went up excitedly. \u201cAh, kid, you even know to buy things back. I\u2019m dying of thirst. Quick, give me a bottle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t stop him. He just let Fraud Tian open the bottle.</p><br/><p>Very soon, Fraud Tian had taken a bottle of milk delightfully and drank a big gulp. He felt great. But when he looked at Lin Fan, he was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, kid? You can\u2019t waste milk like that. You\u2019re taking one mouth and then spitting it out. What the heck are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian and said, \u201cFraud, did you taste anything wrong with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Fraud Tian was taken aback. He looked at the bottle of milk in his hand and took another sip. \u201cNope. It\u2019s sweet. It\u2019ll nourish my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took another small sip, then placed the bottle of milk on the table and shook his head. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. I feel like there are excess aflatoxins. And it\u2019s not just a small excess, it\u2019s an excess of 200%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck are aflatoxins?\u201d Fraud Tian didn\u2019t understand him. Then, he took another big gulp of milk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cancer-causing substance. It\u2019s quite a powerful carcinogen,\u201d said Lin Fan casually.</p><br/><p>*Pfft!*</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian heard that, he immediately spat out a mouthful of milk.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was passing by when he saw a thick, white liquid around Fraud Tian\u2019s mouth and he was shocked. He said in disbelief, \u201cFraud, which f*cking maniac shot into your mouth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian ignored him. Instead, he went in front of Lin Fan and said, \u201cKid, you\u2019re not tricking me, are you? How could you tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Fraud Tian. \u201cNonsense. Who do you think I am? I\u2019m Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang saw that Fraud Tian had ignored him and became curious. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What are you two doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cElder Liang, this kid is saying that there\u2019s a substance in excess in Tianshu Milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a Japanese brand, Master Lin. Why did you buy a Japanese brand?\u201d asked Elder Liang curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI just casually picked it up. I drank one mouth of it and felt that something wasn\u2019t right, so I took a few more mouthfuls but it still didn\u2019t feel right. That\u2019s why I bought a whole box back to see whether I\u2019m mistaken or there\u2019s something really wrong with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, under the surprised gaze of the rest, Lin Fan took out another 5 bottles and drank a few sips from each of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all have problems. It\u2019s not just an issue with the one I drank.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said in a surprised tone, \u201cBrother Lin, could you have made a mistake? After all, how can anyone taste something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and said confidently, \u201cI definitely am not wrong. I really tasted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he took out his phone and started typing in a frenzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what are you doing?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang anxiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019m posting on Weibo to warn everyone and also to give the Quality Inspection Office a heads up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, you can\u2019t just post whatever you want. If you\u2019re wrong, you would have to bear legal responsibility. Moreover, you\u2019re a big Internet celebrity with a lot of fans. You could be sued for spreading false rumors and the punishment could be up to ten months of imprisonment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI have a lot of confidence in myself. I can\u2019t delay this. Otherwise, who knows how many people would drink it unknowingly?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan finished typing his post and he posted it.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang immediately took out his phone. When he saw what Brother Lin had posted, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p><em>This is a f*cking big deal.</em></p><br/><p><em>Although it\u2019s a Japanese company, you can\u2019t play around like that!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

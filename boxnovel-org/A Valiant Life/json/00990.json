But before that, he took out his phone to look at Weibo.</p><br/><p>He realized that someone tagged him, so he went to take a look. It was the young lady from yesterday.</p><br/><p>When he had read her fortune yesterday, he had seen that she wouldn\u2019t be hired. But now that he saw this Weibo post, he instantly smiled. It seemed that the carving had really been useful. It was really blessed.</p><br/><p>But the only downside was that the effectiveness was limited. This blessed carving could only bring fortune to kindhearted people. To people who didn\u2019t meet this requirement, it was just a normal wooden carving.</p><br/><p>Of course, the aesthetics of the wooden carving was amazing. It completely surpassed carvings made by the current masters.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan\u2019s hands moved as he typed a reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cWork hard, kindhearted lady. That wooden carving will bring you fortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>When some netizens saw that Master Lin was replying to a random lady, they were confused as they wondered what was going on. Could it be that a beautiful lady had drawn Master Lin\u2019s attention?</p><br/><p>But when they clicked on her profile, they saw that she wasn\u2019t a beautiful lady. She only looked average but she loved to smile. She gave off a feeling that she was a good person.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Master Lin mean by this? Does anyone understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Is there an expert that can come and explain this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all stupid? It\u2019s so simple yet you don\u2019t understand. Master Lin gave that young lady a present that can bring her good luck. This young lady\u2019s luck indeed became good and she got hired successfully. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Master Lin came across a fan and gave her a present. That\u2019s very well done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Not bad, not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother about all this. He sat there as he took out the materials and the carving knife from his drawer and prepared to start carving. He would make some carvings and store them in the storage ring that he had fished up. In the future, when he meets suitable people, he would give it to them and the task would be completed.</p><br/><p>But to him, this task was quite hard. The difficulty was high.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan rested her chin on her palm as she watched him unblinkingly. \u201cBrother Lin, are you going to start carving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had wanted to make one for Wu You Lan. But under Lin Fan\u2019s care, You Lan\u2019s fate had already changed drastically. She didn\u2019t need it at all.</p><br/><p>Afterward, he thought about what he would carve later. Then, he seemed to have thought of something and his hands started moving nimbly.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan watched from the side. She suddenly realized that Brother Lin looked very good when he was serious too.</p><br/><p>With a move of his fingers, the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost rushed out. This kind of blessed carving was very mysterious. Besides Lin Fan, no one else could make it.</p><br/><p>*Whistling sound*</p><br/><p>The sound was clear and crisp as the initially rectangular piece of wood gradually changed shape.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there were two people at the door. A middle-aged man and a young man.</p><br/><p>They seemed to have been stunned by Lin Fan\u2019s carving technique as they stood there and stared.</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man, in particular, was shocked beyond words because he realized that this carving technique was too amazing. If he hadn\u2019t seen it for himself, he wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>There were no unnecessary movements. He had never seen such skill before.</p><br/><p>It was really too amazing.</p><br/><p>After it was done, Lin Fan\u2019s hands stopped. Then, he gave it a gentle blow to blow off the wooden shavings and reveal the true appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, that middle-aged man gasped.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up and chuckled. Without saying much, he took a closer look at the carving. It was really not bad. It had quite an aesthetic look.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s vivid and lifelike. It\u2019s as if it has a soul of its own. Master Lin\u2019s skill is something that normal people can only dream of attaining,\u201d the middle-aged man praised.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man liked it very much. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMaster Lin, how about you sell it to me? Just name the price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know who he was but this middle-aged man knew him. It was mainly because Lin Fan was way too active. The Internet was a strange place. When one reached a certain level, everyone would know that person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not for sale.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wooden carving was very precious. Just its aesthetics and charm were already outstanding. Moreover, it even harboured special powers.</p><br/><p>Although it would only be useful for certain people, he didn\u2019t want to sell it.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was in no hurry. He felt that there was no problem at all. \u201cMaster Lin, just tell me a price. Anything you say, I\u2019ll accept. I really like this carving. It\u2019s domineering. It\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man next to the middle-aged man was displeased. He felt that this Master Lin was being too arrogant. Then, he resisted his anger as he said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re looking down on us. This is Uingrow Corporation, Mister Zhou Shi Ming.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, he sounded quite proud.</p><br/><p>Uingrow Corporation wasn\u2019t very well-known to the public but that was because it was very low-key. The businesses under its banner were many.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cHaving money is useless. This isn\u2019t something that can be bought with money. What do you two want?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what the young man had said, Lin Fan took a closer look at this Zhou Shi Ming. Indeed, his fortune was awesome. But this had nothing to do with Lin Fan. Even if he had even more money, it would be useless.</p><br/><p>Because wealth and social status were nothing much at all to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming was only in his middle age and he already had such accomplishments. Hence, he was quite self-confident. No matter what he faced, he had the confidence to seize everything in his control.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I really like this wooden carving very much,\u201d repeated Zhou Shi Ming. If it had been a normal person who kept on rejecting him, he would have been enraged.</p><br/><p>But this was Master Lin. Although Master Lin didn\u2019t have much wealth, he wasn\u2019t someone to be messed with. Even in terms of connections, Master Lin was on par with him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cChief Zhou, this is really not for sale. It isn\u2019t something that can be traded for money. Did you just pass by or do you have something to do here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming saw that Master Lin really didn\u2019t want to sell it, so he didn\u2019t press further. He really liked it but now, there were more important things to do, so he decided not to delay any further.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I have something to do. I\u2019d like to ask for your help,\u201d said Zhou Shi Ming, \u201cThat son of mine, for some reason, has lost the ability to move one of his legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cChief Zhou, if his leg can\u2019t move, he has to go to the hospital. What are you looking for me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Master Lin, we\u2019ve already been to the hospital. It became fine for a while but then the problem returned. This has happened for a few times already. That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to invite you to take a look.\u201d Zhou Shi Ming instructed the young man to go to the car and help his son over.</p><br/><p>At that moment, another young man, being supported, walked over awkwardly. His right leg didn\u2019t move at all. It was as if it was just a stiff metal rod.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over and felt strange. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming\u2019s son, Zhou Jun, had a blank face. His tone was a little rushed as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. A while ago, after playing with my friends at a bar, I saw a dog squatted on the road, so I went up to kick it. At that time, it felt a little painful. The next day, my leg started having problems and I couldn\u2019t move it.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan hadn\u2019t been paying much attention at first but when she heard that man say that, she looked over disdainfully. <em>The dog didn\u2019t even bother you. Why did you kick it?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please help us out,\u201d said Zhou Shi Ming.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Zhou Jun before shaking his head. \u201cI can\u2019t treat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer was firm and without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming panicked. \u201cMaster Lin, you haven\u2019t even looked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to look. I understand it already,\u201d said Lin Fan. With a good look, he could see what this Zhou Kun had done. He had cruelly kicked a pregnant dog to death. Even that puppy that had been in its mother\u2019s womb had died.</p><br/><p>This was just retribution.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan could treat him, he didn\u2019t want to. It was that simple.</p></div>\n</div>"}

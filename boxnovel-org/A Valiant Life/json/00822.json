When Lin Fan and the rest of them came in, the people at the admissions counter had their eyes locked on them.</p><br/><p>As a staff member of a ping pong arena, the most basic requirement for him was to understand ping pong. He also had to know the more popular team members right now.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin had become the overall coach of the team and was frequently on the news. Thus, he definitely could recognize him.</p><br/><p>He was even more familiar with that Xu Song. His favorite ping-pong player was Xu Song. When he was watching the Asian World Championships, Xu Song lost to the Japanese team and he was very sad after seeing that.</p><br/><p>His gaze shifted a bit. When he saw the people next to him, his heart started to race even faster.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that Master Lin?</p><br/><p>He felt like his hearts was a little rough now. He was feeling the greatest amount of excitement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that staff member at the admissions counter and could not help laughing. He made an \u2018shh\u2019 noise and asked the staff member not to shout loudly and then he asked him, \u201cIs there a room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d the staff member immediately nodded. The people in front of him were his idols.</p><br/><p>Especially Master Lin. In his eyes, he idolized him more than any of his idols.</p><br/><p>The show on Shanghai TV where he won the arrogant Japanese man will forever be etched in his mind. It was so berzerk.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to trouble you to open one for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d the staff member rushed to their service. The speed which he acted at was a little bit scary. Then he carefully and gently said, \u201cMaster Lin, I adore you. Can I take a picture with you later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member smiled and said, \u201cThank you, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his eyes, he was really too lucky. He did not know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>After sending Master Lin and the rest of them into their own room, he went to prepare some tea as well as a plate of fruits. Then, he immediately gave his boss a call.</p><br/><p>In all this while that this ping pong arena has been opened, they have never had anyone famous come. However, this time, the majority of the national first team players had come so it was definitely a big deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, something big has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin and some of the national first team players are here. Also, Cui Guo Bin is here. They are playing in one of the arena\u2019s private rooms now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019ll be there in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the boss heard this, he was extremely excited. He opened this arena because of his love for ping pong. When he heard that his favorite ping pong stars were here, he definitely could not help getting excited. He did not care about the things he was busy with and immediately rushed to the arena.</p><br/><p>He felt really lucky.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took his bat and said, \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team members did not say anything at all. They did not want to be the first to be sent to their death. They all knew about Master Lin\u2019s abilities so if they went forward they would just be going to their death.</p><br/><p>However, their coach had been drinking a bit of alcohol and was insistent of having a friendly match. This left them in an awkward situation.</p><br/><p>They were going to get beaten.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had already gotten the broadcast started a long time ago.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast were really fired up.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they are really going to play.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is going to be a fierce battle between two giants. Master Lin can\u2019t possibly destroy a team all by himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the chances of him destroying the team all by himself are pretty high. I think the national team is in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily going to be like that. Master Lin may just let them win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be living in a dream. If Master Lin were to concede any points, I\u2019ll broadcast myself eating sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to watch you eat sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Xiao Xu was stunned. Then he shook his head and said, \u201cCoach, how about I wait for a moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the first team, he was considered pretty strong. Although he was not as strong as their first man, Xu Song, his strength was not to be belittled.</p><br/><p>If it was anyone else, he would not hesitate at all and would straight away fight him.</p><br/><p>But now, the person is front of him was Master Lin. He was little terrified and did not dare to fight him. If Master Lin decided to not show him any mercy at all and just immediately left him with no points at all, it would be embarrassing.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking rubbish. You\u2019re up,\u201d Cui Guo Bin glared at him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xu pulled his head together and realized that he had no other choice. He said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t go too hard on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was at the side broadcasting this.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast all laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m laughing to death. Even Xu Yang is scared of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can he not be afraid? He could possibly be beaten very badly by Master Lin until he doesn\u2019t even know where he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly feel very pitiful for the national team. They actually have to meet this sort of big evil person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cRelax. I\u2019ll definitely show mercy. Here, you can serve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Yang said, \u201cOf course I\u2019ll serve. If I don\u2019t serve, I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to touch the ball at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The match began.</p><br/><p>Xu Yang took a deep breath. He could not relax at all. Even during a regular competition, he had never been as serious as he was right now. Also, he was feeling a little nervous inside as well. He glanced at Master Lin and stopped caring about everything else and just served.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly looked at the ball as in was flying in the air. Then, he bent his body and was preparing for a smash.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Don\u2019t be so fierce Master Lin. Going for the smash right at the start,\u201d Xu Yang was going to cry inside already. The pressure was immense. However, regardless of this, he still immediately countered it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin clapped. It was not bad. He was a lot better than the Japanese man already. At least he managed to return a ball.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan suddenly went to a whole new level of speed.</p><br/><p>He was able to change the rhythm at will. The speed at which the ball flew also increased.</p><br/><p>Pow!</p><br/><p>He could not return it.</p><br/><p>Xu Yang looked at Master Lin in surprise. Seeing it on television was one thing. However, being here to play with Master Lin personally was another thing.</p><br/><p>He had just increased the speed and Xu Yang had no time to react and counter it.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, it did not make sense at all.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast were all in a frenzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is too awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Yang is indeed awesome. To be able to return one of Master Lin\u2019s balls. It\u2019s already better than that Zhenping Yiming by a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Yang bounced the ball. His confidence was not very good but he said, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m going to get serious. You better be ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cOkay, come at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was just Xu Yang trying to pump himself up. He was definitely no match for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later.</p><br/><p>Xu Yang waved his hand and surrendered. He said, \u201cNo more, no more. When I\u2019m playing with Master Lin, I feel like I don\u2019t know how to play ping pong at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. He was just playing around. If he were to play seriously, he felt like he would not have let his opponent score a point at all.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was standing at the side and immediately brought a towel and water over. Then she wiped the sweat of Lin Fan\u2019s forehead. When Xu Song and the rest of them saw that scene of how blessed he was, that was the ultimate blow to them.</p><br/><p>They could not beat him in ping pong and weren\u2019t as blessed as him either.</p><br/><p>They were fed with waves of dog food.</p><br/><p>Also, they gained a whole new level of understanding of Master Lin\u2019s skills and that it was really too disgusting. If anyone went up to challenge him they were just looking for their own misery.</p><br/><p>This level of ability was really incomprehensible.</p><br/><p>The speed of his returns was really too quick and did not give anyone time to react.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

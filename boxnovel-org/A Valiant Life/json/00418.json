With the help of his teacher, he had developed a medicine that could treat anorexia. It would literally be impossible to feel indifferent to finally be able to prove that Chinese Medicine was actually that useful. He now found that Chinese medicine was so powerful. This was only after he had met such a great teacher like Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTired?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked, somewhat surprised. \u201cTeacher, I am not tired at all. In fact, I feel excited about the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head in disapproval. \u201cWell, stay home and rest well. I feel that your journey has just begun. I want you to always remember that regardless of your age, you should always put aside time for yourself to rest and reflect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I understand.\u201d Zhao Ming nodded. He wasn\u2019t someone who took other\u2019s advice easily due to his character. He was the type of person who preferred to debate and express his views on different matters. As for the Weibo Incident, he hadn\u2019t been bothered by it. In fact, it could be said that he had barely been affected by the criticism and stress that the public had put on him. After all, there is no such thing as a perfect person.</p><br/><p>However, he felt like he should change and have a little personality.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t young, he felt that there was nothing wrong with having a little child\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing left the study room and headed to the yard for a breather.</p><br/><p>In the living room, his three sons and daughter had returned home. They were seated and waiting patiently on the sofa.</p><br/><p>Seeing his father coming down the stairs, Zhao Li Xing could not help but apologize remorsefully, \u201cDad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Zhao Ming Qing ignored his son\u2019s gesture, passing him from the side. In fact, he did not even look at his son. He just ignored them and headed to the yard where he started stretching his body.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing felt embarrassed standing there. Looking towards her brothers and sister, he realized they all lowered their heads down guilt.</p><br/><p>In retrospect, they should have known that their actions would offend and betray the trust of their dad.</p><br/><p>Now that Dad succeeded and was the one that called the shots, they could not help but feel extremely embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi smiled and went after him. \u201cOld man, why are you being petty with the children? The children already know their mistake and are now back to admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing gave an \u2018Oh\u2019 and continued stretching his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I really can\u2019t believe such an old man would still hold grudges against his children. This is unbelievable,\u201d Zhao Shi continued. Zhao Shi knew her husband\u2019s character well. He was strict with his children and had the capacity to hold them accountable for the mistakes they made. As such, she knew that it would be hard to appease his anger this time around.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stopped moving. \u201cWhen was I offended? I just feel like ignoring them. They should stop wasting time and head back to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi shook her head and then returned to the house. \u201cYour father is still angry. Look at what you guys have done. If you don\u2019t even have faith in your own father, how do you think he would feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing said, \u201cMom, how could we have known? If Dad was certain, he should have given us a heads up. Besides, the video online was so misleading. You can\u2019t put the blame entirely on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin then said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Actually\u2026 Sigh\u2026 Forget it, I have to go and apologize to Dad. It was really our mistake this time around.\u201d Zhao Bin headed to the yard and apologized sincerely to his Dad.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Elder Mu arrived. \u201cHaha, Elder Zhao, I really admire you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing suddenly smiled, ignoring Zhao Bin entirely. \u201cElder Mu, actually, this time was all thanks to Teacher. Without him, this would surely have been impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu sighed, \u201cSigh, Elder Zhao, you are really a lucky man. Master Lin may be young but the knowledge contained in this body is really scary. Hey, did the association contact you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they did. In fact, they called me many times. However, I did not entertain them,\u201d replied Zhao Ming Qing with a wave of his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d With one look, Elder Mu could tell that Zhao Ming Qing was obviously throwing a tantrum. However, it was only right that he did so. When he had been placed under public scrutiny and pressure, no one from the association had backed him up. In fact, they had even thrown him under the bus.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s talk in the study. There are quite a few \u2018visitors\u2019 today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu shook his head and smiled. He could tell what Zhao Ming Qing meant instantly. He followed Zhao Shi to the study. Passing the living room, he saw Zhao\u2019s kids, heads all hung down in guilt and instantly recognized that they were all so dejected because Zhao Ming Qing had yet to forgive them.</p><br/><p>Study room.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu thought for a moment, then asked, \u201cElder Zhao, let me ask you something. What do you plan to do with the medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing thought for a moment. \u201cEveryone thinks that the medicine was developed by me. But it was actually by my teacher. As for how I\u2019ll handle it, I have to ask my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think should happen?\u201d Elder Mu asked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing thought for a moment. \u201cI feel that medicine should be used to save others and not for monetary benefits. However, I will be sure to obtain patents and rights such that Teacher\u2019s efforts are not wasted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu nodded. \u201cMmm, I guess what you said makes sense. You\u2019ve really injected a sense of excitement for researchers around the globe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded in agreement. He felt like when it came to matters like these, he could only do his best to help.</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly and it was almost noon.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, Qing Quan and company are here,\u201d Zhao Shi yelled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed. \u201cLook, we have even more company! Let them all in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Several old men were waiting.</p><br/><p>They were all members of the Chinese Medical Association. They had all been doubters of Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s work and had been afraid of the backlash it would bring. However, now that he had succeeded, they felt unbelievably embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think he will ignore us?\u201d a white-haired old man asked.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan was the Chairman of the Association of Chinese Medicine. Moreover, he was roughly the same age as Zhao Ming Qing. He shook his head and said, \u201cI doubt so. Elder Zhao is not a petty man. Although we were a little wrong at that time, we\u2019ve already been friends for so many years. He won\u2019t. He won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng, the Vice Chairman of the Association of Chinese Medicine, lamented, \u201cThat is not a given. Ever since Zhao Ming Qing became Master Lin\u2019s disciple, he had already been angered by us. I am not sure if he will be so willing to forgive us.</p><br/><p>As they were discussing, Zhao Shi came and directed them to the study where Zhao Ming Qing was waiting.</p><br/><p>They looked at each other before smiling and asking, \u201cSister, how is Elder Zhao\u2019s mood today?</p><br/><p>She replied, \u201cNot very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng clapped. \u201cD*mn, we are screwed this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan waved his hand in dismissal. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s just go up and see if we can work things out face to face.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

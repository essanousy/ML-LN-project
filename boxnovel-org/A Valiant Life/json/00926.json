It seemed like he had a lot more to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, please excuse me. I would like to ask what you mean by those words you just said. I don\u2019t quite understand it,\u201d Lin Fan interrupted mercilessly. He didn\u2019t want to give the opposite party the chance to continue the performance any longer.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi was taken aback and a little displeased. He didn\u2019t like it when people interrupted him. However, since it was Master Lin, he didn\u2019t take it to heart. Then, he explained, \u201cMaster Lin, we value Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute greatly. We also think that the idea of educating the children of the welfare institute is great. However, I think that this requires the cooperation of our department. We\u2019ll provide the manpower and effort in a way that abides by the regulations to create Shanghai\u2019s first children\u2019s welfare institute school.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you mean is for it to be like other schools? The only difference is that the students will be these children?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d answered Chen Shi with a smile.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201d Let me ask you one more thing. According to your plan, who will arrange the appointment of the teachers, principals, and such?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Shi replied, \u201cNaturally, we will do an integrated evaluation and aim to attain the education standard of a four-star school.\u201d</p><br/><p>To him, this was the only way that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute would get on the right track and accept the supervision of the Education Department.</p><br/><p>This time, his goal of coming over was as such. To state this matter to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. This decision hadn\u2019t been made by just himself but it had been through conference discussions before finally being made.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and the rest looked at each other. Then, they looked at Chen Shi with a weird gaze. They typically thought more than average people when they encountered any situation.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang knew what the conditions had been when his brother picked the teachers. He also knew how the welfare institute was managed.</p><br/><p>Now that the Education Department was just sticking their foot in and trying to carry out the same style as other schools, there was a clash in ideals with his brother.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately spoke, \u201cSorry, Leader Chen. I think you\u2019ve wasted your time. Our Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute will not change its teaching style. The hiring of teachers will be handled by me. As for an integrated evaluation, let\u2019s forget about that.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chen Shi was stunned. He hadn\u2019t thought that Master Lin would reject. Then, he hurriedly said, \u201cMaster Lin, you have to consider it properly. This definitely won\u2019t bring any negatives. Also, you\u2019d be able to gain the government\u2019s financial support. It would bring great benefits to the children\u2019s future studies. No disadvantages at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. I am not one bit interested in that. Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute will function according to my wishes. It doesn\u2019t need the supervision of any department.</p><br/><p>He was rejecting it mainly because he felt that when something became too complicated, it would be hard to take care of in the end.</p><br/><p>Teachers were the most important to the children of the welfare institute. If he allowed the Education Department to manage the teachers or to choose the teachers, it would become hard for himself to control things.</p><br/><p>There had been incidents in the past of teachers with scholarly knowledge but no morals who performed corporal punishment on children. Lin Fan didn\u2019t want such things to happen.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi was a little enraged. He felt as if this Master Lin didn\u2019t know what was good for him. Then, he resisted the fire in his heart and started speaking, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But sadly, Lin Fan didn\u2019t give him a chance. He waved his hand and interrupted, \u201cAlright, no need to talk about this anymore. I won\u2019t agree with it. The plans for Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s future have already been decided. You don\u2019t need to worry. Leader, do you have anything else to share, or\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>His meaning was very clear. <em>If you have something to say, hurry up and finish it. If not, go down quickly and just sit down obediently.</em></p><br/><p><em>What did this guy even come here for? </em>He wants <em>to supervise my welfare institute? Dream on.</em></p><br/><p>They had wanted to manage Lin Fan\u2019s welfare institute. Of course, they would let Lin Fan be the first principal. With that, it would generate a great response and they would be able to use that to drive the follow-up development.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But Chen Shi seemed like he hadn\u2019t given up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you really have to consider it thoroughly. The follow-up development will require funds. It will be a huge figure. We only hope for Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to carry on developing. We don\u2019t want to see it crumble halfway,\u201d said Chen Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cFunds?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s head was filled with question marks. <em>Why would he bring up that problem? </em>\u201cLeader Chen, funds are something we really don\u2019t need to worry about. How about this? I\u2019ll try it out for you to see. Then, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear guests, if I tell you that I need ten million dollars but I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll repay you, there\u2019ll be no interests, no IOUs, who would be willing to lend me that amount? Please raise your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Shi, who was standing on stage, felt that this was very strange. He didn\u2019t know what Master Lin meant by that.</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>A sea of hands was raised below the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Master Lin has really degraded. He even has the cheek to ask for ten million.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really not thinking about our emotions at all. I\u2019m a little disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only worth ten million in his heart. That\u2019s meaningless. That\u2019s really meaningless.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han and the rest all shook their heads. They appeared very helpless, a little regretful, and even a little disappointed. Of course, they were all just acting.</p><br/><p>Who, at the venue, wasn\u2019t wealthy? They had been sitting there obediently listening to Lin Fan speak because they respected him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As for this Chen Shi, they really weren\u2019t bothered about him. From what he had said, they could already tell some things.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, fifty million, please raise your hands,\u201d said Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>A small number of people put down their hands.</p><br/><p>And those who had put down their hands all looked helpless. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to but I don\u2019t have that much money. I can\u2019t lend you that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right, me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters who had been at the back of the room the whole time were already dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Perhaps others wouldn\u2019t know but they had been there since the start. How could they not know what was going on?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just directly telling the leader by his actions: \u2018All these things you\u2019re talking about, they don\u2019t mean anything at all.\u2019</p><br/><p>But looking at the leader\u2019s stupefied expression, it seemed that he hadn\u2019t understood who these people were.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cBrother, is this enough? My hand is getting tired. Let me say something. You can play around however you like and even make me broke. I would accept that.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lu Li laughed and joined in as well. \u201cI, President of Lu Corporation, am also willing to lend Master Lin money without any interest. Just say it and I\u2019ll definitely lend you money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ve seen the situation. Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute really doesn\u2019t lack funds. As for the children\u2019s education, I have absolute faith that they will receive the best. What other people have, they will have it all as well. What other people don\u2019t have, they will have it too. So, there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Shi was dumbfounded. This was completely different from what he had thought. As for Lin Fan\u2019s method of communicating it to him, he had never seen something like that before.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

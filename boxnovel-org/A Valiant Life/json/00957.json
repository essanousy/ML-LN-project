His other friends had all either said that they had something to do and couldn\u2019t talk or they said that their money had all been invested, so they didn\u2019t have any cash on hand.</p><br/><p>If someone wanted to reject, there were countless excuses that could be made.</p><br/><p>Wang Wen said, \u201cI only managed to borrow 5 million. Big Bro, could you have mercy on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Jun laughed, \u201cDo you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCall your parents now. Otherwise, I\u2019m done talking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Wen pleaded tearfully, \u201cBig Bro, can I not call them? I\u2019d get beaten to death. Don\u2019t worry. When I go back, I\u2019ll definitely transfer the money to you.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Brother Jun didn\u2019t say more. He looked over at his subordinate, who picked up the knife from the table. Then, he stepped on his cigarette to extinguish it. \u201cCall the doctor over and tell him to prepare to staunch the bleeding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. I\u2019ll call\u2026\u201d Wang Wen said in a panicked tone.</p><br/><p>He was really terrified by these people. He couldn\u2019t imagine himself with both his hands chopped off.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, looks like shooting a film is dangerous,\u201d said Lin Fan with a chuckle as he heard Wang Ke Hao talk about what had happened in the past. For example, when he had been young, he had done some dangerous things in order to cut down on costs.</p><br/><p>But it did make sense.</p><br/><p>Success isn\u2019t guaranteed. There are certain factors involved.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>For Wang Ke Hao to be successful now, it had much to do with the hard work that he had put in when he had been young.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long were laughing as well and the assistant, Zhou Xia Jun continued the conversation by recounting an interesting recent event.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a phone rang.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao looked at his phone display. In his slightly-drunken state, he scolded jokingly, \u201cThis little brat of mine must have gotten into trouble again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cDirector Wang\u2019s son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Just this one son of mine has caused me so much worry. Now that he\u2019s calling me, there must be some sort of trouble.\u201d Wang Ke Hao then answered the phone, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long both didn\u2019t really like Director Wang\u2019s son. They felt that he was purposeless and only knew how to waste his time. He was a privileged and spoiled brat.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan and the other two continued chatting silently, talking about small matters and also a bit of gossip.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao suddenly became agitated. His face was flushed red. \u201cYou d*mned child! I\u2019m going to be angered to death by you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest looked at each other, wondering what had happened.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao said, \u201cI\u2019m Wang Ke Hao. That amount is too much and I can\u2019t afford that right now. I\u2019ll personally make a trip to Haojiang. Please guarantee my son\u2019s safety for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua realized that Wang Ke Hao\u2019s expression was extremely unsightly. He asked anxiously, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was furious just thinking about it. \u201cThis d*mned brat of mine went to Haojiang to gamble. He made a high-interest loan and now he has no money to repay it. He\u2019s been detained over there and if he doesn\u2019t repay the money, they\u2019ll cut off his hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long weren\u2019t too surprised. Instead, they asked, \u201cHow much is it? Is there a need for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c100 million,\u201d replied Wang Ke Hao.</p><br/><p>Everyone except for Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but suck in a breath of cold air as they heard that.</p><br/><p>\u201c100 million? He dared to borrow that much?\u201d asked Li Meng Hua in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao shook his head. \u201cHe borrowed 43 million. The rest is interest. This d*mned child is really pi*sing me off to death. I have to go to Haojiang now. I can\u2019t let anything happen to him.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Li Meng Hua hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry. For this 43 million to turn into 100 million is too much. I know people there. I\u2019ll make a call to inquire. The borrowed money will definitely have to be repaid but we can lessen the interest. The most important thing is to guarantee Wang Wen\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao replied, \u201cAlright, alright. I guess that\u2019s all we can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua had a broad circle of friends. He knew quite a lot of people over in Haojiang. He then made a call. When the call got through, he smiled and spoke in a friendly tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Cheng, it\u2019s me, Ah Hua.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. I have to trouble Brother Cheng with something. My friend\u2019s son made a high-interest loan in Haojiang. From 43 million, his debt went up to 100 million. That\u2019s way too much. Could I ask Brother Cheng for a favor? We\u2019ll definitely repay the borrowed amount but can the interest be reduced?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. Please wait a moment, Brother Cheng. I\u2019ll ask.\u201d Li Meng Hua covered the phone and said, \u201cWho did he borrow from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao answered, \u201cSomeone called Brother Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua nodded. \u201cBrother Cheng, I\u2019ve asked. He\u2019s called Brother Jun. Do you know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do? Alright, I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao asked anxiously, \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to help us contact him. Brother Cheng is a big shot over in Haojiang and he\u2019s quite influential. I think they\u2019ll give him face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s good. I\u2019ll pay the borrowed amount no matter what but this interest is too high. I can\u2019t let my son suffer over there either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua quickly answered, then nodded. \u201cOkay, okay. Thank you, Brother Cheng, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was very nervous as he wondered how it had turned out.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua took a deep breath. \u201cHe has asked him. The 100 million cannot be reduced. But he can guarantee Wang Wen\u2019s safety. This Brother Jun is very powerful in Haojiang. He\u2019s supported by Wynn Casino. Brother Cheng can\u2019t do much about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Cheng says that it\u2019s best to hurry up and pay the money. This Brother Jun should not be angered. He is capable of doing anything. If that happens, it would be too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was panicking now. \u201cHow can I get 100 million so quickly? Sigh, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re asking for my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua said, \u201cI have over 20 million in my card. It should be able to help a little.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zheng Long added, \u201cI have some with me too. Let\u2019s put our money together for now. Now that they\u2019ve promised not to touch Wang Wen, it\u2019s a sort of assurance as well. I\u2019ll make a call to Wynn Casino\u2019s internal department. When I went over there to shoot a film the last time, I met a person-in-charge there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao said, \u201cThank you so much, Ah Long. Quick, give him a call to ask about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haojiang. Wynn\u2019s Casino.</p><br/><p>In a luxurious office.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was looking at the company\u2019s earnings for the past few days. A middle-aged man next to him passed her files one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the company\u2019s profit has been very good recently,\u201d said the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Yun Xue Yao\u2019s expression was calm. She flipped through the account book.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the middle-aged man\u2019s phone rang. When he saw the display, he hesitated for a moment. He requested the young lady\u2019s approval before answering the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Zheng, hello, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to ask my superior about this. Please wait a moment. \u201cThe middle-aged man covered the phone and looked over at Yun Xue Yao. \u201cMiss, the call is from the Hong Kong superstar, Zheng Long. Wang Ke Hao\u2019s son borrowed money in the casino and with interest, the debt is now 100 million. He\u2019s asking if we can reduce it by a little\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished, Yun Xue Yao frowned and glared at him. Then, with a cold tone, she said, \u201cIs this your first day on the job? The company\u2019s rules cannot be changed no matter who calls.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man started sweating profusely as he heard these words. \u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, he continued talking on the phone, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lil\u2019 Zheng. This is a rule. We can\u2019t change it. Yes, yes, please understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Over in Shanghai, Zheng Long sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

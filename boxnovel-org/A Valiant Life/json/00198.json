Without any evidence, nobody could bring him to court, but what he was most worried about was these two guys getting information from Qian Hao.</p><br/><p>He wasn't worried about that Chief Liu but that other kid appeared to be really cunning. He was afraid that that kid might really be quite capable.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian's patience was reaching its limit, \"Master Lin, what are we going to do now? Wang Shen is very aware of his rights. If we don't have any evidence, we simply can't get any useful information out of him.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was not anxious at all, \"It's fine. We can't get anything out of him indeed but there's another guy next door. I think he will tell us.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was surprised, \"How could that be? That guy's mouth won't open either. My colleagues couldn't get anything out of him.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, then found a document and a pen, \"When we go in later, don't talk. Let me do it.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian didn't know what Lin Fan had up his sleeves but at that point, he could only place all his hopes on Lin Fan. If they couldn't find anything within twelve hours, he might have to take responsibility and resign. After all, he had been going against the usual procedure from the start.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this Wang Shen wasn't a simple man. He had a huge social network. If he got out, perhaps just with a few words from him, they would be dragged into deep sh*t.</p><br/><p>The surrounding policemen asked, \"Chief, is there any progress?\"</p><br/><p>The policemen wanted to find out what they managed to get out of the interrogation for one thing but they also wanted to see just what capabilities Master Lin had. The policemen failed to get any information from Wang Shen, could it be that Master Lin succeeded?</p><br/><p>Of course, they had nothing against Master Lin. It was just that young people had competitive hearts. If they, as professionals, couldn't get any useful information, how could Master Lin, a normal townsman, do it?</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian shook his head, \"We couldn't get any useful information from Wang Shen. We'll be going next door now to question Qian Hao.\"</p><br/><p>One of the policemen said, \"Chief, we just interrogated him. This Qian Hao didn't say a word from start to finish. He's even tougher to question than that Wang Shen.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian waved his hand, \"Don't worry about that. Master Lin has his ways.\"</p><br/><p>The policemen looked at Master Lin. They didn't trust him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Alright, let's go in. You guys can sit here and take a break.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian entered the interrogation room, the policemen outside started discussing among themselves.</p><br/><p>\"Do you think they'll succeed this time?\"</p><br/><p>\"I doubt it. Even we can't get any information from him, what do you think some shopkeeper from Cloud Street can do?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why does Chief trust him so much? Does anyone know?\"</p><br/><p>\"I only heard this from other people. This Master Lin used to set up a stall to sell his scallion pancakes. At that time, Chief was still a city enforcement officer. That's when the two of them met. Later on, Chief was investigating a murder case but there were no developments for a long time. Then, this Master Lin gave a few pointers that eventually led to the case being solved. That's why Chief trusts Master Lin so much.\"</p><br/><p>\"That sounds way too unbelievable.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who knows? We can only wait and see how this turns out. If they still can't get any information, I'm afraid Chief will be in trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh\u2026\"</p><br/><p>In the interrogation room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian entered. Qian Hao was sitting there, closing his eyes and resting his mind. He wasn't frightened by Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian's entrance, nor did he open his eyes to them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat down in front of Qian Hao. Just as Liu Xiao Tian was about to wake Qian Hao up, Lin Fan stopped him.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian didn't know what Master Lin wanted to do but Master Lin was taking charge of the whole situation, so he didn't say a word and just sat there quietly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the interrogation room was totally silent. Not a single sound could be heard.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao was getting suspicious. These two guys just entered, why didn't they say anything? He started to become restless.</p><br/><p>Seconds and minutes passed by.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian's outer appearance remained the same but he was getting anxious on the inside. What was Master Lin doing? Why didn't he say a single word? This time couldn't be delayed.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao couldn't take it anymore. He opened his eyes and said, \"Don't even think of framing me. I won't answer a single question of yours.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Qian Hao and smiled, then pushed a document forward, placing a pen beside it, \"You don't need to talk. Wang Shen has already told us everything. You, as an accomplice, can't escape. So just sign your name and this thing will be over.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao opened the document and laughed coldly, \"You think I can be scared? You think I'll believe you? Let me tell you, we have done nothing wrong. We are just a normal service company.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, your boss has already admitted and repented for his crimes and will get a lighter sentence but you still refuse to talk. That will make your sentence even heavier. You will get a life sentence at best and a death sentence at worst. As for your boss, he will be jailed for several tens of years at most. When he is released he will still be able to enjoy the magnificence of daylight.\" Lin Fan said, then looked at Qian Hao, \"As for you, whether you sign or not and whether you admit it or not doesn't matter anymore. Wang Shen has already revealed all your crimes.\"</p><br/><p>As Liu Xiao Tian was listening from aside, he didn't feel very confident. This kind of method only worked on people with weak wills. Against an experienced veteran like this man, it's likely to be useless.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao was a little stirred up, but he maintained his cool. Then he raised his head, \"Hmph, keep telling your stories. It would be a shame if you didn't. Rest assured, when I get out, I'll introduce a director to you. If you write a story for him, perhaps it might be successful.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan folded his arms and leaned back in his chair, his eyes steadily gazing at Qian Hao. Then he said, \"Qian Hao.\"</p><br/><p>\"June 15th, 1982.\"</p><br/><p>\"High school records.\"</p><br/><p>\"At twenty years old he was sentenced to nine months for assault.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao looked at Lin Fan and said disdainfully, \"Who do you think you're scaring? What can that prove? This is the police station. You can just do a search and find that out easily. And don't tell me that it was said by my boss. If you really managed to get it out of him, then even I would respect you.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at Lin Fan. Again, he didn't understand Master Lin's intentions. This kind of information could be found just by doing a search on the computer. Against this kind of person who frequently mixed with the worst of society, it wouldn't scare him at all.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan remained calm. He said unhurriedly, \"2004 was the first time you kidnapped and sold a child, right?\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao was stunned, his expression changed slightly but he quickly hid it. He looked at Lin Fan and said, \"What are you blindly saying?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \"This isn't blind talk, it was all said by your boss.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao was starting to lose his cool. He had only ever told Wang Shen about this matter. No one else knew.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to say, \"According to Wang Shen, that was the first time you interacted with him. Ever since then, you've followed him and during this period, you've cruelly murdered seven kidnapped children. Those seven children were causing a ruckus and because you were afraid that things would get out of hand, you painfully killed them. In fact, Wang Shen tried to stop you but you wouldn't listen.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao was really starting to panic. Sweat droplets started to form on his forehead, \"Bullshit. You're just making this up.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \"Whether it's made up, I don't know, but it was all said by Wang Shen. You're the main perpetrator while he's just an assistant. Under the law, you will bear full responsibility. With this, a death sentence should be about right. Chief Liu and I are just here to let you know this. We're not here to ask you to confirm it. Because we've already gotten Wang Shen's testimonial.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao gazed at Lin Fan, \"You're not a policeman, what are you doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"I forgot to tell you. I'm an undercover police and I've been following you guys for a long time. Have you ever noticed that there has always been a cleaner at your company's entrance? Every day from early in the morning, I would already be near you...\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao looked at Lin Fan and he suddenly thought that Lin Fan might be right. Every morning at the dawn, the cleaner would be there. Sometimes, when Qian Hao slept at the company, he would hear the cleaner downstairs. When he looked at this man smiling in front of him, he suddenly felt that he looked familiar as if he had seen him somewhere before. At that moment, his heart slowly sank\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Qian Hao, \"Do you have anything to say? If not, it means you agree to it by default. I think that Wang Shen would be very happy. He's passed all the blame to you. You really are a good underling.\"</p><br/><p>Qian Hao remained silent.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned to Liu Xiao Tian and said, \"Alright, let's go. This case is closed.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian stood up.</p><br/><p>Just as the two of them reached the door\u2026</p><br/><p>Qian Hao looked up at Lin Fan, \"It's not like that. I'm not the one\u2026\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She kept looking closely at Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>A good figure.</p><br/><p>Tall as well.</p><br/><p>And her face was beautiful.</p><br/><p>Her buttocks, in particular, were perfectly round and perky.</p><br/><p>Although she worked under their own son, they didn\u2019t mind it. As long as she was good to their son, it was fine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation and was a little frustrated. It was all because he was single that his parents were always worried about him.</p><br/><p>However, these things could not be rushed. They had to be taken slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, this is You Lan\u2019s father,\u201d introduced Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin looked at the old man who was standing at the entrance with a face full of smiles and was a little astonished. If Lin Fan hadn\u2019t said it, she would have wondered why there was an old man in his shop. So they were father and daughter.</p><br/><p>But judging by things, the old man definitely had his daughter at a late age.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin went forward. \u201cNice to meet you, Brother Wu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He smiled, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin and Wu Tian He had about twenty years between them. This gap was quite big. However, they might become family in future.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin, on the other hand, started chatting with Wu You Lan. They were just talking about daily matters and also chatting about some unusual matters. Of course, she knew that young ladies aren\u2019t thick-skinned, so she didn\u2019t ask Wu You Lan any difficult questions.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu You Lan was trying to do her best. She didn\u2019t want to leave any negative impression in front of Brother Lin\u2019s parents.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan would pour tea, serve water and do all sorts of work daily.</p><br/><p>This made Mama Lin like her even more.</p><br/><p>Although she liked a daughter-in-law that was capable, she liked a daughter-in-law that knew how to manage the house even more.</p><br/><p>Although this was the first time they had met, she could tell that this young lady was very hardworking and had good feelings about her son.</p><br/><p>However, why didn\u2019t her son settle down with this young lady?</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fan, where\u2019s that kid, Ming Yang?\u201d asked Mama Lin.</p><br/><p>They were very concerned about this friend of their son\u2019s.</p><br/><p>After all, with that card that he had left behind the last time, they had gone to the supermarket and realized that the card contained too much money. It made them a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, he should be pretty busy now. I\u2019ll give him a call to ask him.\u201d Lin Fan dialed Wang Ming Yang\u2019s number.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. My Dad and Mom are here and they\u2019re asking about you so I\u2019m calling you to find out. What are you busy with now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle and Aunty are here? Why didn\u2019t you say so earlier? Where are you guys now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt my shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in an instant. Wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan could respond, Wang Ming Yang hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept his phone. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the kid is busy, there\u2019s no need to come,\u201d said Mama Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. Let him come if he wants to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang came over in a rush. When he entered, he said warmly, \u201cUncle, Aunty, why didn\u2019t you tell me that you were coming to Shanghai?\u201d Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \u201cYou too. You should\u2019ve told me earlier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re a busy man. How could I have told you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I was busier, nothing would be more important than this. Right, Uncle and Aunty, you guys haven\u2019t eaten yet, have you? I\u2019ll reserve a table later on. We\u2019ll go to Shanghai\u2019s best restaurant.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was going to take care of everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny place is fine. There\u2019s no need to spend too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cHow would that be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, everyone chatted for a while more before setting off together.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, Lil\u2019 Fan\u2019s car was given to him by you. You really take care of our Lil\u2019 Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was embarrassed. \u201cDon\u2019t say it like that, Auntie. I can\u2019t take care of him. He\u2019s the one who takes care of me. If it wasn\u2019t for him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately changed the subject, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about taking care or not? We\u2019re fellow brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. Aunty, you guys can treat me like your half-son. In future, if you need anything, you can call me,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>To people who didn\u2019t know the situation, they would think that Wang Ming Yang was taking care of Lin Fan but in truth, it was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s good fortune that he was able to be good friends with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>There were many problems that weren\u2019t solved by this brother of his.</p><br/><p>When he had been bullied by others, Lin Fan would raise his fists to teach the opposition a lesson without a second thought.</p><br/><p>In fact, Wang Ming Yang had really not done much to help Lin Fan. Every time something big happened, Lin Fan would settle it himself and he never went to Wang Ming Yang for help.</p><br/><p>Whenever Lin Fan looked for Wang Ming Yang for help, it would just be a small matter. How could Wang Ming Yang not know that Lin Fan just didn\u2019t want to trouble him?</p><br/><p>Very soon, they reached the luxurious restaurant.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had called this place to make arrangements. He was giving Papa Lin and Mama Lin, who had never been to such a place before, an eye-opening experience. Papa Lin, in particular, would not put down his phone as he kept snapping pictures. He was living like a modern youth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless as well. As long as they were happy, it was all good.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do for the New Year?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cI\u2019m planning to go with Zi Le back to her old home. It would also be a chance to meet her parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the date been settled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. We\u2019ve not decided to marry yet. We\u2019ll see how things go. She\u2019s at the peak period of her working life as well. We\u2019ll wait one or two more years,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cJust remember what I said, she can make you prosper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted Lin Fan on the shoulder. \u201cHey, I always remember your words. How could I forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Huan Yue wants to come as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was startled. \u201cWhy would she want to come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI posted something on my WeChat. She must have found out that Uncle and Aunty have come and wanted to meet them.\u201d Wang Ming Yang smiled at Lin Fan. The look in his eyes was a little strange.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue reached.</p><br/><p>When she reached, she immediately rushed to Papa Lin and Mama Lin\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, Aunty, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Wu Huan Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin didn\u2019t think too much and just responded nicely.</p><br/><p>However, Mama Lin felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Then, she looked at her son and realized that her son had a helpless look on his face. She instantly understood.</p><br/><p>But she was quite happy. The two of them had always been worrying about Lil\u2019 Fan but they had not expected that Lin Fan would attract two girls in such a short time.</p><br/><p>Based on appearances, it was not easy to judge who was better.</p><br/><p>It was really a difficult task.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Wu Huan Yue both sat by Mama Lin\u2019s side. They warmly served her, putting food on her plate and pouring drinks for her. The whole way, it seemed that they hadn\u2019t eaten at all. They were basically just putting food on Mama Lin\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>This made Mama Lin beam brightly.</p><br/><p>She kept saying, \u201cGood. Good. Good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang spoke softly to one another.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, this is troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s so troublesome? I think it\u2019s pretty good. Just take both of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m you? How could I take both of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cDon\u2019t falsely accuse me. I only have Zi Le. However, as long as you keep it a secret, no one will find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glared at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cI think that you\u2019re really not reliable. Don\u2019t you know that if I do that, I\u2019ll get chopped up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

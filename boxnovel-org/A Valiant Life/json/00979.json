She had struggled to get just a few hours of sleep and now, she had been woken up again.</p><br/><p>But earning money was always a struggle. She could only endure it, close her eyes, and force herself back to sleep.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhong Fei had wanted to reject the call but when he saw the phone display, he leaned on the back of the bed and answered it.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Li, what\u2019s going on? It\u2019s so early and you\u2019re calling. Didn\u2019t you go out to play last night?\u201d Wang Zhong Fei grumbled. They had brought a lady each back to their hotel rooms. He was so exhausted right now and he hadn\u2019t expected Elder Li to have the energy to give him a call.</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Elder Li\u2019s tone suddenly became rough. \u201cYou still have time to talk about that right now? Something huge has happened. Hurry up and take a look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. The association is being overturned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s all this?\u201d Wang Zhong Fei was confused as he wondered what was going on.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Master Lin had already become the Chinese Medical Association Chairman. Could it be that people were still blind enough to find trouble with the association?</p><br/><p>Although they hadn\u2019t interacted with Master Lin before, they could see from weibo that Master Lin was unafraid of trouble. Anyone who caused trouble for him would definitely be flamed to death by Master Lin, so much so that that person\u2019s parents might not even recognize him anymore.</p><br/><p>But hearing Elder Li\u2019s words, it seemed that a big problem had really occurred. Then, he opened his Weibo and took a casual look.</p><br/><p>Even if the sky had fallen, there was someone to hold it up. If someone had really come to cause trouble for the association, Master Lin would be there to stop them. Wang Zhong Fei and other people would only watch until the matter was resolved and shout a few remarks afterward.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the content of the Weibo post, Wang Zhong Fei was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he gasped in shock. Then, he jumped up form the bed and stood there bare naked in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cMemberships will be frozen and they\u2019ll re-evaluate everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the f*ck made that rule?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Zhong Fei was talking to himself. He couldn\u2019t believe what he had just seen.</p><br/><p>The Chinese Medical Association had so many people. It couldn\u2019t even be counted. Suddenly, they had announced that memberships would be temporarily frozen and they would no longer be members for this period.</p><br/><p>This impact was immense.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, what\u2019s going on? Do you want to have a go in the morning?\u201d The lady was wrapped up in the bed sheets as she seduced him.</p><br/><p>But to Wang Zhong Fei, even if the lady was even more seductive, it was useless.</p><br/><p>He hurriedly made a few calls to his friends.</p><br/><p>When he found out that this content had been posted by Master Lin, he had a very bad feeling.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, \u2018The new boss cracks the whip three times.\u2019 This was one.</p><br/><p>But this whip was way too brutal. Wasn\u2019t he afraid of causing an uproar?</p><br/><p>He sat his butt on the bed and put down his phone. His eyes glimmered with fear. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a real mess.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>All the members of the Chinese Medical Association had found out about the public notice.</p><br/><p>Some of them felt that the association indeed needed to be cleansed but many others felt that this was a mistake.</p><br/><p>They had no idea what Master Lin was trying to do. He had only just taken up his appointment and he was already making such a move. He had probably already planned this from the start.</p><br/><p>Yet, they had actually stupidly approved of Master Lin taking up the appointment.</p><br/><p>Initially, they had wanted to share some of Master Lin\u2019s spotlight and develop their businesses further but now that the public notice was out, they weren\u2019t even association members anymore. They even needed to be evaluated again. They were already so old, how could they go through the evaluation?</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>There were some office workers that didn\u2019t have high statuses but in their hearts, it was as if they owned the world.</p><br/><p>When they saw Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo post, the netizens started discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe new boss cracks the whip three times. This move by Master Lin is rather harsh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they really do that, that means that all the members of the association have had their memberships frozen and they have to be evaluated once again to re-enter the association. To some people, this may be a good thing. But to some of the old members, this is definitely unfavorable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I can\u2019t help but be worried about Master Lin. This is going to cause huge problems.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s meaning is very clear. Did you see the news from yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout the multi-level marketing organization. There was a Chinese Medical Association member who acted as a guest speaker and he even got exposed by Master Lin. Master Lin is probably doing this now because of that incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know about that. But I support this. When an organization develops to a certain stage, it is sure to have impurities mixed in with the good people. Since Master Lin has agreed to take on the role of Chairman, he definitely wants to help Chinese medicine to progress, so he\u2019s starting by removing these impurities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Chinese medicine masters that I follow have all started protesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the shop, Fraud Tian and the rest approached him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, isn\u2019t this too big of a move?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said worriedly. He hadn\u2019t known about this incident at first but when he saw his Weibo, he was surprised that Brother Lin was going to implement such a large-scale reform.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s so big about it? It\u2019s just a reform. Say what you want but this is already set in stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. I feel that you\u2019re too rash, kid. As they say, you have to slowly simmer the water to cook the frog. This isn\u2019t something that can be resolved in one go. Now that you\u2019ve done this, it will bring huge repercussions.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan said giddily, \u201cIf I let it simmer more, all the water will be gone and the frog might still be alive. I\u2019m taking the hammer and smashing them in one go. If they don\u2019t die, then I\u2019ll give it to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s bad. Master Lin just became the Chairman and he\u2019s already making such a big move. He wants to completely cleanse the members of the association.\u201d A middle-aged man ran over anxiously.</p><br/><p>Their family had deep roots in the Chinese Medical Association. Many people in the association had close relationships with their family. Now, this had suddenly happened in the association. Everyone was going to be kicked out and had to be evaluated to re-enter the association.</p><br/><p>What if they couldn\u2019t pass the evaluation?</p><br/><p>Could it be that they really wouldn\u2019t be recruited anymore?</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou looked at the public notice and frowned, appearing very displeased. \u201cHe\u2019s good. I didn\u2019t think he would dare to play like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what do we do now? Since they\u2019ve already made the public notice, it\u2019s definitely going to be implemented.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImplemented?\u201d Zhang Guo Shou looked at his son. \u201cHe\u2019s dreaming. I thought that he could understand the way things worked in the association but looking at things now, I was taking it for granted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the Chairman of the association sounds like an appointment with lots of authority, this authority is built on the members of the association. I want to see what he can do all by himself,\u201d Zhang Guo Shou scoffed. He had been doing business in the association for so long and spent so much effort and resources on it in order to build his network of relations. How could it be gone just like that?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDad, what do we do now then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou said, \u201cYesterday, there was a television channel that invited me to appear on their show, right? Reply to them on my behalf. I\u2019ll go there today. And spread the word to those in the association to look for Zhou Qing Quan. since he wants to make a ruckus, we\u2019ll play with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, Dad.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

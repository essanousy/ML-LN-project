This isn\u2019t worth it. Sister will introduce you to an even better woman. It\u2019s fine not to have this kind of woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Lil\u2019 Wang, don\u2019t do something so stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman is really despicable. She actually bullied our Lil\u2019 Wang. Why must such a polite and courteous kid like him meet a woman like her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone kept on advising him not to do it but it wasn\u2019t having much of an effect. Lil\u2019 Wang was still sitting there and his state of mind was clearly fluctuating wildly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, some angry sounds came from the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do, woman? You\u2019re even thinking of leaving at such a time instead of advising Lil\u2019 Wang to come down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really inhumane. You should just break up if you want to. You don\u2019t have to bring your lover to Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a young and fashionable lady was surrounded by the crowd. She had her luggage bag in her hand and by her side, a young man was shouting, \u201cGet out of my way. Him jumping has nothing to do with us. Move aside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian pointed forward, \u201cLook, that\u2019s Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s girlfriend. I didn\u2019t think that this lady would be so cruel, to bring her lover to Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s face. Isn\u2019t that just provoking him?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over. That was indeed the case. The lady was beautiful indeed and she was dressed fashionably. The young man next to her was dressed luxuriously as well. He wasn\u2019t a poor man.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao Yun was a little pissed. What were these unruly people doing? He had seen a loser together with a beautiful lady and felt unsettled about it, so he thought of ways to woo the beautiful lady. He hadn\u2019t expected that the beautiful lady actually liked money. To Qian Hao Yun, that was not a problem at all.</p><br/><p>It was just money. What he had was money.</p><br/><p>So he immediately took her with him.</p><br/><p>After having some fun with her the previous night, he came here at noon to say in front of that loser\u2019s face that he had stolen his beautiful girlfriend and that he was going to take her away. What could the loser possibly do about it?</p><br/><p>However, he hadn\u2019t expected this kid to be so rash. He immediately ran up the building and wanted to jump, causing this screwed up situation to happen.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao was dragging her luggage bag, looking at her ex-boyfriend on the rooftop. She felt a little disgusted. Then, she looked at the man next to her and instantly smiled. This was her real Prince Charming. That Lil\u2019 Wang had been the last thing on her mind for a long time already.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady, can\u2019t you urge him not to do it? Can you bear to just watch him jump?\u201d someone from the crowd said.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao frowned, \u201cWhat does him jumping have to do with me? I\u2019ve already broken up with him. It\u2019s not like I told him to jump.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd said, \u201cYou\u2019re being a little ridiculous. Would it kill you just to talk to him? Also, how can someone even be like you? If you didn\u2019t like him, you should have just told Lil\u2019 Wang. you even brought your lover over for him to see. Aren\u2019t you just purposely making him angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let me tell you, if Lil\u2019 Wang really jumps and dies, then you would be considered the murderer for intentionally provoking him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao was a little scared now. \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Qian Hao Yun embraced her and said with disdain, \u201cHehe, who are you trying to scare? He should just jump if he wants to. If he doesn\u2019t I would look down on him. Don\u2019t bother about that loser, Xiao Xiao. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao nodded. She had wanted to leave this place since long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Lil\u2019 Wang, don\u2019t be rash,\u201d the crowd cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang seemed to have seen what had happened below. His heart contracted furiously and it ached very much. He suddenly moved as if he was really about to jump.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his mouth and said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Step backward.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd saw that he had come, they rejoiced. Their Little Boss had come. They had complete trust in Little Boss and they felt that he would definitely be able to resolve this.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang, what are you doing? What is there that you have to jump from a building? Hurry up and come down right now,\u201d Lin Fan yelled towards the rooftop.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang saw Lin Fan too. \u201cLittle Boss, I don\u2019t want to live anymore. I\u2019ve been wronged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. This young man was too fragile. However, it was normal. When someone sees his own girlfriend get taken away right in front of his eyes, unless he\u2019s an ironman, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.</p><br/><p>Most people with unyielding personalities would grab a knife and kill that guy immediately.</p><br/><p>While people with gentler personalities would probably not be able to accept it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI know that you\u2019ve been wrong but come down now. This is nothing. If you believe me, then let me tell you. This lady favors the rich and has disdain for the poor. She is vain and she is hypocritical with her affection. If you are to be with her in future, that would really be a misfortune. Now, God has opened his eyes and gotten an idiot to substitute you. You should be feeling fortunate. Next time, you\u2019ll meet an even better girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was shocked. They hadn\u2019t expected Little Boss to be so overbearing in his advice.</p><br/><p>He really made them speechless.</p><br/><p>When Li Xiao Xiao heard this, he was a little dumbfounded as well.</p><br/><p>What did this man just say? He actually degraded her like that.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qian Hao Yun was angry. He immediately shouted, \u201cWho are you f*cking talking about?\u201d Then, he pointed to the rooftop. \u201cLet me tell you that your girlfriend was snatched away by me. What can you do about it? Jump down if you have any guts, loser. If you don\u2019t jump, I\u2019ll look down on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be so malicious?\u201d The townsfolk were furious. They hadn\u2019t expected this guy to be so cruel, using words to provoke Lil\u2019 Wang.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Lil\u2019 Wang was provoked. \u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that things looked bad. He felt as if Lil\u2019 Wang was really going to jump down.</p><br/><p>He opened the department store.</p><br/><p>He started a search.</p><br/><p>Then, his eyes lit up. He found it.</p><br/><p>Nobita\u2019s Forgiveness Cap: 10 Encyclopedic Points</p><br/><p>History: An item from Doraemon\u2019s 4D pocket, used by Nobita Nobi. It can relax the spirit, allow one to see past one\u2019s humiliation and gradually forget about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this is it. Although I don\u2019t know what this has to do with Doraemon, it looks like it\u2019s very powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lil\u2019 Wang was in an extreme state. It seemed that he wouldn\u2019t heed Lin Fan\u2019s advice any longer. Lin Fan could only use his 10 Encyclopedic Points in exchange for this \u2018Nobita\u2019s Forgiveness Cap\u2019.</p><br/><p>He said in his heart \u2018Exchange\u2019.</p><br/><p>To outsiders, they saw a green cap appear out of nowhere and rise up into the sky, finally landing on Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s head. It shone with a dim light for a moment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath. \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, come down right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk looked on worriedly. They didn\u2019t know what to do anymore. Even Little Boss couldn\u2019t seem to do anything. Could it be that Lil\u2019 Wang was really going to jump?</p><br/><p>On the rooftop.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s brain shook a little. Then, he looked down. He was shocked and he stepped back in fear. What the heck was he doing? Why was he so high up?</p><br/><p>Oh!</p><br/><p>Right.</p><br/><p>His ex-girlfriend was together with another man and she even brought that man here to humiliate him. But why had he been so angry? He should have felt fortunate for discovering that his ex-girlfriend was such a person early. Otherwise, if he got married to her, he wouldn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it seems that Lil\u2019 Wang has gone down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Little Boss is Little Boss after all. Once he appeared, he managed to get Lil\u2019 Wang to come down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after, Lil\u2019 Wang appeared in front of Lin Fan. Then, he said gratefully, \u201cLittle Boss, thank you so much. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I might really not have been able to think things through. You were right. This kind of woman is no good. I should feel fortunate that an idiot has taken my place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil\u2019 Wang on the shoulder, \u201cAs long as you can look past it now, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Qian Hao Yun heard Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s words, he was so angry that his face turned pale. What did that guy say?</p><br/><p>He was in a towering rage!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom! What did you f*cking say? Didn\u2019t you want to jump, loser? Jump then! You piece of sh*t\u2026\u201d Qian Hao Yun yelled furiously. But suddenly, his whole body flew backward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted his pants gently to remove the dust. \u201cJust listening to this kind of people talk is disgusting.\u201d Then, he waved his hand and said, \u201cEverything\u2019s fine now. Disperse, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Foshan Shadowless kick. Lin Fan had sent him flying with a single kick, causing the place to erupt in commotion.</p><br/><p>Everyone cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>Amazing!</p></div>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s as if I\u2019m looking at angels waving to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other Michelin food critics also swallowed their saliva forcefully after seeing Henry eat the scallion pancake. The aroma filled the air and reached their noses. They also couldn\u2019t control themselves anymore.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><br/><p>Then, everyone gathered around the poster and read it carefully.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and started to make more scallion pancakes. The aroma filled the air as the scallion pancakes were formed.</p><br/><p>Even he felt that the scallion pancakes became more delicious. It was different from before.</p><br/><p>It was definitely the power of the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost. It probably wanted these foreigners to kneel down after eating such delicacy.</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>These Michelin food critics couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of the scallion pancakes anymore. When Lin Fan passed it to them, they felt like they were under a spell and they kneeled down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so delicious? What if I can\u2019t eat it anymore in the future? What should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to thank the Gods for giving me such delicious food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A group of foreigners was kneeling in front of Master Lin\u2019s shop. Everyone felt like they were holding a piece of godly scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know why they had become like that.</p><br/><p>It was delicious and their taste buds should have been the only thing that could taste the goodness. However, they were able to feel it within them.</p><br/><p>Their suppressed feelings got unleashed and they lost their minds.</p><br/><p>The other townsfolk were frightened by them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God, what\u2019s wrong with these foreigners?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone mad. They\u2019ve gone mad. Why are they kneeling down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss\u2019 scallion pancakes are indeed delicious but why are they reacting in such an exaggerated manner? It\u2019s even worse than us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a townsfolk deduced.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to my understanding, the scallion pancakes that Little Boss made for us in the past definitely had fewer ingredients. He was probably afraid that we would become like these foreigners and make such exaggerated expressions. However, I really want to taste the scallion pancakes that they have now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s reasonable.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter in the crowd, who was on holiday, immediately took out his camera and took pictures of the foreigners.</p><br/><p>Although he was on leave, his profession meant that he brought the necessary accessories to report breaking news everywhere he went.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he recognized one of the foreigners.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t they Michelin food critics?</p><br/><p>He felt that the news was going to be epic.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan finished making the scallion pancakes, he wiped his hands and drank a sip of tea that Wu You Lan had brought over. Then, he looked at the foreigners.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s disperse. There\u2019s nothing much left.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked so calm and everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>Those foreigners were kneeling after eating his scallion pancakes. Was he just going to ignore that and say nothing?</p><br/><p>That was insane.</p><br/><p>The crowd didn\u2019t want to leave. They felt that what they saw today changed their perspectives.</p><br/><p>Also, they felt a sense of pride.</p><br/><p>Master Lin actually made a dish that made all these foreigners kneel down after eating it. Shouldn\u2019t they be afraid of it?</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the foreigners were afraid of it, the crowd was afraid of it.</p><br/><p>After a short moment.</p><br/><p>The foreigners recovered from their state of shock. They didn\u2019t believe what they had done. However, they didn\u2019t regret it because the taste was simply unforgettable.</p><br/><p>They probably had to remember the taste for the rest of their lives.</p><br/><p>Then, they understood why Henry recommended this shop so much.</p><br/><p>They understood that the taste was worthy of three Michelin stars because it was made on a small pushcart. Furthermore, it overwhelmed the other factors.</p><br/><p>The foreigners looked at Lin Fan and Lin Fan looked at them. His calm look was deeply etched into their minds.</p><br/><p>The foreigners felt that Lin Fan wasn\u2019t a human. He was the God of delicious delicacies. He was the God that could make the simplest dishes taste like Heaven.</p><br/><p>Perhaps even the godly French chefs would have to kneel down in front of this God.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Everyone didn\u2019t know what had happened the previous day but they were shocked when they read the news.</p><br/><p>\u2018Breaking news!

This was the first time he had realized that earning money was so simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll transfer the money to your card later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Just donate this money. But don\u2019t put it under my name, make it anonymous.\u201d Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t accept the money. He had gotten it through improper means and he didn\u2019t want to use it.</p><br/><p>Money has to be earned by oneself in order for one to spend it happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, if that guy looks for you to cause trouble again, tell me. Don\u2019t bear it alone.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to see Wang Ming Yang being bullied like a kid. Moreover, since that Chu Shen was so capable, he definitely wouldn\u2019t surrender just like that. Hence, if a problem were really to arise, Lin Fan definitely wouldn\u2019t stand idly by.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. I have a plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan thought of a good idea. He took out his phone and opened Weibo. He looked for Huaizhou\u2019s Chu Family\u2019s organization and tagged them.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I bullied your family\u2019s son. You won\u2019t use your money to crush me, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was shifting the fault to himself so that Wang Ming Yang could relax.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang saw the post, he was startled. \u201cBrother, this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, it seemed as if he realized what it was and he sighed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just a small matter. I don\u2019t have much to do these days anyway. But could you hurry up with the research lab? I can\u2019t wait anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be done soon. I can\u2019t rush it. If I don\u2019t do it well, there\u2019ll be problems. Such stringent things have to be taken slowly,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang. He took the construction of the research lab very seriously. Hence, he was putting his heart into it and supervising the process in order to ensure that no shortcuts would be taken and no shoddy goods were used.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I was just asking. Next time, when you encounter such situations, don\u2019t back down. Just stay firm. If you can\u2019t handle it, you still have me,\u201d said Lin Fan as he patted Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cGot it. No need for you to tell me. Next time, I swear I\u2019ll fight to the death. If I can\u2019t handle it, you\u2019re up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, alright then. Tell me. Was I cool when I slapped him just now? Did it help you vent out some resentment?\u201d Lin Fan asked with a laugh. He was a peaceful person and he would usually use reason to win over others. However, today, he had violated the rule and committed an evil.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang placed a hand on Lin Fan and laughed out loud. He didn\u2019t say anything. As for whether he felt good, you could tell from his laughter.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan\u2019s post was uploaded, it instantly drew many people\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What is Master Lin talking about? I don\u2019t understand. And what\u2019s up with this Chu Family Organization? Is it a big company?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I\u2019m from Huaizhou. This Chu Family Organization is a super big organization over here. It\u2019s very powerful. And the boss of this Chu Family Organization is one of the top ten in the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s f*cking awesome. Then who is it who got beaten by Master Lin? Was it the son of the Chu Family Organization\u2019s boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that guy, Chu Shen. He\u2019s an exceptionally tyrannical fella. He\u2019s famous over here. If what Master Lin said is true, then it\u2019s probably this guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautifully done. This guy is an idiot. He actually went to look for Master Lin for trouble. He probably doesn\u2019t know how awesome Master Lin is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussions on the Internet were very intense.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the Chu Family Organization\u2019s Weibo manager saw this situation and was startled. He was stunned for a moment before he rushed over to inform the real Chief Chu, the true leader of their organization.</p><br/><p>In the conference room.</p><br/><p>Chu Min Cheng was laughing non stop as he chatted with the middle-aged woman next to him about some business matters as well as some of their experiences.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock!*</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Chu Min Cheng said, \u201cIt must be someone making a work report again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman.\u201d The secretary entered. But when he saw that someone was around, he didn\u2019t speak momentarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s something to say, say it.\u201d Chu Min Cheng was a little curious as to what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Chu, if it\u2019s not convenient, you can go to work first,\u201d said that middle-aged woman with a smile.</p><br/><p>Chu Min Cheng waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it. What exactly is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary nodded. \u201cChairman, Master Lin just posted on Weibo saying that he has beaten Chu Shen. Look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary hastily passed his phone over. When Chu Min Cheng heard the situation, his brows were raised. When he saw the Weibo post, his expression became stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kid has gone out to find trouble again.\u201d Chu Min Cheng was surprised. He seemed a little stunned. He knew about his own son. His son was pretty talented but his temper wasn\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may leave,\u201d said Chu Min Cheng with a wave of his hand.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman next to him thought for a moment before saying, \u201cElder Brother Chu, I think you should give Master Lin a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Chu Min Chen was surprised. Naturally, he knew who this Master Lin was and he admired this Master Lin for achieving so much at such a young age.</p><br/><p>However, calling to apologize was a bit of a stretch.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreviously, I was in Beijing for a period of time and I met my old friend, Chief Wu Yun Gang. He told me about this Master Lin.\u201d The middle-aged woman didn\u2019t hide anything. She revealed some information about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>When Chu Min Cheng heard it, he couldn\u2019t help but be astounded. \u201cThis Master Lin has such an impressive background?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman smiled and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about his background. He has a broad social network. And at the top of his network are people we cannot underestimate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I should really call him. However, I have to give that kid of mine a call first. I know about his temper. I\u2019ll make him come home obediently,\u201d said Chu Min Cheng.</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Eastern Han Organization, Chu Shen had been flipping out in the car, thinking about how to avenge himself.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang. When he saw that it was his friend, he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Chu, I heard that you were beaten by Master Lin.\u201d The voice on the other side of the call sounded very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d When Chu Shen heard that, he was shocked. Then, he quickly changed his words, \u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. So it really is true. Nobody had to tell me. Master Lin already posted it on Weibo. When I saw it, I knew it was you. D*mn. You actually went to find trouble with Master Lin. Don\u2019t you want to live anymore? That\u2019s a f*cking awesome person.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the fury in Chu Shen\u2019s heart burned furiously. <em>F*ck. This guy beat me and even posted it on Weibo for everyone to see.</em></p><br/><p><em>I really have to take revenge now.</em></p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>He saw that his father was calling.</p><br/><p>Then, he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back right now. Don\u2019t go looking for trouble outside all day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Shen was taken aback. \u201cDad, I was the one who was beaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Hurry back. Don\u2019t cause any more trouble. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be courteous with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Chu Shen was dazed. <em>Is this really my own f*cking father?</em></p><br/><p><em>Does he not care about his own son getting beaten?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

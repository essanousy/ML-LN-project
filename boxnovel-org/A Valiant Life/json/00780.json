Elder Dog, we love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy is really too brave. We\u2019re here for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters looked into a distance and their expressions slowly changed. They were clearly in disbelief.</p><br/><p>They had initially thought that although a dog could become very popular on the Internet, it wouldn\u2019t get too overboard. But now, they realized that they had been completely mistaken.</p><br/><p>Those townsfolk were clearly all charging towards Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>Those excited expressions on their faces were terrifying.</p><br/><p>The reporters were pushed aside.</p><br/><p>The fans ecstatically charged in front of Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog saw this, he jumped in fright and landed on the counter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof!\u201d</p><br/><p>He barked a few times, expressing that these fans were too ridiculous. \u201cAll of you, stand there obediently and don\u2019t do anything absurd!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa~ Elder Dog is so cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven his barks sound different from other dogs. He\u2019s really too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really like Elder Dog. I want to bring him home so badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog is really too adorable. I can\u2019t resist it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he was dumbfounded. Was this for real? Was there a need to be like that?</p><br/><p>This Master had done so many deeds and gotten on so many headlines but he had not come across such passionate fans. Now, just after doing one good deed, Elder Dog was receiving such treatment. Lin Fan felt that it didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>When the reporters saw this scene, they weren\u2019t willing to leave. They immediately started taking photos.</p><br/><p>They had found news for the next day.</p><br/><p>This was too much popularity for one dog. If they hadn\u2019t seen this for themselves, they might not have believed it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, this situation doesn\u2019t feel quite right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI can already tell that we won\u2019t get any peace today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian cried out in shock, \u201cF*ck, this doesn\u2019t make sense. How can this Elder Dog be so well-liked?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look at Fraud Tian and sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>Hadn\u2019t he already said? Sometimes, one shouldn\u2019t compare one\u2019s own life with a dog\u2019s. You would lose terribly.</p><br/><p>Time passed, until nighttime.</p><br/><p>The reporters and townsfolk gradually left. In the end, Lin Fan carried Elder Dog and headed home.</p><br/><p>No matter how much the remaining fans shouted for them to stay, Lin Fan could not stay any longer.</p><br/><p>These people were all crazy. At that moment, he had completely experienced the outburst of Elder Dog\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>His attractive force was simply too strong.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Heroic Dog\u2019s true identity is Master Lin\u2019s pet dog.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin teaches his pet to be righteous.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Cloud Street is filled with a vast crowd, hoping to get a look at Elder Dog.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Elder Dog Nicholas. An exceptionally dominant name.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The government might present Elder Dog with a Heroism Award.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When some of the celebrities saw the news, they were instantly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is up with people nowadays? How can a dog be on the trending headlines two days in a row? I\u2019ve done everything I can but I haven\u2019t even been on the trending headlines once!\u201d</p><br/><p>To many celebrities, such an occurrence didn\u2019t make sense. They were fighting viciously for the headlines but not, a dog that couldn\u2019t even talk had gotten on the headlines twice all of a sudden. It caused them to lose their tempers completely.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Now, I understand. Such a brave little dog could only be raised by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this name is really dominant. Elder Dog Nicholas. Who came up with it? Is there a need to be so awesome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already on the way to Cloud Street and it\u2019s all to see this Elder Dog in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always other people\u2019s dogs. Why is my dog so stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething big has happened over here. A mutt has entered the pet store. Those business people are actually using Elder Dog\u2019s name to boost their businesses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^You don\u2019t say. The dogs at the pet store near my place have had their names changed to Nicholas Number 2 and Nicholas Number 3. This has f*cking blown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The celebrity effect had appeared.</p><br/><p>Now, Elder Dog was very popular. Even businessmen had seen this as an opportunity and changed the names of the dogs in their pet stores. Moreover, many people were searching for white mutts.</p><br/><p>Initially, they hadn\u2019t thought much about this.</p><br/><p>But what astounded them was that many customers went into their stores and asked if they had any white mutts that looked like Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>Those owners of pet shops were all stunned and dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What was up with this market situation? Had something changed?</p><br/><p>If they wanted mutts, they could search at the dog meat shops or the streets. Who would be so crazy to buy a mutt?</p><br/><p>But after asking around, the shop owners discovered a means of becoming rich. They immediately went to the villages to buy large numbers of mutts.</p><br/><p>One white mutt for 888 dollars. And that was already the cheapest price.</p><br/><p>For purebred white mutts, the price reached 8888 dollars.</p><br/><p>Initially, they had thought that no one would buy them. However, unexpectedly, there really were idiots who bought them.</p><br/><p>This incident had caused the market for pets to completely blow up.</p><br/><p>And the status of mutts had suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>These dogs, that were like beggars in the past, had suddenly become the symbol of nobility.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a sigh of relief. Finally, no one else came.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, no one came in the morning, right?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Even I\u2019m a little scared. These people are too crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said enviously, \u201cThe Internet is saying that Elder Dog is going to receive a Heroism Award. Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cHow could that be true? There\u2019s no such thing. That\u2019s just the reporters blindly reporting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Fraud Tian nodded, \u201cIf Elder Dog really gets an award, then my life would have been lesser than a dog\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan regarded this problem heavily as well.</p><br/><p>That was the truth. Fraud Tian really might not have been able to compare to Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan definitely couldn\u2019t say it. Otherwise, Fraud Tian would be really hurt.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Before he had relaxed for long, something unpleasant happened.</p><br/><p>A group of girls ran over hurriedly from afar. \u201cElder Dog is in this shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>That group of girls was a bunch of office workers. They really liked puppies. Especially after seeing Elder Dog, they had become mesmerized. Hence, despite the original route to their workplace not passing here, they changed it so that they could come over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can we take a look at Elder Dog?\u201d asked a little lady cautiously.</p><br/><p>What else could Lin Fan say? \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the group of girls squatted down and started patting Elder Dog, who was lying on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so good-looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Elder Dog\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog really enjoyed this situation. He squinted his eyes and let the girls touch him as they liked.</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian saw all these young ladies, he couldn\u2019t help but step forward. \u201cLittle ladies, the puppy is good-looking, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, he\u2019s good-looking.\u201d The girls nodded.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled, \u201cIf you ever want to come to see him next time, feel free. Why don\u2019t you leave a WeChat ID or something so I can send you all pictures of Elder Dog\u2019s life in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! We need to go to work and we won\u2019t be able to come see him frequently.\u201d The girls didn\u2019t think much of it and just gave Fraud Tian their WeChat IDs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at this scene and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but think about something.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, many young people couldn\u2019t even raise themselves, yet, they would raise cute little dogs. They would carry their dogs everywhere they went. These people probably did these so they could attract girls.</p><br/><p>Thinking about Fraud Tian\u2019s age, Lin Fan felt that he was f*cking shameless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

However, he wasn\u2019t really upset about it. It was because he was becoming a valuable person.</p><br/><p>Sigh, being too awesome seemed like a sin.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was cleaning the shop and when she saw Brother Lin\u2019s expression. She smiled, \u201cBrother Lin, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cLook, my artworks are worth so much money now. Do you think I\u2019ll be in danger if I go out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be in danger but I know a lot of people will be coming to request artworks from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give it to them,\u201d replied Lin Fan. The artworks were valuable because of how limited they were. If he was to draw a few hundreds or thousands of artworks, they wouldn\u2019t be valuable anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right, let\u2019s go and do some gardening with the children from the welfare institute. What do you think of that?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>He was a little emotional from thinking about the sixteenth page of knowledge. It was a meaningful task and it was better than the other tasks.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Wu You Lan answered without any hesitation. It didn\u2019t matter where it was, as long as she could be with Brother Lin, it would be good enough.</p><br/><p>Then, the aroma of a perfume could be smelled. A beautiful silhouette appeared at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Brother Lin, I\u2019m back!\u201d Wu Huan Yue stood at the door and smiled. She looked like a fairy. Ever since she had gotten into the entertainment industry, she had gradually changed her image. One look at her and anyone would know that she was a celebrity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Huan Yue, why are you back?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. Then, he smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re really busy now. I don\u2019t even get to see you once in a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stuck out her tongue, \u201cBrother Lin, I applied for leave and I came here the moment I was free.\u201d Then, she looked at Wu You Lan, \u201cSister You Lan, did you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their relationship was decent but when it involved Lin Fan, both of them were merciless. Whoever could win his heart would be more capable. Hence, they interacted normally like sisters but when Lin Fan was involved, things were different.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was helpless. Why did this gooseberry return? Hadn\u2019t she said that she would be busier after becoming a celebrity? It didn\u2019t seem like that was the case.</p><br/><p>Then, Wu You Lan went behind Lin Fan and placed both of her hands on his shoulders. She smiled, \u201cOf course, I missed you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, Wu Huan Yue was enraged at the intimate action.</p><br/><p>However, Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t just give up on him.</p><br/><p>After being in the entertainment industry, she had seen a lot of good-looking males and females but they couldn\u2019t compare to Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>She belonged to Wang Ming Yang\u2019s company and she had a good relationship with Lin Fan. Hence, Wang Ming Yang protected her and didn\u2019t let anything happen to her.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had a good figure and well-defined features. She was like a fairy on earth. A lot of people were attracted to her and tried to win her heart but nobody succeeded. Wu Huan Yue behaved herself and didn\u2019t involve herself with any other males. She just wanted to do her job well and meet Lin Fan during her leaves.</p><br/><p>She was worried that Brother Lin would be taken away by Wu You Lan if she didn\u2019t see him for a long time.</p><br/><p>After all, they were both ruthless \u2018killers\u2019.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they were in a fair competition now. They had to do something to win his heart. Thankfully, Brother Lin didn\u2019t really have other girls around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, quickly sign here for me,\u201d Fraud Tian said as he passed her a pen and paper. \u201cYou\u2019re a celebrity now. It\u2019s difficult to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled sweetly and signed the paper. The signature was beautiful and it was obvious that someone must have designed it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian kept the autograph happily and took her suitcase, \u201cCome in quickly, you\u2019re a big celebrity now. If you are seen by the others, they\u2019d definitely surround this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang took out his phone and took some pictures of Wu Huan Yue. He wanted to post them on Weibo to gain some face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cHuan Yue, how\u2019s your work? Is it tiring?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue felt a sweet sensation in her heart after seeing how Brother Lin cared for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tiring, absolutely exhausting. However, now that I have time to spend with Brother Lin, I\u2019m not exhausted anymore,\u201d Wu Huan Yue smiled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head, \u201cYou speak differently now after being out there for a while. You have the gift of a gab.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue sat on the sofa and straightened her legs. \u201cBrother Lin, you don\u2019t know how many senior celebrities there are. I can\u2019t say the wrong thing, hence, I\u2019ve always been taking note of what I say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change yourself on purpose. What\u2019s wrong with saying the wrong things? We\u2019re still here for you, right?\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He knew that it was difficult to socialize in the industry. There were a lot of people that bootlicked. Although Wu Huan Yue was famous, she was still considered a young celebrity in front of the other senior celebrities.</p><br/><p>For example, in front of that Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had to treat her like a senior celebrity whenever she saw her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, I read an article about you that time. You participated in an award ceremony. Why didn\u2019t you greet Ying Jin? The internet said you didn\u2019t know how to respect seniors,\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue\u2019s face shrunk in anger. \u201cBrother Lin, didn\u2019t you have a conflict with her? I don\u2019t want to interact with her. I don\u2019t care about what the others say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t give you the songs in vain. Don\u2019t give this b*tch any face the next time you see her. You can look for me if she gives you any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled and nodded, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try that next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting for a while longer, Lin Fan realized that You Lan didn\u2019t seem too happy. However, nothing had happened. Why was You Lan acting like that?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had been standing behind Lin Fan and she felt a little upset because Wu Huan Yue had a successful career and was a popular celebrity.</p><br/><p>Then, a saying on the internet resonated with her. She read that women with successful careers were the most attractive. However, she didn\u2019t have a career and she had to stay in the shop. Although she could be with Brother Lin, she wasn\u2019t as attractive as Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head, \u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the time and it was pretty late.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan stood up. \u201cAlright, everyone, let\u2019s have dinner to welcome Huan Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>They found a random restaurant nearby and everyone gathered to eat.</p><br/><p>At the restaurant.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan stepped out of the toilet, he saw You Lan standing there in a daze. He asked, \u201cWhy are you standing there and daydreaming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just thinking about something,\u201d Wu You Lan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think too much about it and he replied, \u201cAlright, quickly go back in. Everyone\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wu You Lan nodded. She wanted to ask something but decided not to.</p></div>\n</div>"}

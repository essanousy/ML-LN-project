He had to return his debt since there was no reason to drag it out.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he wasn\u2019t stupid. Of course, he knew that Elder Zheng wanted very badly to have one of his paintings. Now that he was in Beijing, why not do a painting for Elder Zheng? After all, making a painting, to Lin Fan, was a simple task.</p><br/><p>By drawing a single painting, he could cause Elder Zheng to be delighted. Lin Fan thought that this was definitely worth it.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang chuckled. He liked the environment here very much as well. If he wasn\u2019t Elder Zheng\u2019s security guard, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to enter this place.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>They reached the destination.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang hurriedly got off the car and opened the door for Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019re here. Please get off the car. When Elder Zheng heard that you were coming, his mood became very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. This Elder Zheng\u2019s mood had to be pretty good. After knowing that Lin Fan was going to draw him a painting, how could he not be happy?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin.\u201d At that moment, Elder Zheng stood in the doorway. When he saw Lin Fan, he waved happily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved back, then went forward and said, \u201cThank you so much for yesterday. If it wasn\u2019t for your help, the situation wouldn\u2019t have been resolved so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Elder Zheng\u2019s thick palm patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. He said, \u201cElder Lin, we\u2019re all friends here. That was just a small matter. No need to think so much of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew about Elder Zheng\u2019s personality and didn\u2019t say much after. That kind of matter, even to Wu Yun Gang, had been troublesome. But to Elder Zheng, it was a simple matter indeed.</p><br/><p>It was the smallest of small matters. It may not even be considered a matter at all.</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s arrival made Elder Zheng very happy. A wide smile was spread across his face. He hadn\u2019t told anyone about this. To Elder Zheng, Master Lin now belonged to him. If he called anyone else over, who knew what would happen? If he didn\u2019t get a painting, then it would be a great loss.</p><br/><p>As the President of the Chinese Arts Association, even though he was considered to be the biggest leader, he wasn\u2019t a very prestigious President. If he was, he would\u2019ve gotten a painting by now.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi, in particular, showed off so much that he almost couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the surroundings in the house. There were numerous Chinese paintings and calligraphy works hung on the walls. With one look, he could tell that all these were probably made by masters and had a pretty high market price. But to people like Elder Zheng, judging these paintings by price was very crude.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, come here and take a look. This is my collection and some paintings that were given to me by my old friends. Now, I can only see these paintings and think of them. Sigh, humans are such fragile creatures,\u201d said Elder Zheng with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. Elder Zheng\u2019s collection was shocking. It was really extraordinary. If another collector came to take a look at this scene, his jaw would drop.</p><br/><p>The young man and the old man chatted together. Most of what they talked about was related to Chinese arts.</p><br/><p>When one reaches a certain age, he or she stops caring about other things and only focuses on bettering oneself.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Master Lin, about last night, I\u2019ve already told Lil\u2019 Wang to communicate with those people\u2019s elders. Your friend can rest easy now. He won\u2019t receive any retaliation in Beijing,\u201d said Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thanked him, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled as he waved his hand, \u201cI already said don\u2019t mention it. We have to commit to what we do, especially in this kind of situations. If we don\u2019t settle it completely, there might be hidden complications.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. He agreed with this statement very much.</p><br/><p>They made their way to the study room.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng\u2019s room was old-fashioned and had an aroma to it. When one entered, one could feel a peaceful atmosphere. In such an atmosphere, Elder Zheng\u2019s heart could become quiet, so he could start creating paintings.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went in front of the drawing table. \u201cElder Zheng, today, I shall display my lowly skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng instantly laughed, \u201cElder Lin, your skills aren\u2019t lowly at all. It\u2019s not good to be too humble. Your paintings can honestly be said to be the best in our Chinese Arts Association. You don\u2019t know this but those old guys at the dinner last night hold your paintings in high esteem. Each of them wanted to request a piece but if even I didn\u2019t have one yet, how could they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head as he smiled. How could Lin Fan not know what Elder Zheng was thinking? This time he came, Elder Zheng was so excited, of course, it was because he knew that he was going to get a painting.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much. Elder Zheng had indeed helped him with a big favor, so Lin Fan had to thank him properly. Since Elder Zheng though so highly of his paintings, Lin Fan was going to do one for him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan held the brush and paused for a moment. He was thinking of what he should draw.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Elder Zheng stood there without disturbing Lin Fan. He didn\u2019t want his words to disrupt Lin Fan\u2019s train of thoughts.</p><br/><p>After a certain period of time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put down the brush, then took a deep breath. He looked at the artwork in front of him and nodded contentedly. \u201cElder Zheng, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, he had drawn for a relatively long time. However, Lin Fan was also a little shocked by Elder Zheng\u2019s way of doing things. This canvas was quite big, so the amount of content drawn was quite great. This Elder Zheng had probably already prepared the tools long before he knew that Lin Fan was coming. He even got a bigger canvas on purpose. It was at least twice the size of the paintings that Lin Fan had made for Yue Qiu Ju Shi. Needless to say, as a person grows old with experience, his methods of doing things get deeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good, good\u2026\u201d When Elder Zheng saw this painting, he cried out in excitement thrice.</p><br/><p>Then, he impatiently went in front of the artwork and studied it closely. The more he looked at it, the more he liked it. It was as if he was immersed in the scene inside the painting and he couldn\u2019t remove himself from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a child\u2019s voice came from downstairs.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was looking at the artwork in front of him and completely neglected this voice as if he didn\u2019t even hear it. He didn\u2019t bother about it at all as he was completely engrossed.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard the voice, he said, \u201cElder Zheng, someone is calling you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Elder Zheng came back to his senses, then heard his grandson calling him once more. He instantly smiled and said, \u201cMy wife brought my grandson out for a stroll. Looks like they\u2019re back. This painting must be properly appreciated but now isn\u2019t the right time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Zheng slowly placed the painting nicely. Since it had just been painted, the ink was still wet and he couldn\u2019t keep it yet. He just placed it outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Elder Lin. With this painting, I am satisfied.\u201d Elder Zheng no longer had any desires. With this painting in his possession, what else could he say? \u201cLet\u2019s go downstairs, Elder Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Lin Fan saw Elder Zheng\u2019s wife. She seemed like a peaceful old lady. When she saw Lin Fan, she was clearly a little startled because it was the first time she had seen her husband bring a young man home.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng went forward and said, \u201cXiu Fang, this is Elder Lin, a new member of our association. However, don\u2019t judge him by his age. Even at such an age, his art skills are extraordinary. He just drew a painting for me upstairs. I\u2019ll bring you up to see it later. It will definitely open up your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being praised by Elder Zheng like that, Lin Fan was a little embarrassed. However, he could still accept it.</p><br/><p>Because it was the truth. There was nothing wrong with what he had said.</p><br/><p>However, when Lin Fan saw Elder Zheng\u2019s grandson, his expression changed slightly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

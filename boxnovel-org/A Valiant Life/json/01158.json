She\u2019s waiting for us outside already. Once we pass through customs, we\u2019ll be able to see her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu, who hadn\u2019t spoken throughout the journey, now spoke, \u201cMaster Lin really has broad connections. You have friends across the country. And they\u2019re all women too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, are you jealous?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. He couldn\u2019t help it. Sometimes, even being too popular was an offense.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Liu Xu. She let out a deep breath. It was a pretty good choice to come out for a vacation.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was even more eye-catching than Wu You Lan. After all, in terms of aura and presence, Liu Xu was the ideal goddess for many men.</p><br/><p>However, this goddess was with quite a peculiar group of people.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s flashy look, in particular, was very astonishing. Everyone was dumbfounded as they looked at him. His clothes were overly-fashionable.</p><br/><p>But Fraud Tian was not disturbed by everyone\u2019s stares. To him, these people were in awe of him.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was a little nervous. She was about to see Lin Fan and she didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, you\u2019re being a bit ridiculous, aren\u2019t you? It\u2019s just a man, why are you so nervous?\u201d Jin Meng looked at her best friend in surprise. <em>What kind of man could make Xue Yao act this way?</em></p><br/><p>She really wanted to see just what kind of man Lin Fan was.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t believe that someone could be so incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin.\u201d At that moment, Xue Yao saw a group of people come out from the airport and she immediately waved.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng followed her forward as well. She eyes quickly swept across the group of them. She eliminated the flashy old man and the vulgar-looking man who was holding the phone. Then, she identified the man, who was sandwiched in between two ladies, as her best friend\u2019s target.</p><br/><p>However, when she saw the two ladies by his side, her brows furrowed as she grumbled in his heart. <em>Could this man be a player? He actually has two beautiful ladies with him.</em></p><br/><p><em>And he even brought them to Haojiang. This situation is a little complicated. We have to be careful.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw Yun Xue Yao and waved back. He hadn\u2019t expected her to be waiting for them here.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao rushed forward. With a bright smile, she said, \u201cBrother Lin, You Lan, Sister Liu, welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said from the side, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw Fraud Tian, she was suddenly stunned. It was as if she didn\u2019t recognize him. \u201cYou\u2026 You are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Fraud Tian! Didn\u2019t we eat together the last time? You even said that you would introduce your friends to me!\u201d said Fraud Tian anxiously. He was now a little worried about his love life. He was already so old and he still didn\u2019t have a child. Who was going to carry on his name? Hence, he was definitely anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud Tian! I didn\u2019t recognize you. You\u2019re dressed so\u2026\u201d Yun Xue Yao couldn\u2019t believe it. She hadn\u2019t expected that Fraud Tian would dress like this.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian touched his glossy swept-back hair and couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cI look fashionable, don\u2019t I? Don\u2019t you feel that I\u2019ve changed a lot? This style is pretty good. When I came here, there were countless people looking at me and even taking photos of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was dumbfounded. She wondered what kind of misfortune had befallen on Fraud Tian to make him change so much.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about that for now. Let\u2019s go to a hotel and put down our things first. This time, we\u2019re all here to have some fun in Haojiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, what made Lin Fan curious was that the lady next to Yun Xue Yao kept staring at him. Out of politeness, he smiled at her.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao came to her senses and said, \u201cBrother Lin, let me introduce you. This is my friend and confidante, Jin Meng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng didn\u2019t hide anything. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the Master Lin that my Xue Yao yearns for. You look pretty normal, I didn\u2019t expect that you would be able to make my Xue Yao fall head over heels for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMMM MMM!\u201d</p><br/><p>After those words were said, Yun Xue Yao immediately covered Jin Meng\u2019s mouth. Then, she smiled awkwardly. \u201cBrother Lin, let me bring you all to the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by those words. Then, he nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Haojiang, when Yun Xue Yao came outside, there would naturally be bodyguards accompanying her.</p><br/><p>One car wasn\u2019t enough for all of them, so they had two cars.</p><br/><p>And Jin Meng was alone, driving one of the cars.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Zhao Zhong Yang and said, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m just seeing how Haojiang is. D*mn. I knew that this Yun Xue Yao wasn\u2019t simple but I didn\u2019t expect that she would even have bodyguards\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? She\u2019s an important lady. What kind of person did you think she was?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone boarded the cars and they set off. This was Yun Xue Yao\u2019s territory, so Lin Fan and the rest didn\u2019t have to think much. They just had to follow her lead.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng drove the car alone. She was very curious as she wondered why Xue Yao liked this man.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>At that moment, her phone rang. When she saw the display, she smiled. Then, she answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if it isn\u2019t our young master. What is it? What\u2019s up?\u201d asked Jin Meng with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Meng, don\u2019t be like that. I want to ask you about something. What is Xue Yao doing?\u201d Over the phone, a man\u2019s voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>It was the young master of another family in Haojiang and he was quite a powerful individual.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao is with the man of her dreams. You don\u2019t even need to think about it,\u201d said Jin Meng. She knew that this guy had always been chasing Xue Yao but she felt that it was impossible. He was too playful and he was a show-off. He was clearly not reliable. If it hadn\u2019t been for his status, she wouldn\u2019t even have answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Who is it? Who is Xue Yao with? Who dares to touch the woman of my dreams?\u201d Ma Shao Hao was furious. One could sense his rage through the phone.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng said, \u201cYoung Master Ma, I think you should forget about it. You can\u2019t afford to mess up with this person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be joking. Who is there that I can\u2019t mess with in Haojiang? Tell me. Who is he? I have to have a good chat with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Meng replied, \u201cHe\u2019s not from Haojiang, he\u2019s from Shanghai. Have you heard of Master Lin? If you haven\u2019t, go on the Internet and do a search. Let me tell you that even though Master Lin doesn\u2019t have authority or money, he\u2019s very powerful. If you offend him, you will be in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao laughed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have money or authority but you\u2019re saying that I can\u2019t offend him? I want to see just what kind of background he has. Don\u2019t hang up. I\u2019ll go and search him up right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Meng shook her head and chuckled. She felt that this Ma Shao Hao was too inexperienced. After a long time, she still didn\u2019t hear anything from Ma Shao Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Ma, why aren\u2019t you saying anything? Have you seen it yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a voice came through the phone. \u201cThis guy is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you think I was joking with you? This kind of person might not have money or authority but he definitely mustn\u2019t be messed with. Moreover, there are some things you don\u2019t even know about. Let\u2019s leave it at that. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

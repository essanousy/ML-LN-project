I\u2019ll just watch you all have fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had just come back from Shanghai a while ago. He got to know Master Lin from Shanghai. What Master Lin said at the end of the banquet is something that would forever be engraved in the memory of Young Chang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter getting back, you are not to participate in any form of dangerous activities for seven days, or else something bad will happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>According to his normal frame of mind, he wouldn\u2019t believe it. However, the thing is that Master Lin gave him a mysterious feeling. Such a feeling was profound. Those words were always in his head and were impossible to get rid of.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Chang Hai Ge, what\u2019s gotten into you lately? You\u2019re not playing anything with us. Could it be that you\u2019re scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge didn\u2019t answer him. He didn\u2019t even know how to explain it. In their circle, it would be very embarrassing if they were to be scared of anything.</p><br/><p>Young Shen, who was by his side, opened his mouth and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that Young Chang is scared. But during the time when he was in Shanghai, he met a nobleman. This nobleman said that, when he got back here, he should not participate in any dangerous activities for a week, or else something would happen. It\u2019s already the sixth day. Everything would be fine after tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went to Shanghai with Young Chang, therefore he knew about the situation. Although he also did not believe his words, he still advised Young Chang to not be rash, since it was only a week. It would pass by with a blink of an eye. He didn\u2019t know what would happen if he did participate, but what if something really happened? What would he do?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, this man laughed out loud, then proceeded to face his surroundings and shouted, \u201cLook at this! This time, when Chang Hai Ge went to Shanghai, he got scared silly! He still bloody believes it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding ladies and gentlemen all gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Bing, what happened? What happened to Elder Chang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Bing mocked, \u201cI just issued them a challenge to race, and do you know what their response was? He said that he met a nobleman in Shanghai. This nobleman said that after returning to the Capital, he can\u2019t take part in any dangerous activities for a week, or else something bad would happen. Never would I have imagined that he would believe this. What do you all say, what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they all laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge replied awkwardly, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh. You all haven\u2019t met him. If you were to meet him, you wouldn\u2019t be laughing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect that they would mock him. This made him very unhappy.</p><br/><p>He had to be responsible for his own life. Who cares if it was real or fake? Since he chose to believe it, then he shouldn\u2019t play around.</p><br/><p>But he was rather proud and arrogant. Whenever he would be mocked by his friends, he would feel extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Chang Hai Ge said in a serious tone, \u201cEverybody! Stop laughing. It\u2019s not that I am gutless. I\u2019m just taking responsibility for my own life. Do you all understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentlemen beside him shook their heads. If such an explanation had any use, these people wouldn\u2019t be themselves.</p><br/><p>As expected.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge explained. The crowd couldn\u2019t help but hold back their laughter, \u201cYes, yes. What Young Chang said is what it is. It\u2019s not that you are gutless, but it\u2019s because you care about taking responsibility for your own life. Hence, we shouldn\u2019t make fun of Young Chang anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMakes sense. This isn\u2019t a bad excuse. I can make use of it next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh dear! I can\u2019t join you to get high today! A nobleman told me that if I were to get high, I would die from it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Young Chang knows Young Master Zhou. He would get a fast progression in his career. However, we don\u2019t know him. We wouldn\u2019t be able to progress as quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time Young Chang went to Shanghai to have fun with two celebrities. He knew to bring along Young Shen but not us. It\u2019s evident he doesn\u2019t really care about us anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it that those surrounding him were unhappy with him or were they trying to use psychological methods to piss him off?</p><br/><p>To them, the more the situation was undoable, the more they had to watch it.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai He had already said, within seven days, he cannot participate in any dangerous activities, yet they didn\u2019t believe it and insisted that he broke this lie.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d Chang Hai Ge was speechless, \u201cWhat do you guys mean? Since when have I ever looked down on you all? Why can\u2019t you all understand a brother? The nobleman already said it, so why can\u2019t you all believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Bing waved his hand, \u201cForget it! Young Chang has already made his mind up, what else can we do? Let\u2019s go play on our own. Let\u2019s not make Young Chang unhappy, or else Young Master Zou would come and teach us a lesson. Then we would really be unlucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck! Are you doing this on purpose, Zhou Bing? I\u2019ve already told you, I can\u2019t join you guys during this seven days! After these seven days, I can play with you for as long as you want!\u201d Chang Hai Ge was getting anxious.</p><br/><p>He was unable to tolerate his friends misunderstanding him.</p><br/><p>However, he just didn\u2019t know why they wouldn\u2019t believe him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Bing said, \u201cNo. I trust you. How can I be doing this on purpose? Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd replied, \u201cYes! How can we be doing it on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go play on our own!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge frowned. He was beginning to feel apprehensive. He gritted his teeth, \u201cF*ck! Enough! I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll join you guys to play. Don\u2019t say I\u2019m not enough of a brother, just because I know Young Master Zou doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t recognize you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the crowd burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s the way! Who cares about what nobleman. That\u2019s all just a blind scam.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the awesome and aggressive Young Chang that we all know. We didn\u2019t recognize the previous timid Young Chang.</p><br/><p>Young Shen looked at Young Chang, \u201cAre you really going to play? Are you not going to trust Master Lin\u2019s words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge replied, \u201cWhat can I do? Just let them slander me? No worries. I\u2019ll just play for awhile, then I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that it\u2019s best you don\u2019t play. You also believed in Master Lin\u2019s words. But now you\u2019re against it. What if something really were to happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Shen, Young Chang has already agreed to join us. Why are you still trying to advise against him? If you don\u2019t dare, just stand to one side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge waved his hand, \u201cNo more bullsh*t. If you guys want to begin, then let\u2019s begin. Today, I\u2019ll let you guys know what happens when you provoke me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd laughed, \u201cHaha! Then come at us! Let\u2019s see who\u2019s more impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of people got on the cars.</p><br/><p>After Chang Hai Ge got into his car, he specially checked his car to make sure that everything was safe. He put on his seatbelt and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Once ready, let\u2019s begin!</p><br/><p>Start!</p><br/><p>Waves of thunderous engine sounds could be heard.</p><br/><p>One by one, each car disappeared from the starting point.</p><br/><p>Young Shen was very worried, \u201cNothing is going to happen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge, who was already immersed in the speed of things, had completely forgotten about Master Lin\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>With an unyielding spirit in his heart, all he could think of was to drive faster, faster!</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge sneered, \u201cPeasants thinking you can overtake me. Dream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Young Chang is driving so fast, he even shook off Zhou Bing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be joking. Young Chang is a professional racer. He is fully deserving of the title Qingtian Bay Racing God, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Shen slowly became less and less worried. Looking at the situation, it seems like nothing is going to happen.</p><br/><p>*Bang!*</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud sound could be heard from the distance.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sound came from the walkie-talkie.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s happened to Young Chang\u2019s car!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Young Chang\u2019s car got smashed by a tree. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s the situation like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Where did the tree come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Shen\u2019s expression changed entirely to one of shock and fear.</p><br/><p>How is this possible?</p><br/><p>How could something happen so quickly?</p><br/><p>At the accident site.</p><br/><p>One of the racecars had been smashed by a tree.</p><br/><p>The crowd rushed to the site. Their entire body was shivering and was feeling fearful.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Chang, are you okay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Chang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a horrifying scream came from inside the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and save me! My leg is being pressed on. It hurts badly! I already f*cking told you guys, something bad would happen to me. But you guys didn\u2019t trust me. Now, do you trust me? F*ck! Hurry up and save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Roaring sounds came from inside the car. The crowd could only look at each other in dismay. Their faces were all filled with shock.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect that something would really happen.</p><br/><p>This was simply too terrifying.</p></div>\n</div>"}

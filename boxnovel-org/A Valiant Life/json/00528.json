There was no need to sell scallion pancakes and Lin Fan could hide from Brother Qiang Qiang. It was a plan that could only be thought up by someone with very high IQ.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was pleased with himself. Besides himself, who else could think of such a plan?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wang Ming Yang arrived for some reason.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed the large crab\u2019s claw. It was very fragrant. When he saw Wang Ming Yang, he said happily, \u201cHey, why are you here? Come here, quick. I ordered a few large crabs and I can\u2019t finish them on my own. Come, let\u2019s eat together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had looked for numerous connections because of Lin Fan\u2019s situation. He had even hired lawyers but the lawyers all said that this matter had too great of an impact and it would be very difficult to win his case. The most they could do was get a lighter sentence but even getting a lighter sentence depended on the situation. They said it was impossible to have a prison sentence of fewer than three years.</p><br/><p>When he had heard them say three years, he thought that it couldn\u2019t be. He didn\u2019t even want Lin Fan to be in prison for a single day.</p><br/><p>But now that he saw Lin Fan sitting there, delightedly eating crabs, he was dumbfounded. Since when did the local police station\u2019s treatment become so good? He could even order food?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked his eyes and replied, \u201cWhat is it? Has something happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was speechless. \u201cWe\u2019re all outside, worrying about you, while you\u2019re in here eating like a king. What the heck is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m just having a change of scenery. You see, my attitude hasn\u2019t been quite right lately. I\u2019m getting a little complacent. Being complacent isn\u2019t scary but being overly complacent is scary. Oh right, do you want some crab? These are Yangcheng Lake Large Crabs, they\u2019re chewy,\u201d said Lin Fan cheerily.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stood there stupidly. There was a tinge of sorrow in his eyes. He couldn\u2019t quite understand this brother of his anymore. What the heck was he doing? Anyone with a normal brain wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a prison.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath to regain his composure. \u201cTell me, how long will you be locked up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was chewing on the crab leg. \u201cOne month. I requested it on my own. I committed a crime so I have to receive a fair judgment. Oh right, do you want to eat some crab?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going back to rest,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t try to make him stay. \u201cAlright then. Call me if there\u2019s anything. My phone is with me. Oh right, bring me some furniture. I didn\u2019t prepare anything before I came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded slowly, \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang came out.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to say a single word now. He thought to himself, \u201cCan somebody tell me, is this even being imprisoned? Is he here to enjoy a vacation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wu Huan Yue and the rest called.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang only said one line, \u201cNo need to worry.\u201d That guy was more comfortable than anyone else. And he had caused them go running around everywhere, worried beyond measure. Now, Wang Ming Yang had seen him. He was without a single problem and incomparably happy.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian kept accompanying Lin Fan. He couldn\u2019t quite understand Master Lin. Just how did that brain of his work? What kind of brain did he have to come up with such ideas?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swept it all clean and all the crabs were gone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gracefully wiped his mouth and said happily, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to the detainment room.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this case, of course, he didn\u2019t need to go to the prison. He was just going to the detention house.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian didn\u2019t say anything else. His feelings were complicated.</p><br/><p>The matter had been resolved. The big shots had come out personally but this matter didn\u2019t need to be publicly announced at the moment. After all, this situation wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The Internet was abuzz.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a day already. Why isn\u2019t there any news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these reporters even capable? It\u2019s been so long but there hasn\u2019t been even a bit of substantial news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Master Lin is being bullied inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you dreaming? How could Master Lin be bullied?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I love it. This kind of person is too absurd and he deserves to be captured and locked up. Let me give you some information. For people who commit such a crime, a year in prison is the least. And I must tell you that our country has a rule that in such a case, regardless of the situation, he must be dealt with severely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^you can f*ck off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Master Lin is definitely fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The detention house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up. He felt the brand-new bed sheet under his body and a wide smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Although the place was small, it had everything he needed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang really carried things out reliably. These were all high-end furniture.</p><br/><p>Gazing up at the little iron window, he suddenly felt like singing \u2018Tears behind the iron window\u2019.</p><br/><p>How pitiful.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt sets of gazes nearby shift over to him.</p><br/><p>He saw other people squatting down in their respective cells, gazing longingly at Lin Fan. At the same time, they had looks of surprise on their faces.</p><br/><p>Some of them had been here for several months.</p><br/><p>Some of them, almost a year.</p><br/><p>When have they ever seen something like this?</p><br/><p>Was this guy even in prison? Why did it seem like he was just living in a rental room where he didn\u2019t have to pay any rent?</p><br/><p>Did law even still exist?</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been three days. Why is there still no news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Does anyone know what\u2019s going on and could you tell us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master Lin, for getting my family\u2019s savings back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin exposed those scammers. All the money we\u2019ve been scammed of have been taken back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, Master Lin needs our help. He\u2019s definitely suffering in there. We need to cause a dispute to get Master Lin out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m going to several big forums to post right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, numerous citizens went to various big web forums and message boards to begin announcing it. They were all in approval of what Master Lin did and they felt that he had done a great deed. To them, Master Lin was a hero.</p><br/><p>Now that the hero had been locked up and they could only watch, they couldn\u2019t stand it. They had to do all they could on Weibo to help out Master Lin.</p><br/><p>At that moment, several exaggerated posts appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin has been caught and there is no news yet. He might be facing cruel punishment to extort a confession.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Our hero is suffering and we cannot just sit idly by. We have to rescue Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Requesting a lenient sentence\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang stood far away, looking at the Master Lin shop. She looked as if something was wrong.</p><br/><p>That godly doctor actually got captured.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the godly doctor had suffered a tragic incident, she was naturally very happy. However, her situation could only be resolved by the godly doctor. Now that the godly doctor had been locked up, what would she do?</p><br/><p>She had to go and find out the exact situation.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stood at the entrance, sighing. When Brother Lin wasn\u2019t around, the shop was much colder and less cheerful. Then, a crisp voice rang from her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know when Master Lin will be back?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan saw that someone had come, she was a little startled. She couldn\u2019t help but gasp in her heart, what a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian saw her, he couldn\u2019t help but feel that she looked a little familiar as if he had seen her somewhere before.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \u201cMay I know who you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang gave a short laugh. She was delighted. This young and gorgeous lady gave off a feeling of someone who needed protection. \u201cMy name is Liu Xu. I\u2019m looking for Master Lin to treat my illness. Do you know when Master Lin will be back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head with a sorrowful look. \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang now had an idea about Wu You Lan. She made an \u2018Oh\u2019 sound, then said, \u201cCan I add you on WeChat? I\u2019m from Jiangning and I have no friends or relatives around here. If I find something that I\u2019m unsure about, I think you would be happy to help, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a beautiful lady to meet another beautiful lady, it was only natural to have a good feeling about each other.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu had a very beautiful smile. Adding each other on WeChat was the first step to success.</p></div>\n</div>"}

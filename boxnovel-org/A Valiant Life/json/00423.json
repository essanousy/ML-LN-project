He felt that it was a little unbelievable.</p><br/><p>It was Jin Xuan Ming, a Korean celebrity that had gotten famous recently.</p><br/><p>Why had Master Lin and Wang Ming Yang gotten into a fight with this person? Furthermore, he hadn\u2019t shown any mercy at all. Then, he went to ask the airport medical staff and found out that Jin Xuan Ming had just broken a rib. He heaved a sigh of relief and tried to find out more about what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, he deserves to be beaten up. He actually dared to scold Master Lin,\u201d Wu Yun Gang chided. However, he had to think of a way to bail Wang Ming Yang and Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If it had been an ordinary citizen, it\u2019d be an easier task. However, it was a celebrity.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that Master Lin and Wang Ming Yang wouldn\u2019t have done that to an ordinary citizen. He knew from past experience that they only messed with influential figures.</p><br/><p>But this man wasn\u2019t a local celebrity. He was probably there to dupe all the local fans of their money before returning back to his country. It was probably just an act.</p><br/><p>In the police officers\u2019 vehicle.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just hit his face? It\u2019s better than breaking a rib.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked, \u201cSir, how will we be sentenced?\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader of the team was impressed by them. He said, \u201cIt has to be done according to what has happened. However, it will likely be handled as a normal public security case. You will be detained for fifteen days with a fine of $500. If it was a more serious injury, you\u2019d be charged with injuring him on purpose. This would result in a jail sentence of not more than three years. However, it\u2019s considered to be a light injury and if you can settle it privately, it will be fine. If not, you\u2019ll be detained for fifteen days and you\u2019ll have to pay a bit of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan would typically read up on some laws when he had nothing to do in his shop. However, most of them were complicated and he didn\u2019t understand it. Hence, he immediately tried to see what consequences he would face from hitting someone. Perhaps he might be able to understand the punishment better.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming had sustained minor injuries and the outcome depended on how they were to handle it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This piece of news was published on the same day.</p><br/><p>The peaceful Internet forums suddenly blew up.</p><br/><p>Countless people were stunned when they read that Jin Xuan Ming had been beaten up at the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s good. This man is awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen something like this. I\u2019m extremely impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome. One look at this man and you can tell that he\u2019s an experienced fighter. Even the bodyguards couldn\u2019t match up to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, something\u2019s wrong. Why does this man look like Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo search it up and see if it\u2019s true. However, isn\u2019t Master Lin situated in Shanghai? Why is he in Beijing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I just saw it. It\u2019s really Master Lin. I should\u2019ve known from the start. Only Master Lin could possess such fearsome skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was brilliant. A man like that deserves to be beaten up. Why are there so many stupid fans out there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This matter caused an uproar within the entertainment industry. A lot of celebrities watched this matter closely. They were shocked when they read that Jin Xuan Ming had been beaten up at the airport. It was as if they had seen a ghost. However, they somehow felt like laughing.</p><br/><p>This Jin Xuan Ming wasn\u2019t famous in Korea and he suddenly became famous in China after coming here to try to make a fortune. When he attended some events, he didn\u2019t even respect the senior celebrities. However, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it since he was a famous celebrity. If they posted about it on Weibo, they\u2019d be slaughtered by Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s stupid fans.</p><br/><p>However, this incident was brilliant.</p><br/><p>When Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans found out about this, they were shocked. They cried as if their idol had been killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this fella who hit our Xuan Ming oppa. We have to scold him on his Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s curse him till he dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he touch our oppa? Oppa is the most important being in our eyes. He\u2019s our pillar of support.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bunch of stupid fans commented. \u201cThis is the Weibo of that fella. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>On Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>Countless netizens came to praise him even though some of them didn\u2019t know who he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollowed. I\u2019ll be a lifetime fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually not a follower but today\u2019s an exception. Master Lin is my new idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou strike whenever it\u2019s needed. That\u2019s extraordinary. Let\u2019s wait for those stupid fans to wage war.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a lot of Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans came and scolded him on his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking rubbish, why did you hit our oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe police should lock him up for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should kneel down and apologize to our oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers and sisters, we have to create an uproar to punish this murderer severely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t oppa make a lot of friends from the recent show? Let\u2019s go to their Weibo and ask them for their support.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Yang Jun Chen was a variety show celebrity and he had attended a lot of variety shows before. He was rather influential and had a lot of fans.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at his own Weibo and read about Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s incident. However, he didn\u2019t want to post anything yet because he didn\u2019t like Jin Xuan Ming. Although he acted friendly towards him on the shows, it was just for the show\u2019s effects. They didn\u2019t like him because he was rude to the senior celebrities.</p><br/><p>Although Jin Xuan Ming was famous now, it wasn\u2019t based on his own capabilities. He didn\u2019t deserve to act so arrogantly.</p><br/><p>Then, Yang Jun Chen realized that his Weibo had private messages from Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans and the number of texts was increasing. Some of them said that if he didn\u2019t help them out, he wouldn\u2019t be considered to be a good friend of Jin Xuan Ming.</p><br/><p>For example, some of them called him a dog, etc\u2026 It was really bad.</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to support Jin Xuan Ming to appease these fans so that they wouldn\u2019t pester him on his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope we can seek justice for Xuan Ming. I wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d</p><br/><p>This Weibo post was normal and had no problems. Then, he posted it.</p><br/><p>The fans of Jin Xuan Ming were extremely happy. When they saw Yang Jun Chen\u2019s Weibo post, they felt great about themselves. It was as if they had done something great for their celebrity.</p><br/><p>Yang Jun Chen shook his head helplessly. It was a forced act. He didn\u2019t care about how serious Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s injuries were.</p><br/><p>Then, a phone call came. It was another celebrity who was rather close to him and he was a true friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Chen, you\u2019re mad. Why did you post on Weibo? Don\u2019t get involved in this. Quickly delete it,\u201d his friend said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Yang Jun Chen was stunned. \u201cBrother Mu, what\u2019s wrong? Is there a problem with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice on the phone became louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. You might not know who is Master Lin but you should know the singer who is dominating the charts now. Her songs were all written by Master Lin. Actually, that doesn\u2019t really matter. The main thing is, I heard my boss say that Master Lin has a wide network. This matter has nothing to do with you. Quick, delete it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Brother Mu, if I delete it after posting, Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans would kill me,\u201d Yang Jun Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother about that. Listen to me, quickly delete it. You have to be careful. Only three celebrities spoke about this and all of them have had conflicts with Master Lin before. Don\u2019t get involved in this, quickly delete it and disable your comments section,\u201d his good friend said.</p><br/><p>Yang Jun Chen trusted this friend a lot and deleted the Weibo post without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans were commenting on other celebrities\u2019 Weibo accounts and didn\u2019t bother much about him.</p><br/><p>Some of the celebrities weren\u2019t fools. They knew that this matter wouldn\u2019t do any good to them. In fact, it would only cause more trouble for them. Hence, they just ignored these people and their scoldings.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

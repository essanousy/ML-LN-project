When he received the call from Zhao Ming Qing, he had been slightly taken aback. He had never thought that he would really have a disciple. It was a feeling that he had never had before and he wasn't quite used to it.</p><br/><p>It was going to be a legitimate ceremony and not just a verbal agreement. His title wouldn't be the same anymore and naturally, he would have a larger burden to carry. If he couldn't teach his disciple well, it wouldn't be the disciple's fault, it would be his, as the master. Especially in the field of Chinese medicine, he couldn't take teaching as a joke. He had to do it properly and honestly. He had to explain every problem clearly. Otherwise, if a problem were to occur, it would be his fault.</p><br/><p>In the clothing shop, Lin Fan specially selected a set of appropriate clothing. In any setting or situation, when it was time to be serious, he had to be serious.</p><br/><p>After finishing up the work, Lin Fan looked at the finished copy of 'Various Types of Typhoid'. He wrapped it up and put it next to him.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Six o'clock.</p><br/><p>At a certain hotel.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was waiting at the entrance with Zhao Shi by his side. Their three sons and daughter were standing there as well, looking at each other. They had never thought that this would really happen. Today's event had to be stopped no matter what. Also, they had to expose this trickster who had tricked their Dad.</p><br/><p>Their father was the director of Shanghai's First Chinese Medical Academy and he was going to become the disciple of a youngster. It wouldn't just be humiliating for them. It would also be humiliating for their father's peers, those Uncles and Aunties.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing was slightly red as he stood at the entrance. His fists were tightly clenched and he was very nervous. Then, he said suspiciously, \"Why hasn't a single one of my old friends come?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing said, \"Dad, don't be anxious. Uncles and Aunties should be on the way. You know that it's the peak hour in Shanghai right now.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \"Mmm. Later on, I want you all to be honest with me. I know what you all are thinking but let me tell you, this is your father's only chance in his whole lifetime. If you ruin it, I won't be able to die happily.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin said with a laugh, \"Dad, how could it be that serious? Your medical abilities are famous throughout the nation. What could you possibly learn from a master?\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up. I'm very serious,\" said Zhao Ming Qing sternly.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Bin saw his father's expression, his own expression changed slightly. He could see that his father wasn't joking. When he thought about it, he was a little afraid. Then, he looked over at his Big Bro. Zhao Li Xing nodded at him, telling him not to worry.</p><br/><p>The third brother, Zhao Bing said, \"Dad, why don't we go in first and wait inside?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \"No, we have to wait here. This is etiquette.\"</p><br/><p>The sister didn't say anything. She didn't want any part of such a matter. From the start, she had never wanted to say anything. She knew of her father's temper. If they ruined their father's event without any reasonable explanation, the consequences would be dire.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Zhao.\" At that moment, Elder Mu came from afar.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Elder Mu and smiled. \"You're the first to come!\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu smiled. \"Of course. This is a big event for you. As an old friend, how could I not come early?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed cheerily. \"The rest will be here soon. Please wait a moment.\"</p><br/><p>\"No hurry.\" Elder Mu waved his hand. At that moment, Zhao Li Xing gestured to Elder Mu. Elder Mu said with a smile, \"What is it, Li Xing?\"</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Mu, could you advise my Dad against this?\" Zhao Li Xing was helpless. Although he was capable, he really had no way of helping his Dad in this situation.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu was stunned. He didn't quite understand. \"Advise against what? I don't quite understand what you mean.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing shook his head. \"Against accepting someone as his master. Look at how old he is. How could he become the disciple of a youngster whose as old as my daughter?\"</p><br/><p>When Elder Mu heard this, he instantly laughed. Then, he waved his hand. \"Li Xing, you don't know this. That Master Lin is a really capable man. Your dad has been obsessed with Chinese medicine his whole life. You all know that your father used to work at the hospital. Eventually, he felt that his ability was limited and he couldn't save a lot of people, so he went to become a teacher. As of now, he has become the director and he has nurtured countless juniors to be well-known in the Chinese medical world. Now that he has met the only person that he has respected throughout his whole life, do you think he would care about his age?\"</p><br/><p>\"Moreover, your Dad's old lung disease was treated by that Master Lin. I was there when it happened.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing looked at Elder Mu in astonishment. \"Elder Mu, did you also get brainwashed by that youngster? Even you believe this?\"</p><br/><p>\"How could I not believe it? I saw it with my own eyes. You youngsters shouldn't think too much. Your Dad isn't stupid. He is clearer than all of you about what's good and what's bad,\" said Elder Mu with a laugh. Then, his expression changed slightly as if he just remembered something. \"Don't tell me that you already did something.\"</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the more probable it seemed. It was already six o'clock. He knew that Elder Zhao had invited a lot of people to come to witness this but not a single person had arrived. Something wasn't right.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing nodded. \"Mmm. I called all the Aunties and Uncles that my Dad invited and told them not to come.\"</p><br/><p>When Elder Mu heard this, he was dumbfounded. Then, he looked at Elder Zhao, who had been standing there the whole time, waiting for Master Lin. He hurriedly dragged Zhao Li Xing behind the corner of the wall and said sternly, \"Li Xing, are you trying to anger your father to death?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing hastily said, \"Uncle Mu, what nonsense is that? Why would I want to anger my Dad? I'm worried that he would get cheated and humiliated in front of the Uncles and Aunties!\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu felt that things had gotten serious. He knew of Elder Zhao's temper. Then, he sighed and said, \"You youngsters only think about your own feelings. I think there should still be enough time. Hurry up and call all those Uncles and Aunties who are in Shanghai and tell them to hurry over. As for those from other areas, think of a way to get them to call your Dad and explain why they couldn't make it. Li Xing, what you did today is ridiculous.\"</p><br/><p>\"Your Dad sees this matter as more important than anything else. He wasn't even this serious during your wedding. If he finds out about this, I'm telling you that the outcome would be terrible.\" Elder Mu thought about it for a moment in his mind but he didn't dare to keep thinking about what would happen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing looked at Elder Mu. \"Uncle Mu, you're exaggerating a little, aren't you?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu shook his head. \"Exaggerating? Let me tell you that the outcome will be much more serious than what you think. Your Dad thinks differently from you all. He has an old-school way of thinking. He's old-fashioned and becoming a disciple is a big event. Do you know the phrase 'He who teaches me for one day is my father for life'? Even if that Master Lin is young, as long as he becomes your Dad's master, your Dad will scrupulously abide by his role as a disciple. If you dare to scold your father for that, your father might hit you because that's being unfilial. But if that Master Lin scolds your father, your father wouldn't be angry, instead, he would reflect on himself. He would even think that that is part of his teachings. Do you understand how important this is to your father now?\"</p><br/><p>\"It can't be.\" Zhao Li Xing didn't even dare to imagine that. He still thought that that youngster was a trickster but had he never thought that if he ruined the event without any concrete evidence, the outcome would be so severe. When he heard what Uncle Mu had said, he was panic-stricken.</p><br/><p>\"Can't be? I've known your dad for several decades since we were young. I know him better than any of you. I'm telling you now that no matter what you think, you have to call those people immediately and tell them to hurry over as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the outcome will be unimaginable. Also, I guarantee you that this matter isn't like you think it is,\" said Elder Mu.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a car stopped there.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing went forward immediately.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu hurriedly said, \"Hurry up! Do you need something to happen before you start to regret?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing had been startled by Uncle Mu. Without thinking much, he hurriedly made the calls. He couldn't think much at that moment. After hearing Uncle Mu's words, he felt that things were indeed going to be very serious.</p><br/><p>Whether or not that Master Lin was a trickster, Zhao Li Xing had to call the guests over. If he ruined this event, he and his siblings would be in deep trouble.</p><br/><p>If his father started to rage, they wouldn't be able to forgive themselves for the rest of their lives.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Taking a photo was fine. But asking him to leave Cloud Street was impossible.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei looked at Lin Fan with helplessness in his eyes as if asking for help.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked. <em>What are you looking at me for? I can\u2019t help you.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can\u2019t you talk to him? With his poise and his eye for fashion, it would be a complete waste to stay in this shop. He should live his life on the big stage. He can\u2019t just stay in this small shop and work for someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei said this very seriously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tell me all this. You should say it to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian waved his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re really annoying. I\u2019m not going. You should hurry up and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei seemed unyielding. \u201cYou\u2019ll earn a lot. Just one fashion show can earn you more than you\u2019d earn in ten years over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d Fraud Tian\u2019s heart was slightly shaken, but it was only because of the money. As for leaving Cloud Street, it was completely impossible.</p><br/><p>There was no need to even think about it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. He really hadn\u2019t expected someone to come to Cloud Street to invite Fraud Tian to be a fashion model. This was f*cking mystical. ( .c om )</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei said, \u201cThink about it properly. There definitely will be other people who will come looking for you, but you have to choose me first. I can fulfil all your wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian waved his hand. He didn\u2019t want to say more. He really hadn\u2019t expected to draw so much trouble.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei finally left with disappointment and reluctance. He hadn\u2019t expected to fail.</p><br/><p>However, he was unyielding. It was too much of a shame for such a talent to be working in a small shop.</p><br/><p>Since this shop was owned by Master Lin, the only one who would become famous was Master Lin. Fraud Tian would continue being a staff member without any benefits.</p><br/><p>However, Wang Yun Fei believed that he would definitely be able to convince Fraud Tian before long and make him understand his own value.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian. \u201cFraud, are you really not going? I think you\u2019d earn more there than you\u2019d ever earn here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh.\u201d Fraud Tian smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re speaking as if I\u2019m a greedy person. Let me tell you that I\u2019ve been invited by many to be their bodyguard, but I rejected them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cFraud, you\u2019re bragging a bit too much. But honestly, you should really think about it. Although I don\u2019t understand your fashion, since other people have scouted you, it shows that you do have some potential. You might really become a fashion influencer in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded. \u201cYeah. When you become famous, I would be able to steal some of the limelight as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that this would happen to Fraud Tian. This is really unexpected. Don\u2019t you think so, Dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He\u2019s existence in the shop wasn\u2019t greatly felt. He felt pretty much non-existent. But at that moment, he was laughing as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tian\u2019s fortune is pretty good. If he really goes down that path, he might have some accomplishments.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, there had been countless big shots who have gotten Wu Tian He to read their fortunes, and he had always been accurate.</p><br/><p>Right now, Fraud Tian\u2019s physiognomy showed that he could earn a shocking amount of wealth.</p><br/><p>However, Wu Tian He hadn\u2019t been able to see this in the past. It was as if something had changed. Perhaps it was really because of Master Lin that Fraud Tian\u2019s fortune had gradually changed.</p><br/><p>That was quite likely.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaying all this makes me a little sad. Do you all really want me to leave so badly? It\u2019s just money. I don\u2019t value money at all,\u201d said Fraud Tian in a slightly sad tone as if he had been hurt.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cYou don\u2019t value money? You didn\u2019t give me any money even when I asked you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at him. \u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to harm you and let you get addicted to gambling.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop started to get noisy and everyone was very happy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no qualms about Fraud Tian\u2019s decision. It actually didn\u2019t matter to him.</p><br/><p>If Fraud Tian were to go, it would be pretty good.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to stay, it was fine too. In any case, nothing much would change. If Fraud stayed in the shop, Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to him.</p><br/><p>When the shop owners of Cloud Street saw the news on the Internet, they were all stunned. ( .c om )</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Fraud really became famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Looking at this photo, I can\u2019t see anything special at all. But those netizens are saying that he looks amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea. Perhaps we just have different standards of beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was discussing intensely. They all didn\u2019t feel that there was anything special about Fraud Tian\u2019s clothes. They just felt that it was odd.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the shop, he realized that Fraud Tian\u2019s clothes had changed. He was back to the way he had been before.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, you really change too quickly. Why did you change back?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was stunned. Was Fraud Tian a shapeshifter? But this version of Fraud Tian still felt more comfortable. The version from yesterday was way too flashy and Lin Fan couldn\u2019t quite take it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled. \u201cI realized that those clothes I had been wearing for the past few days weren\u2019t too good-looking, so I gave them all away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was shocked. He hadn\u2019t expected Fraud Tian to give all those clothes away. That was really incredible.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cFraud, didn\u2019t you say that you had discovered your true self? Why did you change so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cMy true self? I went home and took a close look. I\u2019ve made a huge impact on the standards of beauty of the new generation, and I have to change it back. I think these clothes that I\u2019m wearing now are pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What happened?\u201d At that moment, Wang Yun Fei arrived at the shop again. He had even brought reporters.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw Fraud Tian, he was stunned. It was as if he couldn\u2019t believe it. Where had that eye-catching Fraud from yesterday gone? Why had he become a normal old man?</p><br/><p>The reporters took a close look but didn\u2019t see anything special. It was just a very normal old man.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei went forward and said anxiously, \u201cWhere are your clothes from yesterday? Why have you changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cClothes from yesterday? You\u2019re talking about that set of clothes? That\u2019s too ugly. I don\u2019t like it at all. This looks much more normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wang Yun Fei was stunned. Then, he cried out, \u201cIf your think it was ugly, why did you even wear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, it was as if he suddenly realized something and he was very disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t really understand it. It looks like it was just a fluke. Sigh. It seems that I had been thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without saying more, he immediately left Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. They had no idea why the had come.</p><br/><p>Where was the fashionable old man?</p></div>\n</div>"}

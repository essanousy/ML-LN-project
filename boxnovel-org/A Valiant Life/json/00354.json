The feeling in his body was indescribable.</p><br/><p>When the nurses at the service counter saw the little old man, they were slightly astonished. One of the female nurses gazed at him and said, \"Uncle, your complexion looks much better than before!\"</p><br/><p>The little old man was enjoying the refreshing feeling over his whole body. With a smile, he replied, \"Is that so?\"</p><br/><p>He could already feel it but when the nurse said it out, it made his mood pretty good. Then, he added, \"This illness must be getting better.\"</p><br/><p>The nurses nodded as they smiled but in their hearts, they felt tragic. They knew what sickness the Uncle had. It was impossible to recover from it. The only reason they didn't mention the outcome of the sickness was that they were afraid that the Uncle would get depressed.</p><br/><p>The Uncle returned to his ward.</p><br/><p>The nurses started whispering among themselves.</p><br/><p>\"I just saw that Uncle's facial complexion really looked much better than before.\"</p><br/><p>\"I thought so too, he looked especially energetic. He was much better than before. Do you think this could be the so-called 'final radiance of the setting sun'?\"</p><br/><p>\"Maybe it was just an illusion. We all want Uncle to get better, perhaps it's affected our imagination.\"</p><br/><p>\"That makes sense. Maybe that's the case.\"</p><br/><p>The little old man was humming a very modern tune in his mouth as he returned to his ward. When his wife saw that he was back, a wide smile spread across her face as she said, \"Do you feel better after going for a stroll?\"</p><br/><p>The little old man smiled. \"I feel great indeed. I think I'll be discharged in a couple of days. There's no one taking care of the vegetables at home and we don't even know if they've been stolen by those little b*stards.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright.\" Although the wife couldn't accept this sickness, she had already accepted this reality. She trusted the hospital and the doctors had already said that he couldn't be saved. After going back, they should eat whatever they wanted to eat and make proper use of the remaining time.</p><br/><p>The old man was in a pretty good mood. He looked at his wife and wanted to tell her about what had happened but after that, he thought about it. He had already made a promise, so he couldn't tell her. Then, he smiled and shook his head. He decided he would just give her a pleasant surprise when he recovered fully.</p><br/><p>He now had full faith in that youngster. The effectiveness of this first treatment was obvious. He understood the condition of his body best and he really didn't feel the same. It was a feeling he had never felt before.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After leaving the hospital, Lin Fan went to other hospitals to take a look. However, he felt very unsure about where to start. Without the qualifications to practice medicine, he would get arrested if news of this matter got out.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it would be really difficult to meet another person that trusted him like that old man. Even if he just met one person like that out of a hundred people, he could be considered lucky.</p><br/><p>Although he wanted to help and save more people, he was helpless. It wasn't that he lacked the motivation to save them but it was simply not possible for people to believe him. And if someone decided to report him, he would be taken away for questioning.</p><br/><p>At nighttime, he found a guesthouse and decided to stay there. When he went out and took a look, he felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>Though Shanghai was a large city, he had always been in that little place, Cloud Street. He had never come out to see the rest of the world before.</p><br/><p>The next day, nine in the morning.</p><br/><p>\"Master, you're here.\" The little old man had gotten out of bed early in the morning. Before, when he woke up from bed, his body would be hurting all over. Unless he took painkillers, he wouldn't even be able to get off the bed. But this morning, he felt like there was not a single thing wrong with his body. He felt like a normal person.</p><br/><p>According to Lin Fan's current medical skills, if he didn't have the Encyclopedia's mystical boost, treating this illness would take several months or longer but with the mystical boost, he realized that the duration of treatment became extraordinarily shorter.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"How does your body feel? Did you feel anything when you were sleeping last night?\"</p><br/><p>The little old man answered eagerly, \"Yes, yes. When I was sleeping last night, I felt that the bones in my body were warm, as if I was taking a hot shower. I even perspired all over last night. And after the perspiration, my body felt lighter, much lighter than before.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. These were all written in the Encyclopedia. When he heard the little old man say this, it seemed that there were no problems at all.</p><br/><p>As for why he would feel warm, perhaps it was the mystical power of the Encyclopedia mending his body.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around, then said, \"No one followed you, right?\"</p><br/><p>The little old man waved his hand. \"Nope, I didn't tell anyone, not even my wife. Master, which hospital are you from? I think that your medical skills are brilliant.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \"I'm not from any hospital. I've never been through professional training, nor am I qualified to practice medicine. Didn't you realize that I've been sneakily treating your sickness? If I am discovered by anyone, I will be arrested and held responsible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" The little old man was startled. Then, he hurriedly nodded. \"I understand. Don't worry. I'll definitely keep this a secret for you and I won't tell anyone.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and asked, \"You haven't had your breakfast, have you?\"</p><br/><p>The little old man shook his head, \"Nope.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Then drink this medicine. I'll do some acupuncture for you, then I'll do it once more in the afternoon. After that, you won't need any more acupuncture. As for this Chinese medicine, you have to brew it yourself every day. One packet per day. When you finish everything, your body will be recovered.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" The little old man didn't dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>\"Can't you already feel whether it's real or not?\" Lin Fan smiled. Getting this medical major class of knowledge was really nature-defying. Even though he wasn't able to bring people back from the dead, there wasn't any illness or disease he couldn't treat.</p><br/><p>But the previous night, Lin Fan had realized that even though he possessed this nature-defying knowledge, he couldn't spread the knowledge because treating these illnesses required his personal treatment. In the end, he had to depend on himself.</p><br/><p>The little old man took off his top hurriedly. He couldn't wait. \"Master, you really think that I can live another twenty years?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"I can't say for sure but ten to twenty years shouldn't be a problem at all.\"</p><br/><p>The little old man said embarrassedly, \"It doesn't matter if it's ten or twenty years. I only wish that I will pass away later than my wife so that she won't have to be lonely.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened a packet of disposable silver needles, then started the acupuncture. This time, Lin Fan actively paid attention to the feeling of mystical power with every needle he used. It was the Encyclopedia's mystical boost.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. This Encyclopedia really was sick. When the skill wasn't awesome enough, it gave him a mystical boost to make him f*cking awesome. What else could he say? All he could say was 'You're way too strong, Encyclopedia.'</p><br/><p>\"Comfortable. It's really too comfortable.\" An expression of enjoyment appeared on the little old man's face. He had never thought that getting an illness treated could feel so good. It was as if his whole body was floating up. Furthermore, he could feel the obvious changes in his body.</p><br/><p>Before, there had still been slight pains in several parts of his body but after this treatment, there were instant results. Those painful areas were suddenly liberated of all pain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, once again, wrapped up the used silver needles and threw them into the rubbish bin.</p><br/><p>\"Come here at three in the afternoon for the third treatment. After that, we'll be done with the acupuncture,\" said Lin Fan with a smile. Judging by the situation, this acupuncture and medication seemed to just be assisting tools. In the end, curing the cancer still depended on the Encyclopedia's boost.</p><br/><p>The little old man held Lin Fan's hand with a grateful expression on his face. He asked, \"Master, what's your name?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and stood up. As he left, he said, \"Remember, three in the afternoon.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay\u2026\" replied the little old man immediately.</p><br/><p>How could he possibly forget such an important time?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The dosage is different too. It is not a specific treatment plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun was shocked.</p><br/><p>The reporters did not know what to say. Then, a reporter asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, since it\u2019s not just meant to treat Yuan Yuan, how did she\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not expect Master Lin to crack a joke like this.</p><br/><p>Master Lin suddenly realised his mistake. He did not answer their question clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Yuan has indeed recovered. If I did not use the herbs to cure her, I would have used my own method to cure her before researching the herbs. However, using herbs to treat an illness is different from my method. Hence, I managed to use the herbs to cure Yuan Yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan said that, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned, and when they looked at Master Lin\u2019s smile, they could not believe it.</p><br/><p>That sounded too unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, do you mean that you were able to cure AIDS with your medical skills and knowledge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters did not know what to say. They felt that they had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was really like a god.</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>The doctor rushed to the lab to conduct the experiments. When the results came out, he was stunned. It was as if he had seen a ghost too.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was perfectly normal.</p><br/><p>However, Yuan Yuan, who was previously suffering from AIDS, was tested to be HIV negative.</p><br/><p>That meant that she had fully recovered.</p><br/><p>The other lab assistants were curious. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why do you look so stunned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant asked again, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHAHA\u2026\u201d The doctor grabbed onto the lab assistant and laughed. \u201cMaster Lin succeeded! He has eradicated AIDS.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lab assistant remained silent for a moment before asking him in shock, \u201cWhat? Master Lin did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if he thought of something. He immediately unlocked his phone and looked at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. When he saw the post, he did not know what to say at all.</p><br/><p>Master Lin really published the list of medicinal herbs.</p><br/><p>The doctor immediately rushed to the Chinese Medical Academy again. He was ecstatic. He did not expect him to succeed at all.</p><br/><p>It was a joyous occasion.</p><br/><p>Since it was still early in the morning, some people were still asleep, but the working adults were already on public transport as they headed for work.</p><br/><p>On the train.</p><br/><p>\u201cOH MY F*CKING GOD!\u201d</p><br/><p>A youngster shouted uncontrollably after reading Master Lin\u2019s post on Weibo.</p><br/><p>That scream attracted the attention of various people. They felt that this man was crazy for shouting vulgarities so loudly in public.</p><br/><p>The youngster immediately added, \u201cMaster Lin succeeded! He eradicated AIDS!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, everyone in the cabin was stunned.</p><br/><p>Then, they immediately checked their phones and looked at Weibo.</p><br/><p>They lived in Shanghai and they cared a lot about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>In that moment, there was a commotion in the cabin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome. Really awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Master Lin actually succeeded. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a crazy piece of news.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>Most netizens were already online, and when they read the post, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, he did it! Master Lin did it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it. It\u2019s too crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA, I knew Master Lin would succeed! Will those that said that he wouldn\u2019t succeed please step forward? Let me tell you more about Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, simply too awesome! I want to know if there\u2019s any illness that Master Lin can\u2019t cure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the whole world will be changed by this. To many people, Master Lin is their saviour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I think Master Lin used Chinese Medicine on purpose so that he can increase the popularity of Chinese Medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Besides Chinese medicine, what else could he use? Did you actually think that he would promote anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were dumbfounded and ecstatic. They finally heard the great news after a long wait.</p><br/><p>After this incident, they respected Master Lin even more.</p><br/><p>At the Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>A lot of townsfolk had arrived after finding out about it. The foreigners that were waiting patiently were dumbfounded when they heard the news.</p><br/><p>They had waited for a long time, and they had been losing hope with each passing day.</p><br/><p>However, now that Master Lin succeeded, they did not know how to react.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagical, Master Lin is magical!\u201d</p><br/><p>They had never seen a powerful Chinese man like Master Lin before. Master Lin was probably the most powerful Chinese man that they had ever seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe test results are out! He really did it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor that tested the blood samples rushed back in excitement. He started shouting even before he reached the crowd.</p><br/><p>However, when he reached the academy, he realised that the reporters had already surrounded Master Lin. That was when he finally understood that everyone already believed in Master Lin before the results were even out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surrounded by reporters as he answered all sorts of questions.</p><br/><p>He was already used to situations like this. Everyone there was bombarding him with questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMentor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing woke up. When he saw the situation outside, he was stunned. He still did not know what had happened.</p><br/><p>He thought that they were still in the midst of their research, and he could not understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, we did it!\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. Then, he said ecstatically, \u201cTeacher, we succeeded?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, we did it. Bring Yuan Yuan out to see her dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing still did not understand how they suddenly succeeded since they did not make any significant progress the night before.</p><br/><p>It was probably because his mentor thought of something in the middle of the night and did the tests on his own.</p><br/><p>However, he wondered why he did not notice it at all.</p><br/><p>Then, he blamed himself for being sound asleep.</p><br/><p>He just felt remorseful for sleeping.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

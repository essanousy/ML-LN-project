This was a 200m race. It was unlike basketball or football. It only had over ten seconds for the final results to be determined.</p><br/><p>\"Hu Fei Yun got the best start. He's in the first place. His strides are well placed and he's running with perfect form.\"</p><br/><p>\"However, Hu Fei Yun isn't as explosive as the other contestants. The Jamaican contestant is the most powerful and the German contestant, Robert, is a close second.\"</p><br/><p>\"Amazing, simply amazing.\"</p><br/><p>The commentator was commentating ecstatically. This race was the pinnacle of all races. The contestants could be said to be the nine fastest men on Earth. All of them stood a chance.</p><br/><p>This was the most expensive track &amp; field race in history.</p><br/><p>The crowd was cheering loudly for their respective contestants.</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck!\"</p><br/><p>At that point, the commentator suddenly spewed vulgarity on the live broadcast which was played on most television channels.</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned when they heard the vulgarity. They didn't know why he suddenly said it.</p><br/><p>\"Look, guys. Look\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The commentator was dumbfounded. It was as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\"Where is this cameraman from? How is he running so quickly?\"</p><br/><p>The netizens looked at the screen in shock. When they saw what was happening at the side of the track, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>Some spat out their drinks in disbelief when they saw what was happening.</p><br/><p>Those that were eating tidbits suddenly froze. Even their mouths stopped moving.</p><br/><p>At the venue.</p><br/><p>At the stands, Chu Yuan had already given up long ago. He didn't know what to do about his task anymore. He had been watching Master Lin closely. When they started the race, he had virtually given up on getting a good shot. However, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was sprinting with the video camera on his shoulder. He was pointing the camera at the athletes. Furthermore, the most shocking thing was that Master Lin was running at about the same speed as the contestants. What did that mean?</p><br/><p>If it was a long distance race, he wouldn't have been so shocked because the athletes would naturally run at slower speeds to maintain their stamina. The reporters would be able to follow their pace with the video camera. But even that was still a rare occurrence.</p><br/><p>However, it was a 200m race. The athletes were sprinting with all their might. Their explosive power would've been the highest near the end of the race.</p><br/><p>The entire crowd was stunned by this scene. They all covered their mouths in disbelief and stared at the person at the side of the track. They rubbed their eyes and looked again. It was as if they were hallucinating.</p><br/><p>Seidel was confident in his running speed and he didn't have any mercy at all. He ran with all his might, with his head lowered throughout the whole race. Through his peripheral vision, he saw that the other contestants were slower than him and he smiled. Gradually, he overtook five contestants.</p><br/><p>Hu Fei Yun was in the fourth place as he was overtaken by a contestant.</p><br/><p>Then, Seidel raised his head. He decided to give his all for the last fifty meters to widen the gap even more.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, in his peripheral vision, he realized that there was a person following him closely. He turned his head slightly and was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, I must be dreaming.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was carrying the camera and pointing it at the few contestants behind him. He pointed it at each of them and did a close-up shot of all of them. Each of the contestants' veins were popping. Their expressions were a combination of grit and determination.</p><br/><p>Although he didn't know any filming techniques, he knew the basics. Like the way he should angle his camera and what he should film.</p><br/><p>Hu Fei Yun looked at Lin Fan while he was running. Lin Fan noticed that he was looking at him in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Hu Fei Yun was extremely shocked. It was like seeing a ghost. He didn't believe that this man could run so fast as he was carrying a video camera. Furthermore, he wasn't even running with a proper form. His body was tilted slightly and it should've decreased his speed.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan turned the camera to the French athlete beside him. After that, he zoomed in on other contestants.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, come on! Run faster! Give me your best expression!\" Lin Fan exclaimed as he continued running.</p><br/><p>To others, it was an insane race of the best athletes but to Lin Fan, he just wanted to capture the best side of the athletes.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan trusted him and Lin Fan didn't want to disappoint him. Therefore, Lin Fan wanted to focus and do a good job for him.</p><br/><p>The entire crowd was silent. Some of them were holding onto their phones while others were looking in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed the camera at the Jamaican. He was the fastest man there. His speed was insane. He immediately increased the distance between him and the other contestants. He was the fastest man on Earth indeed.</p><br/><p>Seidel was charging forward ferociously but he took several glimpses at the video camera. His eyes were filled with doubt and shock.</p><br/><p>He was probably wondering how the reporter could run so fast while carrying a camera.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that he was looking at him. Then, he just smiled at him and said, \"You're awesome. You're undoubtedly the fastest man alive. They're all behind you.\"</p><br/><p>Seidel didn't understand Mandarin and he didn't know what Lin Fan was saying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that he definitely didn't understand what he was saying. Then, he said in English, \"Good. Number one. Number one.\"</p><br/><p>It was as if Seidel understood Lin Fan and he immediately lowered his head and charged forward. His veins were popping from the explosive power. Lin Fan felt that this type of athlete deserved respect as he gave his best even though he was already leading.</p><br/><p>It was awesome.</p><br/><p>Seidel felt that it was becoming increasingly difficult to breathe and he had reached his physical limits. His legs felt like they were floating.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Seidel felt that Lin Fan would've been left behind him after he ran at full speed. He looked beside him and heaved a sigh of relief as he was finally gone. It really looked like he had been left behind.</p><br/><p>But when he raised his head confidently and looked forward, Seidel was in utter disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"How could it be?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was already in front of him and the camera was pointed at Seidel. Lin Fan didn't want to miss out on the scene when Seidel lowered his head and sprinted. The grit that was displayed had to be recorded. It was sufficient to move and inspire people.</p><br/><p>Then, the momentarily silenced crowd suddenly burst into loud cheers.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Superman is here!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

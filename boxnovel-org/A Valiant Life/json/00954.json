We\u2019re going to learn a tune now.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the children as he taught them patiently.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the teachers that he had hired walked along the two sides to help the children make adjustments.</p><br/><p>To them, the children of the welfare institute received really high-end education. These children were able to come into contact with all sorts of things. The newly-started piano classes, in particular, made them very surprised.</p><br/><p>Mainly, the tunes played by Master Lin had taken their breaths away.</p><br/><p>Although they hadn\u2019t listened to famous performers live before, to them, Master Lin\u2019s performance was even more inspirational than those international masters\u2019 performances. This kind of inspiration could not be described with words, it could only be felt with one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>They saw that these children, after listening to the performance, had been entranced by the piano. Every day, the children would look forward to the piano classes the most.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Jiang Hui was communicating softly with the other teachers, \u201cI feel like these children are very smart. They learn everything exceptionally quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I feel that too. At their age, addition and subtraction involving hundreds are considered very difficult but after teaching them once, they all understood it. They can even infer many more things from what I teach them. What geniuses!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps this is God\u2019s fairness. He\u2019s given these children clever minds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I feel like these children are a little too smart.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Lin Fan\u2019s current capabilities, he naturally heard their conversation. He laughed in his heart. This was all normal. After taking the perfect-grade little intelligence pills, these children were not like average children anymore. With time, they would definitely become people that the society cannot ignore.</p><br/><p>When that happens, countless top-level geniuses would walk out of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. How satisfying would that feel!</p><br/><p>Of course, at the moment, the children had to work hard to charge themselves up. In order to spread their wings and soar like eagles, they still had a way to go.</p><br/><p>The lesson ended.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The children were deeply interested. But the task hadn\u2019t been completed as of yet.</p><br/><p>However, there was no rush. Lin Fan would come whenever he had the time. Right now, he wasn\u2019t really after completing the Encyclopedia\u2019s tasks anymore.</p><br/><p>These days were passing by rather comfortably.</p><br/><p>Director Huang walked in from outside and came to Lin Fan\u2019s side. She said softly, \u201cMaster Lin, a group of people are outside looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d asked Lin Fan curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They seem like celebrities,\u201d said Director Huang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. He wasn\u2019t very keen to see celebrities but since they were already here, he naturally had to go and see them. Otherwise, other people would blame him for being impolite. That wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><br/><p>The conference room.</p><br/><p>Three males and a female sat inside. They spoke a little strangely. It didn\u2019t sound like traditional mandarin but instead, it was mixed with a bit of Hong Kong accent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing able to meet with Master Lin is making me a little nervous,\u201d said a middle-aged man in a jacket. He appeared bold and powerful. He took a look around and felt that the environment here was pretty good.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is very famous in the country. He\u2019s also a young man who\u2019s worthy of respect. Although he\u2019s young, he has done things that most people wouldn\u2019t be able to do in their lifetimes and things that they might not even dare to do,\u201d the only female said with a smile. Her tone was filled with reverence.</p><br/><p>As the group of them were chatting.</p><br/><p>The conference room door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>Director Huang accompanied Lin Fan by his side. \u201cMaster Lin, they\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the four people in the conference room and felt that two of them were very familiar. He couldn\u2019t help but start to recall.</p><br/><p><em>Aren\u2019t these two the famous celebrities from Hong Kong?</em></p><br/><p><em>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long.</em></p><br/><p>But before Lin Fan could say anything, the man in the jacket went forward passionately and grabbed Lin Fan\u2019s hand. \u201cMaster Lin, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Wang Ke Hao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe very famous director from Hong Kong who directed \u2018Police Prison Life\u2019?\u201d Lin Fan was familiar with this name. When he thought about it, he instantly remembered.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao smiled. \u201cYes, yes. For Master Lin to know about me, it is a great honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I grew up watching your films!\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao knew how amazing Master Lin was. He was extremely proud but he didn\u2019t show it. Then, he said hurriedly, \u201cMaster Lin, let me introduce to you. This is Li Meng Hua, Zheng Long, and my assistant, Miss Zhou Xia Jun.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI know. I know these two. I grew up watching their films too.\u201d Lin Fan seemed to only know this sentence. However, it was the truth.</p><br/><p>When he had been young, he had indeed watched many of their films. Even now, he could remember many scenes.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua was all smiles. He extended his hand and said with a Hong Kong accent, \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied politely, \u201cNice to meet you. Welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Long had a curious gaze. \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve met. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed Zheng Long\u2019s hand and replied politely as well. Then, he took a look at Zheng Long and couldn\u2019t help but say with a smile, \u201cMister Zheng\u2019s physiognomy is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Kong people, in particular, celebrities, were very trusting towards things like fortune-telling and Feng Shui.</p><br/><p>Zheng Long was a little puzzled. But Wang Ke Hao explained, \u201cMaster Lins is proficient in many things. In particular, metaphysics is one of his specialties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s because it\u2019s my first time seeing celebrities that I\u2019ve only been able to see on television in the past that I\u2019m talking more than usual. But your physiognomy is really very good. You are reserved and humble, kind, upright, and you have good luck. But be careful of vile characters. You have to be alert.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d Zheng Long thanked him. But he seemed not to be concerned about Lin Fan\u2019s words. He only responded politely since Lin Fan had praised him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother either. Instead, he asked, \u201cSo why are you all here for me today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao replied, \u201cMaster Lin, this is the situation. We are prepared to shoot a film in Shanghai. Because the setting is important, we would like to borrow and use Master Lin\u2019s welfare institute as a setting. Secondly, we\u2019re here to pay you a visit. After all, we will be in Shanghai for a long period of time. Hence, we came to pay our respects to you. If we come across trouble, we\u2019d have to request Master Lin\u2019s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he instantly laughed. \u201cDirector Wang is too courteous. As long as you do your filming according to the regulations, what trouble would you encounter? Don\u2019t worry, Shanghai is very safe. As for borrowing the welfare institute to use as a setting, it\u2019s possible. However, you have to be careful about the people entering and leaving. After all, this is a special place and we can\u2019t have too many people inside at once. Also, please be mindful of safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, of course. Master Lin, you don\u2019t have to worry. I will definitely take care of everything. I definitely won\u2019t bring you any trouble,\u201d said Wang Ke Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Lin Fan was rather easy to negotiate with. Especially to good people, he was easy to communicate with.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao said, \u201cMaster Lin, would you do us the honor of joining us for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was rather interested in this. \u201cAlright, no problem. I shall not reject.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

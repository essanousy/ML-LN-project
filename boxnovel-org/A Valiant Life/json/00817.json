He had obtained the Encyclopedic Points that he deserved.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he hasn\u2019t been relying on it to get his Encyclopedic Points. However, he still kept it on the wall so that it could help him to gain some Encyclopedic Points whenever he was lucky.</p><br/><p>Henry looked at his colleagues, \u201cQuick, come and have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other Michelin critics weren\u2019t interested at all. They didn\u2019t want to eat such food. They felt that Henry was pranking them and it wasn\u2019t fun.</p><br/><p>It was just\u2026 that they had been colleagues for many years and they didn\u2019t know what to say to him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Henry was considered to be their manager. They could only play along with it.</p><br/><p>Worthy of three Michelin stars?</p><br/><p>If other food critics were to find out about this, they\u2019d probably be infuriated.</p><br/><p>Because this was a form of humiliation to them.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was just scallion pancakes. They weren\u2019t some special delicacy. It was totally ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang didn\u2019t say much. He quickly read the poster on the wall. He didn\u2019t expect such a thing to exist.</p><br/><p>Initially, he thought that the poster would contain difficult information to digest. However, he realized that it was just the recipe for the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>When Henry\u2019s colleagues saw that, they shook their heads.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what had happened to Henry. It was as if he had been possessed. It was shocking.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect Henry Wang to be so smart. He merely read it once and he understood it. Of course, Lin Fan was happy.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like anything else but Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you\u2019ve understood it. You can get a scallion pancake,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>When Henry Wang heard that, he stared at Lin Fan in disbelief, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect it to be completed just like that.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t what he had expected.</p><br/><p>He spent $20,000 on a scallion pancake a few days ago. Today, he just looked at a poster and could buy one for just $50. That\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>He felt as if his brains must have been smashed by a door.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore because he had gotten what he wanted. That was to taste the delicious dish.</p><br/><p>However, when he realized that his friends weren\u2019t looking at the poster, he got anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my God, what are you doing? Can you please read the poster seriously? You won\u2019t regret it, trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the colleagues shook his head, \u201cHenry, you\u2019re making it really difficult to believe. This shop is really\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t be thinking about it at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them didn\u2019t think highly of the shop at all. They felt that Henry had gone mad.</p><br/><p>If they were to award this shop with three Michelin stars, people would probably think they were crazy.</p><br/><p>Lin Tan knew that those people were food critics from the Michelin company. However, he didn\u2019t really care about that. He didn\u2019t want to become famous. He could probably get three Michelin stars on his own and convince all of them that his shop was worthy of that. However, he didn\u2019t see the need for that.</p><br/><p>He wanted to stay low-profile and he didn\u2019t want to become famous for it.</p><br/><p>Henry didn\u2019t want to say anything else. He just wanted to taste the food to stun those that didn\u2019t believe him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, can I have one scallion pancake please?\u201d Henry Wang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and started to make a scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>Henry looked at him and watched closely. It was his first time being so close to the making of the scallion pancake. He wanted to see how it was made.</p><br/><p>Simply ordinary.</p><br/><p>He could only use those words to describe the process. He didn\u2019t believe it. How could an ordinary process make such delicious scallion pancakes?</p><br/><p>When Henry\u2019s colleagues saw that, they were in disdain. They felt like Henry was wasting their time on an ordinary thing.</p><br/><p>If the reporters of food magazines were to know that they were there, they would definitely be a laughing stock. Were the Michelin food critics so bored that they had nothing else to taste besides this?</p><br/><p>Henry continued to watch closely. If he didn\u2019t taste the scallion pancakes himself, he probably would have believed that the food was difficult to swallow. However, since he had tried it, he was filled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan coughed gently, \u201cHave you heard of \u2018returning to one\u2019s natural state\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry was stunned. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in Wuxia novels. It\u2019s when someone lets go of all his moves and only uses the simplest one to cause the greatest damage. Right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you can think of it that way. Looks like you know a lot about wuxia novels,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Henry smiled, \u201cYeah, I have a friend who is a drug addict. He got rid of his addiction by reading Chinese fantasy novels. He has already stopped taking drugs and he spends his days waiting for the author to update the novel. I would read it sometimes too. It\u2019s called \u2018the lonely undefeated\u2019. Have you seen it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNope.\u201d However, he was judging the name of the book. He felt that it must have been written by an idiot. The name of the novel was so stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough my actions look ordinary, each action has a purpose. They\u2019re not for show. Do you smell the aroma?\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry was stunned. He took a sniff, \u201cI think I smell it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry\u2019s colleagues just looked at him disdainfully. He must have gone crazy. Where was the aroma?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Henry and felt that he was probably lying. Aroma my a*s. He hadn\u2019t even used the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan started to use the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>In an instant, an aroma filled the air.</p><br/><p>The crowd that was looking at him disdainfully was now in disbelief. They looked at the ordinary scallion pancakes in shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>They could confirm that the aroma was coming from the scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>After a short moment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that there was a need for some special effects. \u201cHere, the scallion pancake is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter!*</p><br/><p>In that instant, it was as if the group of Michelin food critics had seen something extraordinary.</p><br/><p>They rubbed their eyes in disbelief.</p><br/><p>They felt as if they saw rays of light emerging from the scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s glowing. It\u2019s really glowing!\u201d Henry was ecstatic. He felt that it was a miracle to see a glowing delicacy.</p><br/><p>An aroma filled the air.</p><br/><p>The aroma started to spread.</p><br/><p>It was as if the entire Cloud Street was engulfed with the aroma.</p><br/><p>Many of the shoppers stopped in their tracks, \u201cWhere is the smell coming from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s from there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a plastic bag and placed the scallion pancake into the packaging. Then, he passed it to Henry who was mesmerized, \u201cAlright, you can taste it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry stretched out his trembling hands. He couldn\u2019t control himself anymore. Then, he looked at his colleagues, \u201cDo you smell that? Did you see that? This is what I call a delicacy. It is not from this world. Only the Gods can taste such deliciousness from Heaven.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk didn\u2019t see the rays of light but when they heard what this foreigner said, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think these people have gone mad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I not understand what they\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t understand it. I feel like Little Boss is pretending to be awesome again.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

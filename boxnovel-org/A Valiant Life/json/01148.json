Could it be some kind of act?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAct my a*s. Take a closer look. This post was uploaded by the Shanghai Official Weibo. Do you think they would spread false information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre those really the artificial limbs developed by Master Lin? That\u2019s too f*cking incredible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese artificial limbs can be used to run like that and kick like that and they can even be worn when showering. That\u2019s way too valiant. And did you guys notice how the artificial limbs attached to their bodies? It was like a seamless connection!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched it several times already and I watched it very closely. It really seemed like a seamless connection.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese artificial limbs are only retailing for three thousand each? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see for yourself? The Shanghai Official Weibo has already stated that it will only be three thousand each. That\u2019s too d*mn cheap. And did you see the description? These artificial limbs can automatically adjust themselves. When children use these artificial limbs, they wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of growing out of these artificial limbs. These artificial limbs will automatically adjust according to the user\u2019s growth. That\u2019s way too valiant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I understand now. It turns out that Master Lin wasn\u2019t bragging at all. He really succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I told you so. How could someone as awesome as Master Lin be bragging? You guys didn\u2019t believe me. Now that you\u2019ve seen the outcome, what do you have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m convinced. I have nothing more to say. He\u2019s f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the Internet had completely blown up.</p><br/><p>In a certain city, a young man saw the video and leaped up from his seat. Then, he started hurrying home excitedly.</p><br/><p>When he saw his wife lying on the sofa and watching the television, he approached her delightedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife,\u201d the young man hollered. But his wife, who was lying on the sofa, just nodded dully.</p><br/><p>The young man started playing the video and fast-forwarded it before passing it to his wife. \u201cWife, take a look at this video.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman looked at the video. In the video, children were happily running around, kicking a ball around. She was very jealous. In the past, she used to be like this as well. But after a car accident, her life had changed.</p><br/><p>She used artificial limbs too but she felt that it was very uncomfortable. When she walked, it felt very strange. When others looked at her, it was clear that she had a problem with her legs. Moreover, the cold metal on her artificial limbs always made her feel miserable.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d the man exclaimed excitedly.</p><br/><p>The woman nodded. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you if you could tell what was wrong with those children,\u201d said the man.</p><br/><p>The woman shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with them. They\u2019re all very happy and cheerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man rewound the video to the first scene. \u201cTake a look at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman turned her head to the phone. When she started watching the video, she couldn\u2019t turn her head away.</p><br/><p>That child in the wheelchair had both legs crippled and she looked very pitiful. But as the video continued to play, she saw an old lady bring a set of artificial legs over and the girl put them on.</p><br/><p>Then, upon putting on the artificial legs, the girl completely changed. She suddenly became extremely nimble.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d the woman said in disbelief.</p><br/><p>The man replied, \u201cIt\u2019s real. These are the perfect artificial limbs developed by Master Lin. Look at all these children. They are all disabled but, after putting on the artificial limbs, they seem completely normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be fake?\u201d The woman looked up at the man. She knew who Master Lin was but the scene shown in the video was really hard to believe.</p><br/><p>The man said excitedly, \u201cHow could it be fake? These were developed by Master Lin and the Shanghai government\u2019s official Weibo account already announced that they will be collaborating with Eastern Han Organization to manufacture it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it must be very expensive,\u201d said the woman. They weren\u2019t very well-to-do. In her mind, such perfect artificial limbs were probably very expensive. They might even cause up to $200,000.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not expensive at all. It only costs three thousand dollars each,\u201d said the man. He hadn\u2019t expected such perfect artificial limbs to be sold for just three thousand dollars. In the past, he had bought a set of artificial limbs for his wife for over twenty thousand dollars but those weren\u2019t good at all.</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s eyes widened as she muttered in disbelief, \u201cThree thousand dollars\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In Bor Artificial Limbs Company\u2019s conference room, all the executives were sat. They had just received the notice and they had quickly called a meeting. They had no idea what had happened but they all turned silent upon watching the video.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that our product can be improved to such a standard?\u201d the boss spoke with worry written all over his face.</p><br/><p>After watching the video, his first thought was that it was definitely a f*cking act. How could those artificial limbs be so f*cking awesome?</p><br/><p>But later on, he understood that it was all real. Because this video had been posted by the Shanghai government. How could it be an act?</p><br/><p>If those artificial limbs were really as good as the video showed, there was only one outcome for the company. They were done for. They were completely and undeniably done for.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, it must be an act. How could an artificial limb possibly do all that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They look way too nimble. The video is definitely fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the most high-tech artificial limbs in the world aren\u2019t as good as these.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at how they connect so seamlessly. It\u2019s obviously fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>The executives of the company kept rambling one after another. They couldn\u2019t believe what was in the video at all. It was really too unreal.</p><br/><p>It was so unreal that it was scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is real. These are the perfect artificial limbs developed by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the boss of the company said this, everyone on site was astounded. One of them shot up from his seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. That Master Lin doesn\u2019t even understand this line of work, how could he develop this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss looked at him. \u201cThen tell me. What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was lost for words. They didn\u2019t know how to reply to that.</p><br/><p>They suddenly realized that this situation was about to become terrifying. If the video was real and those artificial limbs were to appear on the market, they would be completely done for.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the most important part was that these artificial limbs were too f*cking cheap.</p><br/><p>Three thousand dollars? How could they compete against that?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Bor Artificial Limbs Company wasn\u2019t the only one in distress. All the other artificial limb companies were the same.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people in this line of work and there were even less who were successful. The market could be said to be dominated by just a few companies. Hence, the price of artificial limbs was very high.</p><br/><p>After all, these were high-tech products, not just normal products.</p><br/><p>But now that these perfect artificial limbs had appeared, they had been met with a brick wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. We can\u2019t just sit idly by. We have to protest. We have to file a lawsuit. These perfect artificial limbs from Master Lin would monopolize and ruin our marketplace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, throughout the country, all the artificial limbs companies banded together and decided not to sit idly by. Otherwise, they would be heading towards a dead end.</p></div>\n</div>"}

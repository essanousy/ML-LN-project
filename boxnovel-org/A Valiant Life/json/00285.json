It looks like it's related to gambling,\" a staff member of the broadcasting platform was surveying every single broadcasting room and was extra cautious when he saw this title. Then, he entered it and saw that someone was performing gambling tricks in it.</p><br/><p>He didn't continue watching and he immediately linked it to his manager to examine.</p><br/><p>He had the rights to shut down the broadcast but this broadcaster was pretty popular. After looking at it, he realized that the broadcaster was actually Zhao Zhong Yang. But since he violated the rules, he had to be dealt with. Hence, he sent it to his manager.</p><br/><p>After a while, the reply came.</p><br/><p>When he read the content, he was shocked.</p><br/><p>Promote it?</p><br/><p>\"Sir, this broadcast is talking about gambling. Why should we promote it?\"</p><br/><p>He was waiting for a message from his manager but after a while, the manager just came out of his office. \"In the future, you have to look at things more closely. This isn't gambling. This is a campaign to discourage people from gambling. This is aligned with our country's current policy. We have to promote it to discourage people from gambling. Furthermore, I took a look at it. The quality of the content is pretty good.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At home.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. \"Master Lin, the broadcasting platform pushed our broadcast to the featured page!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't bothered by these things. The number of people in the broadcast kept increasing. It was still early in the morning but there were around seven hundred thousand people in it.</p><br/><p>He simply ignored some of the comments in the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>This type of skills couldn't be passed on to just anyone. If this was taught, people would get into trouble.</p><br/><p>He didn't know how to continue with his showcase but he knew that the people that were watching the broadcast were definitely stunned.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang was in a daze. He just sat beside him and stared at Lin Fan unblinkingly.</p><br/><p>Worship!</p><br/><p>Yes, he could see that Zhao Zhong Yang was simply in awe of him.</p><br/><p>The two decks of cards were being used for all sorts of tricks by Lin Fan. He really had to thank the Encyclopedia for allowing him to perform so many tricks.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia was so awesome. It didn't just give him these abilities. It also explicitly explained the different tricks and techniques. There were so many of them. Furthermore, this gambling skills classification could be unlocked further in the Encyclopedia. But it was already pointless. He just wanted the people in the broadcast to feel a sense of mystery and fear. He wanted them to know how scary it was.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Many of the internet celebrities started to repost Master Lin's Weibo. When they saw Master Lin's Weibo, they all curiously went to have a closer look at it but they were glued to it.</p><br/><p>He was so d*mn powerful.</p><br/><p>When Master Lin was taking a break, they immediately reposted and promoted the page with various titles.</p><br/><p>'Please watch this channel. The God of Gambling will lead you into a different world.'</p><br/><p>'Nobody would dare to challenge someone with these skills. It's so scary!'</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Gradually, they were being reposted.</p><br/><p>Many people became curious and decided to have a look for themselves.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't know what was happening outside of the broadcast but when he saw that the number of viewers kept increasing, he felt that perhaps his task could be completed soon.</p><br/><p>In a certain apartment block in a certain city.</p><br/><p>In an average sized room.</p><br/><p>A young man was laying down on his bed motionlessly. It was already 10 am. He was jobless, so he didn't wake up. He had literally nothing.</p><br/><p>Then, he sent out a message.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, please lend me $1000\u2026\"</p><br/><p>There was no reply at all.</p><br/><p>*Ding!*</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the phone vibrated.</p><br/><p>A voice message came.</p><br/><p>\"Don't even mention $1000. I wouldn't even give you $100. Also, please don't address me as your 'bro'. That's all. Please watch your words and actions\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The man looked at the phone and started cursing, \"F*ck, forget it then. Wait till I get rich and I'll make you regret your actions.\"</p><br/><p>He was referring to getting rich from gambling.</p><br/><p>In the past, he still had a small amount of savings. But ever since he had gotten addicted to gambling, he had lost all of his savings after gambling several times. His family even paid his debts of over a hundred thousand dollars. In the end, they couldn't sustain it and lost faith in him.</p><br/><p>*Dong dong!*</p><br/><p>\"Son, come out and eat!\" a hoarse female voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\"Don't disturb me. I'm extremely stressed now. Do you have money? Give me some money,\" Chen Qiang shouted. All he could think of was to look for money so that he could win back what he had lost.</p><br/><p>\"Son, there's really no more money at home. Stop gambling, you'll never win them.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang replied, \"What do you mean by that? I was just unlucky. People can easily win a few million dollars from there within two or three rounds. I don't want to talk about it anymore. You wouldn't understand it anyway.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the house became silent. Only a long sigh could be heard.</p><br/><p>Then, his phone rang. There was another message.</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang was shocked. Who could it be? Could it be that his friend was going to lend him money?</p><br/><p>But when he saw the text, he sighed. That fella actually sent him a link to a broadcast. At the same time, he added a sentence.</p><br/><p>\"Look at this yourself. Only a fool like you would end up like that.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn. You're just asking for a beating!\" Chen Qiang was extremely angry when he saw the message. In the past, this person used to call him 'brother' and was polite to him. But now, he actually called him a fool.</p><br/><p>A 'good brother' indeed.</p><br/><p>Then, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Qiang, are you going today? I heard the hosts are really unlucky today. There was a fella who managed to win everything after betting fifty thousand dollars!\" a demonic voice came through the phone and tried to lure Chen Qiang.</p><br/><p>\"Is that really true?\" Chen Qiang was shocked. He felt that he could do that too.</p><br/><p>\"Of course it's true! I'm just going to stop here. Decide if you want to go. If you miss it, it'll be gone!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang replied, \"D*mn! I really want to go but I don't have any money now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, do you know who are we? How could we let Brother Qiang have no money? I'll help you settle that. You have to bring the certificate to your house along. If not, it'd be difficult to help you. But don't worry, you'll definitely win today. Then, you'll be on cloud nine.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang hesitated for a moment. \"Alright, no problem. I'll go look for it now. I'm not sure where my mum kept it.\"</p><br/><p>He hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang was shaken by how someone had won so much money. He felt that it had given him a chance to earn back his losses. How could he miss such a good opportunity like this?</p><br/><p>He was extremely angry when he thought of the guy that refused to even lend him $1000. He wanted to look for him after he recouped his losses.</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>He pulled the door but it was locked.</p><br/><p>\"Open the door!\" Chen Qiang shouted.</p><br/><p>\"I won't open it even if you kill me. I heard your conversation. If you take our last possession there, we would be left with nothing.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang was extremely infuriated. \"Mum, you have to believe me. I will be able to win everything back this time. Don't stop me from achieving great things.\"</p><br/><p>They shouted at each other for almost twenty minutes but the door was still locked.</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang was extremely anxious. Then, he laid down on his bed and started to think of a plan. But he felt hopeless after a while because he simply couldn't think of a way to open it.</p><br/><p>He tried to make a call to someone but the person was in the midst of another call. In the end, he just clicked on the link that had been sent to him. He wanted to see what it was.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast, the host was talking.</p><br/><p>\"The most miserable person in the world is one who's addicted to gambling even though he/she is broke. This person will definitely not be able to turn over a new leaf if he/she sinks deeper into gambling.\"</p><br/><p>\"Someone once asked what's the best you can achieve with gambling and now I can tell all of you the answer. The best thing you can achieve is stopping gambling. When you do not gamble, your heart does not yearn for it. That's when you can finally defeat it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Time is money. When you're seated at the gambling table, you're already losing money.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang wasn't exactly listening to these words but his eyes stared intently at Lin Fan's hands.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was chatting with the netizens but he was fiddling with the cards in his hands. He had gotten every single card he wanted. It was so quick that everyone couldn't catch up with what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang exclaimed, \"The God of Gambling\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

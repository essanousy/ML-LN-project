Even though there isn\u2019t much use for it, but being able to clean stains is really convenient.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan managed to clean the entire stall. He happily walked around the stall to confirm that he didn\u2019t leave out any stains, then he burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>It looked as if Fraud Tian had seen a ghost when he laid his eyes on the stall.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! You cleaned it so thoroughly it\u2019s as though its a new one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had a very stunned expression. Never did she expect that Brother Lin was able to clean the stall till a near-new condition. Even though there were certain dents here and there, it was spotless. It looked brand new!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cIt\u2019s so clean!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian could not help saying, \u201cAmazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan proudly said, \u201cThat proves it! I just said it, I\u2019m the God of Cleaning! This is a small problem. It\u2019s a piece of cake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan stared at the door. There were many stains above it. He excited said, \u201cBring the ladder here! I\u2019m going to clean the top of the door! Our sole motive for today is to clean the shop! We\u2019re going to make it look completely new!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan laughed, \u201cOkay! Time for spring cleaning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was now full of energy. Having gained a new power, he wanted to show it off.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone began doing their work.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood at the top of the ladder and began wiping the top of the door.</p><br/><p>Not after long, Elder Zhang also began wiping the glass of his own house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned his head around, \u201cElder Zhang, you\u2019re also cleaning up to stay hygienic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang laughed, \u201cOf course! The little boss is cleaning the front of his shop! Being your neighbor, I can\u2019t be one step behind you! So I have to clean my shop as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Lin Fan laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>However, something even more shocking happened!</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners all joined him in cleaning their own respective shops.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was shocked, \u201cWhy are you all cleaning as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>From the opposite, Sister Hong laughed, \u201cLittle boss, we\u2019re following you. We can\u2019t lose to you. And looking at it, we haven\u2019t cleaned the front of our shops for quite some time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the shops all clean, the townsfolk would feel more comfortable!\u201d Elder Liang added.</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan originally wanted to do was to test his new gained powers. Little did he know that he would be leading the entire Cloud Street to clean their shops.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Auntie Gao, who was dragging the garbage truck along, walked by. She couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cLittle boss, what made you feel like spring cleaning today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThat\u2019s because I saw that the shop was too dirty! How about you, Auntie Gao? Why are you here? Isn\u2019t it your rest day today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao was a sanitation worker here. Together with two others, they were in charge of the hygiene here at Cloud Street. She had a good relationship with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have nothing to do at home. After thinking about it, it\u2019s still best that I come down here.\u201d Auntie Gao\u2019s husband passed away due to illness very long ago. Her children were also studying overseas. And so she was staying all alone in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cThen go and do your thing, Auntie Gao! But remember to rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao replied, \u201cIn all the places I\u2019ve worked at, Cloud Street is the cleanest street around! Every day, it\u2019s simply just sweeping the floor and clearing the rubbish and that\u2019s about it. Please don\u2019t make it more difficult for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The business owners at Cloud Street improved their way of life. They no longer throw their rubbish randomly around the area and this has helped ease the burden for the sanitation workers.</p><br/><p>After Auntie Gao left, Lin Fan went back to giving his all in his work.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk who were strolling down the street were also shocked to see the shop owners cleaning their shops. However, they were happy because a clean shop allows them to feel comfortable.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In front.</p><br/><p>One of the sanitation workers was dragging a rubbish bin along when he came across two young girls, each with a dog. One of these dogs took a dump on the street floor. However, the girls only concerned themselves with their mobile phones and therefore didn\u2019t realize what their dog just did.</p><br/><p>The sanitation worker went up to them and said, \u201cGood morning, if you don\u2019t mind, please clean up your dog\u2019s droppings.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two girls took a glance at the sanitation worker then looked at their dogs. After which, they then walked the dogs to one side while still using their phones, completely ignoring the worker.</p><br/><p>The sanitation worker merely stared at them, then shook her head in disgust. She currently did not have the appropriate tools at hand and hence it was inconvenient to clean it up. All she could do was to continue bringing the rubbish bin to the intended place then come back here to clean it up.</p><br/><p>Now before long, Auntie Gao passed by this area and she saw the feces on the ground. She stopped her truck without thinking twice and picked up the feces using the tools. However, just at this moment, the dog that another girl was holding took another dump.</p><br/><p>That girl saw this and with a can\u2019t-be-bothered tone, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s some here too. Clean it up as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao went up to her and said, \u201cYou guys should bring your own paper towels so you can clean it up yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words itself did not insinuate anything, but the two girls got pissed off and started raging. One of the taller girls, who was wearing a cap, said in an annoyed tone, \u201cHow annoying can you sanitation workers get? Is it wrong to make you guys clean a little? If not, what\u2019s the point of having you guys around?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorter girl beside her decided to join the fray, \u201cWhy are you so full of bullsh*t?\u201d she argued as she pointed her finger at Auntie Gao.</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao heaved a sigh. Why were these two young ladies so ignorant? She proceeded to swat her finger away, \u201cLadies, you can\u2019t be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorter girl had a complete change of expression to one of anger and rage, \u201cWho let you use your dirty hands to touch me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao said, \u201cLadies, you can\u2019t be this unreasonable. This is a public place. If your dog decides to take a dump at random places, you ought to clean it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The taller girl then added fuel to the flames, \u201cDo you know what our dog is? Let me tell you. This dog is worth more than your life! I gave you the opportunity to clean yet you can still complain? If it weren\u2019t for them, you wouldn\u2019t even have this job!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of people raging could be heard.</p><br/><p>The nearby people came to surround them.</p><br/><p>Some of the younger ones wanted to uphold justice but when they saw that the two girls were pretty and cute, all they did was quietly stand to one side.</p><br/><p>If they were just normal-looking girls, they would definitely stand up to uphold justice for the sanitation workers. However, these were two pretty girls. They decided to forget it.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the business owners surrounded them. \u201cSister Gao, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao shook her head, \u201cNothing much. Only that these two girl\u2019s pet took a dump here. I merely suggested that they bring paper towels in future so they can clean it up themselves. I don\u2019t know how I provoked them, but they got angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the bosses took a look, then said, \u201cWhat do you two ladies think you\u2019re doing? You\u2019re supposed to clean up after your pets. Are you trying to bully others?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two girls did not want to back down. \u201cWhat business do you have with this? You have so many dogs around here. Do they not take a dump around randomly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dogs at Cloud Street have better morals than yours. They know where the toilet is.\u201d The boss said furiously.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was at the top of the ladder cleaning the top of the door when he realized that there was a commotion going on in the distance. He then asked, \u201cFraud! What\u2019s going on there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian took a glance, \u201cI don\u2019t think. It shouldn\u2019t be anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a little fatty came running to them, \u201cUncle Lin, there\u2019s a fight going on there. Auntie Gao is getting scolded by someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>This little fatty was the son of Elder Chang. On a daily basis, he would run around Cloud Street being nosy. Whenever something happens, he would run to Lin Fan to report to him.</p><br/><p>If something big was really happening, this little fatty definitely had to report to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan climbed down the ladder. He put down his tools on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

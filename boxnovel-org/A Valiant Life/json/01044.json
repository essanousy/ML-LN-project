Even with his status, he felt as if all of this was surreal and unbelievable.</p><br/><p>He knew Mayor Zhang because he had interacted with Mayor Zhang at a commercial summit before. At that time, Mayor Zhang had talked to him in hopes of getting him to open his business in Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>Today, Mayor Zhang had come too and Huang Ting had personally gone forward to shake his hand but Mayor Zhang hadn\u2019t been focused on him at all. Instead, Mayor Zhang had just shaken his hand simply and said a few words.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if Mayor Zhang didn\u2019t even care much that Huang Ting was there as well. He had placed all his attention on that Master Lin and Huang Ting\u2019s ex-classmate.</p><br/><p>Initially, Huang Ting had thought that his ex-classmate was just putting on an act. But now, it was clear that it wasn\u2019t an act. He was really that amazing.</p><br/><p>No, the right thing to say would be that his ex-classmate\u2019s son was amazing.</p><br/><p>What did those words \u2018Master Lin\u2019 represent?</p><br/><p>As someone who was part of the commercial world, how could Huang Ting not know? Those words represented someone who was unmatched in the whole of China.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge was completely dumbfounded. He hadn\u2019t expected to see Master Lin in person. Initially, he had felt as if he had seen this guy somewhere before. Later on, when Wu Huan Yue came, he connected the dots and figured out that he was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Right now, this topic of conversation was known throughout the Internet. Wu You Lan had connections with Master Lin. If Master Lin hadn\u2019t supported her, how could she have risen so quickly?</p><br/><p>And Wu Huan Yue had acted so intimately with this guy since her arrival. Their relationship was clearly not a normal one.</p><br/><p>In the end, Huang Yun Ge connected the dots and confirmed that this guy was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But the only selfie on his Weibo was really too well-taken. It looked just a little different from the actual person.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, your son is really incredible,\u201d said Huang Ting in amazement. At the same time, he felt a little ashamed.</p><br/><p>He had thought that he could view things arrogantly just because he had money.</p><br/><p>When that Master Lin had shaken hands with him and greeted him, he had only thought that this guy was well-mannered and that Elder Lin had taught him well.</p><br/><p>But now that he thought about it, he had really embarrassed himself.</p><br/><p>Elder Lin chuckled. \u201cSigh, this kid mixes around blindly in Shanghai. I don\u2019t even know what he does. His mom and I don\u2019t really ask him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin felt that his ex-classmate was feeling a little embarrassed but he didn\u2019t want his ex-classmate to feel that way. After all, it was a rare opportunity for them to gather together to celebrate his birthday.</p><br/><p>If he let his ex-classmate feel as if he had used this birthday banquet to show off, his ex-classmate wouldn\u2019t be willing to meet him again.</p><br/><p>The classmates at those two tables looked at each other as they all seemed a little awkward. They had been talking nonstop previously about how Elder Lin had done some things badly and how he was fake.</p><br/><p>But looking at the current situation, all those things were not true at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, that\u2019s amazing. I didn\u2019t know your son was so amazing. With one look now, I can tell that your son is outstanding,\u201d said Zhang Hao with a smile. It was as if he didn\u2019t feel like what he had said previously was inappropriate.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mother looked at the gifts on the dining table, then at Elder Lin\u2019s situation, and she shook her head.</p><br/><p>Right now, her thoughts were all about her son and those four ladies. She wondered what exactly his relationship with them was.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>There were many people inside. When the four ladies entered, Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan with a different gaze.</p><br/><p>It seemed to him that this brother of his was not simple at all. He really couldn\u2019t see through him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang went to Lin Fan\u2019s side and patted his shoulder. \u201cAwesome. You\u2019re really awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Wang Ming Yang helplessly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. What\u2019s so awesome about me? You\u2019re the awesome one.\u201d</p><br/><p>But right now, he was thinking about something. And that was how he should explain this. His mother was not stupid.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao saw that Brother Lin looked uneasy, so she said cautiously, \u201cBrother Lin, was it a bad time for me to come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not you. I\u2019m just thinking about something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>What else could he have said in this situation?</p><br/><p>She had come over to celebrate his father\u2019s birthday. Could he have replied \u2018Yeah, you all really drew too much attention. Couldn\u2019t you have come separately?\u2019</p><br/><p>If he had really said that, it would have been very hurtful. Hence, he decided to just endure it.</p><br/><p>As for how he would resolve this, he would have to think of a way.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao went in front of the other three ladies. \u201cI\u2019m Yun Xue Yao from Hao Jiang. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Sun Tzu said, if you know yourself and know your enemy, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. She wanted to find out who these three people were first.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Wu You Lan. I\u2019m an employee at Brother Lin\u2019s shop,\u201d said Wu You Lan generously without hiding anything.</p><br/><p>But to Yun Xue Yao, it seemed impossible for such a beautiful lady to be a shop employee. Hence, she thought that this was a strong competitor. She had actually given up everything for Brother Lin and worked in his shop. Yun Xue Yao had to admit that that was incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Wu Huan Yue and I mainly work in the entertainment circle,\u201d said Wu Huang Yue with a smile.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao smiled back and nodded. Being in the entertainment circle meant that she was very busy. When Yun Xue Yao looked over at the last lady, she felt that this person had a cold demeanor and she gave off the feeling of a queen.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu looked at the three of them and she introduced herself, \u201cLiu Xu. But you don\u2019t need to worry about me. I don\u2019t have much of a relationship with your Brother Lin. If you have to talk about relationships, you could say we have a grudge against each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made Yun Xue Yao a little embarrassed. After all, she had put it so bluntly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright, alright. Since you\u2019re all here, let\u2019s have a meal together. I was prepared to organize another event to call you all here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed. \u201cThat excuse is a little too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Don\u2019t believe me if you don\u2019t want to. Let\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat,\u201d Lin Fan said. Right now, they had all been arranged. Whether they believed him or not, it didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><br/><p>Right now, the most worrying thing was what his mother had asked the four of them.</p><br/><p>Apart from Liu Xu, he was uncertain about the other three of them.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>The private room doors were pushed open.</p><br/><p>His parents entered.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin said, \u201cSon, your uncles and aunties are here to propose a toast to your friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, those big shots who had been chatting happily with Lin Fan stopped. Especially since Master Lin\u2019s parents had personally come over, they had to give them some face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed and then introduced them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncles and Aunties, let me give you all an introduction. Later on, everyone can just be together. There\u2019s no need to separate anymore.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

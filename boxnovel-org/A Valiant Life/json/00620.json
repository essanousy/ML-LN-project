Why do I feel that it isn\u2019t someone good?\u201d Wu You Lan brought tea over. Thereafter, she stood behind Lin Fan and gave him a shoulder massage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cIf you all know that it is someone bad, then it\u2019s definitely someone bad. Ma Mu Feng of Qingzhou, also known as Ma Qingzhou, has requested me to treat his illness. How will that be possible? He has done so many bad things. If I were to help him, won\u2019t it just cause more inconvenience to others? It\u2019s better if I cut the call earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Qingzhou.\u201d Wu Tian He was slightly distracted. Then, it seemed like he suddenly thought of something. \u201cThis person isn\u2019t one to mess with. In Qingzhou, he has a certain status. He could take both right and wrong. Back then, I helped an important figure to read his fortune, and I heard him say that they had originally intended to catch Ma Qingzhou in one swift operation, but there were people above who was protecting him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like his guy has some skill.\u201d Lin Fan smiled as if he didn\u2019t care at all. Previously, he didn\u2019t care, but now, it seems that he doesn\u2019t even want to bother himself.</p><br/><p>However, he really wanted to test this Ma Qingzhou. Being someone of justice, whenever he met with injustice, it would only be natural that he would want to solve the matter. He didn\u2019t have anything to do these days anyway, so messing with this guy won\u2019t be that big of a deal.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t say that this was looking for trouble when there isn\u2019t one in the first place. As someone of justice, even if the problem had no connection with oneself, he or she should still solve the matter.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He nodded his head, \u201cYes, take care of yourself. It\u2019s best you don\u2019t leave Shanghai. This person is very influential in Qingzhou, but he can\u2019t do much in Shanghai with that many pairs of eyes looking for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan blindly worshipped, \u201cI don\u2019t care anyways. All I know is that Brother Lin is awesome. This Ma Qingzhou wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wu You Lan\u2019s hand. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cOnly you are the smartest here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang, despite being a famous live-streaming anchor, didn\u2019t know what these two people were talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Wu, we\u2019re now living in a harmonious society. How can such radicals still exist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He shook his head, \u201cYoung Zhao, our society isn\u2019t as simple as you think. There was a hierarchy in the past and so does the present. Ma Qingzhou isn\u2019t the only person in Qingzhou. Let\u2019s talk about somewhere further. In the entire country, except for Shanghai and the Capital, there are still many local tyrants. It is only that you have not experienced any of that, if not you would understand. It\u2019s only that Ma Qingzhou contacting Master Lin is rather unexpected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, let\u2019s not talk about it anymore. Who cares about whatever Ma he is. It has nothing to do with me.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He switched on his phone. In the evening, he looked it up online,</p><br/><p>He inputted \u201cMa Qingzhou\u201d.</p><br/><p>There was indeed much news about him. This news weren\u2019t on the major websites, but rather, they were on the forums, as well as certain smaller websites.</p><br/><p>The latest news was all at least a year old.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe that such a presumptuous person would not cause problems. He\u2019s definitely suppressing the news.</p><br/><p>After all, this b*stard was called \u201cMa Qingzhou\u201d. He must definitely be hiding in the shadows in Qingzhou. Not only would he have runners, but he would also have many supporters. There really isn\u2019t anyone there that dares to make a report.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe brutal demolition of Qingzhou\u2019s old city, originally compensating 10,000 dollars per square meter, was forced by unscrupulous merchants to only 3,000 dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrief! Reports from somewhere away from the Capital says that many were brought back by the people of Ma Qingzhou overnight. After three months in the dark house, they suffered numerous beats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Qingzhou killed someone while drunk driving. To distort the truth, it was said that he was driving normally when the person ran onto the road. He paid money to resolve the matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Just by searching these up, it had really shocked Lin Fan. He never expected that this person would be so evil, so much so that there was simply no law.</p><br/><p>As for those suffering injustice in Qingzhou, they had no platform to extend for help. Even if they were to attempt to make a report, they would be kidnapped in the streets and would have to suffer torture.</p><br/><p>All these information was found in the smaller sections of the Internet and did not appear on the media, resulting in it not being able to catch the attention of others.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ma Qingzhou also had other identities.</p><br/><p>Qingzhou\u2019s Top Ten Outstanding Entrepreneurs.</p><br/><p>Qingzhou\u2019s Top Ten Philanthropists.</p><br/><p>Etc.</p><br/><p>Looking at these achievements, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Wasn\u2019t this rather humiliating?</p><br/><p>Such a person like him was still able to have such titles? It\u2019s really a joke.</p><br/><p>However, since things were already like that, he couldn\u2019t let the other party go. He hated Ma Qingzhou. If he did, would he be able to live up to the \u2018Good Citizen Award\u2019 that hung on his wall?</p><br/><p>He opened Weibo.</p><br/><p>Something big has happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cMa Mu Feng of Qingzhou, also known as Ma Qingzhou, is sick and therefore requires treatment. Being someone capable of healing others, no matter if rich or poor, the doctor in me would not just sit by and do nothing. However, from what I know, Ma Qingzhou is a bad person. He has a deep history and has done many bad deeds. He is supported by a group of supporters and has run rampage in Qingzhou. As a result, he has been immediately rejected by me. For anyone else that knows anything more, please leave a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this Weibo was sent out, it caused an instantaneous burst of responses.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He scrolled through Weibo, and with an expression of shock, he looked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2026\u201d Wu Tian He didn\u2019t know what to say. Normal people wouldn\u2019t know who this Ma Qingzhou was. However, he must have known that he was definitely a cruel person. Right now, Master Lin was provoking the other party, which was as good as digging his own grave!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out loud, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just making the first move. I want to see what Ma Qingzhou intends on doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He shook his head. He didn\u2019t know what else to say. He just took Lin Fan\u2019s word for it.</p><br/><p>At least, as long as he was in Shanghai, nothing would happen.</p><br/><p>Weibo exploded with activity.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Master Lin is back! How shocking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Ma Qingzhou. He has such a big title. It\u2019s rather intense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDone many bad deeds. Has a long history. And has supporters. One look and you can tell this person is bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI stand by Master Lin\u2019s point. If the other party is bad, then he definitely cannot help to treat his illness. Who knows how many others he can harm if his illness is treated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am someone from Qingzhou. This Ma Qingzhou is the local tyrant here. Even the officials here have to give way to him. It can even be said that there\u2019s no law here. He has done many bad deeds but no one has dared to do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA portion of my land was sold to him at a lower price because he sent men to torture me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething big happened in Qingzhou last time. This Ma Qingzhou beat someone to death in a company. The victim\u2019s family members wanted to bring this matter up, but he immediately sent people the catch these people. We don\u2019t even know what the situation is until today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is corrupted as hell. Many influential people are working in collaboration with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen there was a campaign against illegal activities, many of them were shut down. Only his business continued to run. Who would believe that there isn\u2019t suspicious going on here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Ma Qingzhou is so powerful. Wouldn\u2019t Master Lin be afraid something might happen to him with him going head to head with this Ma Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan casually replied on Weibo, \u201cJustice doesn\u2019t rest when fighting against evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Weibo exploded in activity again.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026, I\u2019m satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Master Lin I admire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to write down everything I know to let you guys see how bad of a person is Ma Qingzhou is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was now a big shot on Weibo. He had many followers all over the country. With just one Weibo sent out, he immediately caused such a big influence.</p><br/><p>However, many still did not know who this Ma Qingzhou was and had no choice but to check him up online. They could still gather information from the smaller websites.</p><br/><p>The information on the smaller websites was put up to redress the injustice. They put up their own experiences up on the forums, hoping that someone would take notice of it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

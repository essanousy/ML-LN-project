What the f*ck is going on?</p><br/><p>These guys dare to assault the police\u2026</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the scene, he saw the two men beaten onto the ground. He was shocked. Then, he asked in disbelief, \"Fraud Tian, why do those two men who are getting beaten look like policemen?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was dumbfounded as well. \"They don't just look like policemen. They are.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck!\"</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Lin Fan went forward and with a kick to each of them, he kicked those guys away. Then, he helped Ren Jun up. At that point, Ren Jun's face was covered in blood. He shouted anxiously, \"My student is there, hurry up and rescue him!\"</p><br/><p>At the other side, a young man was cradling his head while being hit. He was curled up on the ground, trying to protect himself.</p><br/><p>\"You guys must have eaten a f*cking leopard's guts.\" Lin Fan sent a kick flying at each of them and rescued Zhou Jia Cai from the attack. The two of them were in similar conditions. Both of them were injured.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui, who had been attacking them the whole time, said, \"If you weren't wearing this uniform, I would've beaten you to death today!\" After saying that, he went behind and picked up his things before returning back to the same spot.</p><br/><p>\"You guys have obstructed law enforcement and affected the reputation of the city. You even attacked us. You better be honest about this,\" said Qiu Zhong Dui in an arrogant tone. It was as if he didn't think anything of these two policemen at all.</p><br/><p>Ren Jun had been a policeman for over ten years but he had never come across such an incident. He had only seen such incidents on the news and he had never thought that he would experience it for himself.</p><br/><p>Ren Jun pointed at them. \"You're all just bandits\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui scolded, \"What did you say? I'll bring you into our car and take you to your bureau chief. We have to question you about why you obstructed our law enforcement activities.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk had taken out their phones and were recording this scene. To them, these people were too unbridled. They even dared to be so unbridled in front of policemen. Even arrogance was an understatement. They were lawless.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan had to step up. This incident was sure to become big news and Lin Fan had to go on the news more often. It wouldn't only be to promote justice but he would also be able to go on the headlines and gain some reputation. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at those people and said, \"Don't you have too much guts? You know what they are and yet you still dare to attack them?\"</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui said, \"We are safeguarding the reputation of this city. Our leader is a government official and theirs is just a bureau chief. They have no right to care about what we do or to obstruct our law enforcement.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was broadcasting. \"Brothers, take a look. These people are too unbridled. Everyone, please record this and post it on the Internet for everyone to see just what kind of people they are.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! I'm a city enforcement officer and I'm ashamed to be the same as them!\"</p><br/><p>\"They're too unbridled. They're really too unbridled.\"</p><br/><p>\"I understand now why they're so brave. Their leader is a government official, the number one person-in-charge.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brothers, nowadays, in order to improve their track records, there's nothing those leaders won't do. They'll do anything to make their city look good. And if people don't cooperate, they just take them down by force. This is to attract people and investments so that in the end, they can improve their track records to give themselves a boost. If anyone obstructs them, they take it as a challenge to their authority.\"</p><br/><p>\"The person above is right. Nowadays, these people are so mighty and formidable just because of that.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's a little one-sided. Our current Shanghai leaders are actually very good. I think those people are just anomalies, trying to wave a chicken feather as a token of authority.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui pointed at Zhao Zhong Yang. \"What are you filming? Delete the video!\"</p><br/><p>With Master Lin around, Zhao Zhong Yang was not one bit afraid. \"I'm just filming. If you're not doing any shameful deeds, then you shouldn't be scared of me recording this. Are you going to snatch my phone over? Keep dreaming.\"</p><br/><p>The shop owners of Cloud Street yelled, \"F*ck your moms! Stop bullying people, otherwise, we'll fight you.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, what are you holding a vegetable knife for? Hurry up and put it back. Are you trying to cause trouble for Little Boss? We'll use brooms instead.\"</p><br/><p>\"We're not afraid of a battle. We won't lose.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and put it back. Bring the brooms here. Don't cause trouble for Little Boss.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The shop owners had high morale. They were completely fearless. They all stood behind Little Boss. If these guys came at them, they had nothing to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was losing his patience. He wanted very badly to just use his moves to chase these guys away.</p><br/><p>One of the men stepped forward and said, \"Give me the phone.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang took a step back and held the phone behind his back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath. He couldn't take it any longer. With a furious move of his right leg, he flung a kick at the man. The kick sent the man flying backward several meters.</p><br/><p>\"Nobody move. If anyone moves, I'll make sure you become crippled.</p><br/><p>With that one kick, he had established his authority.</p><br/><p>The entrance of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Several police cars arrived.</p><br/><p>When Head Chief Wang got off the car and saw the scene, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Shao Jie immediately went forward. \"Head Chief, you're here! Qiu Zhong Dui and the rest couldn't be stopped! If we don't end this quickly, there'll be trouble.\"</p><br/><p>With a grave expression on his face, Head Chief Wang said, \"What are all of you doing? You're all just watching them cause trouble?\"</p><br/><p>Shao Jie said, \"Head Chief, we had no choice. They're already in a rage. Moreover, just now, they...they\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang's face was so gloomy that it was scary, \"They what? Speak clearly.\"</p><br/><p>Shao Jie said, \"There were two policemen patrolling and they attacked the policemen.\"</p><br/><p>When he heard this, Head Chief Wang lost it. He roared with anger, \"Did they eat a leopard's guts? Come, if they dare to resist us, we'll detain all of them!\"</p><br/><p>Shao Jie replied, \"Yes sir\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had brought his men along. When he heard these words, he said to his policemen, \"Follow me.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was a crisis going on between the two sides. Lin Fan was unafraid. If the other side were to attack him, he wouldn't hold back. If he crippled them, then so be it. He would attack with killing intent. They asked for it and they couldn't blame Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>As for what the outcome would be, he didn't think about it. He decided to just fight first and think later.</p><br/><p>\"Everybody stop\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud bellow came from afar.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui saw who had come and was startled. \"Head Chief\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang looked at the men and pointed at them. He said sarcastically, \"Good. You're all good. You're all so capable.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian came to Lin Fan's side. Then, he looked at the two policemen who were being supported. His expression changed. \"What happened to them?\"</p><br/><p>The situation was grave. It was very grave.</p><br/><p>\"These two dear policemen were beaten by them. They even said that if the policemen weren't wearing their uniforms, they would've been beaten to death,\" said the surrounding townsfolk.</p><br/><p>Back when Liu Xiao Tian had still been a city enforcement officer, what he hated most was violent enforcement. After he had become a policeman, he hated it even more when people didn't distinguish between right and wrong. When he heard that those people dared to attack these policemen, he was furious.</p><br/><p>When he had been a city enforcement officer, he would never dare to hit a policeman because they were the ones who truly safeguarded the peace and stability of society.</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officers wore uniforms similar to those of policemen and the townsfolk weren't able to distinguish them. In the end, the police took all the blame for incidents like these.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said to Liu Xiao Tian, \"I'll leave this matter in your hands.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded, then pointed at those people. \"Detain all of them. Knowing the law, yet still breaking them and even attacking policemen, you all are too lawless.\"</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui and the rest protested, \"What are you doing? What are you trying to do?\"</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang sent a palm flying into his face. He bellowed, \"Shut up! Just wait for your punishment. Being sacked will be the least of your worries.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

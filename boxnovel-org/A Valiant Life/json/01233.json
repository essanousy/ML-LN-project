We don\u2019t have to rush,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Zhong Yang came over with his phone. \u201cHuan Yue, I\u2019m on a broadcast now, and the netizens would like to cheer you on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue took the phone and looked at the camera. She said, \u201cHi everyone, I am Wu Huan Yue. Thank you for your support.\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole broadcasting room went wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough talking, just donate presents now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the best! Bring back the championship crown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we will always support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens continuously gave presents while Zhao Zhong Yang was standing behind her. When he saw the large amount of presents, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you everyone! I will do my best!\u201d Wu Huan Yue said.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re reading on ReadReadNovelFull .com Thanks!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation and smiled. It was a good idea for a broadcast so that Huan Yue could relax for a bit.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice could be heard from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll be heading outside for the broadcast.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang wanted to go to the venue to broadcast it live so that the netizens could have an idea of what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go ahead.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>The host was speaking outside, but nobody could understand what he was saying.</p><br/><p>However, they looked at the screen, and the situation was similar to competitions in China. There were four judges, and they were really famous and influential.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan felt that there was no difference.</p><br/><p>He looked at the screen and the judges, which consisted of two males and two females. They were in their forties. Although the competition had not started, the four judges were really excited.</p><br/><p>After all, this was a competition between singers, and the quality this year was insanely good. As judges, it was normal for them to be ecstatic.</p><br/><p>In another room.</p><br/><p>Jin Can was beginning to be nervous. On the way to the room, she saw a handful of famous singers whose songs she had heard before.</p><br/><p>Now that she saw these singers, she felt an immense pressure.</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya looked at Jin Can and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Can shook her head, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she did not say much, he could hear that she was nervous. However, there was no point in being nervous now.</p><br/><p><em>ding dong</em></p><br/><p>At this moment, the workers came over to let Jin Can know that she was the first singer to perform.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d Jin Can looked at her number tag and realised it was really the number one. This made her even more nervous. She kept trying to calm herself down.</p><br/><p>However, it was not very effective.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s your turn. All the best,\u201d Director Zhang said.</p><br/><p>Jin Can nodded and took a deep breath before leaving the room. Then, she walked towards the stage.</p><br/><p>There was a huge crowd, and they were there to listen to beautiful melodies.</p><br/><p>When the first singer came out, they were stunned. They wondered why an Asian participant was there.</p><br/><p>Even the four judges were stunned. They started to check their list of participants.</p><br/><p>One of the judges with wavy hair was the famous singer Abigail. She asked, \u201cAre you from China?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Can said nervously, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the crowd laughed. It was uncommon to see Chinese people sing English songs. Hence, they felt that it was a little strange.</p><br/><p>It would be the same if a foreigner were to sing Chinese songs too. The pronunciation would be a little off.</p><br/><p>The male judge, Ralph, who was also a famous singer, said, \u201cLet\u2019s begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The music started to play.</p><br/><p>The netizens who were watching the broadcast watched intently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s starting. I didn\u2019t expect Jin Can to be the first singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough she is a little annoying, she\u2019s still one of us. We should cheer her on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, she can\u2019t let us down. She has to do her best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens did not want to speak further. They wanted to cheer her on.</p><br/><p>At that moment, something went wrong.</p><br/><p>As the music played, Jin Can stood there without opening her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Ralph said as he raised his hand. He furrowed his brows unhappily. He felt that this singer was a little under the weather and that the mistake was amateur.</p><br/><p>Abigail was also in disbelief. She opened up her arms and looked around as if to say that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>The crowd was also in disbelief. They seemed a little restless and started murmuring.</p><br/><p>The chatter got to Jin Can, and her face turned pale as if she had been struck by a blow.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re reading on ReadReadNovelFull .com Thanks!</p><br/><p>In the changing room.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang was stunned. \u201cD*mn, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya was also stunned. He had not expected this at all.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jin Can just stood on stage. All she could hear was chatter. She felt really helpless.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she heard something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you daydreaming? Buck up and believe in yourself. Stop being nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Can turned around to look at the crowd. She did not expect someone to be cheering her on.</p><br/><p>It was Master Lin!</p><br/><p>Although it was a little dark, she could still recognise his voice.</p><br/><p>She did not expect Master Lin to be encouraging her at a time like this.</p><br/><p>Then, she took a deep breath and spoke to the judges, \u201cSorry, can I please have another chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>The judges looked at each other and nodded.</p><br/><p>In the guest room.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned. \u201cHow could you cheer her on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019re overseas and we\u2019re representing China. Rivalry doesn\u2019t change that fact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian thought about it for a moment and replied, \u201cThat makes sense. If she screws up, although it would feel great, the foreigners would think of us differently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and patted Wu Huan Yue on her shoulder. \u201cJust do your best later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jin Can started to sing, and it was pretty decent.</p><br/><p>She pronounced the words correctly, and it was not awkward.</p><br/><p>The four judges nodded, and the chatter among the crowd slowly vanished.</p><br/><p>When she finished the song, everyone clapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cAt least she did not let us down.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>knock knock</em></p><br/><p>Someone knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>When they opened it, they realised it was Jin Can standing outside.</p><br/><p>Jin Can looked at Lin Fan and bowed. \u201cThank you, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>After expressing her gratitude, she left hurriedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. Although it would have felt great to embarrass her, he did not want the foreigners to look down on China.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had thought of many outcomes but he had never thought that it would end up like this.</p><br/><p>They had so many people here but they couldn\u2019t even touch the opposition\u2019s sleeve. If this were to be made known, how embarrassing would it be?</p><br/><p>Looking at the members around, they all looked as if they didn\u2019t want to live anymore. They had been humiliated. However, it was lucky that there were no outsiders around. At least they could protect their faces.</p><br/><p>At the association entrance.</p><br/><p>As an Internet celebrity on Weibo, when Zhou Qing found out that Master Lin was coming to crush the Beijing association, he had come immediately.</p><br/><p>On the way, he had thought of many possibilities. The biggest possibility was that Master Lin would come to a consensus with the association. After all, what kind of society were they living in? How could he just come here and crush them?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Master Lin was a public figure too. He would surely mind his own image.</p><br/><p>After all, public figures nowadays all paid attention to these things.</p><br/><p>But when Zhou Qing reached the entrance, he was completely dumbfounded by the scene before him. Then, he slowly took out his phone and captured the scene in front of him.</p><br/><p>He had not expected that the electric door of the association would actually have collapsed to the ground. Could it mean that Master Lin had really crushed the association?</p><br/><p>If that was the case, it meant that the situation had really exploded.</p><br/><p>Then, he quickly posted the photo onto Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cLatest update: Master Lin has already made his move. Attached is the photo of the association\u2019s electric door which has collapsed.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post was sent, the netizens, who had been waiting for a long time, saw it and lost their minds.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is this true? He has really begun crushing them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is way too scary. This is the Beijing association! Things have completely gotten out of hand. It\u2019s as if he won\u2019t rest until he dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. Master Lin really sticks to what he says. Who would still dare to quarrel with Master Lin on the Internet after this? He takes his quarrels very seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, hurry up and take a look inside. We will definitely be waiting here for more updates.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were all stunned. Initially, they had thought that perhaps Master Lin was just boasting. He might just go over there to negotiate. However, who would have thought that he would really make a move on the association?</p><br/><p>This electric door was so tall and it had even been fixed to the ground. How much strength must one have had to strike it down?</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it made them terrified.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang placed his hands on his head. \u201cBrother Lin really made a move. And it was a violent move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the picture. \u201cThis is crazy. His strength is nature-defying. If it was me, I might not be able to strike the door down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Fraud, even at such a time, you\u2019re still thinking about these things.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang had no expected that this Fraud would still be thinking about these things. It was pretty awesome.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at the photo and burst into laughter. \u201cHe won\u2019t have to pay for the door, will he? It\u2019d be very expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the Shanghai association were completely stupefied as well.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei and the rest had gathered together and they were looking at their phones.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brutal. President Lin is trying to blow out the Beijing association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it ends, who knows how things would become after this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what\u2019s the situation now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here. There an update.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Internet celebrity, Zhou Qing, updated his Weibo again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tragic sight. At the second scene, the Beijing association\u2019s security guards have all been suppressed by Master Lin. I\u2019ve attached many photos of the scene. You can get a sense of the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Qing went in, he saw a group of people lying on the ground. Then, he immediately went forward to ask them some questions. As Huang Hao seethed and snarled, he captured these humiliating photos.</p><br/><p>To Huang Hao, this was an inside matter. If it were to be posted on the Internet, they would completely lose face.</p><br/><p>They had so many people in the association but they had actually been crushed by Master Lin. How would they hide their shame?</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this second update, they were completely speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan someone tell me what exactly is going on now? Could he really have crushed them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at that scene, it seems very likely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the association members. How could they be so weak? So many of them couldn\u2019t even fend off Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^You\u2019re wrong. They\u2019re not weak but Master Lin is simply not human. He\u2019s too strong. All these people were probably easily dispatched in Master Lin\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. How strong must he be to do something like this? I don\u2019t believe that such a strong person exists in this world.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Organization.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang held his phone and stared at it unblinkingly. His mouth was gaping wider and wider. You could fit an egg through his mouth.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le\u2019s filming had ended and she had come back. When she saw Ming Yang\u2019s expression, she said curiously, \u201cWhat are you looking at? You look so engrossed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at my brother charge into battle,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang as he swallowed his saliva.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected Lin Fan to really crush the association. Initially, he had thought that it was a joke. In the end, his brother would probably just go to the Beijing association to negotiate and resolve the issue.</p><br/><p>But looking at the current situation, it seemed that it had reached a point of no return.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was very curious. \u201cWhat kind of battle is Brother Lin charging into?\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew that the only person that her boyfriend would call \u2018brother\u2019 was Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>In her mind, Brother Lin was a public figure. It didn\u2019t seem possible. When she went behind Wang Ming Yang and saw what was on the phone, her delicate face gradually went through a drastic change.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, what is Brother Lin doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cHe said that he was going to crush the Beijing association. It looks like he has really done it. He wasn\u2019t kidding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody had dared to believe that Master Lin would actually crush the Beijing association. He wasn\u2019t giving the Beijing association any respect at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation around him. This Beijing association was much more imposing than the Shanghai association. With one look, you could tell that they weren\u2019t on the same level.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. That\u2019s Master Lin. He really came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t just come. He even struck down our association door. Director Huang and his men were beaten by him as well. We\u2019re done for, aren\u2019t we? If this matter spreads, we would become a laughing stock.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. A single person crushing an association. When I saw Master Lin\u2019s Weibo, I thought it was a joke. I didn\u2019t think it was real.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Lin shouted at the people over there, \u201cMay I ask where your president is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Beijing association members raised their hands and pointed into the distance. \u201cOur president is in the conference hall, welcoming the leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and waved.</p><br/><p>Those members were stunned as they replied out of habit, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. <em>I came to crush your association but you\u2019re still so friendly to me. It looks like there are many friendly people in the world.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

Blood was being spewed all over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is steady. He\u2019s really steady. He\u2019s so steady that he can\u2019t be any steadier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were worried for him while he was eating chicken and playing cards. Doesn\u2019t his conscience hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis must be a facade. Right, it must be a facade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, when did the living conditions in detention centers get so good? I want to go to the detention center to live for some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear editors, we were wrong. We\u2019ve misunderstood you. It turns out that you didn\u2019t report the truth in order to protect us from being infuriated to death by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would dare to believe this kind of living conditions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re happy, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>That well-known reporter said helplessly, \u201cI already told you all not to chase the truth. What do you all have to say now that you know the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was not in such a good mood. He thought that Lin Fan must have been having a hard time in the detention house. He lifted his teacup and took a sip. But when he saw the news on Weibo, he couldn\u2019t help but spit everything out.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is he even f*cking human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhong Yang asked curiously, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian passed him the phone. \u201cTake a look. We\u2019ve been worrying about him but he\u2019s actually been enjoying his life inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the news. In an instant, their expressions changed drastically. Master Lin had his eyes wide open in the photo. That big chicken leg in his hand was exceptionally eye-catching. His eyes, in particular, had a gleam of puzzlement in them as if to say, \u201cI\u2019m eating chicken and playing cards. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was now thinking of a rather serious matter. That was why his task hadn\u2019t been completed yet. Could it be that what he had done wasn\u2019t enough?</p><br/><p>He had to admit that it was embarrassing. His twelfth page of knowledge was already a very valiant class of knowledge but he couldn\u2019t help but be in eager anticipation of the thirteenth page of knowledge, wondering what it would be.</p><br/><p>He had a grand ambition.</p><br/><p>And that was to become the first Super Guru who was good at everything. Even if he didn\u2019t get any sleep, he had to keep working until he achieved it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s treatment in the detention center had drawn numerous people\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>The fans who liked Lin Fan were exceptionally happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this is where Master Lin should be staying in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe government is really pretty good. Master Lin was right in doing what he did, they definitely shouldn\u2019t punish him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s level of enlightenment is too great. He clearly didn\u2019t have to serve a sentence but he requested to be in prison for a month. He deserves our respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were accompanied by some disharmonious sounds.</p><br/><p>A certain famous Internet celebrity was expressing strong protests against this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could something like this happen in a detention center? This is a place for convicts to turn over a new leaf, not for them to enjoy themselves. If he wants to enjoy himself, please send him back to his home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once this post was sent, it drew the attention of numerous netizens.</p><br/><p>Some of them were furious while some of them were praising it as they felt that it made a lot of sense. However, the latter was only a small minority.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this post, he was instantly upset.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear Internet celebrity, please do not take advantage of my popularity. I have to charge a fee for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, everyone laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin is really too awesome. Even in prison, he can play with his phone and update his status. That\u2019s way too impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. This guy only knows how to take advantage of other people\u2019s popularity. Is Master Lin\u2019s popularity so good to take advantage of?\u201d</p><br/><p>The detention house.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of the Guru, Sun Neng and the rest improved their technical skills drastically. Now that the Guru was spending energy on Weibo, they felt that it was a waste of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuru, let\u2019s ignore this guy. Let\u2019s just carry on discussing technical skills,\u201d said Sun Neng eagerly.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun was the Internet Safety Team\u2019s boss but he was very low-key in front of the Guru. To them, this was really a very fortunate thing, to meet such a f*cking awesome Guru. it was something that they would never have dared to imagine.</p><br/><p>If the Guru was willing to join the Internet Safety Team, he would be willing to give up his position and let the Guru lead them on the path of glory.</p><br/><p>However, it was a shame. He felt as if the Guru wasn\u2019t too interested in this matter.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The news on the Internet had quietened down. They were no longer willing to discuss how Master Lin was living too freely in prison. They felt as if discussing it further was unbearable for their hearts. How could there be such a huge difference between him and everyone else?</p><br/><p>In a certain commercial street.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang had successfully asked Wu You Lan out. Walking on the pavement, the two \u2018beautiful views\u2019 drew the attention of many young men. After all, these beautiful ladies were well-received no matter where they went.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was now in a very good mood. Brother Lin was getting by well in the detention house. However, she just didn\u2019t understand why Lin Fan would want to stay in the detention house for a month. Wasn\u2019t that just looking for punishment himself? Although he was getting by well, he didn\u2019t have any freedom.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu You Lan saw a makeup shop. \u201cLiu Xu, let\u2019s go there and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Liu Xu was smiling sweetly. Asking her out had been the first step to success. Everything had to be taken slowly.</p><br/><p>To make the godly doctor change her, she had to attack from the inside. Moreover, she quite liked this Wu You Lan. She was a very cute lady.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stood in front of the sales counter, picking some items while Liu Xu stood at the side. She disliked these makeup products. She had never used them since young. As for those various brands or whatever, she naturally didn\u2019t know them. When Wu You Lan asked something, she just smiled and pointed at one of the products without saying anything. She didn\u2019t know anything anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Xu, what do you think about this lipstick color?\u201d asked Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu nodded, \u201cMmm, it\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head, \u201cI feel like it\u2019s not very good. The color is too dark. I think I\u2019d better choose a lighter one. But you should look at those perfumes. They\u2019re not bad. Give them a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since entering the shop, everything attracted Wu You Lan. Brother Qiang Qiang didn\u2019t know what was so good about all these and she wasn\u2019t interested at all. But for some reason, she felt a sense of anticipation in her heart as if she had discovered some new piece of land.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang smiled, \u201cWhy do you like makeup products so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled very sweetly, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? A lady\u2019s most beautiful period of her life is when she\u2019s young. If I don\u2019t groom myself beautifully, I won\u2019t have the chance when I\u2019m old. Liu Xu, why don\u2019t you try this lipstick that I\u2019ve bought before. Although the color is dark, I like it very much. With your lips, I think it will definitely look great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang had initially wanted to reject the offer but she was an expert in picking up girls and at this moment, it was better not to reject the offer.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan took out the lipstick and applied it for Liu Xu. When she was done, she cried out in surprise, \u201cWow, take a good look. Hurry up and take a look at the mirror.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of the mirror. Brother Qiang Qiang looked at herself in the mirror. Her lips were fiery red. She raised the corners of her mouth slightly. She had a bewitching aura about her.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said excitedly, \u201cYour lips are exceptionally good-looking. When coupled with this color, it\u2019s really beautiful. If your red hair was a little longer and a little wavy, then you would really be too beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang kept looking at herself in the mirror. This was the first time she had seen herself with lipstick. Suddenly, she felt a peculiar feeling rise up in her heart.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded, \u201cMmm. Liu Xu, let me do an eyeshadow for you. You\u2019ll definitely look exceptionally beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the makeup shop\u2019s staff were sneakily watching. They felt as if this lady was really very beautiful. Especially after applying the lipstick, her aura suddenly changed. She gave off a grand feeling.</p><br/><p>Although she was dressed very gender-neutrally, she gave off a unique feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right, I got it.\u201d At that moment, Wu You Lan seemed to have realized something. \u201cWait a moment. Your hair isn\u2019t very long now but you can tie it behind. You\u2019ll definitely look especially beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wu You Lan acted as a makeup artist and a hairstylist at the same time as she groomed Brother Qiang Qiang.</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan saw Brother Qiang Qiang\u2019s appearance, she was completely stunned. \u201cSo dazzling, so grand, so handsome. No, handsome isn\u2019t the right word, it\u2019s gender-neutral beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the customers in the shop saw Brother Qiang Qiang, they were all drawn to her.</p><br/><p>The gender-neutral outfit, lipstick, eyeshadow, hair back in a bun and in particular, that slim figure, were simply stunning.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang looked in the mirror and it was as if she was captivated. \u201cIs that me?\u201d she thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, how can I have such thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, this feeling was really peculiar.</p><br/><p>Deep in her heart, she didn\u2019t quite dislike this feeling.</p></div>\n</div>"}

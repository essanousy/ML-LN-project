His teacher had been caught and he had been notified by Qiu Jie. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have known at all.</p><br/><p>He paced back and forth in the house.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t come up with any plans.</p><br/><p>Sigh, Teacher, what the heck is going on?</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue, who was participating in a show, saw the news, she was dumbfounded. Her manager remained quiet at her side. Her manager had known about this news long ago. She knew that Wu Huan Yue\u2019s standing in the company wasn\u2019t low. She had heard that she was the woman of one of the boss\u2019s friends. Although it was just a rumor, there is always some truth to every rumor.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Huan Yue was just standing there stupidly. Her manager didn\u2019t bother her.</p><br/><p>Then, Wu Huan Yue hastily gave a call to Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wang, what are we going to do about Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m looking for connections. No matter what, I will rescue him. You do what you have to do. Don\u2019t worry blindly.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>How could Wu Huan Yue still be in the mood to participate in the show? However, she was just a small celebrity. In the face of such matters, she was powerless.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan tugged on her father\u2019s arm. \u201cDad, can you get Brother Lin out?\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew that her father had wide connections and he probably had ways to do it.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He said with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, daughter. Just don\u2019t worry. Nothing will happen to Master Lin. you have to believe in him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>A certain district.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin was deeply worried as he sat on the sofa. \u201cWhat do you think has happened to our son? Why would something like this happen? I can\u2019t even reach his phone. This is worrying me to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin wiped the tears from her eyes. \u201cI told you not to let our child leave. We should\u2019ve made him stay by our side but you had to tell him that young people should wander the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin remained silent. He was very worried in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. We have to go to Shanghai right now,\u201d said Mama Lin.</p><br/><p>*knock knock*</p><br/><p>Elder Lin went to open the door. When the door was opened, Elder Li stood on the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Li, is there something you need?\u201d Elder Lin was dispirited. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to compare with Elder Li about whatever.</p><br/><p>Elder Li patted Elder Lin on the shoulder. \u201cElder Lin, don\u2019t be too worried. I\u2019ve asked a lawyer for you, Lil\u2019 Fan\u2019s situation is not too severe. Nothing big will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin said unhappily, \u201cHow could it not be a big matter? He hacked into a bank, he\u2019ll be in prison until the prison collapses!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li comforted him, \u201cYou see, you have to look at the circumstances. Lil\u2019 Fan did good things too. He hacked into the bank to find information about those scammers. He didn\u2019t even cause any harm, right? I think it will be at most a few months. He might not even need to go to prison and might even be invited by our country to join the Internet Specialists.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Lin heard this, his mood became significantly better, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li said, \u201cWhy would I lie to you? You see, this has happened on the news before. Seventeen or eighteen-year-old teenagers hacked into the Education Department to change their grades. After they were found out, they didn\u2019t have to go to prison either. They even got specially recruited into universities. Look at what Lil\u2019 Fan did. It\u2019s a great deed! Nothing will happen to him for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin said, \u201cThen if something really happens, how many years will he be sentenced to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li was clueless as well. Although he had asked the lawyer, the lawyer only replied him ambiguously, saying that he would have to look at the whole situation. However, seeing how Elder Lin was right now, how could Elder Li not comfort him?</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be several months at most. Six months at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin was still very worried. \u201cElder Li, are you saying this just to comfort me? Why do I feel like this matter is very severe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Elder Lin, it\u2019s not severe. You all shouldn\u2019t think too much. How about this? My son knows people in Shanghai. I\u2019ll make a call right now to ask about this matter, okay?\u201d said Elder Li.</p><br/><p>Elder Lin replied, \u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Mama Lin\u2019s voice rang out from the living room, \u201cOld man, our son is calling!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Lin heard that, he was startled. \u201cWhat? Hurry up and answer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li rushed into the house as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, what are you all doing?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s voice emanated from the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fan, are you okay? What happened to you? Your dad and I saw the news about you being caught by the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I\u2019ve been caught but I\u2019m fine. I called you all so that you won\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be fine? There\u2019s definitely something wrong. What are you doing right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just ordered a take-out. Have you all seen the image I just sent to you on WeChat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin hurriedly opened her WeChat. There was indeed an image. In the image, Lin Fan was holding a crab in one hand and eating it very happily. He was even looking at the camera with a wide smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019ve seen it, right? You and Dad don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019m fine. I could have gone out anytime from the start but I felt that my actions were unlawful so I spontaneously requested to stay in prison for a month. What do you think of this action of mine?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cIs that even true? Don\u2019t lie to your dad and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, I\u2019ll let Inspector Liu from the police station talk to you.\u201d Lin Fan passed his phone to Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian received the phone and said, \u201cBig Sister, Big Brother, you don\u2019t have to worry. What he said was all true. Although your son\u2019s actions were a little unlawful, he helped to expose numerous scammers. It is a great achievement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin hurriedly took over the phone. \u201cInspector Liu, is my son really fine? And will my son be hired by our country to be an Internet safety specialist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian and Lin Fan looked at each other, then Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cIf your son is willing, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan snatched over the phone. \u201cDad, why would I want to be an Internet safety specialist? I don\u2019t have time for that. Let\u2019s not talk now. I have to go and eat. If you all want to call me, then call. My phone is always with me. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Elder Lin was smiling happily. \u201cElder Li, my son is fine. But what kind of brain does he have? He isn\u2019t willing to be hired. How good must it be to be an Internet safety officer? It would even be easy to find a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li nodded, \u201cMmm, mmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin had emerged from his worries and his mood was good now. Then, he raised his thumb and said, \u201cElder Li, touch your heart and tell me, how\u2019s my son? Isn\u2019t he amazing? He was brought up by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, mmm.\u201d Elder Li had nothing to say. This turn of events was too quick. Then, he stood up and said, \u201cElder Lin, I just remembered that I have yet to cook my dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin said, \u201cAh, why would you need to cook dishes? Come eat at my place today. Us brothers shall drink some wine and have a chat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li wasn\u2019t stupid. There was nothing to chat about, Elder Lin was just going to show off. Elder Li said, \u201cNah, my son is coming back today. I have to go back and prepare some dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin grabbed Elder Li\u2019s hand, \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. You can all come to my place together. It\u2019s just one extra set of chopsticks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li was a little helpless. It seemed that he might not be able to escape this. And the most terrifying this was that it seemed that Elder Lin was going to use his ultimate move.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The local police station.</p><br/><p>The matter had already been resolved. Initially, this was a very controversial matter and the higher-ups had discussed it. Some of them wanted a heavy sentence while others felt that a light sentence would do. After all, he was a talent and he hadn\u2019t done any harm to the bank or the police.</p><br/><p>Because of that, a number of big shots were having a meeting the previous night.</p><br/><p>At the most intense moment of the meeting, Zheng Zhong Shan personally stepped in and entered the conversation. He only said one sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has done a great favor to my family, could you leaders give him some face on my behalf?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this sentence was said, the whole place was shocked.</p><br/><p>No one dared to say much.</p></div>\n</div>"}

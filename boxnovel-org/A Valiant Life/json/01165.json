Even the martial arts experts were stunned as they wondered what the f*ck was going on. Meanwhile, Zhao Xuan was cursing in his heart.</p><br/><p><em>Is he trying to screw me over?</em></p><br/><p><em>If I knew it was Master Lin, I wouldn\u2019t come here even if I were beaten to death.</em></p><br/><p><em>But isn\u2019t Master Lin in Shanghai? Why is he suddenly in Haojiang?</em></p><br/><p><em>This is completely f*cked up!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you guys trying to do?\u201d Lin Fan put down his chopsticks and turned over. \u201cAre you trying to pick a fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t recognize these people but he could tell from one look that they were skilled in Kung Fu. However, he hadn\u2019t expected them to be someone\u2019s thugs.</p><br/><p>One of the big men immediately waved his hand as he said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t dare! Master Lin, this is a misunderstanding. We really aren\u2019t trying to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was dumbfounded right now. <em>Pick a fight?</em></p><br/><p><em>How brave must someone be to dare to pick a fight with Master Lin? One must have a death wish to do that!</em></p><br/><p>Back then, they had been there at Kunlun Mountain. Master Lin\u2019s performance on stage had left them mesmerized. That scene would even float up in their minds if they were to close their eyes right now.</p><br/><p>If they were to fight Master Lin, they would probably end up in the hospital.</p><br/><p>But the most important part was that if Master Lin were to expose this incident to the public, they could forget about living anymore.</p><br/><p>They would probably get flamed to death by the other martial artists.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin was recognized as the best in the world; the chief of the martial arts circles.</p><br/><p>Now, there were constantly people travelling to Shanghai to request Master Lin\u2019s help to complete their martial arts. In martial arts, this was considered a great favor and they would never be able to repay it.</p><br/><p>Looking at the situation, Zhao Xuan was completely stunned. He didn\u2019t even know what to do anymore.</p><br/><p>However, he felt that it might be a pretty good idea to run away now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Zhao Xuan began to move, the opposite party told him to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Zhao Xuan looked at Lin Fan. \u201cAm I not allowed to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cYou are very problemsome. You cannot leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does me leaving have to do with you?\u201d Zhao Xuan didn\u2019t heed Lin Fan\u2019s words. Instead, he wanted to leave anyway. If he stayed any longer, who knew what would happen?</p><br/><p>However, just as he moved his feet, the big men that he had brought here stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin didn\u2019t let you leave, so you cannot leave.\u201d The big man who was trained in Hong Quan held onto Zhao Xuan, not letting him go.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Let go of me. Let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan struggled as he yelled. He wanted to leave but his skinny and frail body was no match for these big men. He had no choice but to be kept there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck is going on?\u201d In the distance, Ma Shao Hao was dumbfounded. That arrogant guy from before had been suppressed by his own men. It didn\u2019t make any f*cking sense.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see that Lin get beaten up but he hadn\u2019t expected Zhao Xuan\u2019s own men to turn against him. This made him a little disappointed in Zhao Xuan.</p><br/><p>He felt that this guy was quite pathetic.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng was astonished as well. She could see a sense of reverence in those big men\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>She knew that Master Lin was powerful but she hadn\u2019t expected that these big, strong men would feel reverence towards him. There was definitely some kind of story behind this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Hong Quan practitioner?\u201d</p><br/><p>That big man nodded. \u201cMaster Lin, you have great vision. I am indeed a Hong Quan practitioner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you working together with this kind of person?\u201d asked Lin Fan. Martial artists these days would usually earn money by doing performances. Otherwise, they would become bodyguards or private thugs for tycoons.</p><br/><p>Just look at Fraud Tian. He was so proficient in Ba Gua Zhang, but it was useless. He still had to become a fortune-teller in the end.</p><br/><p>If one were lucky enough to become the bodyguard of a tycoon, it would be a pretty good choice.</p><br/><p>There were some martial artists who didn\u2019t have very impressive physiques. Even if they wanted to become bodyguards of celebrities, they might not be wanted. Those celebrities only wanted bodyguards with intimidating physiques. After all, those people with frail-looking bodies wouldn\u2019t be able to fend off waves of crazy fans.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just working to earn a living,\u201d said the big man helplessly. Sometimes, he really felt that these days were pathetic.</p><br/><p>They were strong fighters. To some evil-minded people, they were pretty useful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you guys later.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t question him any further. Instead, he turned to Zhao Xuan. \u201cYou\u2019re from Hong Kong, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan struggled so much that his face was beet red. He hadn\u2019t expected this to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, you have to be wary of this person,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Xue Yao was startled and she couldn\u2019t quite understand. But since Brother Lin had spoken, she would naturally take note of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Shao Hao.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jin Meng saw that figure in the distance and instantly understood what was going on. She yelled his name.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao, who had wanted to retreat, heard her voice. Then, his expression changed. He hadn\u2019t expected to be revealed.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao took a deep breath, then shouted, \u201cMa Shao Hao, I\u2019ll call your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ma Shao Hao heard that, he instantly panicked. The feeling was as if he had done badly on a school exam and his parents were being called.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Yun Xue Yao, is there a need to call my father? If there\u2019s something to talk about, let\u2019s talk nicely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit that this was my fault. I was wrong. This Zhao Xuan is here to help me as well. Handsome brother, I apologize. I\u2019ll pretend that nothing happened, is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was genuinely afraid now. If Yun Xue Yao were to call his father, he would probably be yelled at. More importantly, he couldn\u2019t let his father find out about his collaboration with Zhao Xuan.</p><br/><p>It was a secret.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cXue Yao, I think you should call his father. This situation is a little complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Brother Lin.\u201d Yun Xue Yao nodded and immediately dialled the number on her phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him.\u201d When Ma Shao Hao saw this, his face turned completely pale. If she were to really call his father, he would be f*cked. He immediately tried to snatch the phone over.</p><br/><p>However, that big man next to him grabbed Ma Shao Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. Otherwise, I\u2019ll beat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao growled, \u201cF*ck! Do you know who I am? You dare to hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>But at that moment, the call went through.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Uncle Ma, this is Xue Yao. Ma Shao Hao is causing trouble here and things have gotten a little complicated. I\u2019m not too clear about the situation, but Master Lin knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s Master Lin of Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll wait for you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ma Shao Hao heard that conversation, he suddenly felt weak. Then, he glared at Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone overboard. This is between us. Was there a need to tell my father?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

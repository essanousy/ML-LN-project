When the medicine was prepared, he woke Yuan Yuan up to test it on her.</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was very successful. The medicine improved her health tremendously.</p><br/><p>Also, he immediately consumed it too. As he accelerated the effects of the medicine, he was fully cured of AIDS.</p><br/><p>The medicine had to be consumed for a month in order to destroy every single viral cell in the body. Of course, if the virus was detected earlier, one would only have to consume it for a week or so.</p><br/><p>He successfully purged the poison from Yuan Yuan\u2019s body, and she became a healthy child again.</p><br/><p>Then, he lit a cigarette and took out his phone to announce it to the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I\u2019m exhausted. If not for the major Wuxia classification of knowledge, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to eradicate it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He really believed in the power of the Encyclopedia. It was unbeatable. No illness was too complicated for him. All he needed was enough time to create the right medicine.</p><br/><p>He took a puff before reviewing his post. After checking that everything was accurate, he posted it.</p><br/><p>If any herb was wrongly written, things would go wrong and he would be in trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he posted it and refreshed Weibo.</p><br/><p>Xu Wen was a reporter who woke up early in the morning as he focused on Master Lin\u2019s research on AIDS.</p><br/><p>When he woke up, he immediately refreshed Weibo to see if Master Lin had succeeded.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that he probably needed more time to succeed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his hands started to tremble as he read the Weibo post.</p><br/><p>What did he actually see?</p><br/><p>Master Lin actually made a new post on Weibo and the content was truly unbelievable. Xu Wen became really excited.</p><br/><p>The post only consisted of a list of Chinese herbs.</p><br/><p>In the preliminary stage of AIDS, consume it for a week.</p><br/><p>In the middle stages, consume it for two to three weeks.</p><br/><p>In the later stages, consume it for a month.</p><br/><p>Consume it twice daily, and stop smoking and drinking.</p><br/><p>Then, the list of Chinese herbs continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*MN!\u201d After seeing that Weibo post, he immediately called his colleagues.</p><br/><p>His colleagues cursed him when they saw the time of his call. They thought that he was crazy.</p><br/><p>However, when they heard that there was an update, they were stunned. They immediately woke up and thanked him before heading to the Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>There was only a small group of people outside the academy. Some of the reporters even bought a tent for themselves to stay in as they waited. When they received the call, they immediately got out of the tent and shouted, \u201cMaster Lin is out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to wake up when they heard that.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is really out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, really? If you\u2019re lying, I will kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, let me have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>When everyone looked at the entrance, they only saw Master Lin leaning on a pole and smoking. It was as if he was really carefree and did not have any problems at all.</p><br/><p>A doctor jumped out of the parked ambulance and rushed towards him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled when he saw the group of people charging towards him. He knew that they had waited for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over first.\u201d The doctor stopped the reporters. Then, he walked towards Master Lin. \u201cMaster Lin, can I draw some of your blood to test it in the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lin Fan nodded and let him take some of his blood.</p><br/><p>He knew that the doctor was ruling out the possibility of him being infected.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what about Elder Zhao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. If I\u2019m fine, he should be fine too. Anyway, the medicine is already perfected. Do you think there would be any problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the kid\u2026?\u201d The doctor asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s fine now. You can take her blood to examine in the hospital too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor followed Master Lin to the lab to carry Yuan Yuan so that he could draw some of her blood for testing.</p><br/><p>Soon, he collected both blood samples and rushed to the hospital. He wanted to see the composition of the blood.</p><br/><p>He knew that Master Lin would succeed, but he did not know how he did it.</p><br/><p>When he left, he warned the reporters not to go near them before the results were out.</p><br/><p>However, when the doctor left, the reporters just rushed towards them.</p><br/><p>They believed in Master Lin, and since he said that he had succeeded, they did not doubt him at all.</p><br/><p>The reporters were ecstatic and proud that Master Lin managed to eradicate AIDS.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and walked down the stairs after seeing the large crowd of reporters. Soon, he was surrounded by them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you really succeed?\u201d A reporter asked excitedly. His face turned red from excitement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, I did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how\u2019s Yuan Yuan?\u201d A reporter asked.</p><br/><p>Then, someone rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, please excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun could barely sleep, and when he heard the commotion outside, he woke up immediately and rushed towards Master Lin. He was so excited that he did not even have time to wear his shoes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how was it?\u201d Zhang Yi Jun grabbed Lin Fan\u2019s hand and asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded. \u201cYuan Yuan is perfectly healthy now. The virus is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun stood there rooted to the spot. Then, he shouted and kneeled before Master Lin. He cried, \u201cMaster Lin, thank you. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not know what else to say. The heaviness in his heart vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>He could finally let go of the heavy burden in his heart.</p><br/><p>The reporters immediately took pictures of him.</p><br/><p>However, some reporters were curious and they asked more questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, now that Yuan Yuan has recovered, can I ask if the medicine only has to be consumed for at most one month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, everyone listened attentively.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, this is this is a grand exchange between martial art schools.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho organized this event? Why did they think of organizing it at Kunlun Mountain? It\u2019s so far and so inconvenient.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei was helpless about this as well. \u201cWe complained about this location as well but their reply left us speechless. They said something like \u2018If you can\u2019t even endure some hardship, why are you even practicing kung fu? We didn\u2019t say much after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the organizer, it\u2019s a Chinese martial arts exchange center. That organization is really big. They basically encompass the martial arts practitioners from around the world. Moreover, they\u2019ve been around for a long time. They were established in 1925.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and didn\u2019t ask more about this. He decided to just go there and see. As for the organizers, he didn\u2019t bother much about them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll go and see President Niu. I haven\u2019t seen him in a long time,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile as the two of them headed inside.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t come here in a long time and he even missed this place a little.</p><br/><p>After all, he had very deep memories of this place from back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan stopped in his tracks and looked at that figure in front. Meanwhile, that person saw Lin Fan and suddenly jolted slightly as if he had seen someone familiar.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie was standing there, looking at the young man in front of him. His memories of past incidents started popping up in his mind.</p><br/><p>A group of them had been forced into a conflict in the office by this young man. They were all experts in the association but they had taken a beating from this one man. To them, it had been a huge blow to their confidence.</p><br/><p>Initially, he hadn\u2019t wanted to give in but in the end, he had completely crumbled and even left the association. He had really been filled with rage at first but after calming down, his heart finally relaxed and he seemed to have understood something.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei saw Wang Yun Jie and shouted, \u201cChairman Wang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and let out a smile. \u201cHello, Chairman Wang, it\u2019s been so long. You still have the same style. What is it? Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Over the phone, President Niu had already explained the situation clearly. Lin Fan couldn\u2019t possibly act unfriendly towards Wang Yun Jie. Since the matter had already passed, he decided to interact nicely.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, you don\u2019t know each other until you\u2019ve fought. After fighting, all grievances will be settled.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie stood there for a moment before walking over and extending his hand. His expression was sincere. \u201cHello, President Lin. What happened in the past was my mistake. I\u2019ve deeply reflected on it and I hope you won\u2019t hold it against me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan extended his arm and shook Wang Yun Jie\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s already in the past. I was a little too rash as well and I didn\u2019t give you face in the association. Please don\u2019t hold it against me either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did the right thing. If it wasn\u2019t for that, I wouldn\u2019t have realized my mistake. When I was young, I wasn\u2019t like that. But when I grew old, my attitude changed. Now, I\u2019ve been beaten awake by President Lin. I\u2019m glad it happened,\u201d said Wang Yun Jie. Then, thinking about the Kunlun Mountain trip, he said, \u201cThis time, we\u2019ll have to trouble President Lin to lead the team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all. Alright, let\u2019s not stand here anymore. Let\u2019s go and pay President Niu a visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d replied Wang Yun Jie with a smile. He had really given in to President Lin, especially since he saw news related to President Lin every day.</p><br/><p>He suddenly realized that the President Lin he had known from before had already ascended to a higher place.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei smiled after seeing the two of them. The association could only flourish if the internal department was peaceful. This was something that he was very happy to see.</p><br/><p>The office.</p><br/><p>President Niu saw that Master Lin had come and instantly broke into a smile. \u201cCome, come. It\u2019s not often that President Lin comes to the association. This old man has to appreciate this opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lin Fan felt helpless. \u201cPresident Niu, I\u2019m really sorry. I carry the title of Vice-President but I don\u2019t come here much at all. I\u2019m really embarrassed to be holding this title. Why don\u2019t I just become a normal member instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t ever do that. You may not be here but your reputation is with us. Now, our association is rising. When other people hear that Master Lin is the Vice-President, they trust us very much. President Lin has already contributed to the association tremendously,\u201d said President Niu.</p><br/><p>This was something that Lin Fan had not thought of. He hadn\u2019t expected that his reputation could have such an effect on the association. If he hadn\u2019t experienced it himself, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cPresident Niu, what will we be mainly doing during this Kunlun Mountain trip? Are we just going there to spectate?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Niu nodded. \u201cYes. We are the Shanghai department of the association and we\u2019ve received the invitation. We won\u2019t be respected very much over there. I want you to lead the team and bring the association\u2019s new members over there to see the larger aspects of society and broaden their horizons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s it.\u201d Lin Fan nodded as he understood. They were probably going there just for show.</p><br/><p>President Niu continued, \u201cActually, our association is in a rather embarrassing situation. Some of the martial arts schools look down on us. But since we are a nationally recognized organization, they can\u2019t get rid of us whenever they want to organize any activities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, out of the several big organizers, there are the Big Three families and Big Four clans at the center. There are also various private groups. It is considered a grand ceremony. Moreover, it is a global event. It\u2019s a true martial arts exchange meet,\u201d said President Niu.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t very interested in those Big Three families and Big Four clans or whatever. However, since they were playing a small role, it meant that it wasn\u2019t a big deal.</p><br/><p>To him, this was actually pretty good. He could save some trouble.</p><br/><p>He could treat this trip as a vacation.</p><br/><p>President Niu continued, \u201cThis time, Jiang Fei and President Wang will be bringing some of the new members over. President Lin will be the leader, so please look after them. Over there, there will be many young and vigorous people. If a conflict happens, your kung fu is the strongest and you should be able to protect them. I can relax because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan smiled. \u201cPresident Niu, did you decide to send me just because I can fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Niu\u2019s expression changed. \u201cOf course not. President Lin, don\u2019t think of this old man that way. If I could go, I would.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan burst into laughter. \u201cAlright, alright. Since President Niu has spoken, how can I reject? Then we\u2019ll meet at the airport tomorrow. I\u2019ll be bringing a few other people from my side. They\u2019re my employees and I\u2019m bringing them to see the world as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

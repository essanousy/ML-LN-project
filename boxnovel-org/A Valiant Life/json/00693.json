Do you think the shop feels a little weird today? It has an evil vibe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked, \u201cAre you stupid? Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the two girls in front and nodded, \u201cI understand now. That\u2019s probably why.\u201d Then, he said enviously, \u201cSigh, I\u2019m still single while Brother Lin has two girls that are interested in him. That\u2019s so infuriating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cHaha, don\u2019t be envious. My Ba Gua Zhang skills are absolutely incredible but I\u2019m still single even until today. Don\u2019t be in such a rush. We\u2019ll support each other in the future and we\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEw! Who would want to support you? I\u2019d rather leave my home.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Fraud Tian\u2019s eyes which seemed to be harboring some evil thoughts. He knew that Fraud Tian was thinking of living a bachelor\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know if Master Lin is here?\u201d Then, two guests came to the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cYes, may I know who you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re from Jiangning. We would like to meet Master Lin,\u201d one of the guys said. Then, the other middle-aged man didn\u2019t say anything. It was obvious that this man was the boss of the other man that spoke.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cSomeone\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head, \u201cI am Master Lin. Why are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the middle-aged man that didn\u2019t speak looked in awe. He smiled and went forward, \u201cHi, Master Lin, I am from Jiangning. This is my name card. This time, I am here to request for an artwork from you. Of course, I will satisfy your asking price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the name card and looked at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiangning Long Teng Estate Development Corporation, Director, Li Jian Ming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jian Ming smiled, \u201cYeah, that is me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Master Lin\u2019s artworks got collected by the nation\u2019s museum, his reputation soared. The average citizens were just stunned and awed by it. However, to some of the wealthy men, they hoped to get an artwork from him to hang in their offices to gain some face.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, in order to get an artwork from a great master, one just had to offer money. With money, how could anyone resist it? Especially since he knew that Master Lin was a youngster, he was even more confident of getting an artwork from him. After all, which youngster didn\u2019t like money?</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan returned the name card to him, \u201cI\u2019m not going to draw. Go back home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jian Ming was stunned. He hasn\u2019t expected that at all. \u201cI came here from Jiangning. Are you going to reject me just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand, \u201cWhat else do you want then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jian Ming hadn\u2019t expected to be rejected so directly. \u201cOffer me any price. With the current market prices, your artworks are worth $30 million. I don\u2019t want such big artworks. I just want a painting of Mount Tai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately waved his hand. He didn\u2019t want to draw at all. He knew that a lot of people would be here to request for his artworks. However, he hadn\u2019t expected someone to come so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not selling any artworks now. Fraud, please send them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian went before the two of them, \u201cLeave, please. If you\u2019d like to buy scallion pancakes, you can come back tomorrow. If you\u2019d like to get your fortunes read, you can get it done now. We\u2019re not selling any artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the two of them left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled helplessly, \u201cLook, things can happen so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned, \u201cBro, they offered $30 million. One artwork and you\u2019d get $30 million!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, there are wealthy men everywhere. If I am to draw for just anyone that asks, I\u2019d just be a low-cost worker,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian understood it. \u201cI see. I understand now. You want to make it rarer now so that when the prices increase in the future, you can make a huge sum next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian and felt that he thought too much about it. The only reason he didn\u2019t want to draw was that he was lazy.</p><br/><p>At 6 pm.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to close the shop!\u201d Lin Fan stretched himself and moved his neck. Although he hadn\u2019t done anything much in the afternoon, he was exhausted. He admired himself for being able to sit still for so long.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cBrother Lin, can we go to your place to cook some food?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMy house isn\u2019t that big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled, \u201cIf it\u2019s not that big, it would be more homely and cozy. Don\u2019t you guys think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was praying for that to happen. He had been craving for Brother Lin\u2019s food for a long time.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He smiled, \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten Master Lin\u2019s food for some time already. Now that Wu Huan Yue is back, I am in luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were seriously impressed with Lin Fan\u2019s culinary skills. Those that ate his food before would definitely say that they were the best on earth.</p><br/><p>Obviously, Lin Fan could tell what they were thinking about. \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll let you guys taste my culinary skills today. Huan Yue and You Lan can go and purchase the groceries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was stunned, \u201cBrother Lin, what about all of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely be waiting at home for all of you. You are the only two girls here. I can\u2019t ask the elderly men here to go instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said helplessly. They were just lazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and everyone boarded the car. They went towards his house.</p><br/><p>At 7:30 pm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was busy cooking in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Everyone was sitting outside, watching the television and he was the only one cooking.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia\u2019s knowledge wasn\u2019t a joke. The dishes that he prepared were incredibly delicious. Not a single person would be able to take their eyes off the dishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dishes are ready, we can eat now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smelled the aroma and couldn\u2019t wait to start eating, \u201cBrother Lin, I wish I could eat these dishes for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Wu Huan Yue and thought to herself, \u201cHow could she say it so directly? That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately rejected her, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You don\u2019t know how difficult it is to cook. I am still waiting for all of you to cook for me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wu Huan Yue smiled, \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll cook for Brother Lin next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it had been anyone else who cooked, they would definitely be chatting at the table. However, Lin Fan had made the dishes and everyone couldn\u2019t stop after eating their first bite.</p><br/><p>They were quietly eating and drinking and their chopsticks didn\u2019t stop moving at all.</p><br/><p>At 10 pm.</p><br/><p>Everything was over.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others were prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>However, Wu Huan Yue and Wu You Lan weren\u2019t prepared to leave yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, you can go back first. We\u2019ll be here to help Brother Lin clean up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was definitely going to stay behind to help out too.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said in awe, \u201cWow, I\u2019m envious. Forget it, let\u2019s not stay here. Elder Wu, what are you looking at? Your daughter just asked us to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang didn\u2019t think too much about it. The meal was simply too delicious.</p><br/><p>However, after sending them off.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Wu Huan Yue started to clean up and keep the table and chairs. Meanwhile, Lin Fan sat on the sofa to rest.</p><br/><p>It had been a pretty exhausting day.</p></div>\n</div>"}

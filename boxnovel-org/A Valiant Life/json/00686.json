Ever since the Qingtian Bay Race had first been held, nothing like that had ever happened before!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t slow down when making the turn, but instead, he sped up! How perverse must you be to make such a move?!</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Two illuminated car headlights could be seen coming and a glorious figure appeared before the audience.</p><br/><p>*Screech!*</p><br/><p>The sound of a car braking could be heard.</p><br/><p>A race car came to a halt.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the audience was completely stunned when they saw the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible? Twelve minutes? The record for this Qingtian Bay racetrack is at least twenty-three minutes! How in the world did he do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPinch me! I\u2019m not dreaming, am I? This is impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly! How is this possible? How can he drive so fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he reached the finish line, the Encyclopedia\u2019s notification popped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTask completed: Joining the Qingtian Bay Race. Encyclopedic points +20.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the sixteenth page of knowledge. Because it\u2019s the sixteenth page of knowledge, a knowledge related to someone close to the host will be chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFailure to select a related knowledge. Choosing the sixteenth page of knowledge. Unlocking the sub-class of the Plant Cultivation major classification of knowledge: Landscaping knowledge (With the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: Lead the 365 children from the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to revamp the environment of the Institute. At the same time, at least ten students need to learn the knowledge of landscaping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask reward: Encyclopaedic points +20. The Plant Cultivation major class of knowledge will be unlocked. The seventeenth page of knowledge will be unlocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemark: Because you are unlocking a small classification of knowledge, there is no need to be involved in the industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopaedic points: 4860.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. This wasn\u2019t the first time such a thing had happened. The task that was announced wasn\u2019t for him to become the already brilliant and famous Master Lin, but it had become something else. Also, it involved the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>The reward for completing the task was also plentiful. There was be no change to the Encyclopaedic points rewarded but there would be an additional major classification of knowledge. This was somewhat terrifying and unimaginable at the same time.</p><br/><p>However, let\u2019s not think about it anymore. Completing the task was already enough.</p><br/><p>His trip to Beijing had come to an end. After returning back to Shanghai, he\u2019d have to put his heart and soul into the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The car stopped. Everyone had stopped moving. They were still immensely stunned.</p><br/><p>*bleh*</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ye Tong Xian couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore. She stumbled out of the car and lay flat on the ground at the side. She vomited rather severely. It was as if she had to vomit everything from her stomach.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone finally reacted.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! That was just too incredible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has already reached the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe others at the back are still biting the dust.\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing everyone\u2019s stunned expressions, Lin Fan laughed calmly. As for Ye Tong Xian, she had thought that this was just a joke, but after this, it seemed that she wouldn\u2019t ever dare to ride another car.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any more meaning in staying here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHai Ge, I\u2019ll drive this car for now. You can just take it from the hotel tomorrow.\u201d Lin Fan got in the car, started the engine, and drove away.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge finally managed to react, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, Lin Fan had already left the scene, leaving behind an astonished crowd, as well as a vomiting Ye Tong Xian.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian was left looking a sorry figure. At this point, she was too lazy to even lift her hand, but she was still trembling, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even manage to complete a single sentence and continued to vomit.</p><br/><p>For her, this experience was both terrifying and devastating. There would definitely not be a second time. She would deeply remember Lin Fan. That b*stard, almost costing her her life.</p><br/><p>After a long time.</p><br/><p>Irvine finally reached the endpoint. The first thing he did after getting out of his car was to find the owner of that car from just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the person? Where\u2019s the person from before?\u201d Irvine agitatedly asked. He was a professional racer, a world-renowned figure. But he had actually lost in such a small racing event? Moreover, he had been beaten by an absolute margin. How could he still remain calm after this?</p><br/><p>Even the world\u2019s number one didn\u2019t have such capabilities.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian felt a little better now, however, she still felt slightly giddy. \u201cChang Hai Ge, just who the hell was that guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge blinked, \u201cCan I not say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was helpless. He replied, \u201cHe is Master Lin from Shanghai. However, Tong Xian, I would advise you not to go and find trouble with Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Ye Tong Xian snorted. \u201cYou can relax. I won\u2019t do anything to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about Master Lin. I\u2019m worried about you. You are definitely not his match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ye Tong Xian didn\u2019t expect that Chang Hai Ge wouldn\u2019t have faith in her. She momentarily flared up.</p><br/><p>While everyone at the event was trying to find Lin Fan, he already returned to his hotel, getting ready to fly back to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to ask any more about the situation at the Chinese Art Association. He had already given the painting and completed his task. He didn\u2019t have anything left to do in Beijing, so why not return back to Shanghai to lead the children into a better future?</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>At the Liang family.</p><br/><p>After Liang Hong Tian cried, his felt much better. Especially after the other party\u2019s promises, he could finally relax. All he had to do now was to stay away from any trouble.</p><br/><p>Entering the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, I heard that someone taught you a lesson.\u201d a man said as he stood before Liang Hong Tian. This was his second uncle\u2019s eldest son.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, who did you hear this from?\u201d Liang Hong Tian didn\u2019t want to talk about the event. He knew that these people were here to mock him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNevermind who I heard it from. But from what I know, you seem to be fearful of this person, and you do not dare to take revenge. How shameful is this for the Liang family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian was feeling slightly angry. He didn\u2019t say much after that. He smiled, \u201cBrother, this matter has nothing to do with you. If you feel like taking revenge for me, you\u2019re more than welcome. Master Lin from Shanghai. His shop is at Cloud Street. You can go find him. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going to rest first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wait for a response from the other party before taking his leave.</p><br/><p>Crazy b*stard. Revenge?</p><br/><p>If he had the time, why not spend it doing something else?</p><br/><p>The situation now was that, even if he did want to get revenge, he had to see what capabilities he had. The other party was friends with Young Master Zou, and it was hard to say whether Young Master Zou would stick his hand into the matter. If Young Master Zou was to do so, then he certainly wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>At the Beijing airport.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was calling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are you really leaving? Why not stay a few more days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying any longer. Thank you for your hospitality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to thank me. I didn\u2019t even do much. You were here for such a short period of time. I didn\u2019t even do much as the host.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be even more chances down the road. There\u2019s no hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBon voyage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thereafter, Zheng Zhong Shan and Wu Yun Gang also gave him a call each.</p><br/><p>The departure this time didn\u2019t alarm anyone. There also wasn\u2019t anyone who came to send him off as they felt there wasn\u2019t a need to.</p><br/><p>However, Zheng Zhong Shan was trying his best to get him to stay. Lin Fan was afraid that he wanted him to take part in the International Art Exhibition.</p><br/><p>But for Lin Fan, right now, all he really wished for was to go back to Shanghai and not to travel overseas. He had already left ten Chinese artworks behind, so why did he still need to travel overseas? It would just be a waste of time.</p><br/><p>Right now, he just wanted to see how the International Art Exhibition would turn out.</p></div>\n</div>"}

However, luckily, he was strong enough so ten paintings were just child\u2019s play to him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Thousand Miles of River and Mountains Painting\u2019 was really big but at least it was not as tough. Also, if you were to talk about interest, it was the painting that he liked the most.</p><br/><p>Magnificent colours. Splendid and magnificent.</p><br/><p>But if you wanted to talk about the most stunning one, it would definitely be the \u2018Along the River During the Qingming Festival\u2019 that was the highest level one. If they were to enter it in the art exhibition, no country would not be able to match up to it.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, he was Master Lin. Even if the association wanted to lose, they had to ask him whether he was okay with it or not. He was the type of person that felt that if you wanted to do something, you had to be the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, give me ten baskets of steamed dumplings,\u201d Lin Fan said as he went to a breakfast store and was getting ready to eat. Although he had used the techniques of Wu Xia, he could not go without food. In order to create this \u2018Thousand Miles of River and Mountains Painting\u2019, he had used a lot of his strength.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk who were eating breakfast were all shocked when they heard this. This was a little too much, was it not? To order 10 baskets of dumplings, he must have been the reincarnation of the hungry ghost.</p><br/><p>However, what they did not know was that Lin Fan had not eaten for days. If it were not for his high level of skill, he would have already collapsed from hunger a long time ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I don\u2019t know whether those guys have seen my artwork yet,\u201d Lin Fan said very happily as he sipped some of his congee. In his heart, he was thinking about the things going on at the association.</p><br/><p>At the association.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang saw the painting. Then, he could not control himself and became too excited. As a result, his heart started to act up. Luckily, the ambulance was already at the scene and it rescued him.</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cMister, I\u2019m going to need you to follow me to the hospital for a check-up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang was already 70 years old. When he had been young, his heart had already been in a bad state. However, after taking care of himself, there weren\u2019t really any more problems. If it was back in the past, he would have definitely listened to the doctor. But now, he rejected him without a second thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going. I want to see this painting. If I go to the hospital, I\u2019m afraid that it might be difficult for me to personally see the painting again,\u201d Elder Wang firmly said.</p><br/><p>He had not been careful just now so he got a little too excited, but now, he would not. He would quietly appreciate this painting and keep it in his heart forever.</p><br/><p>What was their goal in getting into Chinese Art? Besides cultivating their spirit and passing their nation\u2019s culture to outsiders, the most important thing was to reach the pinnacle of the world of Chinese Art.</p><br/><p>The association masters all urged him, \u201cElder Wang, listen to the doctor and go to the hospital, don\u2019t be stubborn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, if your body develops any problems because of this, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s urges fell on deaf ears. Elder Wang immediately refuted, saying, \u201cIf you guys want to go then you guys can go. I won\u2019t go even if it kills me. Are you people trying to make miss me the opportunity to see the artwork?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctors were helpless and could only just stand aside. They knew that this Chinese Art Association was filled with old people, but what they did not understand was how they could get a heart attack from looking at a painting. That was simply ridiculous.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the entire scene was in silence and no one said a word.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes were all locked onto the painting.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng\u2019s eyes were filled with shock. But he forcefully restrained himself and softly said, \u201cAlong the River During the Qingming Festival.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had left the name of the painting at the top.</p><br/><p>One of the Chinese Art masters who had a very deep understanding of history could not help but say with a hint of doubt, \u201cThis painting looks like it is depicting the nature and scenery of the Henan capital and the Henan river during the Northern Song Dynasty. It also seems to show a prosperous scene?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is definitely from the Northern Song Dynasty. The buildings are definitely in the style of the Northern Song Dynasty. However, I don\u2019t understand how you see it as a prosperous scene. I don\u2019t see it at all. You can see that one of the people in the painting has an expression of alarm and you can also see that the man opposite him is dressed like a government official.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang hadn\u2019t said a thing but then, he could not help cutting them off, saying, \u201cEveryone, we are discussing the painting now. There\u2019s no need to discuss the history. This painting, I\u2026 Ah, I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the people. There are so many of them and they are all different in their own ways. Also, the painting is so huge. If it were us painting it, it would take more than a year. However, Master Lin has only used a short span of three days. This is simply horrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reality of these words hit all of them. Now, they were all shocked speechless.</p><br/><p>The previous nine were all shocking but they could still take it.</p><br/><p>However, when this one appeared, it shook their world. It was so vastly different that regardless of how many paintings they had seen, they were deeply subdued by this one.</p><br/><p>This piece of art was the best in the world and no one could compare to it. It can be said that even an immortal painter could not surpass this.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi carefully studied it. He pondered over it for a long time and then shifted his gaze to Elder Zheng and said, \u201cElder Zheng, I feel that this painting ought to have appropriate protection. This can definitely be passed down for hundreds of generations. Although Elder Lin\u2019s name doesn\u2019t carry much weight, even if this painting was anonymous, it would still be considered a national treasure. It would even be considered as a masterpiece.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng naturally understood this. He let out a deep breath and unwilling shifted his gaze away from the painting as he said, \u201cElder Yue, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>This painting was like everything Elder Yue said. The artistic value was really high and it surpassed everything else.</p><br/><p>Whether if it was the old times or the current time, there was not a single artwork that could surpass this. Not even the previous nine came close.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he had a very deep feeling that there were no limits to what anyone could learn and that art had no limits at all. The way he saw it, Master Lin\u2019s art had reached a new height. One which no one had reached before.</p><br/><p>It was absolutely terrifying.</p><br/><p>After a while.</p><br/><p>Not a single person had left the art studio. Some of them did not even dare to step near the desk. They were afraid that they would accidentally damage this earth-shattering piece of art. If that happened, no one would forgive them even after they died.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are still not done looking at it?\u201d At that moment, Lin Fan was standing at the door with buns in his hands. He was taking bites from the buns as he asked, feeling a bit puzzled.</p><br/><p>He had already left for a few hours and these old timers were still here. Even if it was a good painting, there was no need for this.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, you\u2019re back,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said. The moment he saw Lin Fan, he ran up to him in excitement. He felt like he had no way of describing his feelings. This sort of excitement was something only they could understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis painting is really too amazing,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s just alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard Elder Lin calmly say \u2018It\u2019s just alright\u2019, they almost coughed out blood in anger.</p><br/><p>It was so amazing and yet he just said it was alright. This made them feel like not living anymore. Their artworks were like children\u2019s when compared to his.</p><br/><p>Elder Lin grabbed onto Lin Fan and said, \u201cFollow us overseas. All the great artists in the world will be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard about leaving the country, he immediately waved him off.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thanks, Elder Zheng. I won\u2019t go overseas. Also, I don\u2019t have any interest in this international art exhibition. To you, are these paintings good enough? The quality is good enough for the standard, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan heard that and then he started to laugh. He was without a doubt very happy. He said, \u201cElder Lin, these paintings not only reached the standard but have surpassed it. I don\u2019t even dare to think about the look on the faces of those foreign artists when they see these paintings. I\u2019m eagerly waiting for that moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re satisfied, it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding Chinese Art, Lin Fan really had no interest in it. He also had no idea why Elder Zheng would get so worked up over a piece of art. However, after some thought, he kind of understood. Younger people could get worked up when they get a high-quality piece of equipment in a game and could even be excited for the whole day. Also, they get thoroughly engrossed in those games. As a result, he could sympathize with the situation that Elder Zheng and the rest of them were in.</p><br/><p>When dealing with them, Lin Fan had a very simple mindset.</p><br/><p>As long as they were happy.</p><br/><p>During this trip to Beijing, painting was the secondary goal, the main one was to complete the fifteenth page of knowledge.</p><br/><p>Wherever it was he had to do it, he would do it. If he missed this chance, he would have to wait for the next one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

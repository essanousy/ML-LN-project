He was anxiously looking for his Grandpa and Grandma to bring him to the toilet.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao was still small and he didn\u2019t notice anything different about himself. He just stood there and said, \u201cGrandpa, Lil\u2019 Bao wants to pee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Bao\u2026\u201d Xiu Fang went forward immediately without a care for the bowls and chopsticks that had fallen onto the ground. She was in disbelief. When she stood in front of Lil\u2019 Bao, her hands started shaking as if she still couldn\u2019t believe what she saw in front of her, as if to her, this was all a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu Fang, are we seeing things? Maybe because we\u2019ve thought about it too much, we\u2019ve started to hallucinate,\u201d said Elder Zheng in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Xiu Fang looked at her grandson. \u201cLil\u2019 Bao, walk a step forward for Grandma to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao didn\u2019t know why his Grandpa and Grandma wanted him to take a step forward. Lil\u2019 Bao just wanted to pee, why did he have to take a step forward? But he was a good Bao Bao who listened to his Grandma so he took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, Lil\u2019 Bao has walked forward. Lil\u2019 Bao wants to pee.\u201d Lil\u2019 Bao was getting urgent.</p><br/><p>Before this grandson had been born, their family was very excited but when he was born, this family instantly fell into misery because there was something wrong with his body.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng grabbed Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s arm and touched his leg, which only recently, was unable to walk. He was so emotional that his voice was a little hoarse, \u201cLil\u2019 Bao, take another step for Grandpa to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao looked at Grandpa\u2019s widened eyes and let out a puzzled expression, then slowly took another step. \u201cGrandpa, Lil\u2019 Bao wants to pee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Bao, listen to Grandpa. Take one more step, okay?\u201d Elder Zheng\u2019s emotions were erupting like a volcano. He had been thinking about this moment day and night for a long time. This moment when Lil\u2019 Bao would be able to walk like normal children. But even after countless treatments, no results were produced. They hadn\u2019t given up but giving up had already crossed their minds.</p><br/><p>But now, a miracle had arrived. Lil\u2019 Bao had really stood up.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao raised his head and looked at his Grandpa and Grandma. \u201cLil\u2019 Bao wants to pee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cLil\u2019 Bao, take one more step for Grandpa to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao was silent. \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For a long while, he didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Lil\u2019 Bao burst into tears, \u201cLil\u2019 Bao wants to pee. Grandpa won\u2019t bring Lil\u2019 Bao to pee. Lil\u2019 Bao is going to pee in his pants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Drip!</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao stood there with his fists tightly clenched. He looked embarrassed as his pants gradually got soaked.</p><br/><p>Xiu Fang came to her senses. Although she was very excited, her grandson had really just wet his pants, so she carried Lil\u2019 Bao to the toilet. \u201cOld man, hurry up and call our children. Tell them what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, okay,\u201d Elder Zheng nodded immediately. He took out his phone and called his son.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what is it?\u201d a deep voice emanated from the phone. It was Elder Zheng\u2019s son, Zheng Hai Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cHai Feng, Lil\u2019 Bao\u2026he\u2026he\u2026\u201d Elder Zheng was so anxious that he started to stutter.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the call, Zheng Hai Feng could tell that his father\u2019s voice was panicky, so he started to get anxious. \u201cDad, what\u2019s the matter with Lil\u2019 Bao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao was his only son. Although he had a slight disability, they had never given up on him. No matter what, he was their son. Even if he couldn\u2019t be normal, they would still take care of him for life. Zheng Hai Feng also believed that his son would not get dejected just because of a small shortcoming like this. He would definitely be able to find a path that suited him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Lil\u2019 Bao is fine. Hurry up and come back with Hui Ci. Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s leg has recovered. Lil\u2019 Bao can walk now!\u201d exclaimed Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>The other end of the call was silent.</p><br/><p>After some time, Zheng Hai Feng\u2019s voice stuttered through the phone, \u201cDad, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cLil\u2019 Bao can walk. His leg is fine. His leg has recovered!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, are you kidding me? Lil\u2019 Bao\u2026\u201d Zheng Hai Feng was in disbelief. To him, perhaps this was a joke by his father. But he knew his father\u2019s personality. His father would never crack such a joke. Then the only other possibility was that Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s leg\u2026had really recovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking! Hurry back with Hui Ci. Your Mom and I don\u2019t know how this happened either. We\u2019ll bring Lil\u2019 Bao to the hospital for a check-up at once,\u201d said Elder Zheng emotionally.</p><br/><p>Elder was emotional. He was even more emotional than his son. This was his grandson! His children were always busy every day and his love towards his grandson became deeper and deeper everyday. Now that his grandson could suddenly stand up, it was as if the heavens had opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m coming back now. I\u2019ll be quick\u2026\u201d Zheng Hai Feng hastily hung up, then without thinking much, he immediately called Hui Ci and told her to hurry back.</p><br/><p>He held a post in the army and Hui Ci was his wife whom he met in the cultural department.</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng paced back and forth in the living room. His mind was in a mess and he was lost in thoughts for a long time. He couldn\u2019t figure out how exactly this had happened.</p><br/><p>Xiu Fang helped her grandson to change his clothes, then carried him out from the toilet. She didn\u2019t want to let go of him. Her palm kept touching Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s leg and she didn\u2019t let go for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Bao, take a few steps for Grandpa to see. Tell Grandpa why you can suddenly walk.\u201d Elder Zheng asked him.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao looked at his Grandpa in a daze. \u201cGrandpa, Lil\u2019 Bao can walk now because Lil\u2019 Bao has grown up. Isn\u2019t it like Grandpa said? Now that Lil\u2019 Bao can walk, it\u2019s because Lil\u2019 Bao has grown up.</p><br/><p>When Elder Zheng heard this, he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>This explanation was indeed what he had made up last time. At that time, Lil\u2019 Bao had asked him why he was different from the other children.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng had been afraid that the child would be upset, so he made up an explanation, while he planned to find a way to treat Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s leg. But they knew that there was little hope and they could only wait for Lil\u2019 Bao to grow up and perhaps understand the situation himself.</p><br/><p>But he never thought that Lil\u2019 Bao would suddenly be able to walk. He really wanted to know the reason for that but perhaps, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get an explanation from Lil\u2019 Bao.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng\u2019s son and his wife returned. His wife, in particular, when she received the news, was completely dumbfounded. She asked about it numerous times and still didn\u2019t believe it was true. This was what she dreamt about every day. Now that she had received this news, she really couldn\u2019t dare to believe it. She couldn\u2019t even recover from her shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, where\u2019s Lil\u2019 Bao?\u201d Nian Hui Ci pushed the door open and entered. When she saw Lil\u2019 Bao running around the room by himself, she stood there and covered her mouth. Her eyes had turned red as tears dripped down her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMama\u2026\u201d Lil\u2019 Bao ran over happily and tugged on the corner of her shirt. \u201cMama, why are you crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Bao.\u201d Nian Hui Ci immediately embraced her child and didn\u2019t say anything for a long while.</p><br/><p>Zheng Hai Feng\u2019s had a firm personality. But when he saw this scene, he couldn\u2019t resist getting emotional too. Then, he went over to Elder Zheng and asked, \u201cDad, how did this happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. Right now, don\u2019t think about anything else. Hurry and bring Lil\u2019 Bao to the hospital for a check. Find out what exactly is happening. We can\u2019t raise our hopes and then be disappointed again later on!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

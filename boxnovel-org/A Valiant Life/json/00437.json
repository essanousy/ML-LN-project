He started to clap and praise him.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi smiled. \u201cPresident, let\u2019s not disrupt Elder Lin\u2019s thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brush was moving non-stop and he smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not about disrupting my thoughts. This artwork is based on the feelings of the twelve of us here. If you guys don\u2019t feel good, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to draw a good one. Don\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all started to be stern after hearing that.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan had had a few glasses of alcohol and he was so excited that his face was red. It showed that he was going to be drunk.</p><br/><p>The others stopped laughing and they tried to look stern.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019d be weird if you guys look like that in the artwork. It\u2019s better to be normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s be normal.\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan smiled and drank a glass of alcohol. \u201cToday\u2019s such a good day, we should all get drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang smiled. \u201cElder Zheng, please watch yourself. If you get drunk, your wife is going to scold us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan laughed. Then, he looked at the people Lin Fan was drawing. \u201cElder Li, look. Is that person you? You look the same but the action is kind of wrong. Weren\u2019t you raising your leg earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li looked over and was stunned. \u201cElder Lin, something is wrong. I only raised my leg for a while just now. Why did it get drawn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it. This is like a camera. I\u2019ve already drawn it, you can\u2019t blame me.\u201d Lin Fan started to draw them one by one. The artwork looked extremely real and it was extraordinary to paint such a clear picture. Other people wouldn\u2019t be able to do it but it was an easy task for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yue, this person is you. It really looks like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it looks like me? It is me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, this artwork is awesome. It\u2019s an honor to witness you draw this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Tao, don\u2019t talk about me. Isn\u2019t this you? Your hunchback is being drawn.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was pretty amazing for Lin Fan to be able to have fun with these elderly men. After all, appreciation of arts isn\u2019t based on age and nationality. As long as you can reach a level to communicate with others, it can overcome any language barrier.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang said, \u201cElder Lin doesn\u2019t have his own name stamp yet. I\u2019m thinking of going to the association tomorrow to make one for Elder Lin. In the future, nobody will dare to counterfeit our association\u2019s artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Elder Lin\u2019s artistic skills are marvelous. I think Elder Lin is going to be at the pinnacle of our association. However, this artwork must be placed in the association. After all, this is like our fortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan suggested, \u201cI think this artwork should be placed in my house. In the future, you guys can come and look for me if you want to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObjection.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, although you are the President, you can\u2019t keep this for yourself. It has to be placed in the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan looked at everyone helplessly. He had actually gotten rejected.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan placed the brush down and said, \u201cIt\u2019s done\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>claps</em></p><br/><p>There was a roaring applause.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cSorry to have embarrassed myself. I just expressed my thoughts freely. I hope everyone is happy. President Zheng, I think this artwork should be placed in the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Zheng? Just call me Elder Zheng,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Lin Fan felt that it was a little weird to call him Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? A young man like you should learn to be open about these things. I don\u2019t mind it at all, why would you mind? Did you forget about signing the form earlier? From now on, you\u2019re one of us. Just call me Elder Zheng,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Elder\u2026 Zheng,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan patted Lin Fan on his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ding ding!</em></p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled when he saw who it was. \u201cChief Wu, aren\u2019t you and Ming Yang at a clubhouse? Why are you calling me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan furrowed his brows when he heard the reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s not looking good. Please come over. Ming Yang is going to get bullied. I can\u2019t seem to convince him. He\u2019s going to die from drinking,\u201d Wu Yun Gang said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. The smile on his face was wiped away. \u201cWhat happened? Where are you guys now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan and the others became stern after hearing Elder Lin\u2019s conversation. It was clear that something had happened. It was Beijing and if something had happened, they could help too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said angrily, \u201cStop him from drinking. I\u2019ll be coming over. If someone still forces him to drink it, retaliate. It\u2019s okay to make things look bad. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian Yun Villa,\u201d Lin Fan asked, \u201cElder Zheng, where is Tian Yun Villa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a friend who\u2019s getting bullied by someone. He\u2019s drinking a lot of alcohol now and I have to be there. If not, something bad is going to happen,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan replied, \u201cI know where Tian Yun Villa is. However, people that can enter the place aren\u2019t normal. They are powerful and wealthy people. It\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll get my security officer to drive you over. Call me if anything happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door was opened.</p><br/><p>A 1.8m man stood there and said, \u201cElder Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend Master Lin to Tian Yun Villa as quickly as possible. Do not let Master Lin get harmed in any way. You can expose your identity if needed.\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan was stern. He knew that it was an urgent problem after looking at Lin Fan\u2019s stressed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand. \u201cSorry, everyone, I\u2019ll be making a move. Thank you, Elder Zheng. I\u2019ll make it up to you guys in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Go ahead before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he quickly left for Tian Yun Villa.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected to receive a call like this. At the same time, he didn\u2019t understand what Wang Ming Yang was doing. After hearing Wu Yun Gang\u2019s tone, he knew that it was an extremely urgent problem.</p><br/><p>He pressed his fingers together and read their fortunes.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any life endangerment but he was extremely furious.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get you there as quickly as I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded.\u201dThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang respected Lin Fan as he knew that he was not a simple man since he could speak to Elder Zhao so casually.</p><br/><p>Tian Yun Villa.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>The situation was extremely oppressive. Wang Ming Yang had his head lowered and his face was red. It was clear that he had drunk a lot of alcohol.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang grabbed Wang Ming Yang\u2019s hand and shook his head. \u201cStop drinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wu, what do you mean? Chief Wang can drink, why are you stopping him? Are you not giving me face?\u201d Young Master Jiang said unhappily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

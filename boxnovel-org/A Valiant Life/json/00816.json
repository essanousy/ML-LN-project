The reactions of people are simply too illogical.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know? I learned this from the ladies on the streets. I think this Caucasian has never had any scallion pancakes before. That is why he is so excited. Don\u2019t be too anxious. Just wait and see,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian just looked at him as if he was saying that he\u2019d be a fool to believe in his words.</p><br/><p>Then, Henry Wang had already stuffed the entire scallion pancake into his mouth. He looked like he was enjoying it. Furthermore, he licked the packaging clean. He didn\u2019t want to miss out on any crumbs.</p><br/><p>He had been completely convinced by the scallion pancake. Then, he immediately grabbed the cart with both of his hands and looked at Lin Fan in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is your scallion pancake so delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a question that was difficult to answer. Why was it so delicious?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even know. Perhaps he could only ask the Encyclopedia about it.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang dared to swear that it was the most delicious thing he had ever eaten. He had never experienced a delicacy like this.</p><br/><p>Although it didn\u2019t look really good, he only realized its goodness after eating it. The other delicacies that he had tasted in the past couldn\u2019t match up to this at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, stay calm.\u201d Lin Fan was frightened by his ecstatic and crazy expressions. If he was unsteady and started to pee his pants, he would be on the news again.</p><br/><p>He even thought of a good headline.</p><br/><p>\u2018A foreigner peed his pants after eating scallion pancakes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the others didn\u2019t say anything. Only Henry Wang continued to ramble on. In the end, he said something about an incredible place and left excitedly.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the others just looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was said worriedly, \u201cDid this foreigner go crazy after eating it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be the case.\u201d Lin Fan was a little worried. If he were to go crazy after eating his scallion pancakes, he would definitely feel bad about it.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore since the person had left.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was still thinking about the taste as he left Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>It was indescribable. One had to taste it personally to be able to understand how good it was.</p><br/><p>He immediately called someone without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHenry, what is it?\u201d A manager picked up at the headquarters.</p><br/><p>Henry had been working in the Michelin company for quite some time. Although he was just a food critic, he was pretty powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have found the true delicacy,\u201d Henry Wang said anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue delicacy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s in Shanghai, China. I think it can be awarded three Michelin stars. It is worthy of people coming here personally to try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHenry, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I can confirm that. It is really the true delicacy in my eyes. David, I\u2019m not boasting. Nothing that I have tasted thus far can match up to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the environment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will send you the pictures I took.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while.</p><br/><p>He called him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHenry, are you kidding me? It can\u2019t even be awarded one star. Are you treating the reputation of Michelin as a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can assure you that it is really delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party didn\u2019t want to say anything else. The Michelin standard was really strict. In order for a restaurant to be awarded it, it had to be tasted by a lot of \u2018secret food critics\u2019. They had to try it twelve times a year before awarding a star. Therefore, the opinions of a single food critic were practically useless in awarding any stars.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t just ignore Henry\u2019s views because Henry was the best food critic. Furthermore, he was a shareholder of the organization. He was close to the legendary French chef, Robuchon. Robuchon said that he was the most professional food critic in Michelin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what was happening. Henry Wang was trying his best to promote his shop. It had stunned a lot of food critics in the company.</p><br/><p>They were really interested in whatever dishes that Henry recommended. They wondered what kind of delicacy could make Henry become like this.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been living his routine life. He would sell scallion pancakes in the morning and go to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to teach the children in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>However, there was a crowd of foreigners in Cloud Street today.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were stunned when they saw the crowd. They wondered what had happened. Then, they stood outside their shops. They wanted to find out what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was in the crowd. \u201cThis shop\u2019s rules are really annoying. Those that want to eat his scallion pancakes have to queue up. Furthermore, he only sells ten pieces a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHenry, are you kidding me? You dare to claim that this shop deserves three Michelin stars?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The environment is bad, the shop is bad and the level of comfort is bad. It is difficult to even award it with the lowest consolation prize, the knife and fork symbol.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang quickly rebutted, \u201cNo. You have to try it to realize how delicious it is. It is really something unbelievable. You\u2019ll ignore all other delicious food and you\u2019ll only think about this. This time, I asked all of you to come here to try it. You\u2019ll not regret this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd didn\u2019t believe what Henry said. They felt that Henry had gone crazy.</p><br/><p>How could it be?</p><br/><p>Why would they ignore all other delicious food?</p><br/><p>That was totally unbelievable.</p><br/><p>When the townsfolk that was queuing up saw Henry, they started to discuss among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the foreigner that broke down is here again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I thought I wouldn\u2019t see him again. I didn\u2019t expect him to be here again. What is he trying to do this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe even bought a group of people. I told you. The competition is getting stiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was busy with his work but when he saw the foreigner, he was stunned. He immediately rushed over to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the foreigner is here again and he brought a group of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at them in confusion.</p><br/><p>After Henry\u2019s experience there, he knew how the procedures of the queue were like.</p><br/><p>\u201cLearn from me. You have to queue up. If not, the other customers will be furious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no. There goes our chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry counted the number of scallion pancakes and when the tenth scallion pancake was sold, he felt like dying. Then, he looked at his friends helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. They sold out.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to give up. He wanted to keep trying his luck.</p><br/><p>He went to the pushcart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Boss, may I know if you really only sell ten pieces a day?\u201d Henry Wang asked. Then, he pointed at his friends behind him. \u201cThese are my colleagues. They\u2019re here to try your scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYes. Just ten a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really nothing I can do about it?\u201d Henry Wang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cActually, there is. Do you see the poster on the wall? As long as you understand it, you don\u2019t have to queue up for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was stunned. He was in shock, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that when I was here that day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you knew about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he blame him for that?</p></div>\n</div>"}

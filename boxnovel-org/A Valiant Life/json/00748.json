When he first saw the group surrounding him, he thought that something had happened, but when he realized that they were the reporters, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>The possibility that something would happen to Master Lin was so small that it was scary.</p><br/><p>Others might not know of his abilities, but how could he not know?</p><br/><p>He was basically a human-like Tyrannosaurus, that was terrifying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cInspector Liu, what can happen to me? However, for these guys, you have to take a look. Do you recognize them?\u201d</p><br/><p>When these burly men saw that the police were here, they began trembling in fear. They couldn\u2019t stop perspiring. Their main purpose for coming to Shanghai was to give this b*stard a warning. To scare him a little.</p><br/><p>They never thought about making a move on him.</p><br/><p>However, they never thought that their opponent was so awesome that he could wipe out their entire force.</p><br/><p>Each and everyone that came over this time wasn\u2019t ordinary. Two or three of them couldn\u2019t close their bodies up. However, in Lin Fan\u2019s eyes, they weren\u2019t even worth mentioning. That\u2019s how powerful he was.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at the people lying on the floor. With the expert eyes of his many years of experience, one look and he could tell that these people were up to no good. They had an aura of a bandit, who would most likely have their IDs checked if they were walking on the streets.</p><br/><p>\u201cHandcuff all of them and bring them back for interrogation!\u201d Liu Xiao Tian waved his hand in a large motion.</p><br/><p>To the police force, Master Lin was a treasure. Even though he wasn\u2019t an employee, but who in the force wouldn\u2019t know Master Lin?</p><br/><p>Just and kind-hearted. He would definitely not bully anyone.</p><br/><p>These people were blind. They actually dared to set foot in Shanghai to commit an assault.</p><br/><p>The reporters continued to snap photos of the venue.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can you repeat exactly what happened here?\u201d One of the reporters asked.</p><br/><p>The police also needed to write a report, so naturally, they also stood at one side to take it down.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan organized his thoughts, \u201cThe situation goes like this. I was very tired after a long day at work and I was getting ready to get home and rest. However, the moment I got off the car, I was surrounded by these people. They threatened me, asking me if I wanted to die. They said that I continued to spout nonsense, I would die a death so terrible I wouldn\u2019t even know how I died. When I heard that, I immediately knew that these people were bad. As expected, they attacked me without rhyme or reason. As you all know, I can still protect myself since I\u2019m the Vice-President of the National Martial Arts Association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInitially, I didn\u2019t want to do anything to them. But I didn\u2019t expect them to have weapons hidden on them. As a law-abiding citizen, how could I let these dangerous men go? Hence, I took them down and made a police report.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>While listening to him, the reporters kept nodding their heads.</p><br/><p>This is huge news. It definitely is huge news!</p><br/><p>If this were to be exposed, it would definitely attract a lot of attention!</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cBring them all away!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the reporters here, Liu Xiao Tian couldn\u2019t express his closeness with Lin Fan in order to prevent them from writing nonsense.</p><br/><p>Being employees, they were very jittery. As policemen, they were helpless in front of reporters. However, before he left, he gave Lin Fan a nod. The significance was obvious. These people would definitely be thoroughly interrogated.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian left.</p><br/><p>The reporters came in a hurry and left equally in a hurry. They couldn\u2019t wait to get back and write the report.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan felt like the world had become a better place. Everything was comfortable.</p><br/><p>Even though he wasn\u2019t a trained expert, he had frightening strength. He wasn\u2019t any ordinary hooligan. Who else but Ying Jin would have wanted to cause trouble for him?</p><br/><p>One of the top clubs in the Northeast.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation with Black Bear?\u201d A middle-aged man looked at the guy standing in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t too sure at the moment. However, nothing could have happened to him. Black Bear is our strongest fighter, as well as the most vigilant. Warning a small public figure is too easy for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to solve Ying Jin\u2019s matter. We have to settle the problem from the roots up. We have to make him a little more humble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this guy was in the Northeast, it wouldn\u2019t be this troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy was speaking the truth. If this were in the Northeast, no matter how awesome someone was, they would all eventually kneel down.</p><br/><p>However, this fellow was in Shanghai. They couldn\u2019t do much over there, or it\u2019d be as good as setting fire to themselves.</p><br/><p>Therefore, all they could do was to threaten and warn him. They wouldn\u2019t touch him at all.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, one of the little brothers rushed in, \u201cGodfather Liu, something happened! Black Bear and the others were taken away by the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu didn\u2019t say anything. One of his men beside him had a complete change in expression, \u201cHow could that happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! I just called them, but the people who picked it up were the police! I told them I was collecting their rent, then the police told me that they had committed an offense and had been locked up!\u201d The little brother said carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith their experience, how could they be arrested by the police? This is impossible.\u201d The man said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tian, I\u2019ve heard that Master Lin is very powerful. He is the vice-president of the National Martial Arts Association. Could Black Bear have fallen before him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Black Bear and the rest are all good fighters. Even if the opponent can fight, he wouldn\u2019t be able to fight ten over people.\u201d Brother Tian said in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu had a strange expression, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Say no more. Looks like we all underestimate Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Tian was nervous. Those men were all recommended by him. Before this, Black Bear and the others roamed the streets. They weren\u2019t afraid of death and their methods were brutal. They caused a lot of trouble for many other bosses. In the end, they were recruited by him. Right now, he was afraid that Godfather Liu would put the blame on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, you can rest easy. They would definitely not sell us out. I can guarantee it. I can also guarantee that they definitely did not hit him. Before they set off, I reminded them repeatedly not to touch him, only to threaten him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu nodded his head, \u201cI trust in your selection. Give me the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took the phone.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu made a call.</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached home, he laid on his sofa, trying to compose his emotions.</p><br/><p>This matter was coming to an end. He just needed to wait for the news to come out the next day.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t expect Ying Jin to be so fierce that she would actually send people to threaten him. It looked as if she had no other plan.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>At this moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Who is this?\u201d It was from an unknown caller. He didn\u2019t think too much about it and just picked up the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you, Master Lin. It seems that we have a misunderstanding. We can actually be friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so weird? Who are you?\u201d Lin Fan was very clear who was calling. Who else could it be other than someone from Ying Jin\u2019s side?</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople on the streets call me Godfather Liu. Master Lin, please take a step back in the matter regarding Ying Jin. Take it that I, Godfather Liu, owe you a favor. In future, if you come to Northeast, I\u2019d welcome you personally. And if you have anything, I\u2019d definitely not decline it. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cAre you the people backing that meddling woman, Ying Jin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, just a friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft. Who are you trying to lie? Are you her lover?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re asking a bit too much, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Godfather Liu had a bit of unhappiness in his tone. But looking at the current situation, he couldn\u2019t do much to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking. Are you her lover? If you aren\u2019t going to answer me, I\u2019ll just cut the call. We won\u2019t talk about this matter anymore.\u201d He just loved to be nosy. If he didn\u2019t make things clear, he wouldn\u2019t feel at ease.</p><br/><p>The person on the other end of the phone was silent for awhile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Are you happy now?\u201d Godfather Liu answered him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if you had just admitted it earlier? However, I really do admire you. You could get your hands on someone with such a strong flavor. It seems that you have good taste. Speak your mind, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Faraway, in the Northeast, Godfather Liu got momentarily pissed listening to this. He couldn\u2019t wait to kill this b*stard.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Compared to last year, the prices in Qing Xian have increased by 30% in just a month,\u201d a construction project manager said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang nodded. He was thinking about developing the Qing Xian region to be more connected to Hong Kong\u2019s residential areas and shopping districts. At the same time, there were a lot of city rail projects that caused the prices of the buildings to increase.</p><br/><p>Then, a plump man reported his findings, \u201cChief Wang, the leader in Qing Xian gave us a document. Because of a corrupt construction company, it\u2019s a mess there. The leader told us that we have to take over the mess if we want to develop the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang furrowed his brows after hearing that. \u201cAre they stupid? How could they make such a request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know if they\u2019re stupid but they must be crazy. The main thing is that the leader in Qingxian has already found his successor. He is probably free to say anything he likes,\u201d the plump manager said.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand. \u201cTell them it\u2019s impossible. We have already invested more than a hundred billion in this project. They want us to take over a company that\u2019s worth thirty billion? Do they really think we print money for a living?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Knock knock*</p><br/><p>Then, his secretary came in.</p><br/><p>The conference room became silent.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat is it? Can\u2019t you see that we\u2019re in a meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, the secretary wouldn\u2019t have dared to barge into the conference room. However, she had to do so now.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, Master Lin is here. He is waiting for you in your office,\u201d the secretary said.</p><br/><p>She knew the relationship between Master Lin and Chief Wang. Sometimes, the staff would also discuss it. They had even thought that they were gays. However, Chief Wang was attached and they had dismissed that thought.</p><br/><p>However, they were speculating if it was just a cover-up.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang suddenly smiled and waved his hand. \u201cAlright, the meeting is over. You\u2019re dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, I still have to report something,\u201d a manager said. He felt that the meeting had been cut short.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t really care about it. He just waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just email me the details. I will read it at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he left for his office.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, our job\u2019s not done.\u201d The manager looked helplessly as Chief Wang left.</p><br/><p>They felt that Master Lin was like a femme fatale to Chief Wang.</p><br/><p>How could a director of a large company to have such divided attention to his work just because of one person?</p><br/><p>The other employees smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Master Lin is here and Chief Wang will definitely go to meet him. How can work be compared to Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, who doesn\u2019t know the relationship between the two of them? If the secretary barged into a meeting like this in the past, she would definitely be fired.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary just smiled and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat on Wang Ming Yang\u2019s chair and looked out of the window. He was admiring the scenery and thinking about how great it was to be a boss.</p><br/><p>*click*</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, you\u2019re finally here to meet me,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said as he opened the door.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Cloud Street for half a month and you didn\u2019t even visit me. This office is pretty nice. The scenery is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t mind Lin Fan sitting on his seat. He just sat on the edge of the table. \u201cIf you\u2019d like, you can move over and I can make arrangements for you to have a designated corner to make scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned the chair around, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not the life I want. Oh, right. I wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething to do with the Welfare Institute,\u201d Lin Fan said. He grabbed the golf club and carefully hit a golf ball into the hole of the portable golf mat.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang knew that his friend really cared about the Welfare Institute. He felt that perhaps Lin Fan would even spend the rest of his life there.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know that the Welfare Institute has several bungalows behind it, right?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang thought about it. \u201cYeah, they look pretty big and ancient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m thinking of developing them into apartment blocks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cAlright, I know what you\u2019re thinking of. Just let me handle it. Since we\u2019re best buddies, you should know that this is pretty much settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, sometimes, you have a great mind for business. If this succeeds, the prices would be insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not thinking of selling it. I\u2019m thinking about the kids and staff of the Welfare Institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cThat\u2019s a pity. It\u2019s okay. I can still pay for it. How many levels are you prepared to build?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it and said, \u201cAbout 50 to 60 levels. I think there\u2019s only enough space to build one building.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang almost vomited blood after hearing that. He asked, \u201cBro, are you having a fever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy? Twenty levels should be more than enough. Are you thinking of going to heaven by building 50 to 60 stories?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard that, Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, you should know that this is Shanghai. If you want to build 50 to 60 stories, do you know how deep the foundation has to be? Also, the wages and the electricity bills would definitely be insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, you have to think about the housing tax. Since you said that you\u2019re not selling it, you\u2019re going to be crushed.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He clearly hadn\u2019t known that. \u201cIs it really a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cLet\u2019s say I earn a hundred dollars, I would have to pay sixty-one dollars worth of tax. Do you think that\u2019s a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed. \u201cNow that you know that, are you still going to build it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang almost wanted to kill himself.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cLet me ask you this. Are you going to help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough then. If you weren\u2019t going to help, I would understand why you would say so much. Now that you have agreed to help, stop talking about those things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed. \u201cI think I might have been your wife in my past life and made you a cuckold. I\u2019m probably here to repay my debts. This is going to cost me everything I earned last year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and patted Wang Ming Yang on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Since we\u2019re family, why should we be so courteous? I\u2019ll make a move now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he stopped at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. The design looks like this.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

I can\u2019t stand waiting anymore. I keep refreshing the webpage but there\u2019s no news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, why are you even waiting? It doesn\u2019t even have anything to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the latest update, the Health Department has intervened. This prescription of Master Lin\u2019s will definitely be distributed in partnership with the Health Department.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I\u2019m not in a hurry but I have a friend who is suffering from leukemia. He has already become broke from seeing doctors but he\u2019s not even getting better. If Master Lin really develops the prescription, his life will be saved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn future, we shouldn\u2019t call him Master Lin anymore. We should call him Tycoon Lin instead. Just by relying on this prescription, he will be able to go to the pinnacle of life.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201c^Are you all f*cking stupid? Hurry up and look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. Something big has happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What has happened? I have to go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some office workers would refresh the news whenever they were free. They would chat happily with their fellow netizens on the Internet.</p><br/><p>At this moment, they noticed Master Lin\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>When they saw his Weibo, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Stupefied!</p><br/><p>In disbelief!</p><br/><p>Shocked!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Such emotions were all bursting out. They even felt that it seemed a little fake. It seemed impossible.</p><br/><p>What had they just seen?</p><br/><p>Master Lin had actually publicized the prescription on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! I don\u2019t even know what to say now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. I have never submitted to anyone in my life but now, I\u2019m really in admiration of Master Lin. This isn\u2019t something that just anyone could do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I told you all. This is my idol. There\u2019s no way he would be like what you guys said. Who was the one who said that Master Lin would become a capitalist? Please, step out now. I\u2019ll f*cking give your mouth a good beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s words are too f*cking\u2026please excuse me\u2026it\u2019s too emotional. I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, even if you buy all these medicinal ingredients, it would only cost over $2000, no more than $3000 in total. What kind of price is this? That\u2019s peanuts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, when you contract leukemia, you usually would have to spend tens of thousands and it may not even get cured. Now, Master Lin is saying that you can cure it with just over $2000. This can\u2019t be a dream, can it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Weibo had completely blown up.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Everyone was on Master Lin\u2019s Weibo page, looking at the prescription.</p><br/><p>At various hospitals.</p><br/><p>Leukemia patients were suffering and their loved ones were helpless. In fact, some families had become poor due to all the medical fees. They were really unable to fork out any more money to pay for the medical fees.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Gasps of shock rang out from the hospitals.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. The prescription has been developed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and contact the pharmaceutical center on the Weibo post.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is no longer a terminal illness. It can be cured with just $2000 now. What are you waiting for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, only a few people had been paying attention to Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo. But when the Weibo post came out, those who had been paying attention cried out in shock, causing the news to spread in the hospitals.</p><br/><p>When the doctors caught news of this, they couldn\u2019t wait to open their Weibos. When they saw the content of the Weibo post, they were all dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>To them, this seemed completely impossible.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When the person who had been in charge of providing Lin Fan with medicinal ingredients all along saw this Weibo post, he was so moved that he almost cried.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected that Master Lin would include his phone number in the post. Master Lin had even advertised for their Chinese medicinal ingredient factory. This was hard to believe.</p><br/><p>His heart was filled with gratitude.</p><br/><p>He felt that providing Master Lin with medicinal ingredients for free had been worth it.</p><br/><p>In fact, he had not thought that Master Lin would repay him in such a great way. Then, he didn\u2019t say anything. He just hurried to gather the workers and start preparing the prescriptions. The number of callers wanting to buy the medicine was just too great. They couldn\u2019t even respond in time.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing went their own ways. As for those who were still gathered at the school entrance, Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t be bothered anymore.</p><br/><p>They were so tired that they were close to fainting. All they wanted was to go home for a good sleep.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan drove his car, enjoying the breeze. His felt an immense happiness in his heart.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring!*</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s call came</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered the phone, \u201cWhat is it? You\u2019ve seen the Weibo post?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang really didn\u2019t know what to say. Was he supposed to call his brother stupid? His brother was more capable than anyone.</p><br/><p>But was it not stupid to post such an important prescription directly on Weibo?</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t gain anything from that at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, I really am in awe of you. How can you be so positive?\u201d Wang Ming Yang sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cI\u2019m talking about the prescription! Don\u2019t you know how important it is? And you just publicized it like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cOf course. Or should I just burn it instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Why didn\u2019t you keep ownership of it? The value of this prescription is huge.\u201d Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t know what else to say. But no matter what this brother of his did, he would always approve.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They had to stay united!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI know. Its value is in treating leukemia sufferers back to health, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang blushed shamefully. \u201cAlright, alright. You\u2019re f*cking awesome, Brother. I can only call out \u2018666\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTo tell you the truth, I really don\u2019t care much about money. And even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t rely on the monopoly of a prescription to gain money. Before the research, I had already decided that if I developed it successfully, I would distribute it for free. Later on, when the Health Department came looking for me, it just further supported my decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang admired his Brother so much that he would prostrate himself. He was completely speechless. His brother was so f*cking reasonable that he had no counterargument.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m hanging up. I\u2019m so tired that I can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan switched off his phone. He had to get a good sleep today. Even if the sky fell, it wouldn\u2019t concern him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Director Chen had not managed to get the prescription from Lin Fan and he felt so bad that it was as if he had eaten sh*t.</p><br/><p>Then, he made a call to his superior to explain the situation.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected Lin Fan to publicize the prescription. That was just plainly going against them.</p><br/><p>At that time, in that country, there were over 4 million leukemia sufferers and this number increased by about 40 thousand every year. It was a huge group of sufferers.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And he wasn\u2019t the only one who knew these numbers. Even those pharmaceutical companies knew it well.</p><br/><p>Over 4 million.</p><br/><p>Even if they sold each prescription for only 10 thousand, how much would they be able to earn?</p><br/><p>But now, it had all become empty hope.</p><br/><p>The prescription had been publicized, removing all agents from the distribution process. It was only 2 thousand dollars now. How cheap was that?</p><br/><p>There were probably countless hospitals that now hated Lin Fan\u2019s guts.</p><br/><p>Some hospitals that were specialized in leukemia treatment were probably going to go bankrupt.</p><br/><p>In the past, these hospitals profited plentifully but now that the patients could just brew their own medicine, who would still go to these hospitals? Hence, many avenues for creating wealth had been cut off.</p></div>\n</div>"}

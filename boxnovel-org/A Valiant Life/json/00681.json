The whole thing had already been resolved but now that Master Lin had opened his mouth, this situation was definitely not settled.</p><br/><p>Although he did not know what was going to happen, Master Lin had just asked him if the hit he took just now was good.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment,\u201d Lin Fan said as he walked to the front of Liang Hong Tian.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian\u2019s brows furrowed as he said, \u201cYou are the one who is close friends with Zou Tian Fu. How could I have never seen you before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately replied, \u201cWhat did you hit him for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian laughed and said, \u201cWhat reason do I need for hitting him?\u201d Then his gaze shifted towards Chang Hai Ge and he sneered, \u201cTell him whether I need a reason to hit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge\u2019s expression changed. He felt like he was being humiliated but in this situation, he could not make a big fuss. \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he was getting ready to open his mouth, something really surprising happened. His eyes opened wide and he looked at Master Lin is disbelief. He had not expected that\u2026</p><br/><p>Pam!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lifted his hand and delivered a slap. It was quick, accurate, unmistakable and it had a sort of a rhythm to it.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian flinched. His expression was one of complete shock. He had never thought that Lin Fan would actually dare to treat him like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to hit me?\u201d Liang Hong Tian had an ominous glint in his eyes and said that sentence very fiercely.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lightly swung his arm and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need a reason to hit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Liang Hong Tian was furious. He had never thought that Lin Fan would be this aggressive. Also, the two men behind saw Young Liang get hit and they could not control themselves. They immediately wanted to go forward and attack Lin Fan but Liang Hong Tian stopped them.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, very good,\u201d Liang Hong Tian said. He had grown up to such an old age and yet he had never been hit before. But today, he had been hit. This kid in front of him, who perhaps was sick of living, had actually dared to hit him.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had seen that he was Zou Tian Fu\u2019s friend so he did not want to get into a fight. However, he had not expected that Lin Fan would dare to attack him first.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Nobody had expected that Lin Fan would actually slap him one more time.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian looked a bit dazed. Lin Fan had actually hit him on both his left and right sides.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly said, \u201cSince you said it was good, I slapped you again to let you experience it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to his plan, in order to draw out his hatred, he had to go from something simple to something complicated. First, he would give him two slaps in a row to liven up the atmosphere before taking things slow.</p><br/><p>This was especially to cause Liang Hong Tian\u2019s focus to be on him. When that happened, he would have succeeded.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge and Shen Ming were both dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>They had never thought that Master Lin would take action. Not to mention that he was so swift and had no hesitation at all.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge did not know why but he was especially touched by Master Lin\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>Based on what he had seen, Master Lin did all of that for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mother.\u201d The two men behind Liang Hong Tian could not take it anymore and rushed in front. He dared to hit Young Liang. He must not want to live.</p><br/><p>Right now, his main goal was to increase the emotions between him and Liang Hong Tian. The other people were just extras and he did not want to interact too much with them.</p><br/><p>*clattering sounds*</p><br/><p>After a small scuffle, they immediately fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian was dumbfounded. He had never thought that this b*stard would be so powerful, that multiple people could not match up to him.</p><br/><p>The room was in complete silence. Zhang Qing Qing was dumbly rooted to the spot. When the things started to happen, it was completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>It was yet another slap.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian had never thought a day like this would ever come. He could not help shouting angrily, \u201cWhy are you so insistent on hitting my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cI have no reason. I just want to hit your face. Do you know who I am now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Lin Fan from Shanghai. Everyone calls me Master Lin. Remember my name and you better not forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Liang Hong Tian\u2019s face was totally red. He did not know what to do now. He started to take his phone out to call for backup but Lin Fan did not give him that chance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed onto Liang Hong Tian\u2019s hand and started slapping his palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOw, ow, ow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a simple bit of action had left Liang Hong Tian\u2019s brain in a mess. He had been completely dumbfounded by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan let go of Liang Hong Tian\u2019s wrist, Liang Hong Tian kneeled on the floor with a \u2018plop\u2019 sound. His head was drooping, in a daze and moving back and forth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rubbed his chin and pondered. The hatred he drew this time was not good enough. He had to do it in batches to be more effective.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge and Shen Ming were dumbfoundedly rooted to the spot. The scene that had unfolded in front of them exceeded everyone\u2019s expectation and was too much.</p><br/><p>Master Lin had beat up Liang Hong Tian. This issue would definitely be blown out of proportion. Given Liang Hong Tian\u2019s character, he definitely would not let this go.</p><br/><p>Screwed!</p><br/><p>They were completely screwed.</p><br/><p>They did not know how to protect Master Lin anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Liang Hong Tian. He had drawn out a lot of his hatred today but he had not completed his mission. But he decided to forget it, he would attract another wave of hatred tomorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lin Fan said to Chang Hai Ge and Shen Ming. He walked up to Wu Ya Ting, carried her on his back and said, \u201cShe really is heavy after getting drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Fang had never seen anything like this before but she still followed Lin Fan. If this man had not appeared, then there was no telling what would have happened that day.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, it was pretty scary.</p><br/><p>Outside the nightclub.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chang Hai Ge and the rest of them and said, \u201cYou guys can go back now. Thanks for tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, there is no need to say thanks. However, since you hit Liang Hong Tian inside there, will there be any problems?\u201d Chang Hai Ge was pretty worried now. This Liang Hong Tian was not an ordinary person and this situation would definitely become very complicated.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \u201cWhat could possibly happen? It\u2019s just a few hundred slaps. I\u2019ll go see him tomorrow and there won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge blushed with shame and said, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>But after the two of them left, Lin Fan took out his phone and then gave Wu Yun Gang a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what\u2019s up? Calling me at such an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cPresident Wu, your niece was sold out by one of her best friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d When Wu Yun Gang heard this, he immediately got up and his face was filled with concern. \u201cMaster Lin, nothing happened right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cEverything is fine. It was all resolved by me. However, she is still very drunk. I think you should come down and send her home.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu Yun Gang heard that, he could not help sighing in relief. Then, it was like he suddenly thought of something. He said, \u201cRegarding this, Master Lin, I trust you a lot. You and my niece are very young and have a good connection. I\u2019ll have to trouble you tonight. Oh no, not good. We\u2019re breaking up. Hello? Master Lin, can you hear me? Hear\u2026 me\u2026 Beep beep beep\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He looked at his phone and saw that Wu Yun Gang had actually hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at Wu Ya Ting who was resting on his shoulder and he laughed. What does this b*stard take me for? He is even willing to sell his niece.</p><br/><p>Su Fang was standing by the side, looking very cautious. She still had not reacted to what had happened just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll send you guys back,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Su Fang immediately nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up. After sending Su Fang and Wu Ya Ting back home, he immediately left. Although this Wu Ya Ting was very pretty, he was not that kind of person to take advantage of others.</p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>After Wu Ya Ting woke up, she had a very dizzy feeling in her head. She could not remember what happened had last night. Then afterward, it was like she remembered what happened. She immediately pushed her blanket aside and sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>Su Fang walked in and said, \u201cYa Ting, you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting was having a bit of a headache and said, \u201cSu Fang, what happened last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she thought about last night, without wasting a breath, she said, \u201cYa Ting, don\u2019t go and play with Qing Qing anymore. Last night, you were betrayed by her. She got you drunk and wanted to let a guy take you away. You were oblivious to what was going on yesterday and it was very dangerous. If it was not for your Uncle Lin that came to save you, something bad could have happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu Ya Ting was stunned. Then she thought about the young man she saw the other day.</p><br/><p>Su Fang was sitting by her side and telling her everything that had happened. When Wu Ya Ting heard it, she was filled with rage. She had not expected that Zhang Qing Qing would do that to her.</p><br/><p>Although she could not remember the situation, thinking about it made her feel scared.</p><br/><p>However, the thing that made her curious was that this guy had told her to be careful of her best friends. She had never thought that he would actually be correct.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

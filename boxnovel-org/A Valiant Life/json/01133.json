Then, he asked curiously, \u201cDo you think that kid will come and take revenge on us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Lin Fan answered firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was surprised. He didn\u2019t quite understand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cBecause his dad just called me and invited me to Huaizhou for a little gathering but I rejected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. He hadn\u2019t expected Chu Shen\u2019s dad to call his brother. But thinking about it, it made sense.</p><br/><p>To his brother, playing around with Chu Shen was like bullying a baby. And only when Chu Shen\u2019s dad called, they could interact on equal terms.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen\u2019s dad definitely wouldn\u2019t get angered or humiliated because of this kind of small matter and he wouldn\u2019t flip out on Lin Fan. Instead, he resolved it peacefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving now. Don\u2019t forget about the research lab. You have to hurry up.\u201d As Lin Fan left, he said a few final words to Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I already said to be patient, didn\u2019t I? It requires time!\u201d Wang Ming Yang yelled as he watched the car drive away. However, he had no idea if his brother heard it.</p><br/><p>The boss of Eastern Han Organization was below the office building, shouting at the back of a car. It was a surprising sight and it was very strange.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan stepped through the door, Zhao Zhong Yang came over hastily. His expression was one of astonishment and disbelief. \u201cBrother Lin, you beat someone up again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Who did you hear that from?\u201d Lin Fan definitely wouldn\u2019t admit it. It wasn\u2019t good to beat too many people up. It would affect his image.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang rolled his eyes as he took out his phone. \u201cLook. Didn\u2019t you say so on Weibo? Also, I looked at the comments and they\u2019re all talking about this. Could that guy really be the young master of Huaizhou\u2019s Chu Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him. \u201cHe probably is. I can\u2019t remember. Don\u2019t bring these things up anymore. They\u2019re all just trivial matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really didn\u2019t care much about this.</p><br/><p>He had taught that Chu Shen a lesson because that guy had deliberately tried to cause trouble for his brother. How could Lin Fan just stand and watch his brother get bullied? It didn\u2019t matter who it was. Lin Fan definitely had to teach him a lesson.</p><br/><p>At that moment, outside, something happened on Fraud Tian\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a beggar. I\u2019m here to look for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside, Fraud Tian had taken out a dollar and was about to give it to the beggar passing by to make him go away. Regarding such situations, Fraud Tian felt very helpless. <em>If you have hands and legs, do you have to do such things?</em></p><br/><p>However, he had to admit that this was an easy way to get money. Just by opening up one\u2019s palms, one could get money.</p><br/><p>Initially, Fraud Tian hadn\u2019t wanted to give a single cent. However, just letting the beggar stand at the entrance all day was not a solution either.</p><br/><p>At the entrance, a middle-aged man with a dust-covered face and tattered clothes was standing there carrying something on his back. Perhaps it was clothes.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian found it strange. \u201cWhat are you looking for Master Lin for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man looked a little pained and a little afraid. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Master Lin to help to treat an illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t treat illnesses here. Go to the hospital to treat your illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man looked at Fraud Tian, then at the inside of the shop and nodded. His expression was a little gloomy and a little perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment. What is it?\u201d Lin Fan saw what was going on. He got up, came out, and shouted at the man\u2019s back view.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man turned around and said in a pleading tone, \u201cMy son is sick. I don\u2019t have money for him to see a doctor. I heard that there\u2019s a Master Lin in Shanghai, so I wanted to come and ask Master Lin to help and treat my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked closely at that middle-aged man\u2019s appearance. That man probably didn\u2019t know that he was Master Lin. And looking at his feet, his shoes were all broken and tattered. There were even blood stains. It seemed that he had traveled a long way.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me take a look then,\u201d Lin Fan said with a gesture of his hand. He could tell with one look that this man was very poor. His son had fallen sick and it seemed that he hadn\u2019t gone to the hospital because he was too poor.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t wanted to trouble himself at first. If he were to open the floodgates and start treating illnesses, there would probably be so many people looking for him that it would be scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to look for Master Lin,\u201d said Wang Da Fu softly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As those words left his mouth.</p><br/><p>Wang Da Fu immediately dashed forward and knelt to the ground. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m begging you. Please save my son. I don\u2019t have money to go to the hospital. This is the only place I can go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around. It seemed that there were people looking over here. Without being bothered by how dirty this man\u2019s body was or how bad he smelled, Lin Fan helped him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand up, stand up. Come in. Let me take a look at your child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Da Fu immediately nodded and walked into the shop. Instantly, a pungent smell spread through the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest felt a little helpless but they didn\u2019t show any signs of unhappiness.</p><br/><p>Because they were all kind people.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Da Fu put down the child that was behind his back. When everyone saw this, they were surprised as they hadn\u2019t expected that the child was actually on his back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what is this?\u201d When Fraud Tian saw that the child had been on the man\u2019s back, he immediately went forward and carried the child.</p><br/><p>\u201cChild\u2026\u201d Fraud Tian patted the child\u2019s face gently and realized that the child\u2019s face was pale and green. The child\u2019s lips were purple and his eyes were all white. Fraud Tian touched the child\u2019s neck. There was no pulse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan with a difficult look on his face as if he wanted to say something but didn\u2019t know how.</p><br/><p>Wang Da Fu suddenly started crying. \u201cMaster Lin, I beg you to save my son. I\u2019ve walked for three days and nights in order to reach this place. People didn\u2019t want me in their cars and said that I couldn\u2019t take their cars, so I could only walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw Fraud Tian\u2019s expression, he wasn\u2019t bothered. Then, he comforted the man. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Let me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, he knew what Fraud Tian wanted to say.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took over the child and touched him. He felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, my son is fine, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Wang Da Fu said. He seemed as if he was about to cry. It was as if he didn\u2019t want to hear an answer that would leave him in despair.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was silent for a moment. Then, he smiled. \u201cMmm. He\u2019s fine. You brought him here in time. It\u2019s just a small problem. You may all go out for now. Pull down the shutter and stand outside the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was startled. This was the first time he had seen Lin Fan say something like this. He really wanted to say that the child was clearly dead.</p><br/><p>But looking at Lin Fan, he didn\u2019t say it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you still sitting around for? Hurry up,\u201d urged Lin Fan. This was a very thorny problem. For Lin Fan to feel that it was thorny, one could tell just how severe it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Fraud Tian and the rest came to their senses and immediately went out. Then, they pulled the shutter down and stood outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll definitely be fine, won\u2019t it?\u201d Wang Da Fu seemed desperate for the answer. He was actually very fearful.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded. \u201cMmm. Since he is handling this, it will definitely be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was his faith in Lin Fan.</p></div>\n</div>"}

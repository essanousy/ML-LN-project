And the dinner was being prepared by the two ladies. As two big celebrities, if fans were to see this, they would probably in disbelief.</p><br/><p>After all, if the fans were to see their idols having to cook personally, they would definitely burst out cursing.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cI just called him and he was already at the airport. He should be on the way here now. Oh right, make the dishes more delicious. Don\u2019t make a mess. Otherwise, we\u2019ll get him to cook instead. His skills are not a joke, they\u2019re earth-shattering. If anyone can learn just one of his skills, it would be a big deal.</p><br/><p>He really respected his brother\u2019s culinary skills. He had to admit that no one in this world could compare to his brother\u2019s culinary skills.</p><br/><p>However, very regretfully, this brother of his didn\u2019t like to cook. If he were to open a restaurant, the whole country would probably go to try his cooking.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, it had been a very long time since he had last tasted his brother\u2019s cooking.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le smiled. \u201cHow could we get Brother Lin to cook? Although his skills are good, we\u2019re personally cooking today to treat the two of you well. The two of you can just sit and wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the kitchen, Xu Zi Le and Wu Huan Yue were giggling. Their pairs of snow-white hands were not the least bit sluggish. Instead, they were very agile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, I didn\u2019t expect that you would be this skillful,\u201d said Xu Zi Le with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re a big celebrity now. If your fans find out, they would be so surprised that their teeth might fall out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled brightly. \u201cSister Xu, in the past, I used to cook for myself. That\u2019s why this is nothing much at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le chuckled, then leaned closer. \u201cSo you can perform on stage, in the kitchen, and in bed. Whoever gets you in the future would be so lucky. Not only can you earn money, but you can also do housework. He could just lie at home all day and be treated by you. How comfortable would that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue laughed cheerily. \u201cSister Xu, aren\u2019t you the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Xu Zi Le thought about it. \u201cI\u2019m still far off. I\u2019m together with your Brother Wang all thanks to Brother Lin. If your Brother Lin didn\u2019t approve, I think Ming Yang might have dumped me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d Wu Huan Yue\u2019s mouth gaped in disbelief. To her, it was simply not possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou always underestimate the friendship between men.\u201d Xu Zi Le patted Wu Huan Yue\u2019s head. \u201cSometimes, the feelings between men are even better than those between a man and a woman. I\u2019ve seen many of such situations before. That\u2019s why I\u2019m already tired now. I don\u2019t just have to treat Ming Yang well, I also have to perform well in front of Brother Lin. If someday, Brother Lin says that I\u2019m not good, I would be dumped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. Brother Lin isn\u2019t that kind of person,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue. She had never thought of things this way.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le chuckled but didn\u2019t carry on with that topic. Her pretty eyes landed on Wu Huan Yue. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. Let\u2019s talk about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu Huan Yue\u2019s pink lips opened slightly. Her hands stopped moving as she turned her head. \u201cSister Xu, what\u2019s there about me to talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you\u2019re still pretending in front of your Sister Xu,\u201d Xu Zu Le laughed. She put on a look as if she was very experienced in this regard. Then, she took a look outside before saying softly, \u201cDo you want Sister Xu to help you tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp\u2026help me?\u201d Wu Huan Yue\u2019s face turned pink as if she had thought about something.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Tonight, Sister Xu is throwing caution to the wind. I don\u2019t usually drink wine but Sister Xu likes you. And I heard from Ming Yang that this Brother Lin has caught the eye of quite a number of people. Sometimes, a lady has to be more spontaneous. Just do it in one go and you won\u2019t have to worry about anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue lowered her head so much that her head was almost buried in her chest. She didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. She felt as if Sister Xu was going a little too far.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be shy. I think you\u2019re pretty good now. You have fame and you have the looks. And your figure is great. Your only weakness is that you don\u2019t have as much time as other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn relationships, the most feared thing is time. Time can defeat everything else. Even if there are deep feelings, time can cause two people to become estranged,\u201d said Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had been a little shy at first but when she heard Sister Xu say these things, her snow-white ears perked up as if she was listening very attentively.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Xu, actually, I can give up everything that I have now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was soft but it was a form of declaration.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl. Why would you give up everything? You can\u2019t throw away your career. You could give up your career for a man but that man might not even care. That\u2019s why Sister Xu is telling you that a woman has to have her own career. This isn\u2019t a burden but a kind of advantage,\u201d said Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was taken aback by Xu Zi Le\u2019s words. She asked curiously, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen who are serious about work are very charming. Then do you know what women who are serious about work are?\u201d asked Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue shook her head. She was a little confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are subduing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c???\u201d Wu Huan Yue had a look of confusion on her face. She didn\u2019t understand what Sister Xu meant at all.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le looked outside again before saying, \u201cLet me tell you that this subduing effect is very mysterious. Do you know what your Brother Wang likes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wu Huan Yue felt as if she was going to find out something incredible.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le leaned close to Wu Huan Yue\u2019s ear and spoke softly. When Wu Huan Yue heard her words, her ears instantly turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wang\u2026 He\u2026he has such a fetish?\u201d Wu Huan Yue felt as if her view of the world had crumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a fetish. This is the subduing effect, understand? Otherwise, why do you think Sister Xu always brings those costumes back after filming every show? Those are all for him,\u201d said Xu Zi Le, \u201cThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t give up this career. As long as you manage your time well, it will not be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut let\u2019s go back to the main topic. Tell your Sister Xue. Have you made your decision yet?\u201d asked Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue looked at Xu Zi Le and lightly bit her lips. She was a little nervous and a little afraid.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>The soup in the pot started boiling up. The soup was about to spill over.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Sister Xu, the soup is going to boil over.\u201d Wu Huan Yue was momentarily stunned.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le saw it and said, \u201cI said so much to you that I forgot about the pot.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Knock knock!*</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, open the door. I\u2019m here.\u201d At that moment, a voice came from outside.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang immediately stood up and walked to the door. Then, he shouted, \u201cThose in the kitchen, hurry up. He\u2019s here.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

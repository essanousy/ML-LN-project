However, it can still be cured. He just needs constant treatment. I can only tell you his current state after seeing the latest treatment report.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much will it cost to treat him?\u201d The reporters asked.</p><br/><p>The doctor continued, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say. According to this boy\u2019s illness, age and treatment plan, if it goes smoothly, it would take about $200,000. If it turns out to be more serious, it might need $500,000. If it reaches a critical stage, it might even cost $1 million. Furthermore, patients with leukemia have poor immune systems and if he gets an infection, he would have to undergo treatment again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much has his family spent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cThey have spent nearly $150,000. However, he only underwent one treatment. There\u2019s still a long way to go. He could spend up to $100,000 in a day in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only a well to do family would be able to afford such expensive medical fees.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It cost $100,000 a day. Furthermore, leukemia wasn\u2019t like contracting a cold. It would take more than a few days to recover. The amount of time needed was difficult to determine.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin held Yang Yuan\u2019s hand worriedly, \u201cHow could you come here alone? Aren\u2019t you going to school anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters took a lot of pictures of Yang Yuan. They were really moved by what he had done for his brother. He had actually hid in a bus compartment just to visit his brother. It was really a dangerous act.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I can cure my brother,\u201d Yang Yuan said.</p><br/><p>Yang Huan nodded. \u201cBrother, I feel revitalized after seeing you. I will recover soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Bin touched Yang Yuan\u2019s head. \u201cBe good, your brother will recover soon. I will send you back home tomorrow and you have to continue studying, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor came to Yang Yuan and said, \u201cLittle boy, you have to be obedient. Your brother will recover in no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, they were just trying to console him. How could they not know the complications of his brother\u2019s illness?</p><br/><p>Although it could be treated, the amount of time and money required was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I really can heal my brother. I have this.\u201d Yang Yuan immediately unzipped his pocket and took out a small bottle. Then, he poured out the thing that was in it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>A circular medicinal pill appeared on his palm. \u201cAs long as my brother eats this, he will recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor laughed after hearing that. How could it be? However, he didn\u2019t want to crush the hopes of this young boy after seeing his determined expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d The doctor asked.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan wanted to tell him the truth about the deity uncle. However, he thought of his promise to him and didn\u2019t tell the doctor about it.</p><br/><p>Then, he kept his mouth shut and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin sighed. \u201cAlright, be good. Don\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters pointed their cameras at Yang Yuan and captured his determined expression which clearly showed how eager he was for his brother to recover.</p><br/><p>It was a belief. An undying belief.</p><br/><p>Yang Huan looked at the round thing in his brother\u2019s hand and shouted, \u201cBrother, I\u2019ll eat it. I want to recover!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan went over. \u201cEat it and you\u2019ll recover!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop playing,\u201d Yang Bin said as he grabbed his son\u2019s hand. \u201cBe good. Your brother is sick and he can\u2019t eat random things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, mum\u2026\u201d Yang Yuan looked at his parents and cried, \u201cIf he eats this, he will definitely recover. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The doctor that was standing beside them said, \u201cLet him eat it then. It\u2019s his hope of healing his brother. We shouldn\u2019t crush his hopes. Furthermore, he wouldn\u2019t feed him anything poisonous, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor thought that it was a snack and eating it wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin looked at the doctor. \u201cAre you sure it won\u2019t affect anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the doctor replied.</p><br/><p>Then, Yang Bin let go of Yang Yuan\u2019s hand. \u201cAlright, let your brother eat it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan was ecstatic. He placed the medicinal pill in his brother\u2019s mouth. \u201cBrother, quickly eat it. You\u2019ll recover!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Yang Huan nodded and ate the pill. \u201cBrother, it\u2019s so sweet and fragrant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. This is\u2026\u201d Yang Yuan was joyous. However, he couldn\u2019t say what it was. \u201cBrother, this is a really good thing. It was difficult for me to get it. When you\u2019ve recovered, you have to listen to my words. You can\u2019t fool with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Yang Huan nodded firmly and swallowed the pill.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan then leaned in and stared at him intently. He looked like he really believed that his brother would recover.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The doctor sighed in sadness. Perhaps this little fella was going to be disappointed soon.</p><br/><p>The reporters also reacted similarly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boy really cares for his own little brother.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYeah, how can this happen? Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t have let his little brother eat the candy. At least it gave his older brother some hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, their brotherly love is so heartwarming. But illness is never kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a picture of this and post it online. Hopefully, it will capture the attention of some kind-hearted people to donate some money to save this boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Bin said, \u201cAlright, your brother has eaten it. Let him rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan said, \u201cOkay, I know. I\u2019m waiting here to watch him recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Bin didn\u2019t know what to say and tears started to well up in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The doctor patted Yang Yuan on his head. \u201cBe good. The hope of recovery has been planted in your brother. We have to continue \u2018watering\u2019 it. Don\u2019t worry. He will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yang Yuan really trusted the deity uncle. He believed that he will definitely succeed and heal his brother.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, my body feels very hot.\u201d Suddenly, Yang Huan\u2019s face started to change.</p><br/><p>His pale face started to become flush.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d The doctor was stunned after looking at what was happening. He saw that this boy\u2019s face was starting to look better.</p><br/><p>When he grabbed onto Yang Huan\u2019s arm, it felt a little damp.</p><br/><p>The reporters were at a loss. They didn\u2019t know what was happening.</p><br/><p>Only Yang Yuan started to jump in joy. \u201cIt\u2019s happening, it\u2019s happening! Brother, you\u2019re going to recover!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Huan\u2019s pores started to contract and expand repeatedly. Whenever they expanded, a drop of clear liquid appeared. It looked as if his body was expelling something.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin wanted to scold his son for giving Yang Huan the pill. However, something extraordinary happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook!\u201d A reporter shouted and pointed at Yang Huan\u2019s bald head.</p><br/><p>Something unthinkable was happening to his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

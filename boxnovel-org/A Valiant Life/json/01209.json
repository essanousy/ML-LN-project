When Wu Yun Gang found out that everyone was leaving, he couldn\u2019t bear it. They had only been in Beijing for a while, but they were already leaving. He wanted everyone to stay a little longer.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wanted to return to Shanghai. Wang Ming Yang had business to settle back there too.</p><br/><p>The previous night, this group of men had had a lot of fun.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest had gotten very close as well. They were like sisters now.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan looked at Wu You Lan and the rest, he felt helpless. The Encyclopedia\u2019s task would be quite difficult to complete. It was quite f*cked.</p><br/><p>Getting stuck here was pretty f*cked up.</p><br/><p>He wanted to unlock the Xianxia major class of knowledge. Even if he couldn\u2019t become immortal, he wanted to at least fly or something.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, what time is your flight?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao replied, \u201cIt\u2019s at 5 PM. What about yours, Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered, \u201cAbout the same as yours. You have to take care on the way back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao nodded. \u201cYup, I know, Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>To everyone, last night\u2019s reunion had been really joyous. Now that they had to part ways, they were a little upset.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest thought that it was quite lonely for Yun Xue Yao to go back alone. However, it couldn\u2019t be helped. Haojiang was too far, so they could only wait until they met again.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>In the early morning.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived at the shop, a large number for townsfolk had already gathered at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, congratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on receiving the reward! It must feel great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI always knew that Master Lin was the most awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. If Master Lin isn\u2019t awesome, I don\u2019t know who is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk really worshipped him. He was too f*cking awesome.</p><br/><p>Facing the townsfolk\u2019s praise, Lin Fan accepted it calmly. After all, what these likeable townsfolk were saying was true. In fact, these were words from the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>The other shop owners specially came forward to look at Little Boss\u2019s award as well. They even held it and took group photos together. It felt amazing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. There\u2019s no need to make such a big deal of this. This is actually very normal,\u201d Lin Fan spoke calmly. To him, this kind of thing wasn\u2019t worth mentioning. After all, he was a god-like being.</p><br/><p>Getting such an award was really simple.</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at Master Lin. In that instant, they didn\u2019t know what to say. As they looked at Master Lin\u2019s serene expression, they couldn\u2019t stay calm.</p><br/><p>If it had been anyone else, they would have held a large banquet to celebrate. However, Master Lin just came back to Shanghai and started selling his scallion pancakes again. It seemed too casual.</p><br/><p>At that moment, in a certain neighbourhood.</p><br/><p>A little girl with double ponytails who looked around twelve or thirteen years old was writing something down on her notebook. With a closer look, it appeared to be a diary.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a little brother. I don\u2019t want a little brother. Little Brother will steal half of Daddy and Mommy\u2019s love for me. They won\u2019t care about me anymore. They won\u2019t love me anymore. I hate Little Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao was a primary school student. Her life had been happy and cheerful, but suddenly, something changed.</p><br/><p>Her Mom and Dad actually wanted to raise a little brother for her. However, her heart resisted it.</p><br/><p>Then, she took out her phone that had been given to her by her family. She opened QQ and wanted to tell her friends about her unhappiness.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, she saw that someone had invited her into a group.</p><br/><p>And this group\u2019s name drew her attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnion Against the Second Child\u201d</p><br/><p>She had been bothered by this matter for a while. Now that she saw this group\u2019s name, it instantly drew in her confused and unknowing heart. She felt as if she had found a team.</p><br/><p>Then, she accepted the invitation.</p><br/><p>Once she entered, messages came from the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome! Our group has gotten bigger again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep it up! Our goal is to stop the second child from taking everything away from us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want brothers or sisters. You\u2019re now one of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw this, Li Xiao Xiao suddenly felt as if she had found like-minded people. Then, she started chatting in the group and talking about her background.</p><br/><p>The group admin sent a message.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Li Xiao Xiao, right? We here are strongly against second children. Hence, we\u2019ll help you. But it depends on whether you will accept our method of help,\u201d said the admin, the anti-second child captain.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao: \u201cI don\u2019t want a little brother. As long as Mommy doesn\u2019t give birth to a little brother, I\u2019ll do whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anti-second child captain: \u201cRight. Since they have you, they shouldn\u2019t have another child. They didn\u2019t even get your agreement. That\u2019s why we have to retaliate against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao: \u201c????\u201d</p><br/><p>Anti-second child captain: \u201cAll of the members here are like you. When something like this happens in the Union, we immediately find someone of the opposite sex to make a baby with you so that your mother becomes a grandmother. This is how we counter her behavior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anti-second child captain: \u201cWe will be finding someone in this group of the opposite sex that\u2019s suitable for you. Trust us. If you really want to counter their behavior, you have to trust us.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying a lot, Li Xiao Xiao finally agreed.</p><br/><p>At this moment, in a certain apartment, a few men and women were working. Their work only required several computers.</p><br/><p>One of them, a thirty year old woman, was very excited. She had succeeded.</p><br/><p>Then, she opened another group and sent a message.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have a new good: Thirteen year old, primary school student, Shanghainese. Priced at $5000. If interested, send the money. We will arrange it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this woman sent the message, this silent group suddenly became lively.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m reserving it!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ding dong</em></p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s phone rang. The money had reached her. Then, she exchanged contact numbers with the person. After that, she placed all her attention on Li Xiao Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. What a dumba*s. If I can\u2019t even bluff you, I wouldn\u2019t be able to bluff anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman laughed as if there was nothing wrong with what she was doing. She felt that this money was too easily earned.</p><br/><p>She was making use of a primary school kid\u2019s rebellious attitude and childish behavior to earn money.</p><br/><p>Nighttime. At 5 PM.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stretched his body. It was getting late. He could go back now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back. You guys should go home earlier too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he started his car and drove towards home.</p><br/><p>Making scallion pancakes every day felt pretty good. It felt much more comfortable than researching medications.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of a small shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped his car and went to buy a bottle of water. When he came out, he saw a little girl pass by in front of him.</p><br/><p>When he looked at her, he didn\u2019t see anything peculiar at first. However, he felt like her expression was a little unnatural, so he kept looking.</p><br/><p>He was suddenly taken aback.</p><br/><p>Then, he didn\u2019t say anything. He put his hands in his pockets and followed behind the girl.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

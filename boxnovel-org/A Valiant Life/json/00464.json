It\u2019s been more than half an hour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe he\u2019s wandering outside. It\u2019s hard for him to always be staying in the ward. However, Elder Wang\u2019s kids are too unfilial. They\u2019ve never visited him since the first day he\u2019s been here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPitiful\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were chatting happily in the ward. It was a kind of affinity for them to be together in the same ward. Their relationship with one another was good.</p><br/><p>Then, a voice came from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang is back. He\u2019s even humming a song. Looks like he\u2019s in a good mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be cheerful when you\u2019re sick. If your mood isn\u2019t good, it wouldn\u2019t be beneficial to your health.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu entered the ward and greeted the other patients. The crowd didn\u2019t ask him about how it went. They didn\u2019t even have to think about it. His illness was definitely incurable. If it was cured. It\u2019d be a miracle. They didn\u2019t want to ask him about it so that he wouldn\u2019t feel hurt.</p><br/><p>He went to his ward and packed his things. He was ecstatic.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang, what are you doing?\u201d The other patients asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu smiled, \u201cPacking my stuff to go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned, \u201cAre you giving up on your treatment? Elder Wang, don\u2019t give up so easily. If your illness is not cured, you can\u2019t live for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu went to a middle-aged man and grabbed his hand. Then, he said sternly, \u201cThank you so much. If not for you, my illness wouldn\u2019t have been cured. However, I\u2019ll be here often to see you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned by Wang Xi Zhu. They didn\u2019t understand what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu smiled, \u201cThere\u2019s a free treatment booth outside the hospital, right? I went to try and he is indeed a godly doctor. I feel so good after it\u2019s been cured. He said that I just have to continue eating my medicine and the root of the illness will be resolved. I think you guys should go and have a try. Perhaps you can be cured of your illnesses too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was stunned. \u201cElder Wang, are you okay? How is that possible? Go and get a check. You can\u2019t be conned by this man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu waved his hand, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for a check. I know my own body well enough. Let me show you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Xi Zhu started jumping happily. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not even panting from jumping up and down. I\u2019m not coughing at all. You know, the godly doctor\u2019s medical skills are superb. You should go and have a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were stunned when they saw him jumping. They felt that it was impossible. How could he be treated within such a short time?</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu was almost done with packing. \u201cAlright, I will be leaving now. Really, you guys should have a try. Perhaps you\u2019d be cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t say anything at all and the middle-aged man looked especially stunned. It was as if he had seen a ghost. He was the one who suggested Elder Wang give it a try but he didn\u2019t expect Elder Wang to recover.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t know if Elder Wang was really cured. His expression looked a lot better than before.</p><br/><p>After Elder Wang left the ward, the remaining patients looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it really be true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Shall we go have a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat works too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s true, that means we won\u2019t have to stay here anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu was preparing the documents to leave the hospital. At the same time, he cleared his hospital bills. He used his retirement funds as he didn\u2019t want to wait for his children anymore. Anyway, he had recovered and he was feeling exceptionally happy.</p><br/><p>The nurse said, \u201cGrandpa Wang, you haven\u2019t recovered. Why are you leaving now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu smiled, \u201cWho said so? I\u2019ve already recovered. I\u2019ve been in this hospital for so long and I was still the same. The free booth outside the entrance only took half an hour and I\u2019ve been cured. Furthermore, it was free. I\u2019ve spent almost all my life savings on the hospital bills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurse looked at Grandpa Wang and didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cGrandpa, you can\u2019t be conned. Your condition is pretty serious. How could you be treated in such a short time? I suggest you stay in the hospital. Don\u2019t give up yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurses knew that Grandpa Wang\u2019s children weren\u2019t very good. They\u2019ve been delaying the payment. However, Grandpa Wang paid them off on his own. At the same time, he requested to be discharged. They felt that he was giving up on treatment.</p><br/><p>Although they weren\u2019t related to Grandpa Wang, they\u2019ve seen a lot of patients that gave up on their treatments in the hospital even though their situations weren\u2019t entirely hopeless.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu waved his hand, \u201cYou guys won\u2019t understand if I told you. I\u2019m really healthy now. Alright, quickly settle the paperwork for me. I want to leave here ASAP. I\u2019m sorry to have owed the hospital bills. At the same time, I\u2019m grateful to the nurses for taking care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurse looked at Grandpa Wang and sighed helplessly. She could only process the paperwork for him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the hospital.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the others were patiently waiting.</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd hadn\u2019t left yet. They were completely stunned by what they had just seen.</p><br/><p>They felt that it had to be extremely painful to be pierced by so many acupuncture needles.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d The townsfolk asked.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie replied, \u201cWe\u2019re from Shanghai. We\u2019re here to do voluntary medical work. There are no fees involved. As long as we can treat you, we\u2019ll attend to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Tong Tong and Qiu Jie were a little emotional. Although they didn\u2019t understand the condition of the previous old man, he had been coughing seriously. It didn\u2019t seem like a minor condition. However, he recovered almost instantly after Teacher Lin treated him. He actually stopped coughing and his face looked more vibrant. It was totally unexpected.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Ming Qing understood everything except one thing. That is, he knew about the individual functions of the acupuncture points but they produced a different effect when they were treated together. Why was that so?</p><br/><p>He looked at the prescription.</p><br/><p>His mentor didn\u2019t hide anything and he seemed like he wasn\u2019t bothered by it.</p><br/><p>There were several different medications and some were completely random. It was very different from what his mentor had given him for his condition.</p><br/><p>There was too much that he didn\u2019t understand. He wanted to ask him about it after returning back.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Zhao Ming Qing was ecstatic. Chinese medicine had to be practiced and the key was to master the combinations of multiple Chinese medications. The human body wouldn\u2019t deviate too much from its core. Once he could understand the core of the human body, he would be able to resolve a lot of problems easily.</p><br/><p>( )</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at the entrance of the hospital.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, please take note. This time, there will be more people here. Get ready to record it down,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing and the others heard it, they turned to the right and got stunned. There were a few patients in their hospital gowns that were walking over. Some of them even needed to be helped over. They looked like they were suffering from serious conditions.</p></div>\n</div>"}

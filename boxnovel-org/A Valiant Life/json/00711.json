What about the police? Why hasn\u2019t the police brought him away for questioning, unless Ying Jing hadn\u2019t reported him to the police?</p><br/><p>This was completely illogical.</p><br/><p>However, after thinking about it, Lin Fan finally got it. Although the slap he gave yesterday was vicious, he had used special means. This meant that even though it hurt, it wouldn\u2019t leave any marks. So, even if the police inspected the wound, there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem.</p><br/><p>There would probably only just have a little investigation, and Lin Fan would probably have to pay a fine of five hundred dollars maximum.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Many celebrities were shocked, but at the same time, no one dared to speak up.</p><br/><p>If it was the old Master Lin, the other celebrities would have displayed their loyalty and stood on Ying Jing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>However, it was different today. Master Lin\u2019s reputation had climbed significantly, and he wasn\u2019t someone that anyone could just trifle with.</p><br/><p>Besides, the loyalty of Master Lin\u2019s fans was simply too overwhelming, it was almost scary. Just not too long ago, with regards to the incident of the three flying doors, Wu Huan Yue had almost lost her life. but who would have known, after Master Lin admitted he was among those who hit Mosaic, this whole contention immediately took a drastic turnaround.</p><br/><p>This made all the celebrities who took note of this incident, dumbfounded, and at the same time bear deep jealousy.</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t they have such a strong fan-base?</p><br/><p>It was at this moment, Ying Jing posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo seek justice is human nature. I demand an explanation regarding the case that happened last night as it has caused a huge impact on my well-being. I had been invited to take part in the singing competition held by Shanghai Satellite TV network, yet because of this case, I cannot do so. At this critical juncture, I have suffered much personal loss. Therefore, I want and will defend my personal rights. @Master Lin @Shanghai Satellite TV network.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens immediately started to flame Ying Jing after seeing her post on Weibo.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because the netizens didn\u2019t have any compassion. It was just because the person was Ying Jing, and they didn\u2019t have any compassion for her. It didn\u2019t matter who was in the right; all that mattered was that scolding Ying Jing was the right thing to do.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Lin Fan\u2019s repeated slapping of Ying Jing had allowed many people to take revenge on her vicariously.</p><br/><p>Who knew? Maybe there were some more junior celebrities who were secretly laughing at this whole incident.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan responded after seeing the post on Weibo</p><br/><p>\u201cB*tch, I\u2019m going to say what I have to say right here. I don\u2019t care where you are, be it Earth or Mars; if you dare to touch Wu Huan Yue again in the future, I will beat you to death. It doesn\u2019t matter if you believe what I say or not, you just need to bear in mind what I have said here today. @Ying Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing Lin Fan\u2019s post on Weibo, netizens reacted vigorously.</p><br/><p>Especially the girls who had made Lin Fan their idol.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo aggressive, so manly. I envy Wu Huan Yue for being so protected by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jing this b*tch might just be about to faint from anger. She has yet again been embarrassed by Master Lin without hesitation and no apology was given.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fans of Master Lin are indeed right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you should still be careful. This scheming witch definitely still wants to defraud you, which means the blame might be on you. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou up there, you think our Master Lin is that dumb? Compensation? He won\u2019t give a single cent. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Shanghai Satellite TV network demand for Master Lin to compensate them, I won\u2019t ever watch their crappy programs again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue\u2019s Weibo was trending.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy idol, what kind of relationship are you in with Master Lin, just before, Master Lin openly said he will protect you. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue, you are my female goddess and I can\u2019t bear to see you being tied down with any man, but if the man is Master Lin, you have my blessings. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou above me, are you living in a dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Huan Yue is also very unrelenting, that one slap on the face was done beautifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>After reading what Lin Fan wrote online, Wu Huan Yue felt a sense of warmth in her heart and it was beyond words. She would have never thought Lin Fan would have said such a sweet thing on the internet- the feeling of being protected by someone felt great.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue couldn\u2019t help but blush, as she gripped onto her toy doll tightly, as she drifted off into her own thoughts and imagination.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Satellite TV network broke their silence.</p><br/><p>Those who read what Shanghai Satellite TV network sent out reeled back in shock.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Satellite TV network, \u201cIt is still a month away from our TV program airing, the teachers involved are still in the process of being selected. The list hasn\u2019t been finalized yet. Hence, there hasn\u2019t been any loss for anyone yet. With regards to Ying Jing\u2019s case, Shanghai Satellite TV network expresses our apologies. On a different note, Master Lin\u2019s musical compositions have garnered respect in the music scene and we very much hope to able to work with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, another blow to the face. In all these years, Shanghai Satellite TV network finally did a good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, I\u2019m not going to watch any other program except the ones on Shanghai Satellite TV network.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jing, your father asks you if your face hurts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, Shanghai Satellite TV network is inviting Master Lin to be one of the teachers on the show? If Master Lin becomes a teacher, I must watch this show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s music composition skills are amazing. Master Lin is definitely a better pick compared to Ying Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSupporting Master Lin as a teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>At some other place.</p><br/><p>When Ying Jing read the news on Weibo, she was infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be? How can Shanghai Satellite TV network do such a thing? They can\u2019t just do this, I must get to the bottom of this,\u201d Ying Jing blurted out. She couldn\u2019t believe such a thing was happening; how could Shanghai Satellite TV network say such things?</p><br/><p>Her manager was dumbfounded after reading the news on Weibo. How was this possible? Although they hadn\u2019t signed any contract yet, the list was more or less already finalized. How could they do a last minute change?</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>ng Jin whipped out her phone and called Shanghai Satellite TV network. She wanted to get to the bottom of the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of that post?\u201d Ying Jing asked furiously, not holding back a single bit of her rage.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the harsh tone over the phone, the vice-president of the broadcasting network knitted his brows, feeling a little unpleased. He replied, \u201cYing Jing, what else could it be? We haven\u2019t signed any contract yet, of course, things aren\u2019t finalized yet. We can\u2019t have you on the show now that this has happened. We are very sorry. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry? Then why did you immediately invite that Lin guy to be a teacher? This is just a direct insult to my face, is it not?\u201d Ying Jing questioned.</p><br/><p>Assistant manager, \u201cWe\u2019re really sorry, but the upper management has already decided. It was not my decision to pull you out of this show. If there is nothing else, I have to get back to work. Also, if opportunity arises, we hope to be able to work with you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWork together, my ass.\u201d Ying Jing screamed into the phone as she hung up. She was so ticked off to the point that her body started to tremble. She never thought that Shanghai Satellite TV network would stab her in the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, since when have I, Ying Jing, been humiliated so badly? I am still not done yet!\u201d Ying Jing\u2019s heart was filled with anger, she could not just let this incident go.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at Shanghai Satellite TV network, the assistant manager knitted his brows, \u201cWhat in the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yet, based on his own capabilities and status, he definitely couldn\u2019t stand up against Ying Jing, because she has people backing her up. However, it didn\u2019t matter at this point.</p><br/><p>Did she dare to go against Shanghai Satellite TV network?</p><br/><p>Only if she had balls of steel.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Looking at Weibo, Lin Fan never would have imagined Shanghai Satellite TV network would make peace with him. It was a pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>Inviting him to be a teacher.</p><br/><p>Hands to his chin, Lin Fan deliberated- it wasn\u2019t a bad idea.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, he still had one more important task to do- send out another post on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cTeacher Ying Jing, I am deeply apologetic about slapping you a few dozen times yesterday. As a token of my apology, please send me your bank account details. I will transfer you five hundred dollars so that you can use the money for your medical expenses. Hopefully, the next time we meet, you are still you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pffft!</p><br/><p>All the netizens who read Lin Fan\u2019s post were stupefied.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this a little too cocky?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

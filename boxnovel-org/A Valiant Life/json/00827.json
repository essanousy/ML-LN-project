He had been roaming around this area for such a long time and had never been humiliated so badly by anyone before.</p><br/><p>He did not care who he was. As long as he was in his midst, he absolutely had to embarrass the guy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan very helplessly said, \u201cGodfather Liu, don\u2019t get so excited. Oh yes, I forgot to wish you a happy New Year. Although it is the New Year, the two of us are still counted as having been acquainted right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m doing well. So what do you want?\u201d Godfather Liu\u2019s tone was very cold. Although he was normally very calm and relaxed when dealing with things, he found it hard to control himself while dealing with this fella.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not think that Godfather Liu had such a big resentment towards him. He felt a little hurt inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me ask, how has Teacher Ying been doing recently? Has she participated in any more variety shows? I want to watch them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been doing well and doesn\u2019t need your concern. Now tell me what you want. Regarding that issue, I\u2019m not doing to argue with you about it. However, you better not push your luck,\u201d Godfather Liu said. He was fuming inside. He really wanted to just slice Lin Fan up into many pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. As long as Teacher Ying is doing well then I won\u2019t have to worry so much. After all, we were just getting to know each other. I felt very helpless and could not do anything when she became like that,\u201d Lin Fan sighed and said.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was at a loss now. He did not know why this b*stard called him and what he wanted. But inside, there was something telling him that it was definitely not something good.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking rubbish. Just tell me what you want,\u201d Godfather Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, since Godfather Liu isn\u2019t very keen on talking, then I shall be more direct. Godfather Liu, you have been meddling with my friend\u2019s logistics company since last year. Can you give me some face and just leave it alone? Don\u2019t let things blow up. It won\u2019t do either of us any good,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The other side of the line was momentarily silent. Then, the sound of a huge and arrogant laughter erupted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like last year, I said the same thing to you, asking you to give me some face. Did you give it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a very honest reply, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t. However, that doesn\u2019t matter. That was me not giving you any face at all. How about if you give me some face this time around, I\u2019ll return it to you next time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that you\u2019re living in a dream world. Let me tell you this, it\u2019s not going to happen. You shouldn\u2019t care so much about things that don\u2019t involve you. I, Godfather Liu, am not someone who is good to provoke.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter!*</p><br/><p>He immediately hung the phone up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his eyebrows and then forced a smile and said, \u201cAs you guys can see, this b*stard is very stubborn. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give him another call.\u201d</p><br/><p>The phone call went through.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle b*stard, don\u2019t push your luck,\u201d Godfather Liu was furious. He felt like this b*stard was trying to taking a sh*t on him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rushed to say, \u201cD*mn, Godfather Liu, why are you being so irritable? If there are any issues, we can talk it out. Give me some face and then the next time, I\u2019ll give you a big one back, how about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost, you sh*t. Let me tell you, don\u2019t even think about this anymore and you better not call me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pa!*</p><br/><p>He hung the phone up again.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan found it very hard to accept.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang felt a little awkward and said, \u201cMy brother how about you stop calling him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. This b*stard is just that low. I\u2019m going to call him again.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Northeast.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was fuming. He felt like this brat did not have any shame at all.</p><br/><p>Regarding that issue, he was still very angry about it. However, he had no choice. He had already come to peace with it and did not think about it anymore.</p><br/><p>However, he did not think that this brat would actually dare to call him again. It was like he did not want to live anymore.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu looked at the Caller ID and was so angry that he almost smashed his phone. However, he controlled himself and then answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you already, don\u2019t call me again. Did you not understand me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you this one chance. If you come right in front of me and say it, I\u2019ll give you face this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan was planning to have a nice talk with Godfather Liu. However, he never thought that this guy would actually be so willing to give him face. He was momentarily very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, this is really too good. Okay, I\u2019ll go to the Northeast to meet you, Godfather Liu,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Good, come over. My place here is very welcoming to you and I guarantee that it will leave a very deep impression on you,\u201d Godfather Liu sneered. He had already thought about it. If he did not show this b*stard his face, then he was afraid that Lin Fan would think that he was easy to bully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Godfather Liu. I f*cked your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle b*stard, what did you say?\u201d Godfather Liu was furious again. He had been roaming around this land for so long and had never thought that he would be this easily angered.</p><br/><p>However, this time, it was different. He was really offended by this b*stard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI f*cked your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu replied, \u201cI f*cked your mother, you b*stard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t scold other people. We\u2019ll be seeing each other soon. I\u2019ll be sure to bring you a gift for our first meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu replied, \u201cA gift for our first meeting? Forget it. Your presence is the best gift that I can get.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, thanks, Godfather Liu. Hearing that really puts me at ease,\u201d Lin Fan said. He felt like this Godfather Liu really had a way with words.</p><br/><p>Hearing those words really made him feel like Godfather Lin had a way with words. Your presence is the best gift that I can get.\u2019 that really made Lin Fan feel very touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Godfather Liu sneered and then hung the phone up.</p><br/><p>He did not want to say anything else at this moment.</p><br/><p>He did not care whether this brat dared to come or not. If he dared to come, he would definitely leave a lasting impression on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan put the phone down, everyone in the room all stared at Lin Fan in shock and with their mouths wide open.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said, \u201cMaster Lin, this situation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not really understand it. What did these few phone calls mean?</p><br/><p>Did they have a good or bad relationship?</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng said, with worry in his voice, \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t go. It\u2019s a very dangerous place and Godfather Liu is not to be messed with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cMy brother, don\u2019t scare us. I was panic-stricken after listening to your phone calls. Over there is the Northeast, not Shanghai. If anything happens, I really can\u2019t help you at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to worry about? It\u2019s nothing. Furthermore, do you guys really think that I\u2019m alone? I have a countless number of righteous followers there in the Northeast. What is there to be afraid of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng anxiously said, \u201cMaster Lin, I think we should just forget about it. I\u2019ll slowly think of a way out of this problem. You don\u2019t have to go and find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cElder Chen, this thing isn\u2019t about you. I have some history with Godfather Liu. In the past, I didn\u2019t go over because I didn\u2019t see the need to. However, after today\u2019s calls, I must go. I mean, he has already been so courteous in inviting me. If I don\u2019t go, then I won\u2019t be giving him face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, relax Elder Chen. Your problem won\u2019t be one for much longer. You don\u2019t have to worry at all,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>However, the thing that made Lin Fan a little disappointed was that Godfather Liu did not save his number.</p><br/><p>After all, he had already called him in the past and argued with him.</p><br/><p><em>I saved your number and you didn\u2019t save mine. This is definitely not giving me any face at all.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

He wasn't cursing Zuo Teng Fei. he was cursing that idiotic celebrity. Earlier on, he had scolded Lin Fan so fiercely and now he wanted to produce a song with him. Did he think that Lin Fan was someone who wouldn't bear grudges?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \"What is it? Why are you so pi*sed?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up Elder Dog Nicholas, who was lying on the floor, and embraced him. He said, \"People nowadays are really shameless. They're even more shameless than my Elder Dog. Right, Elder Dog?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas' eyes widened as he barked. His meaning was clear: 'Isn't that obvious?'</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was holding his phone as he said, \"Brother Lin, the fans can't wait any longer. They've been shaken by your talent. They want to have a few words with you right now, are you free?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took over the phone and said, \"My dear brothers, I'm the legendary godly composer, Master Lin. I understand that you all want to see me, so I'm fulfilling your request. Remember my following words. In the future, if you have any books, movies or other useful things that you don't want, please do not throw them away. Please mail them to Shanghai Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.\"</p><br/><p>\"666...I can relax now that I've seen Master Lin but what does that last part mean? What's going on with this Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute?\"</p><br/><p>\"You all must not have seen the news. But news about charity isn't too popular and not many people noticed. Let me tell you then. Master Lin has taken over the Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute and has entered the charity industry.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, that's awesome. Master Lin is my idol!\"</p><br/><p>\"Everyone has a part to play in supporting charities but nowadays, there's too much bad news about charity organizations causing people to be apprehensive. But if Master Lin is in charge, then I don't have to worry. I will definitely support him!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the netizens watching the broadcast. After speaking nonsense for a while, he handed the phone back to Zhao Zhong Yang and he added, \"You have to donate the money you earn from this to the orphanage. Don't be greedy.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang chuckled. \"You're underestimating me. I'm the boss of the broadcasting world, I won't even have a shred of greed.\"</p><br/><p>Broadcast management.</p><br/><p>\"From now on, we won't deduct anything from the broadcaster, Brother Yang's, earnings. We have to support Master Lin's charity business.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn! F*cking awesome! This platform is f*cking awesome!\"</p><br/><p>\"This platform is very kind. We have to support it.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this, he smiled. \"Thank you, XX platform.\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on the Internet, Autumn Sword Fish Killer was heeding his boss's orders. He had started ordering his trolls to begin announcing all over the Internet.</p><br/><p>He felt that his boss's actions were very shameless. How could someone be so shameless, to boast and brag about himself? It was hard to watch. However, he had no choice. He had to depend on Lin Fan and could only do as he had been told.</p><br/><p>However, Autumn Sword Fish Killer's sense of justice could not be extinguished. Although on the surface, he seemed to be doing his job, he would sneakily add a message.</p><br/><p>\"How shameless. Bragging about himself.\"</p><br/><p>This message, among the tens of thousands of other messages, could not attract the attention of others but after expressing his discontentment, Autumn Sword Fish Killer could carry on with his work.</p><br/><p>*Ding!*</p><br/><p>A message came.</p><br/><p>\"You didn't do your work properly. $100 deducted.\"</p><br/><p>When Autumn Sword Fish Killer saw this message, he was dumbfounded. F*ck, this doesn't make sense. How did that guy know that I wasn't doing my job properly? Could it be that I'm being watched?</p><br/><p>Faraway, at Cloud Street, Lin Fan was well aware of Autumn Sword Fish Killer's every move. This guy had to be properly suppressed. When he saw Autumn Sword Fish Killer's message, he immediately knew that this fatty would try to play tricks. With just a simple feint, he had exposed Autumn Sword Fish Killer. With that low IQ of his, he was trying to play tricks on Lin Fan. That was simply asking for death.</p><br/><p>Taihe Music Company.</p><br/><p>A group of people was having a meeting.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue's second album had shocked everyone there. They didn't dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>*footsteps*</p><br/><p>The footsteps of someone wearing high heels could be heard coming from outside. Then, a lady, accompanied by a member of staff, entered the conference room.</p><br/><p>If there had been fans there, they surely would have cried out in surprise. It was the popular music empress, Cai Ya Ting, who had once been a household name in China. As of then, she was thirty-something but amidst her mature beauty, there laid a powerful presence. The moment she sat down, the staff member removed the coat that was draped over her back.</p><br/><p>Although she still seemed to have a strong presence, her fame hadn't been as great as it had been in her earlier years, mainly because she couldn't get any good songs. On top of that, she had no representative work of her own. Although there was a song from ten years ago that was a classic, too much time had already passed without her releasing another classic. Hence, her status had dropped significantly in the musical world.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Cai, we've done some discussion and we feel that it's best if you don't rush to release your new single. Recently, the musical scene hasn't been too stable.\"</p><br/><p>Cai Ya Ting looked at the song producer and said, \"You're talking about that new singer, Wu Huan Yue?\"</p><br/><p>\"Right. That new singer is drawing too much limelight and she even has a very powerful composer behind her. All ten of the songs he composed have entered the overall charts. Even the tenth-ranked song has twice the number of downloads as the eleventh on the chart. She's too strong. She's simply too strong.\"</p><br/><p>Cai Ya Ting asked, \"How long must we wait?\"</p><br/><p>\"We don't know about that. Perhaps a month?\" said the producer.</p><br/><p>One of the leaders of the company said, \"What do you all think about inviting that Master Lin over to compose a song for Ya Ting?\"</p><br/><p>Cai Ya Ting nodded as well. \"I, too, really wish we could invite the rumored godly Master Lin to create a song for me.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone looked at each other. \"We haven't tried to do that yet. We don't know if it will work.\"</p><br/><p>\"Actually, that Master Lin is in Shanghai and he runs a shop along Cloud Street. Perhaps we could go visit him. Regardless of whether he agrees or not, it shouldn't be a problem to just get to know him.\"</p><br/><p>\"That makes sense.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lying inside the shop when he saw a group of people in front of him. His expression was slightly dignified.</p><br/><p>\"What do you want?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>A plump fatty smiled and said, \"Greetings, Master Lin. I'm from Everyday Records. I'm here today with a request. I'm hoping that Master Lin could develop a song for our company's artist.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"That's a big wish. A song isn't something so easy to get.\"</p><br/><p>The fatty laughed. \"Don't worry, Master Lin. Whatever request you have, just make it and we can negotiate.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \"What's the name of your artist?\"</p><br/><p>The fatty didn't know the intention behind that question. He smiled and replied, \"Yuan Shan Er.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan unlocked his phone and did a search. Then, he displayed his phone in front of the fatty's face and said, \"Look, what does it say here?\"</p><br/><p>The fatty took a look and his face instantly changed. He saw a comment on Weibo from a long time ago:</p><br/><p>'Who is that Master Lin? He's just a clown. Sister Ying, your little sister supports you. Just ignore people like him.'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said grudgingly, \"You saw that? How am I supposed to work with you after your artist scolded me like that? How big must my heart be for me to fulfill your request? Forget it, you should go back. I can't accept this.\"</p><br/><p>The fatty hadn't expected things to turn out this way. He felt helpless and angry at the same time. What the heck did that Yuan Shan Er do that for? F*ck!</p><br/><p>\"I'm very sorry, Master Lin. I'll come back next time and give you a satisfactory answer.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners saw the situation in Lin Fan's shop and started discussing quietly among themselves.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, what's going on with Master Lin? A lot of people are here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, don't you guys know? They're all here to request for Little Boss to write songs for them. Just what kind of brain does Little Boss have? How is he so smart?\"</p><br/><p>\"If you ask me, who am I supposed to ask?\"</p><br/><p>\"Amazing\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

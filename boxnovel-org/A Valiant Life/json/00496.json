At first, he just felt curious but when he saw that old man, his heart started thumping furiously.</p><br/><p>He was the person in charge of WeChat\u2019s operations. It seemed very impressive and in other people\u2019s eyes, he was a successful man. However, in front of this old man, he wasn\u2019t even worth sh*t.</p><br/><p>At that moment, thoughts raced through Zhang Long\u2019s mind. Could it be that WeChat recently published news that wasn\u2019t right and was over-critical of this old man? Could they have angered this major figure and so he called him here to kill him off?</p><br/><p>D*mn. Zhang Long had always told those news editors not to write nonsense. And not to add in personal opinions. Now that something had happened, Zhang Long was the one that had to bear the consequences. If he got out of here alive, he had to settle matters with these editors.</p><br/><p>Zheng Hai Feng patted Zhang Long on the shoulder. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong but we do have a major issue that is related to you.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long trembled in fear. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong but there was a major issue related to him?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I\u2019m just a communications software guy. How could I be related to anything in the military?\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>When he had entered the house, he already noticed that all those security guards had guns with them. Then, he said hastily, \u201cSir, I admit my mistake. Some of the news published by WeChat definitely have exaggerated comments. When I go back, I\u2019ll definitely punish them. I promise. I swear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Chief Zhang?\u201d Zheng Hai Feng resisted the urge to laugh. He shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to put you on a call with somebody. Then, you\u2019ll know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Zhang Long recovered from his daze, Zheng Hai Feng made the call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been waiting the whole time. When he heard the phone, he immediately answered the call delightedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve invited him over. You have something to say to him, right? I\u2019m passing the phone to him now.\u201d Zheng Hai Feng passed the phone to Zhang Long.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long looked at Zheng Hai Feng fearfully. Then, he took the phone and said weakly, \u201cHello\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Through the call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fab said with a smile, \u201cSorry for disturbing you, Chief Zhang. I\u2019m Master Lin from Shanghai. It was a little absurd for Elder Zheng call you here but I want to talk to you about something. Hello\u2026are you listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long immediately nodded, \u201cYes, yes, Master Lin. Please speak. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mind was in a mess. He had no idea who this Master Lin was but for him to have connections with this old man\u2019s family, he must be a significant individual. Zhang Long didn\u2019t dare to be lax.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued, \u201cThis is what\u2019s going on. I took over a children\u2019s welfare institute in Shanghai and recently, we\u2019ve been wanting to start lessons for the children but we\u2019re short of money. I don\u2019t want to bother the government either and I want to rely on ourselves. Hence, I want to borrow your platform to auction off the children\u2019s artworks. Of course, I don\u2019t know much about the process involved. I was thinking if you had the time, maybe you could send some people over to discuss with us. Of course, if you don\u2019t have the time, I can personally go over to meet you all and discuss the overall operation plans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long had been overly nervous the whole time. When Lin Fan said all these, he etched each and every word into his memory.</p><br/><p>But business was business. To become the person-in-charge of WeChat operations, Zhang Long\u2019s thinking had to be exceptional. He instantly understood what Lin Fan wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve understood everything that you\u2019ve said. When I go back, I\u2019ll send people over to discuss it with you. No, I will go personally to discuss with you. Don\u2019t worry about this. I will put in all my effort into accomplishing it,\u201d said Zhang Long.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThank you very much then, Chief Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to thank me.\u201d Zhang Long finally let out a breath of relief. He had initially been scared to death. He really thought that he had committed some kind of grave mistake.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan took over the phone and said, \u201cElder Lin, when are you coming to Beijing? I miss you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two of them chatted, Zhang Long\u2019s guts trembled and his heart was filled with astonishment.</p><br/><p>This old man actually addressed that Master Lin as Elder Lin. How close must the two of them be?</p><br/><p>Zheng Hai Feng said, \u201cChief Zhang, I\u2019ll get someone to send you back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long had been under a lot of stress while he was here. He didn\u2019t dare to relax one bit. He had remembered everything that had been said on the call and he was going to book an air ticket immediately after he went back.</p><br/><p>It was possible for him to leave this matter to his subordinates but he couldn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t trust anyone besides himself. If he screwed it up, it would end tragically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can go back myself,\u201d said Zhang Long. He didn\u2019t dare to be sent home by someone else. It was better to just call a taxi back.</p><br/><p>Zheng Hai Feng chuckled. There were no cars passing by within miles of radius around this place. Without the appropriate identification, he could keep dreaming about leaving by himself.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Below the WeChat technological company building, Zhang Long got off the military car. Then, he stood at the same spot and remained in a daze for a long while.</p><br/><p>When he regained his senses, he immediately took out his phone and gave his boss a call.</p><br/><p>This matter was too important. If he didn\u2019t report it he wouldn\u2019t be at ease.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept his phone. His heart was filled with delight. This matter was finally taken care off. With WeChat\u2019s popularity, the effect would definitely be extraordinary.</p><br/><p>In the drawing room, the children were happily drawing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to Han Lu\u2019s side and said, \u201cLater on, collect the children\u2019s drawings. In the near future, we will be using them to earn the children\u2019s education fees.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Lu was taken aback. \u201cMaster Lin, is it possible to earn money from these?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t trust Master Lin but these artworks weren\u2019t exactly good-looking. They were scribbles of the children\u2019s strange imaginations. Sometimes, when he took a closer look, he would see some different things.</p><br/><p>This was because when one seriously looks at something, one\u2019s thoughts become proliferated, causing a change in one\u2019s vision.</p><br/><p>If he asked the children what they were drawing, there were times that even they couldn\u2019t tell him an exact answer.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou have to believe in them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>The godly back-scrubbing skill\u2019s first signs of divine powers made Lin Fan a little interested. Becoming the famous Master Lin would be simple.</p><br/><p>He could scrub them into submission. He could scrub them into admiration.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he thought that knowledge sub-classes have tasks that are easier to complete. They weren\u2019t very difficult at all.</p><br/><p>In the bathhouse.</p><br/><p>The back-scrubbing workers weren\u2019t too busy at the moment. Today\u2019s business wasn\u2019t as good as yesterday\u2019s. They gathered next to Lin Fan. \u201cLittle Boss. Your back-scrubbing technique is pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cOf course it is. If you want to learn from me, I can teach you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>While completing the task, he couldn\u2019t forget to earn some Encyclopedic Points. Although he had quite a number of Encyclopedic Points now, there\u2019s no way he would grow tired of them.</p><br/><p>These three back-scrubbing workers were all Elder Zeng\u2019s employees. Although they didn\u2019t have the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost, they could still learn the techniques.</p><br/><p>When there was no one around, Lin Fan started teaching them the techniques as well as how to make the back-scrubbing more comfortable. Also, the service duration and service skills were important as well.</p><br/><p>If he was going to do it, he had to do it the right way.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan received a call from Zhang Long. Lin Fan was a little shocked. He had never expected WeChat\u2019s person-in-charge to come personally. But when he thought of Elder Zheng\u2019s status, his shock was dispelled.</p></div>\n</div>"}

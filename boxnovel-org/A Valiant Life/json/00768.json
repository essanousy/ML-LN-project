Furthermore, he didn\u2019t give him any face.</p><br/><p>As one of the Internet flame war starters, he had to do something about it.</p><br/><p>He researched about Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The Vice-President of the Martial Arts Association.</p><br/><p>He immediately ignored that. He felt that he couldn\u2019t have beaten him to death.</p><br/><p>Member of the Chinese Arts Association.</p><br/><p>He worried even less about that. It was just drawing. It was a stup*d skill to have and it was useless.</p><br/><p>After researching, he confirmed that Lin Fan wasn\u2019t as rich as him and Huang Hao immediately started flaming him.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t expect to be flamed by his own supporters after he posted it on Weibo. It was as if nobody had supported him.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was playing with Weibo and when he saw the Weibo post, he was in disbelief. He took a look at it and verified that it was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, some wealthy youngster is flaming you on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was curious, \u201cWhy is he flaming me? I don\u2019t think I messed with any wealthy youngsters recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Huang Guo Hui\u2019s son. He is really arrogant on Weibo. He flames anyone that he dislikes. He probably did it after finding out what had happened here,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened Weibo and saw the post. He wasn\u2019t really interested in reading it. \u201cIt\u2019s his mouth anyway. Let him scold me then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Lin Fan and realized that Brother Lin somehow became wiser. He was different from the past.</p><br/><p>If he was the same Lin Fan, he would\u2019ve started flaming the other party to death. However, he didn\u2019t care about it this time.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn\u2019t believe that this fella would change. \u201cWhat is it? This doesn\u2019t seem like your usual style.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that there are many kind netizens flaming him for me? Do they still need me to do so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the comments on Huang Hao\u2019s Weibo and realized that a few thousand hateful messages were being posted. It was terrifying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was more concerned with the Weibo news about his new song.</p><br/><p>His seventeenth page of knowledge should be completed soon.</p><br/><p>On several international charts, two of his songs were in the top few places. They were climbing to the top rapidly. They literally jumped a few places in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He finally heard what he wanted to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cTask of convincing the public is complete, Encyclopedic Points +20.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the eighteenth page of knowledge. As it is the eighteenth page of knowledge task, it will be unlocking a relevant knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking xianxia [immortality heroics], a minor class of animal training knowledge. This includes the Encyclopedia\u2019s Mystical Boost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: Train Elder Dog Nicholas to become a majestic rural dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask Reward: Encyclopedic Points +20. The chances of the nineteenth page of knowledge unlocking a major class of knowledge would be increased to 60%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNote: As it is a minor class of knowledge, there is no need to involve previous knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrent Encyclopedic Points: 5000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. What was going on? He was really ecstatic.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect to receive another xianxia minor class of knowledge again after the past experience with the Little Intelligence Pills. Although it didn\u2019t seem to be very useful, \u2018xianxia\u2019 was really incredible.</p><br/><p>At that instant.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas, who was lying on the floor raised his head and looked at Lin Fan. He felt a different aura.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog Nicholas and Elder Dog Nicholas lowered his head.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why but he felt a little anxious, especially after seeing that fella\u2019s smile. He felt that something bad was about to happen. It was as if he was being watched.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog?\u201d Lin Fan shouted. The smile on his face became wider. He was prepared to conquer the Elder Dog in one night.</p><br/><p>*bark*</p><br/><p>Elder Dog felt that the way Lin Fan was looking at him wasn\u2019t friendly. As the king of the dogs of Cloud Street, he had to protect his dignity and status. He immediately showed a defensive and stern expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He felt happy with what he got for the eighteenth page of knowledge.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of new knowledge in his head and he had the Encyclopedia\u2019s Mystical Boost.</p><br/><p>Every time he had a Mystical Boost, he would become incredibly godly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan and felt that he was laughing so cunningly. He thought that something must have happened. Every time this fella smiled that way, something bad would happen.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao was furious. He had been flamed by the netizens for an entire day and he was in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>It would be impossible for him to delete his Weibo account. Even if he was getting flamed, he had to persevere and finish the other fella first.</p><br/><p>In Beijing.</p><br/><p>In two different luxurious villas, two youngsters were chatting on WeChat.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hao Hao said, \u201cHuang Hao is so stupid. He actually dared to flame Master Lin of Cloud Street. Doesn\u2019t he know how powerful Master Lin is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Liang Cong replied, \u201cHaha, this id*ot just returned from overseas. He wanted to join the Weibo groups and flourish like us. He should have taken a look at himself first. It\u2019s humiliating to be compared to him by the netizens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Hao Hao replied, \u201cHey, I feel like something is wrong. Why isn\u2019t Master Lin doing anything to Huang Hao? According to what I know, Master Lin isn\u2019t such a kind man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Liang Cong replied, \u201cHe\u2019s just a useless troublemaker. Perhaps Master Lin doesn\u2019t even give a d*mn about him. Oh, right, did you hear any news recently? Is Godfather Liu of the Northeast going to do anything to Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Hao Hao replied, \u201cMy *ss. According to what I know, the Godfather Liu has been warned. I think it was because Master Lin has a good relationship with some notable leader. I don\u2019t know the details but I guess that should tell the story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incredible,\u201d Shen Liang Cong gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s that incredible. Alright, let\u2019s not talk about that. Recently, I\u2019ve been preparing to film a movie and I would like to contact Master Lin to build a good relationship,\u201d Jiang Hao Hao said.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang Cong replied, \u201cD*mn, did you use my Chinese dragon costumes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost, they\u2019re so ugly. If they were to appear in my movie, everyone would be frightened. Alright, I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Hao Hao was the son of the richest man in China and Shen Liang Cong was the son of one of the top ten biggest entrepreneurs. Although they were really arrogant online, they still had some brains.</p><br/><p>When they saw Huang Hao flaming Master Lin, they knew that Huang Hao was an id*ot.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin didn\u2019t have any legitimate status, he couldn\u2019t have been an ordinary figure after surviving so many trials.</p><br/><p>The most recent one being the Ma Qing Zhou incident.</p><br/><p>If people had a conflict with Ma Qing Zhou, they definitely wouldn\u2019t dare to go over to Qingzhou. After all, they\u2019d be beaten up even if the person was the son of the richest man in China.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin went there alone and finished Ma Qing Zhou. Wasn\u2019t that impressive?</p><br/><p>Anyway, they didn\u2019t really care about what others thought of it.</p><br/><p>They were really impressed by what he did.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It seemed that after so many interactions, the Shanghai reporters loved Lin Fan and they believed in him too. They believed that all other people were spreading was just hype and they couldn\u2019t trust it.</p><br/><p>But what Lin Fan didn\u2019t know was that the Shanghai reporters were actually afraid of him. In the past, they would always report the news whenever something came up but now, they had already been slapped in the face a few times.</p><br/><p>Some of these reporters only trusted Master Lin now. Before Master Lin personally admitted to something, they would never publish it.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just lying there. The matter involving the welfare institute had been resolved for now. The rest would be up to Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, he received a message on his phone. When he picked it up to take a look, he realized it was from that person responsible for his Internet relations, the Internet troll Autumn Sword Fish Killer, who hadn\u2019t contacted him in a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The message only contained three words. But Lin Fan wanted to reply: \u201cF*ck off!\u201d</p><br/><p>He just ignored it and placed his phone to the side. He didn\u2019t want to bother about this kind of person that didn\u2019t do their work well.</p><br/><p>In a certain house.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was holding his phone, waiting for Master Lin\u2019s reply. But it was as if he had thrown a stone into the sea and it sunk without a single trace. Not a single bubble was seen.</p><br/><p>Looking at the broadcast room, although it wasn\u2019t broadcasting, the pitch black screen had comments all over it.</p><br/><p>In this recent period, he had really expanded. After each broadcasting session, he would go to the restaurant and feast like a king. The wines that he would drink were all high-class wines that cost several hundred dollars.</p><br/><p>After all, in the broadcasting world, he was known as one of the top gamers.</p><br/><p>Every time he broadcasted, he would receive many gifts.</p><br/><p>But something outrageous had happened. He had duo-queued with a big shot. That big shot seemed to have f*cking awesome skills but Autumn Sword Fish Killer could tell with one look that he was a hacker.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the big shot got reported by someone and a big fuss was made out of it. Later on, he tried to suck up to the big shot by stating publicly that the big shot did not hack but was actually just really skilled.</p><br/><p>But not long after, the big shot admitted to hacking. And because Autumn Sword Fish Killer had made that statement, he became targeted as well and people revealed that he had actually been hacking too.</p><br/><p>Looking at the comments.</p><br/><p>\u201cHacking dog. F*ck off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still say that you didn\u2019t hack. If you didn\u2019t hack, I would eat your big c*ck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer pulled open his pants to take a look. <em>I\u2019m not that big.</em></p><br/><p>But regardless, Autumn Sword Fish Killer was screwed. He couldn\u2019t carry on with his broadcasting business.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, why isn\u2019t he replying my message? D*mn it. I have to call him.\u201d Autumn Sword Fish Killer steadied himself and decided to make the call.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin fan\u2019s phone rang. When he saw the phone display, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Then, he answered, \u201cAh, isn\u2019t this the rumored pro gamer Autumn Sword? What is it? Are you promoting some kind of hack to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d A pitiful voice came from the other end of the call. It was as if he was extremely regretful. \u201cMy dear boss, can you give me one more chance? I promise with all of my pride, if I don\u2019t work properly, I will clear my clogged up toilet using my tongue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t be disgusting. Weren\u2019t you doing very well? It\u2019s just hacking, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s there to be afraid of. Just scold them back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer said, \u201cBoss, don\u2019t say that. I\u2019ve thought about it by myself and I feel that my talents should still be invested into the Internet. With my abilities, I can split heaven and Earth apart and eliminate all enemies for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was amused. \u201cNo need. Do you know that hundreds of people respond to my every command now? I have even more Internet trolls than you used to have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer started to panic. \u201cBoss, you can\u2019t do this to me. I know a secret. I know who\u2019s been specially trying to tarnish your reputation recently. I am willing to charge into the danger for you, Boss. I\u2019ll bring this group down into oblivion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lin Fan was a little curious. It was clear that someone had been purposely trying to tarnish his reputation. And they were exceptionally ferocious. Now that he heard Autumn Sword Fish Killer say that, he felt that there definitely was a specialized group trying to tarnish his reputation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so? Tell me then,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \u201cThen, Boss, you have to promise me that you\u2019ll continue employing me. Let me be your number one Internet troll. I guarantee and I swear that I will never lose my way again. I will only be loyal to you, Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. <em>This 300-pound fatty is actually negotiating with me.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you one more chance to perform. I\u2019ll continue to hire you but if you dare to run away again, be careful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished, Autumn Sword Fish Killer immediately nodded his head frantically and replied, \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t. Boss, trust me. I am a trustworthy person.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Trustworthy? Trustworthy my a*s!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cQuick. Tell me who is trying to attack me,\u201d Lin Fan said curiously. I\u2019ve never angered anyone. And I\u2019m so righteous and kindhearted too. Have these people\u2019s brains short-circuited? They actually formed a group just to tarnish my reputation. It doesn\u2019t make sense at all.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \u201cYesterday, I was invited to a group by someone. I realized that the people in the group all hated you. There were people from every industry. There were people who sold medicine as well as people who sold children. And one of them, you won\u2019t believe who she is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Autumn Sword Fish Killer said that, Lin Fan was completely stunned.</p><br/><p><em>Ying Jin?</em></p><br/><p>This name seemed rather distant to Lin Fan. If he didn\u2019t think hard enough, he wouldn\u2019t even remember. As for those pharmacists or whatever, Lin Fan would never admit to having something against them. After all, they had never even met before but he had suddenly become hated by those people. It really made him helpless.</p><br/><p>As for those human-traffickers, he knew that just taking down one of them would implicate a whole group. Being hated by those people was very normal.</p><br/><p>If he came across them, he wouldn\u2019t mind giving them a good beating and then sending them to prison.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \u201cBoss, don\u2019t worry. Since I\u2019m on your side, I will definitely get rid of all of them for you. I\u2019ve already secretly infiltrated their highest level. Using my intelligence and my plentiful experience, I\u2019ll blend in with them and within a short period of time, I\u2019ll become the leader of their group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInvading the enemy\u2019s inner circle? Not bad. Do your job well. I believe you. If you help me to settle this, I\u2019ll give you 500 dollars as a reward.\u201d Lin Fan thought about it and felt that it was better to clear this matter up. Otherwise, these guys would continue to tarnish his reputation. He had had enough.</p><br/><p>As for these 500 dollars, it was to motivate Autumn Sword Fish Killer. After all, this guy was quite easily satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry, Boss. I definitely won\u2019t let you down. I shan\u2019t disturb you any further, Boss. Be well, Boss. See you next time, Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer hung up and let out a deep breath.</p><br/><p>Sitting in front of the screen, looking at the comments, his heart ached.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, if I knew, I wouldn\u2019t have hacked. Now, my reputation has been ruined. That despicable big shot actually said that I was the one who influenced him to hack. How shameless. Wait until my Internet trolls assemble. The first thing I\u2019ll do is ruin your reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>He rubbed his tummy.</p><br/><p>Thinking about how he had a job again, he was feeling cheery. He decided to go out to reward himself with a feast.</p><br/><p>After all, he had slimmed down recently. He had lost a total of 1.5kg.</p></div>\n</div>"}

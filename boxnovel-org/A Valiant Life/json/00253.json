Just give me a beating.\"</p><br/><p>The family members were crying, \"No matter how much it is, we're willing to spend it on you. How could we bear to hit you?\"</p><br/><p>The old man wanted to sit up but his body didn't even allow him to perform such a simple action. He said, \"If you won't hit me, then let me give you a laugh.\"</p><br/><p>The illness-plagued, skin-and-bones old man mustered up all his energy for a short laughter. His whole face of wrinkles scrunched up together, like a bright chrysanthemum flower.</p><br/><p>As the family members looked at the old man, with their eyes red and puffy, they started laughing as well.</p><br/><p>The old man said, \"That's more like it. If you're all laughing, then I can be at ease. I asked my wife yesterday 'How do I make our kids happy?' and she told me that if I just smiled, you would all be happy.\"</p><br/><p>The family members couldn't stop their tears from flowing. That wife that the old man was talking about had already passed away three years ago.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his mouth and said, \"If she could talk, that is what she would say.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De didn't say a word, but just silently nodded.</p><br/><p>In the lobby.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came forward and patted Xu De on the shoulder. \"You gotta stay strong, kid.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De didn't know who Fraud Tian was, but still, he nodded and thanked him.</p><br/><p>Someone of Fraud Tian's age calling Xu De 'Kid' was normal.</p><br/><p>The few of them say down.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the child in Xu De's embrace. \"The child is very handsome. The purple cloud comes from the East. Xu Dong('Dong' is Chinese for East), that's a very good name.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De was slightly astonished but when he thought of Master Lin's reputation, he was at ease.</p><br/><p>\"His name was given by his grandfather.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. He realized that Xu De's expression, although still gloomy, had at least gotten slightly better.</p><br/><p>\"You've spent quite some money on medical bills, am I right?\"</p><br/><p>Xu De nodded and replied, \"Sold my house, borrowed whatever I could from my relatives and friends but in the end, I still couldn't save her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Xu De on the shoulder. \"At least you tried all you could. You won't have any regrets in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De took over the cigarette that Fraud Tian had passed to him and took a puff. Then, he said, \"Master Lin, what do you say I should do from now on? I feel like my whole life is over at this point. If it was just me, it would be fine but I still have Dong Dong.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn't interrupt. He left this matter in Lin Fan's hands. He trusted Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stroked Dong Dong's face, then looked up at Xu De. \"Since it's come to this, let me tell it to you straight. Dong Dong currently has two fates. Two futures. You want to know what those are?\"</p><br/><p>Xu De was stunned. \"You can see the future?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Do you want to know?\"</p><br/><p>Xu De remained silent for a while.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>\"The first fate is to become a beggar, to become what people call the 'scum of society'. He will spend his life crossing paths with the police numerous times and then spend his most smooth-sailing days in a prison cell,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When he heard this, Xu De stared with his eyes wide open at Lin Fan as if he couldn't believe it. His mouth twitched slightly, wanting to say something but not knowing what to say. It was as if there was something stuck in his throat.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan carried on, \"The second fate is to become a contributor to society, an educated man that becomes successful. He could become a scientist, a wealthy man, an inventor, a professor\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Xu De looked at Lin Fan, then his expression became gloomy again. \"Master Lin, thank you for encouraging me. I know you are all good people but you don't know about me. I really have nowhere to go. I owe too much money. Even if I work the rest of my life, with no sleep and no rest, I won't be able to earn that much money back.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Xu De, then let out a thin smile, \"Xu De. Male. Born in 1981. Previously, he has\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Xu De, who initially just looked blankly at Lin Fan, now stared at him in disbelief. He suddenly realized that this person in front of him knew him so well. Could he have researched about him before?</p><br/><p>But very quickly, the thought faded away because it wasn't possible. He was just a normal person, a person living from day to day. He wasn't worth researching about.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \"Do you believe me now?\"</p><br/><p>Xu De said in a hoarse voice, \"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang, who was standing by the side, was astonished. He had known that Master Lin was incredible, but he hadn't known he was this incredible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at Xu Dong and said, \"Look, right now, he has two fates. I have two suggestions for you. Your choice will affect his future. Do you want to hear them?\"</p><br/><p>This time, Xu De did not hesitate. He nodded immediately.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"First, I can help you to repay all your debts. You won't owe anyone a single cent but he will spend his life doing nothing, become the so-called 'scum of society'. He will waste his life away, waiting to die. He will live a lonely life, then die on the streets at sixty.\"</p><br/><p>When Xu De heard the first part, his eyes had glimmered with hope but when he heard the later part, his eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\"The second choice. You lift yourself up. Suffer for twenty years, after which, your debts will be repaid fully. As for him, he will be a sensible boy from young. He will be hardworking and talented. He will become a useful person in society and live a fulfilling life. And you will also enjoy love and joy from him and his family, all the way until you die a blissful death.\"</p><br/><p>\"Now, you can choose. To enjoy a period of peace with no debts or to suffer for twenty years, then have a blissful ending. Of course, fates are ever changing and there are other choices you could make. But of course, of these two choices, one of them is good and the other one is bad. Think about it,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The fortune-telling ability was indeed amazing but seeing tens of years into the future, though not difficult for Lin Fan, it was not completely accurate. Because, within this period, every choice would affect his fate. Because of this, it really didn't matter the choice he made.</p><br/><p>If one could really see through someone's entire life, that wouldn't be fortune-telling anymore. Only a real god could do that.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian, who had been quiet the entire time, was stunned by Lin Fan. He really wanted to ask whether it was true. Still, based on the current situation, he remained quiet. He planned to ask Lin Fan once they left the place.</p><br/><p>\"Twenty years\u2026\" Xu De's mouth gaped open. He looked down at his son and said without hesitation, \"I choose the second option. I will suffer for twenty years in exchange for a life of joy and prosperity for my child. It will all be worth it. If his mother knew about this, she would be rejoicing.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, then asked solemnly, \"Do you believe me?\"</p><br/><p>Xu De looked at Lin Fan and nodded. \"I believe you.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan smiled, then he stood up. \"If you believe it, you will have. If you don't believe it, you won't have it. A person only needs to decide once. Twenty years can be said to be long but it can also be said to be short. It can pass in the blink of an eye. Spend some time with your wife. I will be here to visit you again soon.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De stood up and looked at Lin Fan. \"Master Lin, I really believe in you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"To believe in me is to believe in yourself. It's also to believe in the future of the one in your embrace.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the elevator.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \"What you said just now, is it true? Is his future really going to turn out that way?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang was waiting in anticipation too. He wanted to know as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"It can't be confirmed. If it was for sure, it wouldn't be effective. It will only turn out well if he believes it. Otherwise, all will be lost.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh!\" Fraud Tian was astonished. That was the same as not saying anything at all. It was just like he used to do, conning people with fortune-telling. Just that this time, it was a higher level scam.</p><br/><p>However, Fraud Tian believed that the future would really turn out that way.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his bank card. \"Here, take twenty thousand. It will be deducted from your pay.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah, why is it deducted from my pay?\" Fraud Tian was in a much better mood, but when he thought of the money being deducted from his pay, his heart ached.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Fraud Tian, \"I'm letting you know that it's not easy to be a good person. If you want to be a good person, you need to pay a price. But I'll give you a 'like' on this matter. After the shop is renovated, I'll give you a pay raise.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled. \"That's more like it. It would be too heartless of you to bully an old man like me who's about to enter his Autumn years.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

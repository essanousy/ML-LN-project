Now, those things have been exposed. The reporters are recording it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB*stards. F*cking b*stards.\u201d Godfather Liu\u2019s face was green with rage. In this situation, he couldn\u2019t think too much. If he allowed this to develop further, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well. Those things are yours, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, I\u2026\u201d When the person on the other end of the call heard that, he was dumbfounded. And at the same time, he was very afraid.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll cover you. But if anything is to happen to me, none of you will escape. I\u2019ll also prepare ten million for you. If you do this for me, I guarantee that you will have no worries for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man became silent when he heard this. He had already accepted his fate. Even if he didn\u2019t agree, what could he possibly do?</p><br/><p>If Godfather Liu was to go after him, he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape.</p><br/><p>Moreover, if he accepted responsibility, he would gain a number of benefits. It would be worth it.</p><br/><p>However, he had never expected that there was something even scarier that was going to happen.</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu\u2019s face looked so malevolent that it was terrifying. At the same time, there was a bit of fear in his heart. However, he was still holding on to his last bit of hope. He would not just sit and wait. He quickly took out his phone and made a few calls.</p><br/><p>At the scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles. This situation had gone according to his expectations. Then, he turned to the comrades from the Food Safety Department. \u201cThis kind of matter is very severe. You have to handle it strictly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The comrades from the Food Safety Department looked at each other, then quickly contacted their unit, telling them to send people over. If these things were to be distributed outside, there would be nasty repercussions.</p><br/><p>And the most important part was that there were so many reporters around. Even if they wanted to resolve this quietly, it wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in charge here?\u201d asked the old policeman sternly.</p><br/><p>That manager who had been knocked down by Elder Dog previously had been struggling in his heart. In the end, he accepted Godfather Liu\u2019s conditions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m in charge,\u201d said the manager. He immediately took the blame for the incident.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at this manager. He had not expected this person to take the blame.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this Godfather Liu was very quick at doing things. He had already found a scapegoat so quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan naturally knew that something like this would not be able to cause Godfather Liu trouble. However, it could cause Godfather Liu to be embarrassed.</p><br/><p>The battalion had not arrived yet. The old policeman said, \u201cWhere are all these from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager looked calm. It seemed that he had already been prepared. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until my lawyer comes before I say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters kept on taking photos of the manager. No matter what the situation was, they would just record it first.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Dog dashed over.</p><br/><p>When the manager saw this dog, his expression suddenly changed. It seemed that he had some psychological scar. When he had come into contact with this mutt previously, he realized that this dog\u2019s strength was shocking. He had gotten pinned to the ground by the dog.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Elder Dog\u2019s head. \u201cNot bad, not bad at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t mind the number of Encyclopedic Points he had used to feed and raise Elder Dog anymore. They had had their uses.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Dog started barking at those meat products.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw Elder Dog do this, he was puzzled as he wondered what had happened.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he saw Elder Dog start charging into the middle of those meats. He searched around for very long. Then, he bit onto a piece of meat and opened it up with his front paws.</p><br/><p>A packet of white substance fell out. It was very eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the white substance and instantly fell silent.</p><br/><p>A fine, powdered substance, stored in little packets.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went forward and grabbed the packet. He took a close look. Then, he looked at that old policeman. \u201cMy police comrade, these look like drugs, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, their eyes widened.</p><br/><p><em>Drugs?</em></p><br/><p><em>There were drugs hidden in these meats?</em></p><br/><p>This news was going to explode.</p><br/><p>When the old policeman heard this, he immediately went forward and grabbed the packet. Due to his experience, he could confirm that those were definitely drugs.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was still searching in the pile of meats. It seemed that not every piece of meat contained these. They were all dispersed.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog picked out another piece of meat. Then, he opened it up and it was yet another packet of white powder.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they\u2019re trafficking drugs!\u201d A reporter cried out in astonishment, seemingly in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is big news!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes were drawn in.</p><br/><p>That reporter\u2019s face had turned white. His sweat was dripping profusely. He had not expected that there would be drugs.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu had not told him about this.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his throat moved a little. He seemed very nervous and very frightened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the manager. \u201cYou better think carefully. This situation is now much more severe than before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager pretended to be calm when he heard Lin Fan\u2019s words. However, his body trembled for a moment. It was clear that he was afraid now.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the police battalion arrived.</p><br/><p>When the leader was informed that there were drugs hidden in the meats, he instantly took the matter seriously.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t as simple as selling poor quality meat anymore.</p><br/><p>Then, they started to cordon off the scene. The reporters were chased out.</p><br/><p>But how could the reporters leave so easily? They stayed outside and continued to take pictures and videos.</p><br/><p>They had already taken photos of the drugs in the meat previously.</p><br/><p>This matter was already substantiated but what they wanted to know now was who was behind this. How could they have hidden so many illegal items?</p><br/><p>And Lin Fan was surrounded by reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what do you think about this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the face of the reporter\u2019s question, Lin Fan was a little dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say in this situation. It was simply an unexpected joy.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had just wanted to use this incident to send Godfather Liu little \u2018gifts\u2019. But he had not expected that Elder Dog would do a great service and dig out another matter.</p><br/><p>This was a little unfathomable.</p><br/><p>The reporters looked at Lin Fan, clearly in anticipation. They felt that Master Lin was really a mysterious man. He had actually managed to discover such a huge matter.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan could swear to god that it wasn\u2019t intentional.</p><br/><p>He had no idea that it would turn out like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d He cleared his throat, then said, \u201cDear reporter comrades, about this incident, I feel furious. Lawbreakers nowadays are really too lawless. This logistics company must be looked further into, especially the person-in-charge of this company. I heard that it\u2019s Godfather Liu and that he\u2019s a very lawless guy in the Northeast. I also heard that his hand covers the sky in the Northeast. He owns many offices and nightclubs here. I have a brave guess that these things are probably directly related to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we should pay close attention to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since it was already like this, Lin Fan decided to criticize Godfather Liu a little.</p><br/><p>The reporters looked at Lin Fan, recording his words.</p><br/><p>However, they felt helpless in their hearts.</p><br/><p>This Master Lin had indeed come to the Northeast to go against Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>They had to give in to Master Lin.</p></div>\n</div>"}

They had seen this before as they admitted that Lin Fan was the only person that could insult Ying Jing and get away with it.</p><br/><p>If it were them, they would have been screwed over long ago.</p><br/><p>Of course, for a few of the celebrities, it was entertainment for them. Ying Jing had a shining reputation in the entertainment circle. However, a few celebrities had been scolded by Ying Jing before. Although they felt injustice, they could only swallow their anger against Ying Jing.</p><br/><p>With Master Lin\u2019s entrance into the scene with his merciless mouth and daring actions, they were content to see that Ying Jing had finally gotten what she deserved through Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If it was long ago, the celebrities who were on Ying Jing\u2019s side would have relentlessly defended her. However, they didn\u2019t bother about it now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s works and reputation had left a huge impact on them, and some of them had very much wanted to meet Master Lin in the future. In order to keep on his good side and avoid being flamed by him, those celebrities decided to stay silent and watch from the benches.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was one of the four teachers who was invited for the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 competition hosted by Shanghai Satellite TV Network, and it was the first time that the other three teachers had met Master Lin.</p><br/><p>This competition was a live broadcast and so in the duration of the competition, there wouldn\u2019t be any filter even if anything happened during the competition.</p><br/><p>However, the Shanghai Satellite TV Network had faith in the abilities of the teachers that they had invited. With their skills, there naturally wouldn\u2019t be any problems. As for the competitors, if anything really happened, it would become the highlight of the show.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Satellite TV Network.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had arrived early. He lived in Shanghai and all it was only a ten-minute drive to reach the destination.</p><br/><p>As he approached the information counter of the headquarters of the TV Network, the receptionist immediately recognized him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m a huge fan. Could I get an autograph?\u201d the young lady working at the counter asked warmly, taking out a pen and a notebook, her face full of expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, no problem,\u201d Lin Fan said, as he reached out his hands, signing his name boldly and hugely on the paper. \u201cRight, have the other teachers arrived yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet, you\u2019re the earliest,\u201d the receptionist replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll go up first,\u201d Lin Fan waved her goodbye as he walked into the lift which brought him to the top floor.</p><br/><p>President Liu and the Vice-president of the network had already been waiting in the meeting room as Lin Fan walked in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please take a seat,\u201d the vice-president said, his face full of smiles. He was extremely excited about the program which had cost a lot to produce.</p><br/><p>They had spent a lot of money investing in the advertisement of the show in order for it to receive a wider audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, vice-president,\u201d Lin Fan replied, smiling.</p><br/><p>President Liu was sitting down, his face beaming with delight. \u201cMaster Lin, ever since we announced the teachers for this show, your degree of popularity has shot up a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much really. It\u2019s only small-scaled, really not worth mentioning,\u201d Lin Fan said, humbly waving that thought away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s by no means small scaled. Master Lin, your rise to fame is something that I have never seen before,\u201d President Liu said.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan\u2019s rise to fame, the people in the circle had analyzed and discussed it before.</p><br/><p>The final verdict was that it was unique and unreproducible.</p><br/><p>Unless one was like Master Lin who was a man of many talents, it was almost impossible to do what he did to rise to fame.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, one of the workers walked into the meeting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cSirs, the three teachers have arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, the other teachers have arrived. I\u2019ll just leave you guys to warm up to each other so that you guys won\u2019t be strangers on the stage,\u201d President Liu said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cAlright. These three teachers are extremely famous and I would love to get to know them. Next time, I can brag about meeting them.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Liu chuckled, not taking his comment seriously. From his point of view, Master Lin himself was capital. If other celebrities had his abilities, they probably would be over their heads. They probably wouldn\u2019t even remember their names.</p><br/><p>Although their interaction was short, President Liu could tell that Master Lin was someone that was easy to get along with- he was well-tempered and wasn\u2019t arrogant.</p><br/><p>At that moment, two guys and a girl walked into the meeting room.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang had a tall figure and his hair was silver from age. He had been in the music scene for over twenty years and had a whole collection of classics under his belt.</p><br/><p>The other male wore clothes that were modern, although he was already forty years old. He had the title of \u2018King of Pop\u2019 in the music circle, although he hadn\u2019t been too active and lively the past few years. However, he wasn\u2019t to be taken lightly.</p><br/><p>The last person was a beautiful lady. Although age had left its scars on her face, it was undeniable that she was a beauty in her prime.</p><br/><p>Looking at the three of them, President Liu smiled, \u201cWelcome. I\u2019ll introduce him to you. This man here is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the three teachers, his face beaming with joy, \u201cHow do you do? I hope that we can work happily together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang shook Lin Fan\u2019s hands, looking excited. \u201cI never imagined that you would be this young. I have personally seen the ten pieces of art that you have created which now hang in the National Museum. I was completely in awe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan never thought that Huo Jian Xiang would be that friendly. \u201cTeacher Huo\u2019s songs have accompanied me while I was growing up, especially that song \u2018Mountains and Rivers\u2019. It is still my absolute favorite song till this day. I am a fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d Huo Jian Xiang chuckled.</p><br/><p>If they gave him face, Lin Fan would not be stingy with his praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Liu, how do you do?\u201d Lin Fan warmly greeted him. He was elated from being surrounded by so many huge celebrities.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Liu Ying Dong\u2019s expression was calm and composed, not showing any excitement. He gave Lin Fan a simple handshake and retreated backward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think the situation was awkward. He glanced at him again- it looked like Liu Ying Dong had something to say about him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had never insulted him before, and so there was only one other possibility, and that was that Liu Ying Dong was good friends with Ying Jing.</p><br/><p>The music circle was small and Ying Jing had been inside for a long time. Similarly for Liu Ying Dong, and so the chances of both of them knowing each other well was quite high.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t care too much about that. As long as Liu Ying Dong didn\u2019t actively insult him or get in his way, it was fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you are indeed very young. I am good friends with Sister Ying, but I\u2019m not sure what misunderstanding you have with her,\u201d Zhao Li said voluntarily.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan could tell from her eyes that she looked down on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, I think you got it wrong. I have nothing against Ying Jing,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why does Master Lin direct so much hatred towards her?\u201d Zhao Li asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. We have no misunderstanding between each other. However, there is an enmity between us. I\u2019ve said before that if she treated other people disrespectfully again, I would spare no expense at shaming her.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that both Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li both had a very close relationship with Ying Jing. It was hard to tell if both of them already disliked him.</p><br/><p>President Liu realized that there was something wrong with the atmosphere in the meeting room. Thereafter, he initiated, \u201cSince the four teachers are already here, we can start the briefing for the program later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

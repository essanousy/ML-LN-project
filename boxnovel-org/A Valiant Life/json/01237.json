She\u2019s the best in our country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, it\u2019s all because of Master Lin\u2019s amazing composition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Master Lin is too good. I\u2019m so impressed. How could he write something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think Wu Huan Yue will be the champion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say, but I think she stands a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were discussing it and trying to find the song online.</p><br/><p>They could not replay the livestream, which made them really anxious.</p><br/><p>They wanted to listen to the song again.</p><br/><p>At the performance venue.</p><br/><p>Some of the foreign singers started a discussion about Wu Huan Yue among themselves. They felt that she was a really good singer. Furthermore, she was singing amazing classics.</p><br/><p>That was something formidable.</p><br/><p>In the changing room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked towards Wu Huan Yue. \u201cThat was breathtaking. It was even better than yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue chuckled. \u201cBrother Lin, I think I did better than yesterday. I wonder what the result is going to be like. I\u2019m a little nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to worry about? It\u2019s amazing. Regardless of the results, what matters is that you did your best,\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Wu Huan Yue nodded. Now that she had some hope, she wanted to do even better and earn a better result.</p><br/><p>The results were released.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had done it.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Can did not manage to make it to the next round. It was because there were simply too many amazing candidates to choose from. Everyone had done their best on stage.</p><br/><p>Hence, she was eliminated.</p><br/><p>When she saw Director Zhang, he looked really displeased.</p><br/><p>He was there with only one wish: to defeat Master Lin. However, they had not expected Master Lin\u2019s compositions to be so good.</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya remained quiet. Only two of his songs had been used. The other songs could not be used at all. He felt embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he had even posted online before he had left for the States.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Jin Can did not say much either. However, she still smiled and greeted everyone. She did not seem to be as egoistic as before.</p><br/><p>The next day, news articles were posted online on different platforms, and many people were expressing their views on the competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue reached the final round.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Jin Can to be eliminated. She should be ashamed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so shameful about it? She has nothing to be ashamed of for being there on stage. She sang pretty well and deserves to be praised. However, Zheng Ya deserves all the hate. Look at what he posted on his Weibo post before he left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, who gave this idiot the courage to argue with Master Lin? He should know Master Lin\u2019s power by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya returned to the hotel and scrolled through Weibo on his phone. When he saw the comments, he was so angry that he almost smashed his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, how does it feel to be praising yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know you\u2019re going to delete your account. We\u2019re waiting for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re brave enough, reply to our comments. Why do you keep deleting them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese idiots.\u201d Zheng Ya was enraged. He had not expected so many people to be flaming him.</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately deleted the comments. After all, he had already lost. There was nothing he could do. He could only return back to China on an earlier flight and curse that Wu Huan Yue could not make it further.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>It was the final show and the day to determine the winner. Wu Huan Yue just sat there and rested.</p><br/><p>Yang Qian looked at Wu Huan Yue\u2019s calm expression and went to ask Lin Fan, \u201cMaster Lin, do you think Wu Huan Yue will win?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cWho knows? She will do her best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Qian was really nervous because the other singers were incredibly talented too.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to determine who was going to win.</p><br/><p>The hosts on stage announced, \u201cWe will determine the winner of the competition tonight. Among the five singers, who will be the champion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Abigail looked at the stage and said, \u201cI wonder what song the Chinese singer will be singing tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ralph hesitated for a moment. \u201cI think it will be even better than before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two other judges chuckled. \u201cWe did not expect a Chinese singer to be one of the five finalists. It\u2019s a rare occurrence.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was also cheering the candidates on.</p><br/><p>Some were even chanting Wu Huan Yue\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Abigail turned around and smiled. \u201cLook, Wu Huan Yue is clearly the crowd favourite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ralph replied, \u201cOf course. If I were in the crowd, I would support her too. I hope she can sing something different for us tonight. Among the other four singers, there\u2019s someone that I\u2019m close to, and I hope he wins it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the competition started. The first singer was a middle-aged man with long hair.</p><br/><p>Everyone recognised him, as he was a famous rock singer. He was a force to be reckoned with.</p><br/><p>The four judges cheered loudly for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the screen and smiled before saying, \u201cThis singer is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Qian replied, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s famous and incredibly good. I\u2019ve heard his songs before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like Huan Yue is the last contestant. Is that right?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wu Huan Yue replied as she opened her eyes. She was well-rested and really wanted to do well in the last round of the competition.</p><br/><p>Soon, the participants slowly made their way on stage. The atmosphere was at its peak. It did not seem like a competition at all. It seemed more like a concert now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, it\u2019s your turn,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stood up and nodded at Lin Fan before heading to the stage.</p><br/><p>The four judges were really looking forward to her performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally her turn. I\u2019m really looking forward to her song,\u201d Abigail said while smiling.</p><br/><p>The other judges wondered how Wu Huan Yue would perform.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Huan Yue appeared on stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really honored to be performing today,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said.</p><br/><p>The crowd applauded.</p><br/><p>The netizens watching the broadcast were really nervous. It was finally Wu Huan Yue\u2019s turn. The previous singers had performed extremely well.</p><br/><p>Hence, they were nervous because it was a competition among the best singers.</p><br/><p>At the venue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be performing \u2018Innocence\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>The song started to play.</p><br/><p>The four judges looked at each other.</p><br/><p>The style of the song had changed.</p><br/><p>It was different from before, which made them even more excited.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

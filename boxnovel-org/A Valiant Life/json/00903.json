I think there are about 100 people. However, I don\u2019t know how many of them are trolling us,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Please reply to them and get their personal information with the school that they are in. Get them to send it over. Also, get their salary expectations. Write everything clearly and organize the information. I will take a look at them.\u201d He hadn\u2019t expected this to be so popular with the people.</p><br/><p>Although he was not some superstar celebrity, he was pretty well known on the Internet. That gave him some extra points.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, it was all meaningless. The important thing was that the welfare benefits he provided had to be enough for them to make a living.</p><br/><p>Although it was a welfare organization, people couldn\u2019t be taken advantage of. If not, even if people were willing to stay there, they wouldn\u2019t be willing to stay there for life.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, sure.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang nodded and proceeded.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon!</p><br/><p>Beside the river.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had switched to a different location because he knew that people were going to look for him. He felt that there were only two possibilities.</p><br/><p>When the kid took out the medicinal pill, the others would guess that it was him. The second possibility was that they might come to the riverside to look for him.</p><br/><p>However, the first possibility was very likely.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Because the news about his medicinal pills had gone viral. If they were doctors, they would be able to guess it.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t afraid of it. He was prepared to deny everything and give some stupid reason to shake them off.</p><br/><p>Now that Zhao Ming Qing had retired, he wasn\u2019t busy at all. He had called Lin Fan today to initiate a fishing session.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan initially hadn\u2019t wanted to agree to it. After all, it would prevent him from using his ability fully. However, he felt that it was still okay since he was not in a rush. There were going to be a lot of opportunities for him to fish.</p><br/><p>The youngster and the old man sat there together.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, how do you feel? Do you feel relaxed after letting go of everything?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s relaxing. I feel as if I\u2019m a different person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. That way, you can improve your mood and become healthier,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the display on his phone and smiled. Then, he picked up the call, \u201cElder Zheng, why did you think of calling me?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was situated in Beijing and the main form of communication was via phone calls. He would call him a few times a month but not too often.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan laughed. \u201cElder Lin, why can\u2019t I call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you can. I\u2019m just curious. How\u2019s your health now? Still going strong, I suppose?\u201d Lin Fan asked. They usually spoke to each other about arts and literature. At the same time, they could get along with each other the best in the Chinese Arts Association. They usually just made small talk with the other members but there wasn\u2019t anyone else that they could really get along with.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing strong. I\u2019m going strong. With such a godly doctor like you, even if I were to fall sick, I wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, your tone suggests that something is wrong. Tell me what it is. With our relationship, there\u2019s no need to beat about the bush,\u201d Lin Fan said. He wouldn\u2019t reject Elder Zheng if he were to ask of a favor. After all, he had helped Lin Fan a lot too.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was listening attentively beside him. He knew that the person on the phone was definitely not an ordinary man. After all, he could tell that from the way they addressed each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn old friend of mine has been in poor health recently. I would like you to take a look at him,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that it had something to do with treating illnesses again. However, the fact that this man was friends with Elder Zheng meant that he wasn\u2019t an ordinary man too. Then, he asked, \u201cWho is the powerful man that made you ask for a favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled. \u201cMa Jun Guo. He used to be my teammate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Jun Guo?\u201d</p><br/><p>The name was quite unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was shocked, \u201cThe former Director of the nation\u2019s Health Department\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. Then, he asked, \u201cElder Zheng, was he from the Health Department?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. However, he has retired. He\u2019s the same as me now, just trying to be healthy. However, he doesn\u2019t really like Chinese Arts. He prefers Chinese chess,\u201d Elder Zheng said. He didn\u2019t know the relationship between Lin Fan and the Health Department. If he had known about it, things would probably have become complicated and he wouldn\u2019t have said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, did you read the news recently?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. He didn\u2019t know what Elder Lin meant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was against the Health Department and although they didn\u2019t flame each other, it didn\u2019t mean that they had forgiven one another.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, I can\u2019t help you with this. I really hate the people from the Health Department,\u201d Lin Fan said directly. He didn\u2019t want to hide anything from him. If this person hadn\u2019t been from the health department, Lin Fan would\u2019ve agreed to help.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan really treated him, then what would that mean?</p><br/><p>He had been bullied by them and now they wanted him to treat their illness? He couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. He asked curiously, \u201cNo, Elder Lin, listen to me. What\u2019s the situation? Why are you in conflict with the Health Department? Don\u2019t worry. Just tell me about it and I will resolve it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Actually, I was in a good mood. Now that you\u2019ve mentioned this, I feel annoyed again. I will hang up first. There are a lot of great doctors now. You can get your friend to choose someone else. Also, I am not an imperial physician.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan felt that the matter had become complicated and Elder Lin sounded agitated. \u201cElder Lin, don\u2019t be agitated. We can talk things over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not agitated. I\u2019m just unhappy. I\u2019ll be hanging up now. I\u2019m fishing.\u201d Lin Fan immediately hung up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little worried. \u201cTeacher, there won\u2019t be a problem, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. Let\u2019s fish.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hands.</p><br/><p>Beijing.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. He was confused about it. Then, he went to his study room to read the news.</p><br/><p>He did a search and everything was there for him to read.</p><br/><p>After reading everything, he finally understood the situation.</p><br/><p>He understood why Elder Lin hated the people from the Health Department. If it had been himself, he would hate them too.</p><br/><p>Then, he picked up his phone.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cElder Ma, let me ask you something. Did the current leader of the Health Department send you a gift?\u201d Elder Zheng asked directly.</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo was stunned. He replied, \u201cElder Zheng, what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan replied, \u201cWhat else? If you didn\u2019t receive a gift, why did you promote him to such a high position?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Elder Zheng, you can\u2019t accuse me.\u201d Ma Jun Guo was anxious. That was clearly an accusation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI looked for Elder Lin for you and when he heard that you\u2019re from the Health Department, he didn\u2019t even want to give me face. Go and read the news on the Internet and call me back. Tell me how you\u2019re going to resolve this. Even I am angry now after reading the news\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo was speechless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

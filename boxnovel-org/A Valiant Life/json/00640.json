He had thought that the biggest supporter of Ma Qing Zhou was that person called Cheng Nian Liang. However, after receiving the call, it was made apparent that there was someone far more sinister and at large.</p><br/><p>Who on earth was Cheng Nian Liang? He had already woken up one tiger, but behind the first tiger, there was a second. Something was off.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Ma Qing Zhou didn\u2019t know who the boss of his superior was? Maybe only Cheng Nian Liang knew.</p><br/><p>He wanted to make a call to Cheng Nian Liang, but that was an impossibility. Although he was Master Lin, there were people who hated him.</p><br/><p>Maybe the superior of Ma Qing Zhou decided to get rid of Ma Qing Zhou and decided to put his best patron in his place. That was a pretty big move.</p><br/><p>However, the number that called Lin Fan\u2019s phone was worth tracing. If he ever had the good fortune of meeting that brat, he would spare no expense in beating that guy up.</p><br/><p>Boarded the plane!</p><br/><p>Economy class.</p><br/><p>Last time when he traveled with Wang Ming Yang, he sat in a private jet and didn\u2019t need to fork out a single cent. Now that he was alone, he didn\u2019t bear to spend anything more than economy class after donating all his savings to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, I never thought I would be sitting on the same plane as Master Lin. Master Lin, can we have a picture together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you are just too amazing! You handled this case spectacularly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little flabbergasted. He never thought that he would meet people that would welcome him this warmly on the flight. As he walked to his seat, all he could do was shake the hands of everyone that greeted him.</p><br/><p>A few people on the flight didn\u2019t recognize who Lin Fan was, and was puzzled to why he was getting so many greetings from the other passengers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you guys so much for your love. The plane is about to take off,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan realized that some of the air stewardesses were batting their eyes at him. He turned away unable to bear it.</p><br/><p>However, it was good to have the air stewardesses around, as they controlled the passengers.</p><br/><p>A three-hour flight was good to catch some shut-eye. But for Lin Fan, it was almost impossible.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, there would be people approaching him to talk.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Airport.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked towards the arrival hall exit.</p><br/><p>From afar, he saw a familiar figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, brother! You really did it this time!\u201d Wang Ming Yang exclaimed. He had been waiting for Lin Fan for quite a while. After seeing him, he immediately rushed up and gave him a bear hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re safe. Next time, don\u2019t risk your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang on the shoulder. \u201cWhat risk is this? Is this called risking my life? I went there to bully people. Anyway, how are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed. \u201cGreat! Everything is going great! Ever since you helped me get rid of my bad air, I\u2019ve been feeling more comfortable than ever. However, I have to give you this one billion dollars. You risked your life to get it back for me, and me giving it to you is the least I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang, sighing, \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand me, do you? I take money like dirt. Why are you giving me your one billion dollars? Do you want me to live a befuddled existence? I\u2019ll tell you, there is no way I am going to do that. My heart is as solid as a rock, and I will not be swayed by money. But if you want to give me, I prefer if you donate the money elsewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, I can\u2019t talk using normal language with you, and I speak the truth. Forget it, I\u2019ll keep the money for you. If you ever lack money next time, just tell me,\u201d Wang Ming Yang was speechless. He was determined to understand his brother better, and he only had this brother who didn\u2019t care about money at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \u201cAlright, up to you. I don\u2019t really lack money. If I lack money, I\u2019ll just ask shamelessly, even if you safe keep the money for me or not. It is really troublesome to be friends with me, really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed. \u201cYou finally realized how shameless you are. I must say, you are so smart and yet you just found out that fact?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan jabbed Wang Ming Yang, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back to Cloud Street. Although I\u2019ve been gone a few days, I\u2019m already starting to miss the crew.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two began to walk off, their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that Ma Qing Zhou would be brought down by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is nothing. I even screwed over all his patrons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little serious. I never thought you would implicate the big tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat big tiger are you talking about? Behind this small little cub, there is an even bigger tiger. Just now before I boarded the plane, I received a call and the caller threatened me. I scolded him until he decided to turn off his phone. After I get back to Cloud Street, I\u2019m going to figure out who this brat is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan, shocked and befuddled. Thereafter, he patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSteady a little, don\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. The Big Tiger was just a prankster. Slowly, if he could trace the caller, he would slowly torment him with his words.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was shocked as he stepped into the entrance of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>He felt a little out of place after seeing the banner hung at the entrance of the street. \u201cEh, what\u2019s with this grand entrance? I\u2019m not used to this!\u201d Lin Fan said, acting humble.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan jokingly, \u201cDon\u2019t act like a pretentious prick, if you continue acting, I\u2019ll slap you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Lin Fan smiled. Thereafter, he shouted towards the whole of Cloud Street, \u201cEveryone, I\u2019m back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Cloud Street came to life.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Little Boss is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLight the firework! Quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crackle and rattle!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street started bustling with excitement as all the other shop owners gathered around Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you really did this one good this time. The people of Qing Zhou have been liberated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, I saw the news. I never thought that Qing Zhou would still have that kind of evil inside. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the pain the people have gone through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much, nothing much. What I did was very small,\u201d Lin Fan said, waving them away.</p><br/><p>The people were all amazed, but for Little Boss, this was just a small thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, the journalists are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists knew the news of Lin Fan\u2019s return. After doing something so huge in Qing Zhou, everyone knew about him.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou had cooperated with the police and gave himself up all because he listened to Master Lin\u2019s words. They were definitely curious what Master Lin had said to him to cause him to have such a change of heart.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Fan was surrounded by the journalists.</p><br/><p>Facing that question, he didn\u2019t know how to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything was because of love.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists were speechless.</p><br/><p>What kind of explanation was that?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

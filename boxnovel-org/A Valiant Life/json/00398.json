Just a little bit.\"</p><br/><p>\"I told you. If your art was good, it'd be horrifying,\" Zhao Zhong Yang said. He knew that Master Lin couldn't have known much about art. How could someone be so talented in so many aspects? It was impossible.</p><br/><p>The children waited quietly and Lin Fan asked, \"What do you want me to draw?\"</p><br/><p>Lil' Fatty who had gone through treatment was already healthy. He wiped his mucus from his nose and said, \"Ultraman.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ultraman doesn't look good. I want to see a tiger.\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to see mountains.\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to see the sea.\"</p><br/><p>The children started to discuss among themselves. They all requested what they wanted.</p><br/><p>The people in the broadcast room started laughing.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, it's hilarious. Master Lin is going to have a tough time. He's going to be embarrassed by the kids' requests.\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder what Master Lin will draw. I think he doesn't really know how to draw.\"</p><br/><p>\"I think so too. No matter what, I still think he's a good man. He's so caring and it's rare nowadays.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"Alright, alright, you guys are making too many requests. I can't satisfy all of you. I'll just draw what I want.\"</p><br/><p>He placed the tools on the table.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a pencil. \"Chinese arts have been around for a long time. It's experienced many different eras. There have been many famous artists. People drew humans, sceneries, flora, and fauna. Today, I am going to combine the three main themes and draw something nice, okay?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\" The children cheered.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 Master Lin must have done his homework. He's speaking so confidently.\"</p><br/><p>\"Combining three themes is going to look amazing. Let's just see what Master Lin is going to draw.\"</p><br/><p>\"I wonder what Master Lin is going to draw.\"</p><br/><p>The old man that loves drawing: \"Master Lin, that's a difficult task. I've been studying scenery drawings all my life and I know nothing about humans, flora, and fauna. The greatest masters today have only mastered two themes. Mastering three themes is seemingly impossible.\"</p><br/><p>\"I agree with what the master above said.\"</p><br/><p>\"Although I don't know much about art, I know that it's possible to master one theme but it's difficult to master two themes.\"</p><br/><p>\"I think all of you are crazy. Master Lin is just drawing for fun. You guys are too serious about it.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan continued.</p><br/><p>\"There's a standard procedure that we follow for art. Please memorize the following steps.\"</p><br/><p>\"You have to have a good base artwork to work with. Start with the tree barks. Draw some branches and just use a little bit of ink. The colors have to be balanced. The red and green colors have to be crisp.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to move his wrist. He started drawing on the paper. He was drawing extremely well and he looked like he knew what he was doing. He had all the Encyclopedic knowledge and he could draw whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>The crowd in the broadcasting room was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, that's insane. He even sounds professional. However, I've never heard of his techniques.\"</p><br/><p>\"You don't even know art. Obviously, you've never heard of it before. I did a search online but I couldn't find it. I think it's his own techniques.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Tao, are you still here? Say something. What's the meaning of this?\"</p><br/><p>Then, 'The old man that loves drawing' was thinking about it. He was a little taken aback when he heard Lin Fan's techniques. It seemed a little unusual. It was clear and easy to understand.</p><br/><p>It was really something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>When he saw what Master Lin was drawing, he frowned. He didn't understand what was going on but he had to answer the crowd in the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\"I've never heard of the techniques said by Master Lin. However, it's clear and easy to understand. I have to say that it's important for people that just started to learn art. This covers what you have to take note of when doing Chinese art. It's good knowledge to have,\" Master Tao said.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, I can't believe Master Lin is talented in this. His words were knowledgeable.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Tao, what do you think of Master Lin's drawing?\"</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang said, \"I can't tell for now. But the way he's drawing is unusual. Professionals usually hold the pen with the two joints of their index fingers. The middle finger would hook onto the pen and their first index joint would stick closely to the pen. Their index finger and middle fingers would be used to apply force inwards.\"</p><br/><p>\"You sound so experienced. You're indeed a true master, Master Tao. One would benefit a lot from you teaching it live on a broadcast.\"</p><br/><p>\"I also feel that Master Lin's way of holding the pen is special. It's like he's using a lot of force with his index finger.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's stop discussing. Master Lin is not a professional artist. He's just teaching the kids how to draw. It's a good thing. Just wait till he's done before commenting, okay?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's true. Look, Master Lin is drawing the scenery.\"</p><br/><p>\"He's drawing so quickly. Master Lin is looking so professional.\"</p><br/><p>\"No matter what, Master Lin just loves to showcase his talents. I'll give him full marks for this.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan was drawing even better and faster as he continued. The entire drawing was already in his mind.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to control one's spiritual and physical strength. However, by devoting his energy and will to drawing, it created a spectacular effect. With one look, people would think that the drawing was a lively and incredible one.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang looked at the broadcast and he wanted to see what Master Lin was doing. Then, someone knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\"Come in.\"</p><br/><p>When he saw who it was, Tao Shi Gang smiled. \"Why are you here, Brother Yue?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Yue was 'Yue Qiu Ju Shi'. It was his nickname in the world of artists. He was especially talented in drawing flora and fauna and was regarded as one of the best in the country.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Tao, what are you doing?\" Yue Qiu Ju Shi asked.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang smiled. \"I'm just watching a broadcast before I start drawing. It helps to invigorate me. There's a young chap that's drawing too and therefore I was interested to see. I believe you're here because something cropped up, right?\"</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi chuckled. \"I really can't escape your judgment. It's like this. I want to organize an art exhibition but I don't have enough artworks. Therefore, I need to borrow some from you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, alright, alright.\" Tao Shi Gang chuckled. Artists like them would have people asking for their artworks. Some people would actually pre-order them for tens of thousands of dollars. Those larger artworks would typically cost more than a million dollars.</p><br/><p>Artists like them didn't lack money. The thing that Yue Qiu Ju Shi was worried about for the art exhibition was the lack of artworks. It wasn't about the cost of the exhibition. Therefore, he came to ask his friend for some artworks.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang had forgotten about the broadcast as he chatted with his good friend. They were discussing the artworks.</p><br/><p>After a while.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang suddenly thought of it and smiled. \"Brother Yue, I saw this fella in the broadcast that was rather interesting. He had a special technique. After hearing it, I felt that it was unique. Let me show it to you.\"</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi was stunned. \"Really? There's a young chap like that?\"</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang was smiling as he turned to the screen. Then, he was stunned by what he saw. It was as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026this\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

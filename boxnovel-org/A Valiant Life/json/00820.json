It blew up so much that it was frightening.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that it was only the beginning. One day, everyone from all around the world rushed there after reading the Michelin guidebook and it would be crazy.</p><br/><p>The fact that he only sold ten pieces a day had already driven people insane.</p><br/><p>Many people still came to taste and experience it. However, they were gradually disinterested as the shop only sold ten pieces a day.</p><br/><p>However, they were dumbfounded when they saw those that managed to buy the scallion pancakes and the expressions that they made after eating it.</p><br/><p>Even if it was delicious, it couldn\u2019t have produced such expressions.</p><br/><p>It had totally changed their perspective on things.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I\u2019m done. I\u2019ve never seen a scallion pancake shop with so many people in the queue. It must be long since they last ate a scallion pancake.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizen was pretty angry and he immediately posted a picture online.</p><br/><p>Those netizens that didn\u2019t know the background story were stunned after seeing it. They felt that it was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Even those shops that went viral on the Internet wouldn\u2019t have had so many people. Furthermore, some of these shops even spent money to hire actors to queue up at their shops.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know? This is Master Lin\u2019s shop. The second restaurant in the country with three Michelin stars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe only sells ten pieces a day. Even if you\u2019re super influential, you wouldn\u2019t be able to make Master Lin sell an extra scallion pancake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullsh*t. I don\u2019t believe it. If the richest man in the country were to come over, he would have to sell it to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Are you stupid? Even if the richest man came, it would be useless. Do you believe that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussions online were intense. Most of the netizens felt that it was literally impossible. However, those that knew the truth knew that it was really difficult to buy any of Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Even those re-sellers might not be able to get their hands on it because they also had to depend on their luck. Even if they were lucky enough, the price people had to pay was crazy. Those that weren\u2019t rich wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was feeling really helpless. \u201cDo you think we should expand our shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat for? I feel that the current space is good enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay but look at the number of people here today. It\u2019s crazy. Our shop can\u2019t possibly contain that amount of people,\u201d Fraud Tian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh,\u201d Lin Fan sighed in frustration. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to turn out like this. Remember when we first set up this shop just to make a living? We just wanted to earn a little bit of money and have a peaceful and carefree life. But look at things now. There are so many people and it\u2019s so stressful. I regret opening this shop. If I had known about this, I would have continued with my pushcart business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Brother Lin. We\u2019re a family here. Don\u2019t say any hurtful things.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang immediately covered his face in fear. He was afraid that Brother Lin would say something that was hurtful to him.</p><br/><p>He realized that Brother Lin was getting better at pretending to be awesome. If he wasn\u2019t cautious, he would probably be hurt by his words.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly shrugged his shoulders. He wasn\u2019t pretending to be awesome. That was just what he was thinking about.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the large crowd outside and he didn\u2019t even know what to say. There were so many of them waiting outside and he only sold ten pieces of scallion pancakes a day. Was that really a good idea?</p><br/><p>If he indirectly started a fight because of the fact that he only made ten pieces of scallion pancakes a day, wouldn\u2019t he be beaten up too?</p><br/><p>He kept thinking about that and he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>The experienced townsfolk who had been queueing up since a long time ago didn\u2019t want to say anything. They knew that it would be useless.</p><br/><p>Was that going to be easy?</p><br/><p>They looked at the crowd and it was horrifying. In the future, the chances of them getting their hands on the scallion pancakes would be even lower.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin, a lot of people complained that we shouldn\u2019t be selling only ten pieces a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wu You Lan helplessly. What could he do? Selling ten pieces of scallion pancakes daily was considered to be decent. If he were to increase the number of scallion pancakes, wouldn\u2019t he die from exhaustion?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, did Elder Dog go out again?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. He goes out early in the morning every day. I don\u2019t know the reason why. Usually, he would be back by the afternoon,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>He realized the weird habits of Elder Dog. Initially, he wanted to broadcast the habits of Elder Dog but he didn\u2019t expect Elder Dog to run away so quickly every morning. He really couldn\u2019t find him at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still thinking about completing his Encyclopedic task. He just didn\u2019t know how long he needed.</p><br/><p>He had to train Elder Dog till he became godly. He didn\u2019t know how godly Elder Dog had to be before he could complete the task.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>A group of people appeared at the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin,\u201d Cui Guo Bin smiled as he brought a group of people to the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned when he saw them, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know who these people were.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin looked disappointed, \u201cMaster Lin, we had such a good conversation over the phone. Did you forget about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Coach Cui. Sorry, I couldn\u2019t react in time.\u201d Master Lin smiled awkwardly. \u201cCome, quickly come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin smiled and brought some people in as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Master Lin. I am Xu Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and smiled, \u201cI know who you are. I saw some pictures of you online before. You\u2019re quite good-looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song was embarrassed. Although the two of them were youngsters, he felt a little pressured as he was looking at the famous Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Then, the others started to introduce themselves. They were really impressed by Master Lin\u2019s table-tennis skills.</p><br/><p>This time, they came to Shanghai to help Xu Song treat his injuries and play some matches with Master Lin. They wanted to see the difference between their abilities.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, your shop is amazing. It just got three Michelin stars. It\u2019s only the second one in the country. Furthermore, you\u2019re so good at table-tennis. That\u2019s really impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cI\u2019m just okay.\u201d Then, he looked at Xu Song, \u201cDoes he have a leg problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s an old injury. He injured it in the past. Because of the intensity of the competition, he didn\u2019t manage to rest it. Now, it\u2019s been affecting him since then. He has seen a lot of doctors before. Even though it was effective, they couldn\u2019t solve the root of the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSit down. Let me have a look.\u201d Lin Fan touched Xu Song\u2019s legs and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big problem. Don\u2019t worry. I can get rid of it completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song was in disbelief, \u201cMaster Lin, is it really curable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin gently nudged Xu Song\u2019s head, \u201cWhy are you so doubtful? Master Lin is a godly doctor, did you know that? In the past, when Master Lin was practicing, he had treated a lot of complicated illnesses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before coming to Shanghai, Cui Guo Bin had done a lot of research on Master Lin online. He was really shocked by it.</p><br/><p>He felt that this person was literally incomparable. It was indeed infuriating to compare himself to others.</p><br/><p>Xu Song gently rubbed his head, \u201cBrother Cui, I\u2019m not being doubtful. It\u2019s a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>If someone else had nudged his head, he would have been furious. However, he respected Brother Cui a lot and he had guided him in his life. Even if Brother Cui were to beat him up, he would have no complaints.</p><br/><p>That was how much he respected him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

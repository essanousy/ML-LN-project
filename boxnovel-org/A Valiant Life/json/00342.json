Their Weibo accounts had really been taken over by the people. Those comments that they had deleted kept appearing over and over again. They also kept becoming the most liked comments.</p><br/><p>They thought that this fella wanted to destroy them completely.</p><br/><p>How could anyone in this world be so shameless?</p><br/><p>What they didn't know was that Lin Fan wasn't bothered by this at all. He was living carefreely everyday. As for this internet war, he had left it to Autumn Sword Fish Killer.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was still rather unhappy. He wanted to make things difficult for Lin Fan once in a while. However, he always failed. Also, his salary had been cut by $3000 which affected him a lot. It felt like whenever he was plotting something, he'd always get found out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thinking about how to complete the task in a better way. Then, he immediately made a call.</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue saw the incoming call, she immediately picked it up. \"Master, you finally called me.\"</p><br/><p>When he heard her voice that was filled with anticipation, he smiled. \"How's your latest album doing?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled. \"I'm still a new artiste. My results are decent on the charts. However, those that are ranked above me are all my seniors. I can't beat them yet.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \"Hmm, do you want to have another album? I can help you create one.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh\u2026?\" Wu Huan Yue was stunned. \"Master Lin, you mean you want to help me create an album?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yeah. How's that? Do you want to win? We can win with quantity and the quality is obviously going to be top-notch. Are you up for it?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang still thought that the interval was too short and it wouldn't be effective. However, Lin Fan couldn't wait any longer to complete the Encyclopedic task. He had no motivation for the current task and he wanted to complete it as soon as possible so that he could move on to the next one.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue didn't reject Master Lin. \"Master Lin, I'm definitely up for it. I've been working on my singing with my teacher. I'm extremely interested to apply it to the album.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright, no problem. I'll give Wang Ming Yang a call.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately called Wang Ming Yang after hanging up. He said, \"This is the only way. I've discussed with Wu Huan Yue already. I'll help her come up with another album. Don't tell me that the time span between the two albums is too short. I feel that the current album is not doing well enough, which is why I want to make a new one to give it a boost.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. Then, he coughed. \"Bro, this album was made by Teacher Yang. He's beside me now.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"D*mn, pretend I didn't say anything. Teacher Yang, don't mind me. But I mean it. I don't want to wait for another month. Just let me do it.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang couldn't say anything else. He just nodded. \"Alright then, I'll play along with you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright, that's my brother. When I'm done selling scallion pancakes, I'll come over to look for you. We can finish up on the songs.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"Do you have to be so hasty?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"How can I not be?\"</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan felt extremely good. The current task wasn't very meaningful and he felt that there was no need to take it slow.</p><br/><p>After the production team of 'Celebrity Family' had advertised for Cloud Street, there were even more people visiting Cloud Street. Many of them came after hearing so many good things about it. These days, Cloud Street's visitor traffic had reached its peak and Lin Fan's business had been booming with people.</p><br/><p>\"Are Master Lin's scallion pancakes that delicious?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. Master Lin's scallion pancakes are out of this world. You can only understand it after eating it.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's that good? I came after watching the variety show. There are so many people here, how long do I have to queue for?\"</p><br/><p>One of the men replied, \"It depends on your luck. If you're lucky, you can buy it today. If not, you'll have to wait and you might even have to wait for the rest of your life.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you cursing me?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not cursing you. That's the way it is. He only sells ten pieces a day and it's by a balloting system. Do you think you're that lucky?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian subconsciously caressed his beard after seeing so many townsfolk outside the shop. If the shop was his, he'd definitely serve every single one of them even if he'd be worked to death. He'd be unlike that kid, who insisted on limiting it to ten a day. How helpless.</p><br/><p>But Fraud Tian didn't feel that there was anything wrong with what Lin Fan was doing. He was still extremely happy because there were several resellers that secretly treated him to meals. They wanted him to assist them. In the end, Fraud Tian just ate and gave them empty promises. It all depended on their luck.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, that's bullsh*t. I'm not buying it. It's not as if I've never eaten scallion pancakes before.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, alright.\"</p><br/><p>\"One less person means less competition.\"</p><br/><p>The balloting ended.</p><br/><p>Some of them were elated while others were depressed.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, I got selected! I got selected!\" a middle-aged lady exclaimed.</p><br/><p>At that instant, a reseller went forward. \"Ma'am, are you selling that scallion pancake? I'll buy it from you for $1000.\"</p><br/><p>The lady replied, \"Do you think I'm stupid? If you want it, pay me $2000. If not, forget it.\"</p><br/><p>The reseller replied, \"Alright, deal\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk that were new to Cloud Street were stunned when they saw that. \"D*mn, a $50 scallion pancake actually got bought over for $2000?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course. These are Master Lin's scallion pancakes. The reseller can sell it again for a much higher price, sometimes up to a few times that price.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, a few times? Which idiot would buy it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Young fella, don't think that something doesn't exist just because you've never experienced it. There are so many wealthy men in this world and you'd never imagine what they're thinking.\"</p><br/><p>When they saw the red dollar bills, they finally believed it. A $50 scallion pancake had really been sold for $2000. The reseller carefully packaged the scallion pancake and made a call to his contacts so that they'd be delivered promptly.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street had become the source of a sales chain.</p><br/><p>These resellers would spend hours queuing everyday and if they didn't get anything, they'd leave immediately. They didn't affect the business at all. If they managed to buy something, they'd earn a lot of money.</p><br/><p>Of course, the resellers didn't manage to buy scallion pancakes everyday because some townsfolk insisted on eating them. What could they do about that?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't bothered by these things at all because these things made more people patronize Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners were grinning everyday because their businesses were doing extremely well with the help of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Then, at Wang Ming Yang's place.</p><br/><p>Teacher Yang said, \"Chief Wang, are you serious about creating a new album?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"Yeah.\"</p><br/><p>Teacher Yang said hesitantly, \"The frequency is too high. It'll have a negative impact.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand. \"It's okay to be negatively affected. My brother wants to try it out and I'll support him. It's okay to suffer losses.\"</p><br/><p>Teacher Yang was helpless but he was curious about Master Lin. He was wondering what kind of spectacular songs he was going to write this time.</p><br/><p>He only knew about one of his songs, 'Sky', and he felt that it was an extremely good song. But it was difficult to tell if Master Lin could continue making such nice songs.</p><br/><p>Because some composers could only make one or two amazing songs and the other songs were average.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

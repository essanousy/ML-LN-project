He had to reject Elder Zheng to stand up for his student. He couldn\u2019t let his student be bullied like this.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had caught a few big fish and was feeling pretty happy with his reward. \u201cTeacher, come and have dinner tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cForget it, I\u2019m not in the mood today.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Zhao Ming Qing, he felt that the reason for his teacher\u2019s bad mood was the incident earlier.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had wanted to reply to his teacher but he decided not to.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan sent Zhao Ming Qing home and drove back home after that.</p><br/><p>When he reached his underground lift lobby after parking his car, he pressed the button. However, he realized that there was no response.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. The lift must have malfunctioned.</p><br/><p>He lived on a pretty high level but he had no choice but to walk up the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m finally back.\u201d Lin Fan pressed the light switch but he realized that they didn\u2019t work either. \u201cCould it be a blackout?\u201d</p><br/><p>He took out his phone in the darkness and switched on the flashlight. Then, he moved to the balcony and looked around. He realized that most of the other places were pitch black too. There must have been a blackout.</p><br/><p>He walked to the kitchen and tried to open the tap.</p><br/><p>However, there was no water. Things didn\u2019t seem too good without water and electricity.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The fact that he lived on a high floor made things worse. It looked like he needed to stay over in a hotel for the night. He packed some clean clothes and ran down.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t slept well the night before. After all, the hotel wasn\u2019t as comfortable as his home. When he reached the shop, the townsfolk were waiting for him.</p><br/><p>The scallion pancakes had already won the hearts of many and people felt uneasy without them.</p><br/><p>Although he set the daily limit to ten pieces a day, sometimes there were townsfolk who could understand the poster on the wall and he would end up selling more than ten pieces.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Then, his phone rang. It was an unknown number.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve been receiving calls from unknown numbers. I don\u2019t think I offended anyone lately.\u201d Lin Fan felt a little confused but he still picked up the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know who this is?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The person who called was a middle-aged man. He sounded polite. \u201cHi, may I know if you are Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. \u201cYes. You are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Master Lin. I am from the local Health Department of Shanghai\u2026\u201d Lin Fan ended the call even before He Jun could finish speaking.</p><br/><p>He Jun was dumbfounded as he held the phone in his office.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t believe that Master Lin would hang up on him even before speaking.</p><br/><p>Outrageous. It was simply outrageous.</p><br/><p>Although he was unhappy, he was really helpless. He had just gotten scolded by his superiors.</p><br/><p>He felt really miserable too.</p><br/><p>The leader had said \u2018Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s thinking isn\u2019t appropriate.\u2019 This had led to him making changes to suppress Zhao Ming Qing. Could it be that there had been something wrong with this?</p><br/><p>It was indeed difficult to understand the thinking of his superiors.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the leader had told him that if he couldn\u2019t appease Master Lin, the matter would not be resolved.</p><br/><p>In the end, he picked up the phone and called again.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t resolve it, he couldn\u2019t answer his boss.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was fuming with anger. The Health Department actually dared to call him. He felt that they had gone overboard for challenging him with a phone call after what had happened.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>The phone rang again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw the caller ID and immediately picked up. \u201cDo you have a problem? What do you want? Say it now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Jun had gotten scolded by his superiors and now he was getting scolded by Master Lin. He was furious. However, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it since he was being sandwiched. He could only endure it to resolve the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s a misunderstanding. I am He Jun from the Health Department. I\u2019d like to tell you something.\u201d He Jun wasn\u2019t happy at all. It was pretty uncommon for him to be treated like this.</p><br/><p>Those medical directors would always treat him with respect.</p><br/><p>However, he was currently being scolded on the phone and he still had to speak to the opposition respectfully.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead then. Don\u2019t talk rubbish.\u201d Lin Fan was still skeptical about the Health Department. However, he felt that perhaps Elder Zheng had explained the situation to them.</p><br/><p>However, he still felt that it wasn\u2019t sufficient.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this. Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s appointment will be discussed further. We realized that we didn\u2019t think through our actions. We understand the problem and we hope that Master Lin can forgive us.\u201d He Jun literally forced himself to say those words.</p><br/><p>He had actually said that to an ordinary townsfolk and if people were to find out about it, they would think that he was a laughing stock.</p><br/><p>However, he had to endure it and resolve the problem.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t give him any face at all. \u201cAll of you are stupid. The final decision was made by you. Now that you realize your mistakes, you should call my student, not me. Alright, I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>*beep*</p><br/><p>The phone call got cut off again. He Jun was infuriated.</p><br/><p>The other people in the office heard He Jun\u2019s roar and they whimpered in fear. They knew that their superior was in a bad mood since they had entered the office in the morning. Therefore, everyone avoided him like a plague.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, who called?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cSomeone from the Health Department. The idiot that demoted Ming Qing. He called to tell me that they were wrong and they are going to review their decision. I think they must be crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, that\u2019s weird. This is extremely rare. They actually realized their mistake? They would usually cover up their mistakes with hundreds of excuses.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang replied.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan wanted to reply Zhao Zhong Yang, another call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey must be asking for trouble.\u201d Lin Fan was furious.</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately declined the call and blocked the number.</p><br/><p>He Jun was furious after hearing the sound on the phone. <em>Did the fella just block me?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he is doing,\u201d He Jun grumbled angrily. He knew that his position would be at stake if he didn\u2019t resolve the problem.</p><br/><p>However, did he really have to go and look for Master Lin personally?</p><br/><p><em>This\u2026</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

The night is cooling and its rather nice to just walk around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan relaxed himself. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to walk around in quite a while, and this is pretty nice. Oh, how are things going with your investment with Cloud Corporation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill okay, not much to say. Your connection in the capital city is quite impressive. I went over to Cloud Corporation to settle some business and it was green lights all the way. There were no barriers of entry at all,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said. \u201cYou just have to many secrets up your sleeves. If you didn\u2019t tell me , I wouldn\u2019t have believed you at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t have any secrets. It\u2019s just how well you know me,\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of this, I haven\u2019t blamed you yet. Do you look down on me?\u201d Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan, asking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked a little puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan. \u201cHow do I put this? I know about that time you went to buy artwork. If you lack money, you can just tell me. The Children\u2019s Welfare Institute is also my responsibility and I am more than willing to pay me share,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said. \u201cAnd I am really serious about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang on the shoulders. \u201cAlright, alright, please don\u2019t be angry with me. Next time I need money, I\u2019ll come looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Wang Ming Yang laughed, before taking Lin Fan by the hands. \u201cBrother, come let us sing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the span of a life how many people do you know? How many friendships will survive for long? Please don\u2019t part with me today without shaking my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome let us walk on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cAlright, come. Let me blow you away with my perfect pitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriendship remains strong within our hearts, today we mark this moment, and we shall meet once more again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we never meet again face to face,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will still be friends from start to end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, your voice is murderous,\u201d Wang Ming Yang covered his ears, lamenting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if! Your voice is murderous!\u201d Lin Fan retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to know you better last time because I thought you were an expert at some things, and making more connections would be good. Now, I changed the way I see it. You are my best bro and friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you were a d*ck the first time I saw you, and a stupid burdensome one too. But now\u2026\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s eyes were sparking, awaiting what Lin Fan would say.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cBut now, you\u2019re just a burden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, your mother,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said, his face looking a little downcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of their eyes met each other\u2019s, and they started laughing out loud, slightly intoxicated from all the alcohol.</p><br/><p>At that moment, they turned their heads to see what was going out in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d Lin Fan said, looking puzzled.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked ahead, \u201cNot sure. Eh, this place looks like Fourth Avenue, and those guys look like they\u2019re wearing military clothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver pulled up next to Wang Ming Yang and Lin Fan, taking a closer look at what was happening in front of them. \u201cPresident Wang, those few guys look like they\u2019re wearing the military uniform from the Imperial Japanese Army. Fourth Avenue contains famous relics and ruins from World War Two and some of them are anti-Japanese. It is a place for patriotism and civil education.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wang Ming Yang exploded. \u201cWhat the f*ck? My second grandfather sacrificed his life during the Japanese Occupation then. What the f*ck are they doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let us go and see,\u201d Lin Fan said without wavering, as he moved off with Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The entrance to Fourth Avenue.</p><br/><p>Four people were standing in a line, and one of them was holding a hand phone, \u201cTake a good look. No one has discovered us yet. Some people who passed by just now were scared shitless by us and ran off. I told you guys, that all of you are too chicken to catch us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, our seven day challenge is coming to an end. You guy can continue scolding us. it doesn\u2019t change the reality at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look at the red wall behind us. We are the ones who painted on it. It\u2019ll frighten anyone who sees it tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live the Imperial Nippon Government. We will be back in a few years\u2019 time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who were in the live broadcast were enraged.</p><br/><p>They never thought someone would stoop so low as to do this.</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast room, it was only raging. All the keyboard warriors started to spam the page with hate messages and death threats. Although they knew where they were, they felt helpless, not knowing what to do with this scary, arrogant bunch of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, can you guys stop scolding us and just come over here to beat us up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you guys something. You guys are just too chicken to do anything. All you can do is just use your dingy little keyboard to write some words. Did you see those guys just now? We just scared them away like nothing. How hilarious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeaklings will always be weaklings. You just saw what we did. They didn\u2019t even dare to come up to us. What a shame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud shout went across the street.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck do you brats think you are doing here?\u201d Wang Ming Yang dashed across the street, pointing accusing fingers at the youngsters.</p><br/><p>The five people started laughing as they saw the person dash towards them. \u201cTake a look, one of your comrades have come. Too bad there\u2019s only three of them and five of us, and we have come prepared. Once we take out our equipment, they\u2019ll shit themselves all the way home.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the youngsters looked at Lin Fan. \u201cWhat do you think you guys are doing? F*ck off, this is none of your business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB*stards, I\u2019ll make you regret what you did,\u201d Wang Ming Yang was exploding with rage, ready to tell the youngsters off.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, one of the youngsters took out a gun from his pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t move. One twitch and your head goes off.\u201d</p><br/><p>For normal people, they would have been scared shitless seeing the bunch of suspicious looking people, especially after taking out a gun. They would have thought that the gun was real.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stopped in his racks, frozen on the spot. He never imagined that those guys would have a gun.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued dashing forward, directly lunging towards the person who was pointing the gun at them. Lin Fan picked up the gun, inspecting it. \u201cWhat kind of mockery is this? A fifteen dollar toy gun just to scare people? You guys are just mentally retarded.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngster who were kicked onto the floor lay there in a daze, unable to react in time. The four other youngsters stood there, frozen in panic. \u201cWhat the heck\u2026 you guys\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I\u2019m not going to waste my time with you guys. All kowtow before me,\u201d Lin Fan commanded. The few youngsters were able to deal with anyone who was weak, but Lin Fan was out of their league. Lin Fan also didn\u2019t feel like saying anything more. He immediately snatched their phone away from them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the live broadcast burst back into life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat just happened? What on earth just happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot sure, looks like those guys just got screwed. These b*tches finally got what they deserved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, finally. This is great. Finally someone did something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, who is that guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the live broadcast chat, \u201cWhat on earth are you guys doing? Who are those youngsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, I don\u2019t know who he is but I hope he teaches them a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. These youngsters are a bunch of degenerates and they finally will get what they deserve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro, let us fill you in. These five guys are Imperial Japan Activists. They had a seven day challenge and they had been going around to various anti-Japanese landmarks the past week to vandalize and cause trouble. Please teach them a proper lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys really have no morals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was starting to get a clearer picture of what was going on. \u201cUnderstood, I\u2019ll see who these guys are really like, and I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five youngsters kneeled on the floor. After hearing what Lin Fan had said, their faces turned pale in terror.</p></div>\n</div>"}

That was so fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it just be a show? It isn\u2019t uncommon these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd was stunned and they were all discussing it. It looked impossible.</p><br/><p>The couple hugged their child in shock. It looked impossible. They had been in the hospital for so long and wasted so much money. How could it be treated so easily here?</p><br/><p>However, as they heard the commotion, they took out their medical bills slip, \u201cLook, this is our medical bills slip. We aren\u2019t an act. This\u2026 We don\u2019t even know what to say about this. We just came out of the hospital and we were prepared to go to Shanghai Children\u2019s Hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at the slip and were in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. His illness couldn\u2019t even be treated by the Citizen\u2019s Hospital but it was treated in such a short time here. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I don\u2019t know what to say. If it\u2019s true, then it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were ecstatic. They felt that this trip had been worthwhile as they were able to learn knowledge that they wouldn\u2019t have learned from the books.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s not that the hospital can\u2019t treat him. Chinese medicine focuses on treating the specific problems of a particular person. For Western medicine, it is just a little more complicated than Chinese medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This child\u2019s weird illness wasn\u2019t difficult to treat. He just had to find the vital acupoints. The Encyclopedia had a description of this illness and he could use this method to treat him in a short time. He didn\u2019t even need to use the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>If this method of treatment were to be published, it would be another historical breakthrough.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The child\u2019s parents were full of gratitude. Their child\u2019s illness had made them extremely anxious. Now that it was resolved, it seemed like they weren\u2019t being weighed down by the burden anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. Don\u2019t let it end here. I will prescribe you with some medicine. Go to a proper Chinese medicine shop to get these medications in the future. Let the child take it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. You can stop after a week. Don\u2019t worry, the medicine won\u2019t have any side effects. It is used to improve his energy levels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, godly doctor. Thank you\u2026 How much is the prescription? We will pay.\u201d The child\u2019s parents were convinced and Lin Fan had instantly become a godly doctor in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we treat illnesses for free here. It\u2019s voluntary medical work. Quickly go and buy the medicine. You can let him take the first serving tonight,\u201d Lin Fan said and waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d The child\u2019s parents nodded. Then, they quickly brought their child to a Chinese medicine shop to buy the medicine.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is the reasoning behind this?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cActually, there isn\u2019t any reasoning behind it. It is simple to treat an illness like this. It\u2019s just you guys don\u2019t know about it yet. Thankfully, I\u2019ve done research about this illness before and that\u2019s why I know about it. Lil\u2019 Jie, please record everything that happened today. I will explain it to all of you in the future when we go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was ecstatic. At the same time, he became even more impressed with his mentor\u2019s medical skills.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie wasn\u2019t sure of some of the symptoms but he still recorded them down. Next time, he could study it and it would definitely be beneficial to him.</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd went forward, \u201cAll of you are Chinese medical doctors, what else can you treat?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question wasn\u2019t easy for Zhao Ming Qing and the others to answer. Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWe have to see the illness before we give our verdict.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about cancer?\u201d A townsfolk asked.</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan replied, someone else answered, \u201cAre you asking for fun? Cancer is an incurable disease. You think they\u2019d be able to treat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk replied, \u201cNo, did you see the news previously? A godly doctor appeared in the hospitals in several cities and even treated a cancer patient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fake. I heard that it was all faked by the hospitals. Look at those hospitals now, they are booming with patients. It was just an advertisement for the hospitals. If these people here could treat cancer, why would they be doing voluntary medical work here? I wonder where they would be now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled but didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t want to answer it as he felt that there wasn\u2019t a need to do so.</p><br/><p>Cancer was an incurable disease and it was a fact. However, he had managed to treat it because of the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost. If he had exposed himself, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem but he would definitely be frustrated with the number of patients.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he wanted to take it slow and if he was faced with a cancer patient, he would temporarily keep his identity a secret.</p><br/><p>However, if he was exposed, it wouldn\u2019t have been a big problem.</p><br/><p>He was a godly doctor that was able to treat cancer patients, so what?</p><br/><p>They continued until afternoon and there were two more patients. Initially, Zhao Ming Qing would look at the patients and identify the illness. Then, he would propose something while Lin Fan would add on to his proposal.</p><br/><p>This was extremely beneficial to Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>At a certain hospital ward with three people.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man walked to his family member, \u201cIt\u2019s weird today. There are a few people who are doing voluntary medical work at the entrance. What do you think of them doing voluntary medical work at the hospital\u2019s entrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two other patients smiled, \u201cThey are stealing business from the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too. However, let\u2019s not talk about that yet. Earlier, there was a child who had been sleeping for extremely long hours and the hospital couldn\u2019t do anything about it. But he was treated completely after seeing them for a while. I feel like it was an act but at the same time, it didn\u2019t seem like one too.\u201d</p><br/><p>*cough* A patient on the bed that was furthest inside gently coughed. \u201cWho knows? Anything could happen in this world Anyway, I feel that anything is better than getting sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a nurse came in with a medical bills slip. \u201cWang Xi Zhu, you have to ask your family member to pay the medical bills. You haven\u2019t paid about $10,000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNurse, I know. I have informed them. They\u2019ll pay up soon.\u201d The patient who was furthest inside was Wang Xi Zhu. He nodded. He had a problem with his lungs and it was a recurring problem. He had to visit the hospital every time it recurred and it was expensive.</p><br/><p>Every time he entered the hospital, he had to delay payment as he didn\u2019t have the money to pay.</p><br/><p>The nurse left.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu sighed, \u201cSigh, I really don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019d rather die than get this disease.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said, \u201cYeah, actually you can go to the hospital entrance to have a look. It is free anyway. Perhaps you might be permanently cured and you won\u2019t have to stay here anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu replied, \u201cDoes it really work? It might be a scam.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it was a scam, just go and have a look. I feel like it\u2019s not a scam,\u201d the middle-aged man said.</p><br/><p>Wang Xi Zhu thought about it for a moment and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

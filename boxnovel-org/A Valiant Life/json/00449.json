When he saw Elder Zheng walk out, he immediately stepped out of the car and opened the door. Suddenly, Lil\u2019 Wang was stunned. He saw that Elder Zheng was holding Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s hand and was able to walk on his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang was a little confused. He was Elder Zheng\u2019s bodyguard and he knew about their newborn and that he had a problem. He understood their helplessness and sadness.</p><br/><p>Today, he saw that Lil\u2019 Bao was able to walk on his own and he was so emotional that he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng patted Lil\u2019 Wang on his shoulder, \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, let\u2019s go to the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang replied.</p><br/><p>At Junqu Hospital.</p><br/><p>Even the director of the hospital came to greet Elder Zheng. Although Elder Zheng was a retired man, he was still impactful.</p><br/><p>If it was an average day, Elder Zheng wouldn\u2019t have been that anxious. However, he had to find out what happened to Lil\u2019 Bao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Jiang, please do a check on my grandson and see what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Elder Zheng said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Director Jiang\u2019s face changed when he saw Lil\u2019 Bao. He knew what was wrong with Lil\u2019 Bao right from the first day he was born. He was born with a flaw and the specialist team had discussed about it before but the final decision wasn\u2019t favorable. If he were to undergo a surgery, the chances of success were low. Furthermore, there would be unexpected side effects. Hence, the situation dragged and they could only wait till it improved before making a final decision.</p><br/><p>However, Lil\u2019 Bao could walk and it shocked Director Jiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Elder Zheng, I\u2019ll get the specialist time to do a check-up,\u201d Director Jiang said. He wanted to find out what was the situation with Lil\u2019 Bao too. He knew how complicated it was as their hospital had done checks on him before.</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly recovered and something must have happened.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lil\u2019 Bao was sent to the medical check-up room.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was waiting patiently.</p><br/><p>Director Jiang was an experienced doctor with superb medical skills. He was personally conducting the checks on Lil\u2019 Bao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the body measurements?\u201d Director Jiang asked.</p><br/><p>The doctors beside him replied, \u201cDirector, everything is normal. There isn\u2019t any problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jiang looked at the x-ray image carefully and realized there wasn\u2019t any problem with his legs. He remembered that Lil Bao\u2019s leg was in a serious condition and it was naturally born that way. He could\u2019ve done something about it but the success rate was too low. Furthermore, if something were to happen, it\u2019d definitely be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng and the others didn\u2019t agree to it. Although there was hope, they didn\u2019t want to try it unless it was 100% successful. If not, they wouldn\u2019t have agreed to let Lil\u2019 Bao undergo the experiment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Director Jiang was stunned. He realized that there was a small dot on the x-ray image. If he didn\u2019t look at it closely enough, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome and have a look at this. What\u2019s this black dot?\u201d Director Jiang asked. The surrounding doctors quickly came over. They were the specialists of Junqu Hospital and they could think of solutions extremely quickly.</p><br/><p>Then, they were stunned when they looked at the x-ray image. \u201cThere\u2019s a dot and it\u2019s not exactly small. It sorts of covers the nerves around the knees densely. It looks like it\u2019s pierced through the bone. Look at the child\u2019s knees and see if there\u2019s a dot there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The specialists removed the child\u2019s pants and suddenly, Lil\u2019 Bao held onto his pants, \u201cUncle, why are you guys removing my pants?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctors smiled, \u201cLil\u2019 Bao, we just want to have a look at something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the doctors removed Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s pants, they looked at the knee area carefully and shouted, \u201cDirector Jiang, quickly come here. There are a lot of small dots. They\u2019re all extremely small. If we didn\u2019t look at it carefully, we wouldn\u2019t have noticed them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jiang quickly went forward and looked at it carefully. He wondered, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the specialists said, \u201cDirector, do you think it\u2019s like those acupuncture needles used in Chinese medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAcupuncture needles?\u201d Director Jiang was stunned. Then, he shouted at the nurse, \u201cGo get a Chinese medical doctor here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the nurse nodded and went out immediately.</p><br/><p>When Elder Zheng saw the nurse walking out, he asked anxiously, \u201cNurse, how\u2019s the situation like in there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, the Director and the other doctors are having a look. I have to get a Chinese medical doctor here to look at something,\u201d the nurse said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh\u2026\u201d Elder Zheng seemed a little nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, there won\u2019t be anything wrong. The Gods must be looking after Lil\u2019 Bao,\u201d Zheng Hai Feng said.</p><br/><p>Nian Hui Ci had been praying for Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s condition to improve and if it was really okay, she hoped it was real. She was patiently waiting for the hospital to finish the checks.</p><br/><p>The nurse brought a Chinese medical doctor in.</p><br/><p>In the medical check-up room.</p><br/><p>The old Chinese medical doctor looked at the small dots around the knee area and raised his head, \u201cDirector, they\u2019re indeed done by acupuncture needles. Only 0.125mm needles could leave such small holes. Furthermore, there are some big and small dots here which belong to different acupuncture needles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this again, the needles actually pierced through the bone. Do you know of any Chinese medical doctor that\u2019s able to do this?\u201d Director Jiang didn\u2019t know much about Chinese medicine and hence he asked for an experienced Chinese medical doctor to come and have a look.</p><br/><p>The Chinese medical doctor looked at it for a while and said, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m seeing this. I don\u2019t know the reason for the needles to pierce through the bone. However, this type of needles are typically extremely soft and it\u2019s virtually impossible for it to pierce through the bone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s acupuncture needles?\u201d Director Jiang asked again.</p><br/><p>The Chinese medical doctor nodded, \u201cYes, I can confirm that. Judging from this, I think it\u2019s only been done a while ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been done a while ago? Are you sure?\u201d Director Jiang asked in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The old Chinese medical doctor nodded. At the same time, he was extremely curious. He wondered who had such an ability and what was the reason behind this.</p><br/><p>Outside!</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng and the others were patiently waiting and when Director Jiang came out, they rushed forward, \u201cDirector Jiang, how\u2019s the situation like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, let\u2019s go over there to talk about it,\u201d Director Jiang said.</p><br/><p>This matter was unbelievable and he wanted to ask what exactly happened.</p><br/><p>At the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Jiang, go ahead and tell me. Is it a bad news?\u201d Elder Zheng asked calmly but he was extremely nervous. This matter concerned his own grandson and he didn\u2019t want it to be a negative one.</p><br/><p>Director Jiang replied, \u201cBefore saying anything, I would like to know if there\u2019s a Chinese medical doctor in your household.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChinese medical doctor?\u201d Elder Zheng was stunned. Then, he shook his head, \u201cNope, there isn\u2019t one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s knee has dots from acupuncture needles. After our investigation, Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s knee managed to heal miraculously. According to our check-ups in the past, Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s leg was bent because of a change in the nerves. However, they\u2019ve recovered now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng asked, \u201cDirector Jiang, you mean Lil\u2019 Bao has fully recovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Director Jiang nodded. \u201cHowever, Elder Zheng, think about it again. Did Lil\u2019 Bao undergo any treatment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Elder Zheng shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>Nian Ci Hui stood aside and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>However, Lil\u2019 Wang knew what happened but he didn\u2019t say anything about it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

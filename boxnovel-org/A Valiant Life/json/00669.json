He was even in disbelief. Then, he started writing in a thick notebook. He hesitated for a moment and realized that it was something that he had never learned before.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, can you recommend your teacher to me?\u201d Di Jia Nuo asked with anticipation. He didn\u2019t expect someone to be so gifted in cardiology.</p><br/><p>He was a well-known cardiologist in America and he wanted to meet him to learn more about it. Lin Fan only analyzed the illness for a short moment and he could give a flawless report about it. He also suggested the most effective treatment and it was something that Di Jia Nuo had never seen before.</p><br/><p>Based on that, he was extremely interested in meeting the godly doctor.</p><br/><p>His mentor had been well-respected and as the student, he was ecstatic. However, he couldn\u2019t confirm if his mentor would meet him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Di, let\u2019s not talk about this first. We have more important things to do,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing smiled and said. Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong had learned a lot after coming to the mountainous regions of Yunnan. It was an eye-opening experience.</p><br/><p>Di Jia Nuo nodded, \u201cYeah, we have more important things to do. However, Elder Zhao, you have to introduce him to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s question wasn\u2019t really difficult. He had a lot of solutions to resolve the problem. However, he had to tell them the most effective one.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, he looked at the time and it was almost time to board the plane.</p><br/><p>In Beijing.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan packed his things, \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, drive me to the airport.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang was Zheng Zhong Shan\u2019s main chauffeur. He was on standby every day. Furthermore, he had been the chauffeur for the Zheng family for almost ten years. He was satisfied and proud of his job.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, what\u2019s the happy occasion today?\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang asked while driving as he saw Elder Zheng smiling.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled, \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, Elder Lin is back. It is definitely a happy occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang was stunned. Then, he smiled, \u201cMaster Lin is back? That is indeed a happy occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng\u2019s grandson was healed by Master Lin. To Lil\u2019 Wang, those that did Elder Zheng a favor were also his benefactors. Therefore, he respected Lin Fan a lot.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled, \u201cThis time, with Elder Lin\u2019s support, the International Arts Exhibition will definitely be a smooth-sailing one. It wouldn\u2019t be the same as the one that was held three years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>The International Arts Exhibition that was held three years ago was embarrassing. Their artworks were the second from the bottom in terms of popularity. They only won India. How could they accept that?</p><br/><p>Although the foreigners didn\u2019t really understand Chinese Arts, the lousy ranking was unbearable.</p><br/><p>This time, he was filled with confidence. It was all because of Elder Lin. Furthermore, Elder Lin offered to provide ten artworks. If they were to receive a poor score again, they\u2019d be helpless.</p><br/><p>At 5 pm in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>A luxurious car was parked outside. Lil\u2019 Wang immediately exited the car and opened the door for Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, I\u2019ll fetch Master Lin. You can wait in the car,\u201d said Lil\u2019 Wang.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. My friend came from a long way. It wouldn\u2019t be nice of me to stay in the car. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang couldn\u2019t say anything else but agree with him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already left the plane. He knew that Elder Zheng was there to pick him up. As for Beijing, he had always felt that it was a nice place. After all, it was the capital and it was difficult for other cities to be compared to it.</p><br/><p>He collected his luggage and got his tickets checked. He walked out and he saw Elder Zheng and Lil\u2019 Wang. He smiled and went forward, \u201cElder Zheng, sorry to trouble you for coming here personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled, \u201cElder Lin, I have been watching the moon and the stars and I finally got you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang went forward, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll carry your luggage for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Lil\u2019 Wang.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. He didn\u2019t say anything else as he passed the luggage to Lil\u2019 Wang.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was a little doubtful, \u201cElder Lin, it\u2019s not that I do not welcome you here. I would like to ask why you decided to come over so soon. Is it because you have something else to attend to here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to be there so soon but the International Arts Exhibition required a certain level of craftsmanship. Furthermore, it was difficult to look for tools to draw. Therefore, he wanted to go to the association to draw.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was stunned after hearing that. He felt that what Elder Lin said was extraordinary.</p><br/><p>He spoke about the limitation of tools and how average drawings wouldn\u2019t work. What was Elder Lin going to draw?</p><br/><p>After thinking of that, Elder Zheng was a little emotional. He was also filled with anticipation. He looked at the time and slowly dismissed his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. Follow me back. I\u2019ll get my wife to cook a sumptuous feast for you,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019m in luck.\u201d Then, he thought about something that he felt that he had to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, do you know Ma Mu Feng of Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan nodded, \u201cYeah, of course. I didn\u2019t expect such a person to exist in the society. Furthermore, Ma Mu Feng\u2019s \u2018backing\u2019 is actually him. That\u2019s shameful. I know that the government had already passed orders to tackle it promptly. We have to arrest these fellas as soon as possible. However, Elder Lin, when you\u2019re met with such problems in the future, you can look for me. Although I\u2019ve retired, I still have some authority.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cElder Zheng, I\u2019m not talking about that. Ma Mu Feng\u2019s backing has another backing. Initially, I didn\u2019t know about it but he contacted me. According to my investigation, he should be in Beijing. However, I don\u2019t know who he is. Can you think of who is capable enough to be the backing of another one? He must be powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. \u201cThere\u2019s such a thing? If so, I think he is definitely a big shot. I\u2019m afraid there are a lot of hidden things in this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Zheng Zhong Shan looked more stern. It looked like he was serious about resolving the matter.</p><br/><p>However, he just didn\u2019t know what was going on behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>Then, Zheng Zhong Shan smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s not think about this. We should rush back. I\u2019m afraid my wife is a little impatient.\u201d Then, he said sternly, \u201cHowever, do not be rash regarding this matter. I think the team behind the scenes is not a simple one. They\u2019re probably a big group of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he found out who the person was, he would definitely not let him off. With his current capabilities, he wasn\u2019t afraid of anything at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

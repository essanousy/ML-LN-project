He was so satisfied with it that he started nodding his head. The rough layout was already completed. Although the overall progress wasn't completed yet, it looked promising.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang, the shop owner of the adjacent shop smiled while standing beside Lin Fan. \"Little Boss, your renovation works are really quick. They probably just need a few days more to complete it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded.\"Yeah, it's a small shop. There isn't much to prepare anyway.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang replied, \"Did the court of law transfer you the payment for the renovation?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, it was really quick too. $320,000, not a single cent less.\" Lin Fan had to give a thumbs up to the people working there. Qiao Fei had initially not wanted to give any money but it would've made things worse for him. After a while, Qiao Fei surrendered to his fate and gave the money. Especially since he had been detained for six months, it was like torture to him.</p><br/><p>It must have disrupted so much work. The people back in the company had to try to speak to Lu Li to seal the deal again but it was all in vain. Lu Li had already signed the agreement with the other company and the project had already started. All they heard was \"We can work together in the future if the opportunity arises.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang looked into the distance. \"Hey, what's with Fraud Tian?\"</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian walked to the shop, Lin Fan was stunned. \"Hey, Fraud. What's wrong? Did you get beaten up by someone? Why are your eyes swollen and red?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian wiped the corners of his eyes and heaved a sigh, \"It's so pitiful.\"</p><br/><p>\"What did you see?\" Lin Fan was extremely close to Fraud Tian. He was such a heartless man but now, he was crying over someone. It was such a weird occurrence.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \"I followed that man to the hospital. It was pitiful. An average person can't possibly stay at the hospital for a long time. I was having such a hard time looking at the patients there and even their families too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"That's the way it is. You're not Superman or God. You just can't help it sometimes even if you'd like to.\"</p><br/><p>\"But if you love a person and want to help him or her, you have to do your best,\" Fraud Tian said. It was the first time he had said such a deep sentence.</p><br/><p>Even Lin Fan was stunned. \"What exactly did you see? The impact sounds so heavy.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian recounted the incident, \"Let me tell you then\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Elder Zhang listened carefully. They hadn't expected him to be able to articulate everything so clearly.</p><br/><p>\"Don't you think it's very pitiful? Especially after hearing what the kid said\u2026 I can't take it. 'Dad, I don't know how to beg for food. What am I going to do? Tell me, what can I do about this\u2026'\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gently patted Fraud Tian on his shoulder and showed empathy. There were countless such instances in the world and sometimes you just had to think positively.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian held Lin Fan's hands and Lin Fan tried to move his hands away. But Fraud Tian held them extremely tightly. His eyes glimmered with hope. \"Why don't we help him?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that he couldn't shake him off. \"Fraud, you mean well but don't you realize that there's nothing we can help him with? Firstly, we aren't medically trained. Furthermore, even if we were, it's anemia. We would be helpless. Secondly, let's talk about money. It's not like we're broke but what can the money do? It could also cause something bad to happen\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \"I'm not talking about helping him with those things. I've seen these instances so many times over the past decades. I understand them. However, I just saw how pitiful the kid was and how sad his dad was. They probably don't have any confidence for the future. That's why I would like you to read their fortunes and enlighten that dad so that he'll find hope in living again. Although they're in a huge debt, life is always changing and I just want them to find hope again.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned, he looked at Fraud Tian and felt as though he didn't know him anymore.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian thought Lin Fan wasn't agreeable since he remained silent. \"Please help them just once. I won't be a busybody again in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not about being a busybody. It's just that you shocked me,\" Lin Fan said in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \"It's mainly about that child and the man. You can't just say the child is still young. That's wrong\u2026 The child is still suffering. I just feel that enlightening them would be the best way for us to help them. Since we were fated to meet, it'd be a waste not to help them when we can. In the future, when I think of this, I'd feel bad about myself. Nowadays, people are too cold and selfish.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned by what Fraud Tian said. He hadn't expected him to be so kind-hearted. Elder Zhang also looked at Fraud Tian differently. Then, he gave him a thumbs up and said, \"I feel that what Fraud Tian just said makes a lot of sense.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian just looked at Lin Fan and waited for him to say something.</p><br/><p>As long as he agreed, they'd leave immediately.</p><br/><p>He believed in Lin Fan's fortune-telling capabilities. Even if it was really a scam, it was still much better than the others. It would be easier to convince them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian and felt that he couldn't reject him. \"Alright, let's go have a look then.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was ecstatic. He pulled Lin Fan. \"Let's go there quickly. Some things can't be dragged on.\"</p><br/><p>It was a weird scene as the old man tried to drag a young man out of the shop.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang added, \"Let me join the both of you. This is a good deed. There is power in unity. The success rate would probably be higher.\"</p><br/><p>\"Fraud, it's okay for us to go but you gotta let go of my hands. How am I supposed to walk like that?\" Lin Fan said helplessly. It didn't look good on them to be pushing and pulling each other in broad daylight.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was extremely excited. He felt that as long as this fella decided to do something, things would definitely be resolved. He had that much confidence in Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian led them to the ward.</p><br/><p>The three of them stood at the entrance and looked inside. All they could see was the man's back view.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pulled Fraud Tian aside. \"Rest there and wait for me. I'll bring him there later.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and Elder Zhang nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked into the ward and stood by the bed. When he saw the woman on the bed, he realized that she was about to die.</p><br/><p>The man raised his head. \"Master Lin?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him, \"Xu De.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De was stunned. \"You know my name.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"Since you know who am I, you should know what I'm doing. Previously, you asked me how you were supposed to continue with your life. Today, I'll take a closer look at it. I just need some time and I wonder if you're free.\"</p><br/><p>Xu De remained silent and looked at the bedridden wife with his child embracing her. They were both in deep sleep. Then, he said, \"I have time.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's go to the resting area then. We can talk there,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He was feeling extremely lost and he didn't know what to do. When he had been there for the medical reviews, he had heard that there was a powerful fortune-teller along Cloud Street. Therefore, he decided to have a look.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin was there, he felt as if he had found someone to rant to.</p><br/><p>As they walked past a ward, Lin Fan stopped and Xu De stopped as well. He didn't know what Master Lin was up to.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since the first time they met each other, she had fallen beyond redemption. Still, she shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to help me, or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see when the time comes.\u201d Lin Fan turned into the male toilet conveniently.</p><br/><p>It was this stupid excuse again.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu hated such words as \u2018We\u2019ll see when the time comes\u2019. She didn\u2019t have much faith.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the toilet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fab chuckled. If she wanted to use him as a tool, she could keep on dreaming.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t the type who would just go along with anything. She didn\u2019t even have to think about it.</p><br/><p>After the meal, he paid and left. It was nearing the new year and Shanghai had become evidently quieter. On the last one or two days, it was hard to even see a care on the road.</p><br/><p>It was exceptionally cold and quiet.</p><br/><p>The laborers went home as well. All kinds of shops had basically stopped opening. Some of the locals went to visit relatives while others stayed at home and didn\u2019t go out at all.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, let\u2019s see my luck today. If I\u2019m still not able to buy it, I\u2019ll have to wait until next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, although I\u2019ve queued for several months, I\u2019ve only managed to buy it once. But this feels pretty good. I\u2019ve met quite a few acquaintances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so modest. Today is my birthday and I don\u2019t believe that I won\u2019t be able to buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The queue-ers drawing lots to buy the scallion pancakes was already a common thing. Anyone who lived in Shanghai would know that there was such a strange shop along Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the time of the year, as long as it was morning, the place would be packed with people. Just seeing it was frightening.</p><br/><p>Some people who had never eaten these scallion pancakes before would think that there was something wrong with these people. Weren\u2019t these just scallion pancakes? Was there a need to act this way?</p><br/><p>But anyone who had eaten it once would definitely never forget the deliciousness of that flavor. It was simply tormenting.</p><br/><p>Looking at these queuing townsfolk, Lin Fan gave a big wave of his hand. \u201cThank you, everyone, for your support for Cloud Street this past half a year. I, Lin Fan, am not someone who doesn\u2019t know how to repay favors. So, I\u2019ve decided to supply an unlimited amount of scallion pancakes today. I guarantee that everyone will get a hot and piping piece of scallion pancake today. But it\u2019s only for today. Tomorrow, I will be keeping my stall as well. I\u2019ll resume business when the New Year break is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The queuing townsfolk were startled. Then, they started crying out in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! I didn\u2019t hear wrong, did I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve almost been moved to tears. Little Boss, you don\u2019t need to say anymore. As long as you continue selling scallion pancakes in future, I\u2019ll queue for the rest of my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss really is a kind businessman. I\u2019m touched!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cSigh, although I\u2019ll be very tired, suffering a little for everyone to return home happily for the new year isn\u2019t too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, the townsfolk were all moved.</p><br/><p>What a great workload! Was there anyone more hardworking than him?</p><br/><p>Fraus Tian looked at Lin Fan and sighed helplessly, \u201cSigh. Indeed, after limiting the daily amount for so long, taking off the limit occasionally causes them to be filled with gratitude. This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were boiling with excitement. Some of them immediately called their friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss is supplying an unlimited number of scallion pancakes today. Hurry over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I\u2019m at the shopping centre buying new year goods!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you still buying for? If you miss today, you won\u2019t have another chance! It wouldn\u2019t be too late to buy in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. I\u2019m coming over now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that the number of people queueing was getting higher. It seemed that it would be impossible for him to finish working before the afternoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, go and buy me some ingredients.\u201d With just the amount of ingredients he had now, he would not be able to make more than a few servings.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was about to go but how could those townsfolk let Little Boss be troubled by this? They made a call to the old supplier and told him to hurry up and deliver the ingredients over.</p><br/><p>One by one, servings of scallion pancakes emerged from the wok.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk stood in their original spots, filled with delight as they tasted the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>No matter how many times they ate it, it would always be as delicious to the townsfolk.</p><br/><p>A young man, who was in a bad mood because his year-end bonus hadn\u2019t met his expectations, took a bite of the scallion pancake at this moment.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, that gloomy expression instantly vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>An unrestrained voice burst out from his mouth. If that exaggerated expression of his had been seen by others, he would have become a celebrity actor.</p><br/><p>However, the surrounding townsfolk didn\u2019t look at him strangely or with disdain.</p><br/><p>Because they knew that Little Boss\u2019s scallion pancakes really had a kind of demonic power, which could cause someone to let out such expressions uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>To that young man, all of his displeasure had dissipated. His eyes gleamed with hope and anticipation for the coming year. He would definitely work hard next year and achieve good results so that he would receive a satisfactory year-end bonus.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners had all left. Some of them were going to close their shops for the day.</p><br/><p>They stood at the entrance and looked at all those exaggerated expressions but they had already gotten used to it long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you guys think Little Boss makes these scallion pancakes? How come they have such demonic power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Enough talk. I\u2019m going to queue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore going home for the New Year, we get to eat Little Boss\u2019s scallion pancakes once more. My heart is satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He worked all the way until the afternoon. All the townsfolk had left and Lin Fan was lying on the chair, exhausted. His expression was that of a person who had lost all hope in life.</p><br/><p>It was really f*cking tiring. He also regretted that he had tried to act awesome. Wasn\u2019t he just finding trouble for himself?</p><br/><p>Looking at the drawer full of money, Lin Fan tidied it up a little.</p><br/><p>Over ten thousand dollars.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out for a while. You guys, wait for me,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was taken aback. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cGetting money to give you guys your wages. If you don\u2019t want it, then I shan\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, please go, boss.\u201d When Fraud Tian heard that they were going to get their wages, he was incomparably delighted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and didn\u2019t say much else.</p><br/><p>He went to get $240,000 from the bank</p><br/><p>He was going to pay them $60,000 each.</p><br/><p>Although Wu You Lan and her father were working for him for free, he couldn\u2019t just take advantage of them.</p><br/><p>Although this money wasn\u2019t much to Wu Tian He, who was secretly a wealthy man, wages still had to be given.</p><br/><p>Thinking about how his Internet relations person, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, would cut corners at work all the time, Lin Fan thought that even if he didn\u2019t contact him, he wouldn\u2019t know to contact Lin Fan either.</p><br/><p>For such an employee, Lin Fan felt that he would have to supervise and pressure him the next year.</p><br/><p>In the end, he deducted a little and sent Autumn Sword Fish Killer three packages, each with ten thousand dollars.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>A message came.</p><br/><p>A picture of someone picking up soap.</p><br/><p>A photo of someone licking another person\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live the boss. Boss, I\u2019ll give my all for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>From these words, you could tell how ecstatic Autumn Sword Fish Killer was. He hadn\u2019t expected that his boss would not forget him. His boss had even given him a large wage.</p><br/><p>This was an amount that he had never imagined he would earn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWork for me obediently next year.\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, don\u2019t worry, boss. I\u2019ll definitely give my all on the Internet next year and uphold justice for you, boss. I won\u2019t back down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan packed his things and prepared to go and fetch his parents at the airport.</p><br/><p>Their plane would reach at 10 am.</p><br/><p>Looking at the clock, it was about time, so Lin Fan started his car and drove towards the airport.</p></div>\n</div>"}

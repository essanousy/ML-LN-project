He even felt a little terrified. He had already used his full strength but the opposition was still matching him skillfully and easily. He felt as if he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan exchanged blows with Wu Yun for a while. He couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cYour foot technique is a little flawed. It seems short of the original ancient technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish are you spouting?\u201d Wu Yun cried out as he threw a kick. But very quickly, the kick was easily deflected by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that rubbish? After so much time has passed, it\u2019s difficult to avoid some degradation,\u201d said Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>Very soon, Wu Yun backed off. He took a deep breath to calm himself before placing his fist to his palm respectfully. He didn\u2019t feel ashamed. \u201cI concede defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re too courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun had many questions in his heart but after hesitating for a long while, he couldn\u2019t open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, of course, could see through that. He said with a smile, \u201cActually, if you are free, you can come and look for me tonight. We can exchange teachings once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I will definitely be there tonight.\u201d When Wu Yun heard that, he was delighted. His impression of Lin Fan instantly soared as well.</p><br/><p>During this match, his opponent hadn\u2019t used any strength at all and he hadn\u2019t gotten beaten down by his opponent. However, he knew that his opponent was only being considerate and letting him keep his pride.</p><br/><p>As for tonight, he wanted to plenish the Linqing Tantui that had been passed down and make it complete again. It was considered a great service to him.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun had a strong sense of loyalty and brotherhood. When someone did him a favor, he would return it tenfold.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you said I was embarrassing. Now you\u2019ve seen it. That guy is very strong.\u201d As Zheng Bin saw Wu Yun coming down the stage, he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Zheng Bin, be more courteous to President Lin. If I find out that you say bad things behind his back, I wouldn\u2019t mind having a spar with you,\u201d said Wu Yun sternly as he looked straight at Zheng Bin.</p><br/><p>When Zhen Bin saw Wu Yun\u2019s eyes, he was given a scare. Although he was strong too, he was no match for Wu Yun. Then, he turned away and didn\u2019t say more.</p><br/><p>However, he was still a little unyielding. Even so, he had no choice. He just wasn\u2019t as strong as the opposite party.</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong exclaimed in a surprised tone, \u201cI never thought that this young man was so powerful. His fist techniques and feet techniques have all reach the pinnacle. How did he train to become so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other old-timers shook their heads as well. They couldn\u2019t understand either.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, Brother Lin!\u201d Wu You Lan shouted from below. She seemed to be incomparably thrilled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s broadcast room had gotten very lively. Those Internet buddies of his were all spamming comments in a frenzy after seeing what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Master Lin is f*cking awesome. I really admire him. It\u2019s like there\u2019s nothing he doesn\u2019t know how to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough said. In order to thank Brother Yang for showing us such a spectacular broadcast, I\u2019m sending all of today\u2019s food money to Brother Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^That\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m sending my accommodation fees for tonight to Brother Yang. Enough said. I\u2019ll just have to go and endure the cold in the forest tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a true talent. Enough said. Sending a hundred rockets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those Internet buddies had never seen such a scene before. If Zhao Zhong Yang hadn\u2019t broadcasted it for them to see, they would never see it in their lifetimes.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned. \u201cAmazing. This kid is way too amazing. I didn\u2019t think that he would even know Lanqing Tantui. When I was young, my father told me that this Tantui is the most difficult technique to go against. It involves thirty percent fist strikes and seventy percent footstrikes. It\u2019s versatile and unpredictable, fierce and imposing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was completely convinced now. In the past, he had always thought that this kid was only good at Ba Gua Zhang. But now, it seemed that that was hardly the case. Even his Tantui was so incredible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood on stage as he pondered about something.</p><br/><p>The Martial Arts Association was a recognized organization on the surface level. However, these martial arts inheritors, who had passed down their martial arts through generations, still looked down on the association.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt as if he should do something. He had to change the current situation.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan placed his fist to his palm respectfully and faced everyone. \u201cI am Lin Fan, Vice-President of the Shanghai association. Today, I\u2019ve come to Kunlun mountain to meet all you brave men. It is a huge honor. My humble self has practiced martial arts for some time and become proficient at various Chinese martial arts. If any schools are lacking anything, you may come on stage and I can help to plenish your knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, everyone on site was stunned.</p><br/><p>Even Fraud Tian was completely dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, has the kid gone mad? His bragging is going overboard. There have been so many Chinese martial arts passed down until now, at least hundreds of them. He actually said that he can plenish their knowledge. This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to believe it. Anyone with a normal brain wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>The several old-timers on the viewing platform started discussing as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis President Lin has let his pride get the better of him. There are a plethora of martial art schools. They can\u2019t all be learned by one person \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Sigh. Forget it, forget it. Since he has true abilities, let\u2019s just let him be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong shook his head and didn\u2019t say anything about this. It was too surreal.</p><br/><p>The people below the stage exchanged looks with one another. They had all been stunned by those words. If this President Lin had said that he was proficient in a few styles of martial arts, they would have believed him. After all, he had already exhibited two different techniques and he could be said to be a genius.</p><br/><p>But he had actually said that he was proficient in all schools of martial arts. This was hard to believe.</p><br/><p>Even if the Sun were to rise from the West, they would not believe this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe knows no boundaries to his boasting. He has really forgotten himself.\u201d Zheng Bin laughed mockingly after hearing those words.</p><br/><p>When the rest heard what Zheng Bin said, they nodded as well but didn\u2019t say much. After all, he had already spoken. What else could they say?</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie looked at Jiang Fei. \u201cHas President Lin gone a little too far? This isn\u2019t good, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei was at a loss for words. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. President Lin said it himself. I have no idea what\u2019s going on either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room had lost their minds.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is Master Lin trying to defy nature? It\u2019s like he wants to become the god of martial arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I don\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, get Brother Lin to perform. If it\u2019s true, I\u2019ll sell my house and give you the money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s wide eyes were fixed on Brother Lin. His Internet buddies weren\u2019t the only ones in disbelief. Even he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation on site. <em>Why did it suddenly become quiet? At least give me some applause or some whistling. If there\u2019s no noise, it\u2019s a little awkward.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like everyone doesn\u2019t believe me. But it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s still early, so let me give everyone an exhibition. Although there are many different schools of Chinese martial arts, we have enough time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBa Gua Zhang!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan stood in the arena and started making moves. His first display was Ba Gua Zhang. 64 palm strikes, flowing like water without a single pause.</p><br/><p>The people in the audience watched with their eyes and mouths gaping.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan changed styles.</p><br/><p>Someone below cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Xingyi\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

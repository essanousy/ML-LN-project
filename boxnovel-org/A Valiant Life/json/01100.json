There were occasional sounds but those were just sounds of breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Erlang Fist.\u201d</p><br/><p>When a man saw Master Lin performing in the arena, he couldn\u2019t help but gasp in shock. He was an inheritor of Erlang Fist. But as he watched the display, he suddenly realized that the technique he had learned all along was like sh*t compared to this person in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Six Stars Fist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another man cried out in astonishment. He realized that the Six Stars Fist that he knew was very different from the one being displayed in the arena. It was as if what he had been doing was child\u2019s play. And what was being displayed was the true Six Stars Fist.</p><br/><p>*Rumble!*</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud sound rang out. It was like the boom of thunder but also like a tiger\u2019s roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s coming from the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this sound, they started searching for its source. When they realized that it was coming from the arena, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be the Tiger Leopard Thunder sound, could it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. That\u2019s only a legend. Even if it\u2019s real, according to the records, only the one performing the technique would be able to hear it. How could it possibly be transmitted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what the f*ck is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the arena, Lin Fan felt that all his different martial arts had already been mastered completely. To others, these styles would seem like a single entity without any difference at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our Yumen Fist.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man in the audience stood up and his jaw dropped as he stared blankly at the scene. He had never thought that he would really see the Yumen Fist. This was the technique that they had been passed down.</p><br/><p>At that moment, looking at the performance in the arena, he suddenly realized that there wasn\u2019t just a small gap between his skills and that person\u2019s skills. It was a large and distinct gap.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian just stood there, completely dumbfounded. His hands had even started trembling. He didn\u2019t dare to believe that someone had really mastered all the different Chinese martial arts.</p><br/><p>Until now, he had seen plainly that this kid had already displayed 35 styles of Chinese martial arts. And the kid was at the peak of each of those martial arts, reaching heights that ordinary people could never reach.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be? How can the world be so evil?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian mumbled to himself.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei and the rest were semi-professionals. But compared to the real professionals, they were still unsure about many things. Even so, they had been stunned by this scene.</p><br/><p>Because, to them, this was shocking. He was too strong. He was really too strong.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God! I\u2019ve been stunned for ten whole minutes and I only just regained my senses. Is this made using special effects?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too 6. His movements are like water. The appeal is way too strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Even someone like me who doesn\u2019t understand martial arts feels that this motherf*cker is too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the guy who said that he would sell his house still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is trying to defy nature. Up until now, I\u2019ve lost count of how many different martial arts styles he has shown. But each moment has given me a huge shock. It\u2019s simply difficult to turn my eyes away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy phone was discovered by my teacher just now and he wanted to confiscate my phone. But now, he\u2019s by my side, watching the broadcast with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really too awesome. Brother Yang, why aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Bin was looking at the scene in astonishment. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to believe it but it was simply too hard to believe. <em>Is he still human?</em></p><br/><p>He had exchanged blows with the opposite party previously and been pushed off the stage mysteriously. He had been unyielding at first but now, he had really submitted.</p><br/><p>They were simply not on the same level.</p><br/><p>Wulang Fist!</p><br/><p>Damo Eighteen Hands!</p><br/><p>Zilong Cannon Fist!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Even some of the techniques which had stopped being passed down were being displayed one by one. The audience didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>An hour passed.</p><br/><p>Two hours passed.</p><br/><p>Three hours passed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s speed kept on increasing. If he kept on going slowly, who knew how long he would take?</p><br/><p>At that moment, when the final martial art style had been exhibited, Lin Fan raised one of his feet before slowly placing it down again.</p><br/><p>A rumbling sound rang out. It was as if all the energy in his body was dissipated through his foot. There were even some cracks on the arena floor.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan hadn\u2019t controlled his strength, the arena would have disintegrated into dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Lin Fan dusted off his hands. There wasn\u2019t even a drop of sweat on his forehead.</p><br/><p>*Thud!*</p><br/><p>Those old-timers who had been sitting on the viewing platform fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>They were elders. Initially, they had sat there to see their juniors perform. But now, they had been scared stiff. They couldn\u2019t even speak.</p><br/><p>To them, this person in front of them was not human.</p><br/><p>Three hours. It had been three whole hours.</p><br/><p>They had watched for three hours and been shocked for three hours. Their hearts almost couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>Compared to this young man, they suddenly realized that, besides their age, they had nothing at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve displayed my incompetence,\u201d said Lin Fan as he bowed respectfully. Then, he went off the stage. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh oh!\u201d Fraud Tian nodded. He was completely stiff and didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Fei and the rest wiped the sweat off their foreheads as they followed behind Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The group of them left.</p><br/><p>The place remained silent. Everyone was deep in shock.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A series of voices broke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Was that real? That was a true master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI counted a total of 185 styles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could there be so many? I thought it was only 129.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that there were several tens of styles that we don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a great master. A true master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was just here a while ago. D*mn. The master has left. Quick, let\u2019s go and find the master. I\u2019ve always thought that my technique wasn\u2019t quite right. It turns out that it wasn\u2019t complete. The master said that we can look for him if we need to. He\u2019d help us to complete our techniques.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong, who was on the viewing platform, was astounded. He was already so old and he had experienced all kinds of things. However, he could say surely that he had never seen anything like this before.</p><br/><p>Terrifying. Simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>On the way down the mountain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very calm. Wu You Lan, who was by his side, leaned on Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019re really too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just alright,\u201d said Lin Fan indifferently.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan and said in disbelief, \u201cYou really know everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud. \u201cDidn\u2019t I just exhibit it? I actually know a bit of everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pfft*</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nearly puked out blood. He suddenly realized that there was such a huge gap between them. They couldn\u2019t be compared at all.</p><br/><p>The people from the association were now looking at President Lin with worshipping eyes. They hadn\u2019t expected that everything President Lin had said was true.</p><br/><p>He really knew all the different Chinese martial arts\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

She at the pinnacle of the music circle and commanded the respect of all the people who were under her. She had the power to make and break careers.</p><br/><p>However, a huge problem had just cropped up.</p><br/><p>What would people say when they mentioned her name in the future?</p><br/><p>\u2018Ying Jing? That person who got slapped on the street by Master Lin?\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking at her current situation, Ying Jing realized that she was done for, especially now. She had forgotten that she was a huge celebrity, or that the press called her a music legend.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you down with me,\u201d she hissed, her nails swiping at Lin Fan, completely unlike the demeanor of a huge celebrity.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off,\u201d Lin Fan said, pushing her away, causing her to fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>The people who were eating with Ying Jing were all dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The vice-president of the broadcasting network was especially shocked. He couldn\u2019t figure out why Master Lin was this violent against Ying Jing. They were all public figures and this would definitely affect both their reputations.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing wasn\u2019t just any ordinary person. She was well known and her influence was great. She had many supporters and most people would have given her some face.</p><br/><p>Although Ying Jing couldn\u2019t do much to Lin Fan, she still had a considerable influence on Lin Fan\u2019s friend, Wu Huan Yue. Did she really not want to have her career anymore?</p><br/><p>The rest of the people didn\u2019t dare to say anything, not wanting to offend anyone. Angering both parties would have had bad consequences.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stood at one corner, his gaze fixed on Ying Jing, her body trembling with fear and trepidation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned to look at Wu Huan Yue, \u201cHuan Yue, you must remember- you must never bully anyone that is weaker or kinder than you. If anyone chooses to offend you or attack you, you must be courageous and determined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stood there stunned. Lin Fan\u2019s words had a great impact on her as if it was speaking to her innermost being. Thereafter Wu Huan Yue mustered her courage and rushed up to Ying Jing, and with her left hand delivered a huge slap to her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you are a senior, you shouldn\u2019t expect people to just respect you if you never earned it. I\u2019m returning the slap you gave to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>An uproar!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, that pretty lady there is Wu Huan Yue, a newcomer to the music scene. She had come up with quite a lot of good songs, but damn, I never thought she would have the guts to hit Ying Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear what she said just now? It seems that this Ying Jing hit her before, and now she\u2019s returning the favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just too sensational!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who had been eating with Ying Jing all looked at Wu Huan Yue in a daze. They never thought that this little rising star in the music scene dared to hit her, this\u2026 this\u2026</p><br/><p>If it were any other smaller music celebrities, they would have never done this in a million years.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief. It looked like this tactic was rather effective, making Wu Huan Yue a lot braver and courageous.</p><br/><p>In order to thrive in the music industry, one needed to have a strong will.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, it was easy to get bullied.</p><br/><p>In life, fewer words would be better if you could take action against injustices.</p><br/><p>Action and not words were needed to iron things out.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue couldn\u2019t believe that she had really done it. Thereafter, she turned to Lin Fan, \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s anger had already subsided. He patted Wu Huan Yue on the head, \u201cEh, that wasn\u2019t too bad. You were brave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thereafter, he turned his gaze to Ying Jing, \u201cDon\u2019t think that just because you have a longer career than others means you can just bully them like that. Make sure you remember your lesson today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jing sat on the floor, her hair a mess, her body covered in food. She bolted out and wanted to get back at Lin Fan, but the vice-president of the broadcasting network and the rest of the people restrained her, preventing Ying Jing from doing anything rash.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, all stop,\u201d the vice-president said. After pondering the situation, he figured that controlling the situation would be the best course of action. If more people knew about this case, it would be too hard to control.</p><br/><p>At this same time, he knew that this problem had already gotten quite big already.</p><br/><p>Just wait for the headlines tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The best option now was to wait for Ying Jing to cool down and stop her from doing something that she would probably regret the next day.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of me,\u201d Ying Jing struggled to break free, but she was blocked by a few of the big shots that she had been eating with, and it was impossible for her to break free. Thereafter, she was dragged off to a car as they left the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, let\u2019s go. This was a perfect dinner, now let\u2019s go and watch a movie,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>After all that happened, Lin Fan still had the mood to bring Wu Huan Yue for a movie. It goes without saying that Lin Fan had a huge heart.</p><br/><p>Although Wu Huan Yue had been shaken a little, realizing that this was probably the craziest thing that she had done, she was not about to let her first date with Lin Fan end like that. Hence, she nodded her head, \u201cMm.\u201d</p><br/><p>They left the scene calmly.</p><br/><p>As if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>However, this was sensational news for the public.</p><br/><p>In their friend circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jing just got slapped on the streets. The first-hand video, quick let\u2019s watch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the people of Weixin all started sharing the video. At first, they looked at the video in unbelief, thinking that it was just a stunt. After analyzing the video more, they realized that it had actually happened for real.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Twelve o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>The movie that Lin Fan and Wu Huan Yue watched was the last screening for it, and it was a romance film. For Lin Fan, the show was just plain insipid and boring, and he almost fell asleep.</p><br/><p>For Wu Huan Yue on the other hand, she had a great time watching it.</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cGet some rest, and don\u2019t think about it too much. If there is any problem I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was pinching her clothes, and her heart was racing. She had been holding back for too long so much so that her cheeks were blushing. With all her courage she asked, \u201cBrother Lin, do you want to come up for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting a little late and I should probably be heading back. Don\u2019t just think of giving your heart to me just because of what happened today. Take it slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what Lin Fan had said, her cheeks turned into an even brighter shade of red, \u201cBrother Lin, you are thinking too much, I just wanted to spend more time, with you that\u2019s all. Nothing else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, not that. But I won\u2019t go up. I better go back to sleep,\u201d Lin Fan said. He looked at Wu Huan Yue\u2019s blushing face, not wanting to tease her anymore, \u201cGo back and get a good rest, you\u2019ll need it for tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t an idiot; if he really went up, he wouldn\u2019t be leaving tonight, and things not suited for children might even happen.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, he never really planned for this to happen.</p><br/><p>Maybe because he was thinking about Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>If something really happened between him and Wu Huan Yue, he could be considered scum, since he couldn\u2019t be having an affair.</p><br/><p>If he said he didn\u2019t have any feelings for Wu You Lan, he would be lying, but\u2026</p><br/><p>Forget it, forget it. Don\u2019t think too much about it. Maybe next time.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue realized that Brother Lin\u2019s expression changed a little. She feared that she probably guessed what was on his mind, but she didn\u2019t point it out.</p><br/><p>It was mostly because she didn\u2019t want to find out about it, especially since it hasn\u2019t reached a mature stage yet.</p><br/><p>However, she silently swore to herself that she had to make Brother Lin like her, unlike what was happening right now.</p><br/><p>Smack!</p><br/><p>Just was Lin Fan was deep in thought, a warm sensation radiated from his cheek.</p><br/><p>He never thought that Wu Huan Yue would do a sneak attack on him like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, be careful. I\u2019m going to go up now,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said, getting down from the car, her face still blushing. She turned around and leaned forward, waving goodbye again.</p><br/><p>And in that action of leaning forward, the collar of her dress gravitated downwards, casing Lin Fan to see something that he shouldn\u2019t have seen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling a little helpless, \u201cAnd you should probably throw that dress away too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue giggled, thereafter turning back as she galloped up the steps.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan left peacefully after he saw the light from her apartment turn on.</p><br/><p>He never thought that Wang Ming Yang\u2019s company residence was that nice. It looked like he had to bewail to Wang Ming Yang and get an apartment there for himself too.</p><br/><p>Upstairs, Wu Huan Yue stood on the porch, looking at the car as it faded into the distance</p><br/><p>She clenched her fist.</p><br/><p>Keep on trying! Keep on trying!</p><br/><p>Brother Lin will surely surrender to me after I become a huge music star!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although they were holding their chopsticks, they didn\u2019t move at all. Even if they took some vegetables, they just put them in their bowls.</p><br/><p>Their gazes occasionally shifted to Chen He, who was lying on the ground.</p><br/><p>He looked simply miserable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chen He as he sat down, waiting for Wang Ming Yang to arrive. When everyone saw that Master Lin didn\u2019t speak, they didn\u2019t speak either. Some people wanted to call the police but they decided against it. Since this wasn\u2019t their problem, they decided not to find trouble for themselves.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stomped inside in a rage. When he opened the door, he bellowed, \u201cWhich f*cker hit my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the industry had known long ago that Xu Zi Le was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s girlfriend.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang.\u201d When Xu Zi Le saw Wang Ming Yang, the injustice in her heart burst out.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang saw his wife\u2019s cheeks all red and with finger marks on them, he was furious. He rubbed her cheeks and asked, \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, his eyes turned cold. \u201cI\u2019ll f*cking kill that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le shook her head, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. Brother Lin stood up for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Yang, come here. This is the guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang told Xu Zi Le to stand at the side and watch. Then, he went forward and patted Lin Fan on the shoulder. \u201cThank you for this, Brother.\u201d Then, when he saw who was on the ground, he was taken aback. \u201cChen He.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He had his teeth clenched in pain. He raised his head and looked menacingly at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cWang Ming Yang, you dare to let someone hit me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mother.\u201d Wang Ming Yang raised his leg and stomped on Chen He\u2019s face. \u201cYou dared to hit my wife. Do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the opposition was a big shot, he wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><br/><p>At most, he wouldn\u2019t go to the North anymore.</p><br/><p>If his wife had been bullied and he just let it be, he wouldn\u2019t be a man.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Yang, you finish him off. I\u2019ll take care of things after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded, \u201cMmm.\u201d Then, he saw Chen He\u2019s left arm and was slightly startled. This Brother of his was really brutal.</p><br/><p>Chen He had never expected himself to be beaten up so cruelly. With his status, how could anyone bully him? But now, he was being beaten and he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He yelled. Right now, only the police could save him. As long as he managed to leave this place, he would definitely have his revenge on these two.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cBeat him up until you\u2019re about done, then I\u2019ll heal him up a little. After that, keep on beating him up. Give him something to remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cMmm, understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd. \u201cYou guys, carry on eating. No need to care about us. This has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Dao, who was sitting there, was dripping with sweat. He knew that this situation was f*cked up.</p><br/><p>Chen He was an investor for their television show. Now that the show had been finalized, Chen He came to Shanghai and, unexpectedly, took a ferocious beating. He had been beaten so much that he had started to doubt his life.</p><br/><p>Director Jin knew that he would never be able to work with Chen He again. However, this television show would not be affected.</p><br/><p>Chen He had invested so much money into it. If he shut down the show, all his invested money would have gone to waste.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The banquet was going on as per normal but Chen He\u2019s screams unceasingly rang out. The screams were blood-curdling and it made everyone\u2019s hearts tremble as they were filled with fear.</p><br/><p>How could they still carry on eating? They would have to have really big hearts to be able to keep eating.</p><br/><p>Xue Er said, \u201cSister Xu, will there really not be any problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le shook her head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as those to brothers are here, nothing will go wrong. At least in Shanghai, there won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chen He. They had already started this feud, so Lin Fan had to make him submit. He had to instill a sense of respect and fear of Shanghai into Chen He, so that Chen He would never dare to take a single step into Shanghai ever again.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The waiters of Dongyue Entertainment Hotel knew that there was something going on inside, so they went to report it.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu looked at the performance data and nodded contently. Since the opening of the hotel until now, their income had been pretty good. Although it still couldn\u2019t match up to her previous place, it was at least a very good start. And over here, everything was her own. She no longer had to live under the banner of the Liu family.</p><br/><p>*knock knock*</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Liu Xu put down her work.</p><br/><p>The waiter came in and said, \u201cChief Liu, it\u2019s bad. There\u2019s a fight that broke out in the banquet hall with the television programme production crew. That Chief Chen who shook hands with you just now is getting beaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu frowned. This Chief Chen was a big shot up in Northern China and he was a very capable man. She had purposely gotten to know him because she hoped that when her business expands to Northern China, there would be someone to watch over it. Now that she heard that Chief Chen was getting beaten, she was a little displeased.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go take a look,\u201d said Liu Xu.</p><br/><p>No matter who was beating him up, as long as it was in her hotel, she had to stop it. This was where she ran her business, how could she let there be trouble in here?</p><br/><p>The employees nodded respectfully. In their eyes, Chief Liu was a strong woman. Her working style was firm and she was even more capable than most men. For her to be able to put up such a strong front, the employees were all very convinced of her abilities.</p><br/><p>At the entrance, they could hear the screams that sounded like pigs being slaughtered.</p><br/><p>*creak*</p><br/><p>They opened the door and entered.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu exclaimed, \u201cEveryone, please stop\u2026\u201d But before she finished her sentence, she realized that a man had turned around and was looking at her. And that man was familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor Lin\u2026\u201d Liu Xu couldn\u2019t quite understand the situation. This was the production crew\u2019s finalization banquet. Why was this guy here?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Chief Liu? My Brother and I are just here teaching this man a lesson. Could it be that we\u2019ve disturbed you, Chief Liu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu waved his hand, gesturing for the security to leave. \u201cGodly Doctor Lin, why do I feel as if there is something bad every time I meet you? I run my business here but here you are, beating someone up. If news of this spreads, it\u2019ll affect my business negatively.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles. \u201cThen are you going to let me teach this man a lesson on your territory or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at this guy\u2019s smile, Liu Xu was very displeased. But this man that they were beating was Chief Chen, so she had to say something to mediate the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Chief Chen, could you stop hitting him? Or, why don\u2019t you resolve your conflict outside? Doing this in my hotel isn\u2019t too good,\u201d said Liu Xu.</p><br/><p>She felt that her relationship with Lin Fan was rather strange.</p><br/><p>Friends? Not really.</p><br/><p>Enemies? Nope.</p><br/><p>Either way, she just didn\u2019t like him very much but nor did she hate him. She just liked seeing him lose out.</p><br/><p>But she wasn\u2019t stupid. Although she hadn\u2019t known Lin Fan for very long, she knew that he was very protective. For him to hit Chen He, it seemed that Chen He must have done something wrong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI shan\u2019t call you Chief Liu. Liu Xu, will you lend us your place to teach this man a lesson or not? If you refuse, then forget it. We\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu squinted her eyes and made a frustrated expression. Then, she waved her hand. \u201cDo as you please. I don\u2019t understand you. Why must you teach him a lesson in my hotel? I shan\u2019t care about this but my hotel just opened, don\u2019t kill anyone in my hotel. I don\u2019t want to have to close down my hotel after just opening it a while ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu took a glance at Chen He and couldn\u2019t help but tremble. It was f*cking cruel. She decided that it was better to quickly leave.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, are we just not going to care?\u201d asked a waiter.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t talk so much and don\u2019t be so nosy. Do whatever you should be doing. You didn\u2019t see anything. You didn\u2019t hear anything. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

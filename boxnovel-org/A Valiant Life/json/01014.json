He had always followed Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. Especially when he saw Master Lin do good deeds, he would feel very happy.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin was met with trouble, he had to do all he could to help.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I saw everything that happened. This is place is under surveillance too. The insurance company will help us,\u201d said the traffic policeman.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. He wasn\u2019t bothered by the collision.</p><br/><p>However, he looked over to Huang Zhen and said in a displeased tone, \u201cWhy are your words so unpleasant? You said previously that she would have deserved it if you ran over her. How can you think of something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Zhen retorted, \u201cHow I think has nothing to do with you. Now that you\u2019ve damaged my car, you have to fix it. Although you\u2019re Master Lin, you can\u2019t just act as if nothing happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t ever run from my responsibilities. I will definitely get your car repaired. But I want to ask you this. If you really ran over her, what would you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Master Lin\u2019s gaze, Huang Zhen wanted to avoid it. \u201cI didn\u2019t even run over her, how would I know?\u201d Then, a rush of confidence filled his heart. \u201cStop talking about all this nonsense. Now that you\u2019ve damaged my car, you have to pay for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the adult came over with his daughter. \u201cThis was caused by my daughter. I will pay for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been standing at the side, struggling in his mind. Master Lin had driven into that person\u2019s car in order to save his daughter. Now that his daughter was fine, he couldn\u2019t just leave like that.</p><br/><p>Although he really didn\u2019t have much money to repay the man, he would have to bear the responsibility bravely even if he would have to sell his house.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Huang Zhen burst out laughing when he heard this. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay me? What will you repay me with? Now that he is helping you to pay, this has nothing to do with you anymore. Don\u2019t get involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>The traffic policeman was very displeased. \u201cYoungster, your words are way too reckless. What\u2019s wrong with him bravely taking responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Zhen looked at the traffic policeman and laughed in his heart as well. He waved his hand and said, \u201cI won\u2019t waste my time talking to you guys. My only request now is for my car to be fixed.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan said something in an icy cold tone, \u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s car was not cheap. And it was a local car plate too. It seemed that he was a Shanghai local.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Huang Zhen looked at Lin Fan with an alert look, wondering what this person wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I just want to see if I know him. If I know him, it would be good to break off connections with your father. After all, like father, like son. Your way of speech is so vile, your dad is probably the same,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Huang Zhen was furious upon hearing that. He felt that this Master Lin was really despicable, to insult him so plainly. Then, he laughed coldly and said, \u201cAlright. My father is Huang Yang Shan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis name is quite familiar. I think I know him.\u201d Lin Fan thought about it for a moment. It was quite familiar. Then, he took out his phone and looked through his chat history.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said that very calmly. Then, he made a call to that number. Once the number was dialed, the call was answered. It was as if that person had been waiting by his phone.</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan spoke, Huang Yang Shan\u2019s voice came through.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as if he hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to spontaneously call him and it had made him very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Huang, my car collided with your son\u2019s car. I will definitely pay what I am supposed to pay. However, I want to ask you how you raised your child. Why does he feel that running over and killing someone is a very normal thing\u2026?\u201d Lin Fan explained the situation very calmly as he held the phone in his hand.</p><br/><p>The place was suddenly filled with silence.</p><br/><p>Huang Zhen looked at Lin Fan as his heart started racing. He felt that things weren\u2019t looking good.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the traffic policeman and the child\u2019s father didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Around them, more traffic police officers came and started to direct the traffic.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lin Fan hung up the call and placed the phone back into his pocket.</p><br/><p>Huang Zhen had strange feelings in his heart. Then, his heart shifted. \u201cForget about it. You\u2019re good. I admit defeat. I\u2019ll repair my own car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Your dad will be here soon. I will definitely pay for your car. I damaged it so I\u2019ll definitely repay you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Zhen said, \u201cWhat do you mean? If you want to pay, then just pay. Why did you call my dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI know your dad. Seeing you like this, I had to tell your dad about it. Just now, your dad said over the phone to tell you not to move. He\u2019s coming right now to whip you. If you go, he\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that.</p><br/><p>The traffic policeman was dumbfounded. It was as if he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>Master Lin had damaged this youngster\u2019s car and promised to fix it. But now, he had called the youngster\u2019s father over to take care of the youngster.</p><br/><p>It was a little messy. This relationship was a little messy.</p><br/><p>When Huang Zhen heard that, he started to become fearful. His throat started to twitch. It was as if he hadn\u2019t expected things to develop to such a state. Also, he was in disbelief as he couldn\u2019t believe how well connected Lin Fan was.</p><br/><p><em>How could he know my own dad?</em></p><br/><p><em>And judging by what he said, my own dad is standing on his side.</em></p><br/><p>Very quickly, twenty minutes passed.</p><br/><p>A car came over and Huang Yang Shan got off the car. When he saw Lin Fan, he gave a warm smile and hurried forward to shake Lin Fan\u2019s hand. \u201cHello, Master Lin, hello.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yang Shan realized that Master Lin was not warm towards him. He remembered that the first time they met, Master Lin had been very warm towards him.</p><br/><p><em>Then, his heart sank. This d*mned brat.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2026\u201d Huang Zhen went forward and started speaking in a weak voice. But before he could finish, he was slapped in the face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou d*mned brat. What did you say? You said that if you run over someone, that person deserves it? Is that what I taught you?\u201d Huang Yang Shan pointed as his unbridled son and scolded.</p><br/><p>Then. He took out the belt from his pants and said ferociously, \u201cLet\u2019s see if I\u2019ll whip you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Huang Zhen saw this, his spirit left his body as he quickly cowered backward. \u201cDad, don\u2019t hit me. This is in public. Give me some face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! It hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Huang Zhen kept running around the car while Huang Yang Shan kept chasing him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan folded his arms as he stood there, enjoying this chase.</p><br/><p>Some of the car drivers who passed by saw this and were dumbfounded. They wondered what was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said to the little girl who was in her father\u2019s embrace, \u201cSee that? If you don\u2019t listen to your father in the future, you\u2019ll be taught a lesson like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>That little girl looked at the situation and was a little frightened. Then, she nodded and said childishly, \u201cI am very obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Huang Yang Shan came over panting and said apologetically, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve let you see a joke. It was because I didn\u2019t teach him well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhen I saw your son, I thought that you were also such a person, Chief Huang. But it seems now that it was just a lack of education.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yang Shan was very embarrassed. He could only smile accommodatingly. Then, he looked at that son who had been beaten into submission and scolded, \u201cHurry up and drive your d*mned car away. Are you leaving it here for people to see? Let\u2019s see how I\u2019ll deal with you later. You\u2019ve really become lawless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Zhen didn\u2019t want to say anything else. He had been completely humiliated and he was afraid of getting beaten even more. Then, he hurriedly went into his damaged car and drove away quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go yet. I haven\u2019t even paid the repair fees,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>When Huang Yang Shan heard that, he said hurriedly, \u201cMaster Lin, what are you talking about? This kid of mine is foolish. You saved a life and you did the right thing. Let me repair your car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. The matter has been settled. I will take care of my own car. Sorry for making you come all the way here, Chief Huang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d, said Huang Yang Shan hurriedly.</p><br/><p>The traffic policeman saw this scene and was in admiration. Master Lin was really amazing.</p><br/><p>He had to respect him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

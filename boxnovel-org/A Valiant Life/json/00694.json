Obviously, he knew what they were thinking but the situation was a little complicated.</p><br/><p>Sigh!</p><br/><p>He heaved a sigh and he didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore.</p><br/><p>It was just him being selfish.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the kitchen, Wu You Lan was washing the dishes while Wu Huan Yue was in the toilet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, you seem to have something on your mind today. What is it?\u201d Lin Fan asked. He didn\u2019t really notice anything but when they had been eating, he realized that You Lan looked a little sad when he asked Wu Huan Yue about her career.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Wu You Lan replied and continued washing the dishes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou must be hiding the truth, do you think your Brother Lin is blind? You have it written all over your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cReally? That can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cQuick, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan thought about it for a moment and said, \u201cBrother Lin, didn\u2019t you say that women with successful careers are more attractive? Huan Yue has a successful career but I am just working in the shop and not contributing anything much. Therefore, I thought that I should go out and make a living. If not, I would lose out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He hadn\u2019t expected Wu You Lan to be thinking about that. Then, he smiled, \u201cWhy do you think of it that way? Furthermore, how could you be contributing nothing? The work in the shop is your career.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I contributing?\u201d Wu You Lan didn\u2019t want to hide anything from Lin Fan since he asked her about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be contributing nothing?\u201d Lin Fan gently touched Wu You Lan\u2019s head. \u201cIf you were to get another job, who is going to massage me in the future? Who is going to serve the customers tea? Therefore, your current work is your career. Of course, if you want to work outside, it\u2019s not impossible. I\u2019d just be sad and I\u2019d ask someone else to replace you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Wu You Lan immediately replied. Then, she clenched her fists, \u201cThis is my job. Nobody else can take it from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and gently patted Wu You Lan\u2019s head. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s good then. Therefore, don\u2019t think of it this way next time. If you are to leave, my life would be so dull and boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan lowered her head and blushed, \u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely do my job well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best. I have high expectations for you,\u201d Lin Fan held her hand and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Wu You Lan nodded.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected You Lan to be thinking of that. Could it be that she felt pressured as Wu Huan Yue was doing well as a celebrity?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that it was probably the case.</p><br/><p>Then, Wu Huan Yue stood at the entrance of the kitchen and asked sneakily, \u201cWhat secrets are you sharing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHow could there be any secrets? We\u2019re almost done with the cleaning. I\u2019ll send you back home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue replied, \u201cBrother Lin, I don\u2019t have anywhere to go. Can I stay at your house? Anyway, there are two rooms here. I can sleep in one while you send You Lan back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was furious after hearing that. How could Huan Yue stay there? If the lights were to go out and Huan Yue was to take the initiative, Brother Lin wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the temptation. Things would definitely go out of hand if a male and female were to stay in the same room.</p><br/><p>Then, Wu You Lan only had one thing on her mind. She wanted to stay too.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back too then. Huan Yue doesn\u2019t come here often. I will accompany her tonight,\u201d Wu You Lan held Lin Fan\u2019s arms and said coquettishly, \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thinking about what was going on and he felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw their eyes, he nodded, \u201cAlright, it\u2019s late anyway. The two of you can share a room then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin is awesome.\u201d Wu You Lan kissed Lin Fan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>That\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan touched his face. It was a little overboard. Although it felt great, there was someone around.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was furious. She hadn\u2019t expected to be slower than You Lan.</p><br/><p>In the darkness of the night.</p><br/><p>On a random grass patch.</p><br/><p>A mysterious silhouette.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve finally caught it. Wu Huan Yue, you\u2019re so famous now. I followed you here from another country and I finally got what I wanted,\u201d a man said. There was a camera strap hanging around his neck.</p><br/><p>He was a crazy paparazzi. He was pretty famous in the country and he reported a lot of news about several celebrities.</p><br/><p>When he was reporting about a celebrity having an affair, he also noticed Wu Huan Yue, the new face of the music industry.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street, he had already taken a picture of Wu Huan Yue with a man. They were behaving quite intimately. He knew that something was wrong when he looked at them. Hence, he followed them and realized that Wu Huan Yue and another lady were staying at the man\u2019s house. He was so excited that he almost fainted.</p><br/><p>Could they be having a three-way relationship? The new and popular singer was sharing an apartment with a beautiful lady and another man. This piece of news was going to create an uproar.</p><br/><p>He was especially excited when he saw who the man was. It was actually Master Lin.</p><br/><p>One of the most famous people on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Dai Jun Ming\u2019s hands were trembling as he held onto the camera. Although the night was pretty cold, he wasn\u2019t bothered by it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was staying in his room and playing with his phone. Then, Wu You Lan opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cBrother Lin, I didn\u2019t bring any pajamas. Can I borrow a shirt from you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019ll get a new one for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan wasn\u2019t as tall as Huan Yue. She was around 1.65m while Wu Huan Yue was about 1.73m.</p><br/><p>Although there was a difference in their heights, their figures were perfect.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was prepared to shower after they entered their room. After all, he never had a lady stay over at his house before.</p><br/><p>There was the sound of water trickling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had a good sense of hearing. He knew that someone was showering.</p><br/><p>After a moment, Wu You Lan\u2019s voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t come here. I\u2019m only wearing your shirt.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Lin Fan\u2019s throat trembled. D*mn, You Lan was definitely trying to seduce him.</p><br/><p>He had to stay calm.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was staring intently at everything that was happening. She didn\u2019t expect Wu You Lan to be so open about it. Especially when she said that she was only \u2018wearing his shirt\u2019, her killing intent was bursting out.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t lose to her at all.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue decided to give it her best shot and she went out of the room.</p><br/><p>The battle between the two of them had just begun. She was prepared to go to Lin Fan\u2019s room to ask for a shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019m also here for a shirt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t come here yet. I\u2019m also only wearing a shirt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stayed in his room obediently. What the f*ck were they doing? Could they stop this?</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan was about to shower, he saw two small panties being hung on the glass and he thought of something.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Wu Huan Yue wearing his shirt only and walking around with their white and slender legs.</p><br/><p>They were seducing him.</p><br/><p>Brother Lin\u2026 Come here.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s fly together.</p><br/><p>He suddenly recovered from his daze. What was he thinking about? That was so lecherous.</p></div>\n</div>"}

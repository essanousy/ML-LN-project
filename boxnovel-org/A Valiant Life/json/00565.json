Everything will be fine and well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, will the treatment be complicated?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all very concerned about this matter but with their trust in Little Boss, they all believed that Little Boss would definitely treat her successfully.</p><br/><p>Lin fan said, \u201cAlright, everybody calm down. I\u2019m going to start the treatment now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that he was going to treat the kid today, so he had prepared the equipment when he had come to the shop earlier. Even with his medical abilities, treating such an illness had a certain degree of difficulty to it. However, he had the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost. With acupuncture as a support and Chinese medication as the main force, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem as long as she continued to take the medicine.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people watched this scene without looking away for a single moment. It was really their first time seeing Little Boss treat someone, so of course, they were incomparably curious.</p><br/><p>They saw Lin Fan take out the silver needles and pierce them into several important acupuncture points. Everyone kept gasping in shock. Some of them were nervous, some were fearful and some were excited. Then, they started discussing softly. In order not to disturb Little Boss, they didn\u2019t dare to speak too loudly.</p><br/><p>His palm descended upon the child\u2019s body, mainly to use the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical powers to start cleansing her body of the cancer cells.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this technique of Little Boss\u2019s is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see for yourself? Don\u2019t you realize that as Little Boss is treating her, the child\u2019s face looks better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Time passed by minute by minute, second by second.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest were gathered at the side and were watching curiously.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to remove the needles. He removed all the silver needles, then wrote a prescription on a piece of paper which he handed to Xie Mei. \u201cHer condition has basically stabilized. However, she has to keep taking the medications, three times a day for half a month. One in the morning, one at noon, and one at night. After that, you can bring your child to the hospital for a checkup. She should be fine by then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei was startled as she stood in place. She was still in a daze and it was as if she didn\u2019t dare to believe it. It was only when the people around her prompted her did she regain her senses. Then, with a face full of joy, she asked, \u201cGodly Doctor, is my daughter well already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cShe isn\u2019t well yet but as long as you listen to what I say and keep having her take the medicine for half a month, she will regain her health. During this period, don\u2019t give her any spicy food and let her eat porridge often.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei nodded. Her hands trembled as she placed the prescription in her bag. It was as if that was the most important thing in the world to her.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk were asking questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, will she be fully recovered in half a month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYep, as long as nothing out of the ordinary happens, there won\u2019t be any problems. Also, do you all still not trust my medical abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd quickly shook their heads, \u201cHow can that be? Little Boss\u2019s medical abilities are the best in the world. How can we doubt you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho asked that question just now? Are you doubting our Little Boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who our Little Boss is? He\u2019s the renowned Godly Doctor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The praises kept coming in and Lin Fan constantly nodded his head contently.</p><br/><p>Not bad. That\u2019s more like it.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Xie Mei knelt down in front of Lin Fan. \u201cThank you, Godly Doctor, for your kind grace. Thank you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Big Sister, hurry up and get up. This is Cloud Street. We don\u2019t do this kind of things here,\u201d said Lin Fan hastily. The townsfolk standing beside Xie Mei carried her up, then, they all smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, our Little Boss doesn\u2019t like this kind of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although our Cloud Street is a commercial street, we are all very caring and we like to help others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe child\u2019s health is the most important. Next time, you mustn\u2019t be manipulated by other people anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei was so touched that she was on the verge of tears. She said gratefully, \u201cThank you, everyone. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Xie Mei\u2019s physiognomy. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He decided that since he was doing good, he should just go all the way. He went to the drawer and took out money from inside. \u201cBig sister, here\u2019s ten thousand dollars. Take them. You\u2019ll need money to get the medicine and also to get more nutrients for your child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor, I can\u2019t take this. You have already done us such a great favor. I can\u2019t take your money,\u201d said Xie Mei in disbelief. She never thought that there were such good people on this earth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shoved the money into her hands. \u201cJust take it. I can tell what kind of situation you\u2019re in. When your condition improves, come to Cloud Street again and give me a board, or something else, to hang on the wall. I don\u2019t really like other things. Just things like this will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei looked at the Godly Doctor and said gratefully, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk started laughing, \u201cLittle Boss has already gotten so many Good Citizen Awards from the police. We mustn\u2019t bring shame to Cloud Street either. Everyone, take out some money as well. What matters is sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019ll contribute two hundred for the kid to nurture her body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m poor. My money is all managed by my wife. I\u2019ll give my remaining fifty dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this scene, he chuckled. It wasn\u2019t much money but to them. It might have been a meal or several packets of cigarettes. If they used it for themselves, it wouldn\u2019t have made much of a difference but by donating this money, perhaps the money might help the child and help to resolve a greater issue.</p><br/><p>Xie Mei was at a loss for words. She was really touched. She had never received such a heartwarming treatment before. Ever since her daughter fell sick, her relatives all distanced themselves from her. Those good friends from her past gradually grew distant as well. It was as if they didn\u2019t want to go near her.</p><br/><p>Because everyone knew that her daughter\u2019s illness was severe and the costs of treatment were very high. Hence, in order for her not to borrow money from them, they stayed away from her.</p><br/><p>Xie Mei didn\u2019t blame anyone but the burden on herself was really too great. At times, she felt like giving up but she kept on persevering with her teeth clenched.</p><br/><p>In the end, Xie Mei left the place. She left with her heart full of hope. Her daughter was well and she believed that she would definitely be able to give her daughter a good life from now on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd. \u201cAre you all really not going to run your businesses? Can\u2019t you all see that customers have gone to your shops and they couldn\u2019t find the owners?\u201d</p><br/><p>At some of the shop entrances, some customers were looking into the shops but they couldn\u2019t see anyone. They were puzzled. What kind of shops were these? Why wasn\u2019t there anyone there to welcome them?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, we\u2019re going back to our shops.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, how much money did I lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners all dispersed and hastily returned to their shops. If they didn\u2019t run their businesses, they wouldn\u2019t earn any money.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he shook his head. Saving others from their despair felt great. He loved this feeling a lot.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came over to Lin Fan\u2019s side with a smile on her face. \u201cBrother Lin, are you tired? Shall I give you a massage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, my shoulder is a little sore. Let me see your technique then,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was delighted. \u201cBrother Lin, my technique is first-rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>This matter had ended joyously and delightfully. Everyone\u2019s moods were pretty good.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was thinking of what to do about the car. It had been ruined to such an extent. Driving it out would be a little embarrassing.</p><br/><p>However, it was his own fault. Such a good car had been ruined just like that.</p></div>\n</div>"}

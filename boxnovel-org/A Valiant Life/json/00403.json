Lin Fan wanted to draw but the other party wouldn\u2019t accept it. This put Lin Fan in an awkward spot.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cYou really don\u2019t want it?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Tao Shi Gang shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. This painting must be produced in a specialized environment. Such a great masterpiece cannot be made in such a place.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Lin Fan had nothing to say. Then, he smiled and replied, \u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll owe you for now and when I have the chance, I\u2019ll repay you.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Yue Qiu Ju Shi was still completely immersed in the artwork. Even just a small bird in the painting encompassed great character. At that moment, he looked up and said, \u201cMaster Lin, initially, Brother Tao and I were prepared to stay here for a few days but with such a masterpiece in my hands, I wouldn\u2019t be at peace without giving it proper protection. During the exhibition, I\u2019ll definitely display this artwork to the public. After the exhibition, Brother Tao and I will come back for a visit.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">When he was saying this, Yue Qiu Ju Shi was clearly a little embarrassed but he had no choice. He valued this painting of a hundred birds facing a Phoenix greatly. If it was even a little bit damaged, he would be very upset. He could only hurry back to Beijing and hang it up. Also, he had to get a very expensive insurance for it. It was the most important piece of work in his life.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cThere isn\u2019t such a need, is there?\u201d said Lin Fan. If these two masters stayed here and taught the children how to draw, that would be pretty good. They would be able to give the children a sense of a master\u2019s aura. If they really had to leave, then Lin Fan would have nothing to say. He had never thought that his own artwork would be so important to some people.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cThere is such a need. There is.\u201d Yue Qiu Ju Shi nodded hastily. He turned his gaze over to the masterpiece which was laid across the drawing table. If he didn\u2019t make sure it was properly protected, he wouldn\u2019t be able to eat or sleep in peace.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Seeing how the situation was, Lin Fan decided not to impede. \u201cSince it\u2019s like this, let\u2019s meet again next time.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Tao Shi Gang said, \u201cMaster Lin, are you part of any association right now?\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">After meeting a master like Master Lin, he wanted to pull him into the association. For such a great master not to be in the association was a shame. Moreover, they wanted to interact with Master Lin often in order to raise their own art skills. After all, there are no limits to learning. One should keep learning as long as one is alive.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThat will have to wait for now. If I want to join the association, I will contact you.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Yue Qiu Ju Shi said, \u201cMaster Lin, before the Chinese traditional art exhibition, will you be free to come to have a look?\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Lin Fan nodded. \u201cSure, just let me know.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Going to see the larger scene, expanding his horizons.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Everyone interacted for a while more, then Yue Qiu Ju Shi carefully and cautiously packaged the painting. He kept it close to his body as if he was taking care of a precious child. When Lin Fan saw this, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. However, in his heart, he did feel quite good. For his own artwork to be so well-received, it was only natural for him to feel happy.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Outside Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Yue Qiu Ju Shi said ecstatically, \u201cBrother Tao, book the first-class cabin.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Tao Shi Gang laughed. \u201cI thought you liked the economy cabins.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cThis time is different. Even my life isn\u2019t as important as this painting. Of course, I have to be safe. I\u2019ll contact someone to come fetch us from the airport later on,\u201d said Yue Qiu Ju Shi.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Tao Shi Gang laughed as he said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t such a need, is there? No one else knows about this.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cNo, even if they don\u2019t know, I have to be safe. If I lose this, I won\u2019t be at peace for the rest of my life,\u201d said Yue Qiu Ju Shi.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">This trip to Shanghai had really been worth it. It had been so worth it that he didn\u2019t know what to say. He had never thought that he would be able to witness the birth of such a wonderful masterpiece. Although Master Lin wasn\u2019t famous, Yue Qiu Ju Shi wasn\u2019t someone who cared about fame.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Only those filthy upstarts with a bit of money cared about the fame of an artist. Someone who really understood art wouldn\u2019t care about fame. What they cared about was the true value of an artwork. This value wouldn\u2019t change even after hundreds or even thousands of years.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Even in their association, there were guys that he looked at with disdain, mainly because they only knew how to hype themselves up and raise the value of their artworks. In the eyes of outsiders, they seemed impressive but to Yue Qiu Ju Shi, they were worthless. Even if they gave him their artworks for free, he wouldn\u2019t want them.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u2026</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Lin Fan took a deep breath. His heart ached a little because ten Encyclopedic Points had gone just like that. However, he knew that a price had to be paid for him to show off. Those ten Encyclopedic Points were the price he paid. Without a single Encyclopedic Point left, he felt quite miserable and could only slowly earn the points back.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Before this temporary knowledge disappeared, Lin Fan bellowed, \u201cLeave the brush and ink.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Zhao Ming Qing was startled. He was scared stiff by that voice. Then, he saw his teacher stride over to the drawing table and spread open the writing paper. The brush in his hand pranced about freely like a dragon flying, like a phoenix dancing.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Exceptional and incomparable.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">A highly-skilled practitioner.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u2026</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cThe temporary calligraphy skill has finished.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Upon hearing this sound, Lin Fan\u2019s hand stopped. \u201cHow many sheets have I written?\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Zhao Ming Qing counted, then said, \u201cTen, teacher.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Lin Fan nodded contentedly. Not bad. Ten pieces were not bad. With this calligraphy of his, if he claimed to be second in the world, no one would claim to be first. When Zhao Ming Qing saw this handwriting, he couldn\u2019t help but gasp in shock. But because he wasn\u2019t a professional, he wasn\u2019t too shocked. Still, he didn\u2019t say anything as he felt that it was very imposing.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cThis is for you. \u2018\u2019. Old but vigorous. It\u2019s not bad. Remember to mount it and place it in your study room when you go back,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Zhao Ming Qing looked at these four words, then at Lin Fan. \u201cTeacher, this\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cWhat is it? Is there something wrong?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">In front of his teacher, even if there was something wrong, he wouldn\u2019t have said it. Then, he shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just that these four words are exceptionally imposing. They don\u2019t seem normal at all.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Lin Fan laughed. What a joke. If he was more well-known, these four words would\u2019ve been worth a thousand pounds of gold. Even calligraphy professionals wouldn\u2019t dare to challenge him after seeing these four words.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Initially, when doing the painting for Yue Qiu Ju Shi, he hadn\u2019t thought much of it. After painting it, he realized that a piece of Chinese art without a few words written on it wouldn\u2019t be impressive enough.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">However, he didn\u2019t know calligraphy, so what could he do? He could only exchange his Encyclopedic Points for it. But fortunately, the Encyclopedia was quite reasonable. The temporary skill only required ten points. He had no choice but to do it. It was his own fault for not thinking things through beforehand.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">That painting was definitely an exceptional masterpiece but if it were in his hands, it would be worthless. However, by giving it to Yue Qiu Ju Shi, it not only made him worship Lin Fan but he also helped to advertise Lin Fan.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Unknowingly, Lin Fan started fantasizing.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">In his fantasy, the bank came to collect his debts, $1 billion. He had no money and couldn\u2019t pay the debts. Then, the bank told him that he could just draw ten paintings for them. When he thought about this, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but start laughing.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Zhao Ming Qing stood at the side, looking at his teacher. He saw his teacher start laughing for no reason and was a little frightened. \u201cTeacher\u2026teacher\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Lin Fan came back to his senses, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Zhao Ming Qing shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">\u201cOh, right. I should explain the parts of \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 that you don\u2019t understand. Listen carefully and think about it when you go back,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cYes, teacher. I will engrave it into my memory.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

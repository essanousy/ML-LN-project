Tears started streaming down his face.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*cries*</p><br/><p>The guard at the bus stop was at a loss. He didn\u2019t expect this to happen at all.</p><br/><p>The surrounding tourists didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Then, they started to figure out what could have happened.</p><br/><p>They thought that this kid probably lived in a poor family and his brother had fallen terribly ill. The fact that he had to hide in the bus was probably because he didn\u2019t have money to pay for the bus fare.</p><br/><p>The eggs were probably for his brother to eat.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Now that most of them were broken, he must be heartbroken.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boy, don\u2019t cry,\u201d some tourists went forward to console him.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan wiped his tears, \u201cI\u2019m trying to piece them together. Now that they\u2019re broken, my brother would have nothing to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guard at the bus stop was a middle-aged man. After looking at what had happened, he felt really bad for pulling the boy. If he had not done that, the eggs would not have broken.</p><br/><p>After touching his pockets, he realized that he had $200 and he quickly handed it to Yang Yuan. \u201cLittle boy, I am sorry. I don\u2019t have much cash with me now. You can keep the $200 as a form of compensation. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan shook his head, \u201cUncle, I don\u2019t blame you. I can\u2019t accept your money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Please take it. Didn\u2019t you say that your brother is in the hospital? You need money.\u201d The man quickly just pushed the money into Yang Yuan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The surrounding tourists were moved by what just happened.</p><br/><p>A lady who seemed rich took out $1000 from her purse and handed it to Yang Yuan. \u201cThis is from me. Keep it and pass it to your parents at the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have $200 here.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you $100, I don\u2019t have much cash with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you $300.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd went forward to hand Yang Yuan some money as they felt sorry for his family\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>The situation showed the kindness of man. People started to go forward and give Yang Yuan money without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan didn\u2019t really ask for money but the tourists insisted on him to keep it.</p><br/><p>The bus driver asked, \u201cLittle boy, do you know which hospital your parents are at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan nodded, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will send you there then. It\u2019s not safe for you to be alone,\u201d the bus driver said.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan didn\u2019t expect these people to be so kind and he felt a sense of warmth in his heart. \u201cThank you, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the tourists smiled and waved, \u201cAlright, little boy, I still have some things to do. I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, please send him to the right place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bus driver replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Would I possibly sell him as a slave?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The crowd laughed and were less worried about him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the hospital!</p><br/><p>On the bed.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan\u2019s brother, Yang Huan, was lying on the bed. His face was pale and he had lost most of his hair after a single session of chemotherapy. However, he still looked really joyful.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, I miss my brother. I want to go home.\u201d Although Yang Huan was still young, he knew that he was sick and that the family didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for his medical fees.</p><br/><p>The farmer that was sitting by the bed grabbed Yang Huan\u2019s hand, \u201cBe good, you\u2019ll go home once you recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the ward, an elderly man was squatting at a corner. He was at a loss. He had used up all his money and borrowed money from all his friends and family. If he were to call them again, nobody would pick up his call.</p><br/><p>The expensive medical fees had already crushed him.</p><br/><p>Then, a doctor walked to him, \u201cDear parent of Yang Huan, your family\u2019s hospital treatment card is running out of money soon. Are you able to get more money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Bin raised his head and looked at the doctor, \u201cDoctor, I really can\u2019t borrow any more money.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor sighed. He knew the family\u2019s situation and that they were poor. They paid over $100,000 for the initial treatment but it was not enough to pay for future treatment. Even though he pitied them, he couldn\u2019t have done anything.</p><br/><p>He was just a doctor and he didn\u2019t have the power to make a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already reported your family\u2019s situation to the hospital. I have requested, on your behalf, to allow your child to continue receiving treatment while you pay in installments. However, the results have not been released yet,\u201d the doctor said.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Yang Bin wanted to kneel down in gratitude after hearing that but the doctor stopped him from doing so. He said firmly, \u201cActually, there\u2019s another way that you may want to try if you\u2019d like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would. What is it?\u201d Yang Bin immediately nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can contact reporters and seek help from the society. IF you need, I can pass you his number for you to contact him. However, I can\u2019t guarantee that it would work,\u201d the doctor said.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin was an ordinary citizen. He didn\u2019t understand these things but he believed that the doctor wouldn\u2019t lie. He knew that this doctor was a great man and had been trying to help his family.</p><br/><p>At Noon!</p><br/><p>In the ward.</p><br/><p>Yang Huan was lying there and he was reading a book. He seemed to be enjoying it a lot.</p><br/><p>Each treatment was really painful but he had to be strong because he didn\u2019t want to break his parents\u2019 hearts.</p><br/><p>Then, a voice could be heard from outside.</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cIt is this family. I really need your help. This boy is only nine years old and he has leukemia. The treatment is extremely expensive. However, his family is really too poor and they can\u2019t afford to pay the medical fees.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Bin saw the reporters as they entered. He became really agitated and just knelt down in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. Then, they replied, \u201cPlease, get up first. We are here to assess the situation so that we can help you better.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were reporters that worked for charitable organizations and they were there to assess the situation. They needed to verify things before reporting it.</p><br/><p>The reporters took pictures of Yang Huan, who was lying on the bed. They also interacted with him.</p><br/><p>After their interaction.</p><br/><p>The reporters were moved by the boy. He was really sensible and strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, mum, brother\u2026\u201d Yang Yuan appeared at the entrance of the ward.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin was talking to the reporters and he was stunned when he saw Yang Yuan. He asked in disbelief, \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, this uncle sent me here,\u201d Yang Yuan pointed at the bus driver beside him and said. Then, he looked at his brother who was lying on the bed and ran over, \u201cBrother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Huan shouted ecstatically when he saw his brother, \u201cBrother\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters took pictures of the situation and asked the bus driver what had happened earlier.</p><br/><p>The bus driver was stunned by the number of reporters in the room. Then, he just explained things to them.</p><br/><p>He sneaked into a bus compartment!</p><br/><p>And stayed for more than ten hours!</p><br/><p>The reporters were in disbelief after hearing what he had said.</p><br/><p>When the bus driver found out that the situation was worse than what he had expected, he immediately went to withdraw $5000 and passed it to the family.</p><br/><p>He was truly moved by this boy.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

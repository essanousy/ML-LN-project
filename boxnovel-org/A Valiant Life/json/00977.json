Why did Chairman Zhou call everyone over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe there\u2019s something happening. Perhaps the association is reforming or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin received the Nobel Prize in Medicine. That\u2019s really a great boost to our image. Recently, the medical license at my hospital has inflated in price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here. It inflated by quite a lot too. I didn\u2019t think that it would have such an impact.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Chinese Medical Association members were chatting with smiles on their faces. They were in good moods. After all, their Chinese medicine which had not been high looked upon in the past has now gained a level of respect that was unprecedented.</p><br/><p>Also, some hospitals had started looking for Chinese medicine masters to work in their hospitals. And they were treated extremely well.</p><br/><p>Members of the Chinese Medical Association were especially well-received.</p><br/><p>Although other people didn\u2019t say it, they knew that this was all because of Master Lin. If it hadn\u2019t been for Master Lin single-handedly raising the reputation of Chinese medicine, it probably would be where it was now.</p><br/><p>In the conference room.</p><br/><p>The big conference room was filled with people.</p><br/><p>This meeting was attended by all Shanghainese members. If it had been before, some members might not have attended. They might have felt that it didn\u2019t matter even if they didn\u2019t attend as they had only joined the association to gain a title.</p><br/><p>But now, it was different. With Master Lin\u2019s existence, the Chinese Medical Association\u2019s standing had been raised within the nation and even internationally.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Just recently, many reporters had come to the association to interview people. This had greatly promoted the association.</p><br/><p>Of the people present now, many had been approached by people who wanted to join the Shanghai Chinese Medical Association. As for why they didn\u2019t join the association at other places, some people were rather ambitious and didn\u2019t want to climb their way up from the bottom.</p><br/><p>*Footsteps*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside. Everyone\u2019s gazes shifted over as they waited silently.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan, accompanied by Vice-Chairman Wang Tian Feng, entered the conference room. At the same time, his secretary, assistant, and other people followed closely. They were going to record the contents of this conference.</p><br/><p>He stepped on the rostrum.</p><br/><p>All the association members stood up. \u201cGreetings, Chairman Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Zou Qing Quan nodded as a form of greeting to the members.</p><br/><p>Previously, the place had still been a little noisy but now, it was completely silents.</p><br/><p>There was not a single sound. Before Zhou Qing Quan spoke, no one dared to speak.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng sat there, arranging his files and not saying a word. Elder Zhou had already told him about the situation. He agreed with Elder Zhou\u2019s suggestion to let Master Lin be the new Chairman as well. This wouldn\u2019t be disadvantageous to the association at all. It would only bring benefits.</p><br/><p>Of course, he knew that Master Lin wanted to reform. This was not an easy path to follow. If they handled anything badly, it would draw harsh criticism. If that were to happen, it might be a problem.</p><br/><p>But this had already been decided on. No matter what reform it was, it would be fine as long as they followed Master Lin\u2019s lead.</p><br/><p>With a great Chinese medicine achiever leading the Chinese Medical Academy, it would eventually rise up.</p><br/><p>*Cough cough!* A gentle cough was heard throughout the conference room. All the members sat up straight. They felt that something big was about to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore the conference begins, I\u2019d like to say something. Chinese Medical Association member, Ma You Min, was involved with a popular multi-level marketing organization and he used the name of the association to scam others outside. He has been severely dealt with and kicked out of the association. He will never be accepted again. Also, he has been handed over to the judicial authorities for appropriate punishment. The person who recommended Ma You Min to the association will also be suspended for observation.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words were said, some people had disbelief on their faces, some had anger, while some were feeling guilty. They felt as if some problem had been discovered.</p><br/><p>Ma You Min didn\u2019t have a high standing in the association but there were some commercial lectures where they would invite association members to put on a front.</p><br/><p>As for what was involved, that was needless to say. Of course, they would gain money and benefits.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan then changed the topic. \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say about this for now. Now, I\u2019ll talk about something important. The Chinese Medical Association has already existed for several decades. It has gone through many lows but no highs. Since taking up this appointment, I haven\u2019t brought glory to the association. I am deeply regretful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tension in the room was stifling. Everyone felt that something huge was about to happen.</p><br/><p>Nervousness, fear and other such emotions filled their hearts.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cRight now, I will step down from my position as Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association and hand over my appointment to Master Lin. Master Lin will take on the appointment from in the future. Now, you all may vote if you agree with this or not,\u201d said Zhou Qing Quan.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone was secretly happy in their hearts. Those who used the association\u2019s name for personal gain outside were especially excited.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin was going to take on the appointment of Chairman, their Chinese Medical Association\u2019s standing wouldn\u2019t be the same anymore.</p><br/><p>If they were to say this in public, other people would be shocked.</p><br/><p><em>Our Chinese Medical Association\u2019s Chairman is the man who conquered leukemia and received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Master Lin. If you work with us, there is nothing to worry about.</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, everything was perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Zhou, you\u2019re stepping down. This\u2026this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! You\u2019ve given so much to the association and your body is still robust. Why are you stepping down all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were only pretending to persuade him to stay. It could be seen through with a single look.</p><br/><p>Some association members who were sincere understood Elder Zhou\u2019s thinking. He wanted the association to keep progressing, so he had to have a capable person step up.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And obviously, Master Lin was that capable person. They completely approved of this.</p><br/><p>But some artificial people just had to pretend to make Zhou Qing Quan stay. They acted as if they couldn\u2019t bear to see him step down.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan looked at the crowd. \u201cI\u2019ve already discussed this with Master Lin. He has accepted the appointment as well. Does anyone have any opinions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the place went silent. No one was against it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. From now on, Master Lin will take over as Chairman of the Chinese Medical Academy. Today\u2019s conference ends here. Please take your leave. Also, spread the word about this,\u201d said Zhou Qing Quan.</p><br/><p>This outcome was what he had expected.</p><br/><p>Master Lin becoming the Chairman only brought benefits to most people. There were no disadvantages.</p><br/><p>Of course, he knew that there were many bad people mixed with the honest folk in here. They all had different agendas. But he wondered whether they would still be as joyous if they knew about what was going to happen later on.</p></div>\n</div>"}

This was so that he could scan it into the computers. Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to interfere with what he was going to do with the content.</p><br/><p>If they were to be published, it would be extremely beneficial to him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing left happily. He wasn\u2019t going to be bothered with the people at the Education Department. He wanted to read the materials first and he would only send the materials to them after he was done reading.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t understand why they needed to check the materials\u2019 content. These were written by his mentor. How would they be able to understand it?</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did some stretching and wanted to go home to rest after a long day at work.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be making a move first, see you guys tomorrow.\u201d Lin Fan waved at the others.</p><br/><p>At the apartment block.</p><br/><p>In a place like Shanghai, everyone dreamt of owning a house. To Lin Fan, his biggest dream was still to return to Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>The reason why he couldn\u2019t return was that he had no money.</p><br/><p>A typical house would cause a few million dollars and a better one would be more than ten million. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t even have a girlfriend. Why would he need a house? It was more practical to rent a place instead.</p><br/><p>He went towards the lift after exiting the car.</p><br/><p>The lift door opened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hummed a song and was feeling happy.</p><br/><p>Then, as he stepped into the lift and wanted to turn around, a man attacked him from behind. He brandished a dagger across his face and pointed it at his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Things were getting out of hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mind was frantically thinking.</p><br/><p>Kidnap! Robbery! Rape!</p><br/><p>Regardless of what it was, he had to retaliate.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately twisted his wrist and thrust his hips. Then, did an impressive shoulder throw.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you try to kidnap me?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a loud slam and the lift was shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch, it hurts\u2026\u201d Suddenly, a female\u2019s voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. Why was it a female? When he looked at the lady on the floor, he was dumbfounded. Then, he chuckled, \u201cBrother Qiang Qiang, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation made Lin Fan feel awkward.</p><br/><p>It was too violent. Brother Qiang Qiang seemed a little crazy. she actually came from Jiangning and held a dagger to him. Was she really thinking of kidnapping him?</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang lay on the floor and her eyes were red. It was as if she was going to cry. However, there were no tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so d*mn painful.\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang looked to be in a lot of pain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t known that it was Brother Qiang Qiang who wanted to kidnap him. Hence, he wasn\u2019t merciful at all. His shoulder throw might have sprained or fractured her hips.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Lin Fan realized that Brother Qiang Qiang wasn\u2019t faking it. Then, he squatted down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Brother Qiang Qian hated him a lot. If not for him, she wouldn\u2019t be in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be in a wheelchair for the rest of your life, be serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang was stunned when she heard that. If she was going to be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, she\u2019d rather be dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly treat me then! Why are you standing there?\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang shouted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan actually wanted to treat her immediately but his attitude seemed a little bad. \u201cI\u2019ll only take a look when your attitude improves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang looked at Lin Fan, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect Brother Qiang Qiang to really look for him. However, her dad had said that he wouldn\u2019t let Brother Qiang Qiang cause trouble. Why did he let her come here then? However, when he looked at Brother Qiang Qiang\u2019s fearsome expression, he knew that she wanted to cause trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You mean you were right to attack me? Your attitude sucks and yet you want me to treat you? There isn\u2019t such a good thing in this world,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang wanted to kill this man. \u201cAre you going to treat me or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cWhen your attitude improves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, dream on. I, Brother Qiang Qiang, have never known about being good-natured,\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang said. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help anymore. I\u2019ll just call the ambulance myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Brother Qiang Qiang tried to tolerate the pain and called the ambulance. After beeping twice, the phone call got disrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, what kind of rubbish signal is this? I can\u2019t even make a call.\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang was furious. It was as if everything had gone wrong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was helpless too. This walkway was a little weird sometimes, the signal would be disrupted occasionally and they wouldn\u2019t be able to make any calls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, think about it. The evidence is all here. Why not I call 110 for you and you can be sent to the hospital by the police? By then, your hip would be useless.\u201d Lin Fan said. \u201cA beautiful \u2018lady\u2019 like you would be paralyzed. That\u2019s a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang looked at Lin Fan and felt that he wasn\u2019t just trying to scare her. Then, she was frightened. \u201cPlease take a look at me. We can discuss about anything else in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Brother Qiang Qiang\u2019s attitude suddenly became better.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you were the most arrogant person on earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA wise man submits to circumstances. If a person has substance, he or she wouldn\u2019t be afraid of failing again,\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you mean. Could you repeat that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang tried to contain his rage, \u201cPlease take a look at my injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What was the purpose of the attack?\u201d Lin Fan said. Then, he pressed on Brother Qiang Qiang\u2019s hips. She had a small waist. This feeling was really peculiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything. He pressed on it again and there was a clicking sound. It was as if the bones had been pushed back to its original position.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, how do you feel now?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all? Didn\u2019t you say that I would be paralyzed?\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang moved and felt that it was much better than before.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAre you stupid? You think you\u2019d be paralyzed from a fall like this? I was just lying to you. Your bones just went out of position.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang was furious. She felt that she was humiliated. However, she was there to discuss important things with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to treat me?\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang tolerated the pain and asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed helplessly, \u201cI\u2019m speaking the truth. I can\u2019t help you. What do you want from me? Look, your current appearance is beautiful. You look like a fairy. Your complexion is so much better and your boobs must be even bigger than before. Did you feel as if a lot of guys looked at you back in Jiangning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang tried to contain her rage. What this fella said was right. After her body had changed, she realized that a lot of guys looked at her differently.</p><br/><p>Even the staff at the counter of the hotel would sneak looks at her.</p><br/><p>However, this feeling wasn\u2019t what she wanted. She didn\u2019t want guys to look at her, he only wanted girls to look at him.</p><br/><p>She had been in Shanghai for two days. She had been following Lin Fan around and she had been prepared to kidnap him to force him to change her back.</p><br/><p>If she couldn\u2019t be changed back, she would have killed him right there.</p></div>\n</div>"}

This is the police station\u2026\u201d When the policemen saw a group of people suddenly charge in, they were dumbfounded. What were these people trying to do? This was the police station, were they trying to defy the natural order?</p><br/><p>\u201cReport. We want to make a police report. Our friend has been kidnapped,\u201d Wang Ming Yang and the others blurted out. They were all dumbfounded at that moment. Lin Fan had been kidnapped right in front of their eyes and they weren\u2019t able to do anything about it.</p><br/><p>When the policemen heard this, they started getting anxious. \u201cKidnapped? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a major incident. There weren\u2019t many kidnappings in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian came out from the office. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s all this ruckus about?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the policemen went forward and said, \u201cInspector, there are people here to make a report. They say that there\u2019s been a kidnapping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKidnapping?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was startled. \u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>But when he saw who had come, he was stunned. \u201cFraud Tian, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian saw Inspector Liu, it was as if he saw someone he could rely on. Then, he said with an anxious look on his face, \u201cInspector Liu, something big has happened. Our Little Boss has been kidnapped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was startled. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that Master Lin has been kidnapped?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said in a panicky tone, \u201cJust after we came out from the hotel after our meal, an MPV without a number plate stopped by the side of the road and they pulled my brother inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was stunned. He had never expected Master Lin to be kidnapped. How was that possible?</p><br/><p>According to his knowledge, Master Lin had very powerful fighting abilities. Who would have been able to kidnap him?</p><br/><p>No, unless\u2026</p><br/><p>He had a slight idea of what had happened but he wasn\u2019t sure of it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was in a very restless state right now. His own brother had been kidnapped right in front of him and he wasn\u2019t able to do anything. How could he stand it? \u201cInspector Liu, according to my knowledge, the opposition has guns but I don\u2019t know how many people there were.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, when Inspector Liu heard that they had guns, he knew that it was no small matter. Then, he swiftly started moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, inform the vice squad and the traffic police department. Get them to check the cameras along Long River Road and find out which direction they went.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a police officer hurriedly ran over and whispered into Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had already had an anxious look on his face. Suddenly, his expression changed again as he blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The boss of Lu Family Group has been kidnapped as well?\u201d At that moment, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Right now, not only Master Lin had been kidnapped. Even the boss of Lu Family Group, Lu Li, had been kidnapped as well.</p><br/><p>Just what was up with this day? Why were there two consecutive major incidents?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cInspector Liu, what\u2019s going on now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cChief Wang, don\u2019t panic. I\u2019m going to go over to the bureau for a bit. If there\u2019s any news, I\u2019ll let you know immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll follow you to the bureau. If anything happens, I would be able to know at once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the head office.</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian reached, Lu Li\u2019s father, Lu Zhong Ming was already there.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Qin, what\u2019s the situation now? I just received a report that Master Lin has been kidnapped as well but I don\u2019t know if the culprits are the same,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>Chief Qin frowned, \u201cMaster Lin got kidnapped too?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was unexpected.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhong Ming, who was sitting there, had experienced countless trials in his life before. At that moment, he maintained his composure. \u201cChief Qin, I trust the police force on this matter. If the kidnappers want money, I can pay them but you have to guarantee my son\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin nodded but there was a huge amount of pressure on him. Lu Zhong Ming was a man with high status in Shanghai. Now that his son had been kidnapped, it was undoubtedly a challenge.</p><br/><p>There was a high possibility that this kidnapping wasn\u2019t because of money.</p><br/><p>They had thought of many possibilities. The first was that the kidnappers would request money. However, even Master Lin had been kidnapped. There was something rather fishy about this situation.</p><br/><p>However, they weren\u2019t sure whether the kidnappers that kidnapped the two of them were from the same group yet. If they were from the same group, then something would be very wrong with this situation.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian came to Chief Qin\u2019s side. \u201cBureau Chief, I feel that these kidnappers are probably from the same group. It is very likely that they did this because of \u2018Scorpion\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin nodded. He felt that way as well. \u2018Scorpion\u2019 was a drug lord, he would definitely have raised a bunch of daredevils. Now that he had been captured, \u2018Scorpion\u2019 would always display a calm and collected expression during interrogations, occasionally revealing bits of information that were unimportant. He probably already knew that there would be people coming to rescue him.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the investigator arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cBureau Chief, they were driving an MPV without a number plate. An investigation would take a lot of work. It would probably last until tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin shook his head, \u201cTomorrow might be too late. But we don\u2019t have any leads right now. It seems that they had done their preparations before coming. I\u2019m afraid that all we can do is to wait for their call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive out the order to be in category one alert. No matter what, we have to rescue them within twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the MPV.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this is the guy that got Boss arrested. I really want to put a few bullets right through him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is really useful. If we want to get the police to release Boss, we have to rely on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang, is this guy really reliable? Will the police release Boss just for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang was the man who had asked Lin Fan for directions. He laughed coldly. \u201cThat\u2019s why we kidnapped the other guy. With that man in our hands, I believe that the police will listen obediently to our arrangements.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was there, pretending to be unconscious and listening to these people talking. He had an idea of the situation in his mind. It seemed that they had not only kidnapped him but another person as well.</p><br/><p>Moreover, their goal was to rescue \u2018Scorpion\u2019.</p><br/><p>He had not thought that these were \u2018Scorpion\u201ds buddies.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan had learned through experience why people who help the police crack large cases have to wear monkey masks. It turns out that people would really take revenge on them.</p><br/><p>Initially, when he had been captured, Lin Fan had wanted to see just what these people were up to.</p><br/><p>If they were just doing it for money, then Lin Fan would have taken these guys out immediately when they were in the vehicle.</p><br/><p>Did these guys really think that they could suppress Lin Fan just using a pair of handcuffs?</p><br/><p>They were simply dreaming.</p><br/><p>But now, Lin Fan was laughing in his heart. It seemed that there was someone else behind this. He wanted to see just who it was.</p><br/><p>When all of them gathered together, Lin Fan would take them all out in one fell swoop.</p><br/><p>When that happens, it would be a great merit.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan was now wondering who was the unlucky guy who got kidnapped like he did. From what he heard, it didn\u2019t seem like just a simple guy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know how much time had passed but the car had taken many turns before the sound of brakes were heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>They thought that Lin Fan was unconscious and he needed to be carried. Lin Fan wasn\u2019t going to wake up, he just continued to pretend to be unconscious.</p><br/><p>They reached the inside.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang said, \u201cBring a pail of water and wake him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that they were going to pour water on him, of course, he couldn\u2019t carry on pretending to be unconscious. It would be very uncomfortable if his whole body was wet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Where am I?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ridiculous performance had begun.</p></div>\n</div>"}

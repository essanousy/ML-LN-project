Someone is going to take my place as the President.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Fei and Wang Yun Jie stood up in disbelief. \u201cPresident, you\u2019re doing well here. Why are they chasing you away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it. Someone must have seen the power that our association is going to obtain and he probably wants to take over it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie was furious. \u201cIn the past, when we weren\u2019t doing well, all of them didn\u2019t want to come over. Now that we\u2019re on the rise, they are actually fighting to come over. We can\u2019t let them get what they want.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Niu waved his hand, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about it. After all, this is what the headquarters commanded. I have to respect their decision. Alright, tell me more about what happened in the mountains. I couldn\u2019t really see from the video.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he said that he wasn\u2019t bothered by it, he sounded pretty disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, we can\u2019t possibly talk about that at this time. Let us speak to the headquarters and see if we can figure something out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Beijing headquarters.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Shanghai branch to have such a positive change. It is something extremely unexpected,\u201d a pair of middle-aged men was conversing about the Shanghai association.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the trip to Kunlun Mountain really helped them a lot. We\u2019ve already informed President Niu about the change in appointment. You\u2019re going to take over him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man smiled and his face reddened. \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. We\u2019re all a family. We would be relieved for you to go over. Elder Niu should retire soon, given his old age. We need to find someone young.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, will this cause any trouble?\u201d The middle-aged man asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing will happen. This is a normal transfer of appointment. Furthermore, Elder Niu should really retire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and the others returned, the other shop owners gathered around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you really made a name for yourself this time. All of us saw the video and it was insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. My son keeps whining that he wants to meet you and he\u2019s been practicing martial arts in the living room. Should we open a class in Cloud Street so that Little Boss can teach him some skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that sounds good. Perhaps he could even become a professional next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes after hearing that. \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t you think that that would be too much for me to handle?\u201d</p><br/><p>They became quiet. They were the type to speak their minds and they were used to being shut down.</p><br/><p>They would just start to brag to anyone they saw about knowing Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, the townsfolk have been going crazy ever since you left. They feel that they\u2019ve been lacking energy as they haven\u2019t smelled the goodness of the scallion pancakes in a long time,\u201d Elder Liang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. In the past, people said that they don\u2019t have energy when they don\u2019t eat. Now, they\u2019re saying that they don\u2019t have energy because they can\u2019t smell it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He realized that the townsfolk had to give in to the daily fixed limit of the scallion pancakes and even though they couldn\u2019t buy it most of the time, they could at least smell it and indulge in the smell of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, don\u2019t be surprised but someone actually made a business out of that. A whiff of the scallion pancakes costs $1.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned after hearing that. How could anyone start a business with that idea?</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang called.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to ask what the situation was regarding the research lab.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Ming Yang, how\u2019s the research lab going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cIt\u2019s still under construction. Don\u2019t be too anxious. This is very technical and we have to find professionals to do it. Anyway, bro, you\u2019re really awesome for what you did at Kunlun Mountain. Tell me, how good did that feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about how good it felt. I should\u2019ve asked you along too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn it, you always say that but you don\u2019t even think about me,\u201d Wang Ming Yang complained.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYou\u2019re so busy. How could you just follow me around like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang rebutted, \u201cWhat am I busy with? I spend so much money to hire people to work for me. If I have to handle everything, I\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it and agreed with what he said. \u201cAlright, tell me what\u2019s your intentions of calling me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cNothing much. I just feel like treating you to a meal tonight. My wife is going to cook a feast and she\u2019s asking you to come over with Huan Yue. Are you going to come over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll definitely be there. Alright, I have another incoming call.\u201d Lin Fan looked at his phone and saw another caller ID. Then, he hung up on Wang Ming Yang\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Jiang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t know why Jiang Fei was calling.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei said hurriedly, \u201cPresident Lin, something bad happened. The Beijing headquarters want to chase President Niu away and replace him with someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan had still been smiling but when he heard that, he furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei was furious. \u201cThey must have realized the rising power of our association and they want to get rid of President Niu because of his old age. They\u2019re forcing him to retire in view of the increasing responsibilities that he will have to take up. I think that\u2019s all excuses. They just want to be a part of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll hang up now. I\u2019ll resolve this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows and hung up the call. Then, he opened the Weibo app and saw the post by the Beijing headquarters.</p><br/><p>He replied to the post immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you. Can you not be so shameless? President Niu is the President of the Shanghai association and that has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the post was published, the netizens were confused about what had happened.</p><br/><p>The Beijing headquarters responded quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cVice-President Lin, this is a command. President Niu is just going to be re-allocated to Beijing. Don\u2019t get so worked up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied: \u201cWorked up? What do you mean that he is re-allocated? If the new president dares to come over, I will get crush him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words were reckless.</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned and they didn\u2019t know why Master Lin was so furious.</p><br/><p>The members of the Beijing association were also furious and they started to scold Master Lin on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin, how could you be so unreasonable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied: \u201cWhat do you mean by that? If you dare to do that, I will go to Beijing now and get crush all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that was posted, things went downhill from there.</p><br/><p>The members of the Beijing association started to get even angrier. \u201cFine, come over then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cSure. I\u2019m not afraid to do so. Just wait for me. I\u2019ll be there in the afternoon. Watch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were all confused and they didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p></div>\n</div>"}

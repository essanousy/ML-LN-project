This matter was just a small one but most people didn\u2019t think this way.</p><br/><p>They felt that Master Lin was really too mystical, to be able to do such a mystical thing.</p><br/><p>They could accept that he had conquered anorexia.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they could accept that he had conquered leukemia.</p><br/><p>But now, he had even conquered infantile spasms. They really wanted to ask him what on Earth could he not do?</p><br/><p>To the pharmaceutical manufacturers, this guy was simply inhumane. If the prescription that he developed contained medicine that cost a lot, perhaps they could still accept it. But this despicable guy kept on using the cheapest kinds of medicine in his prescriptions and it was even the most common kinds. They couldn\u2019t even profit much from these.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>How were they supposed to survive like that?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian applauded him. \u201cYou\u2019re awesome, kid. I\u2019m really in awe of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had to be in awe. The things that Lin Fan had done were unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled proudly. \u201cFraud, that\u2019s very well said. You have to be in awe of me, isn\u2019t that right? But really, I might have offended people again. Look at my Weibo. There are people threatening me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, be careful. It\u2019s because you\u2019ve gotten in the way of other people\u2019s benefits that they\u2019re now coming for revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said worriedly, \u201cNothing will happen, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNothing will happen. These people wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything to me. They\u2019re all talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s really strange. Why didn\u2019t the Health Department come and talk to me this time?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He really felt that it was strange. Could it be that the prescription was too normal? After all, infantile spasms wasn\u2019t a terminal disease. With the current advancements in medicine, it could be treated.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that really was the case.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang. The display showed an unknown number.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hesitated for a moment before answering, \u201cHello, who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, who I am is not important. I want to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAlright, say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were a little ruthless this time, don\u2019t you think? Do you know how many people have made terrible losses because of you?\u201d The person on the other end of the call had a very unfriendly tone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. These losses have nothing to do with me. I\u2019ve already said previously to sell all your stock at the original price quickly. But no one listened to me. I can\u2019t help it that way, can I? Moreover, this doesn\u2019t concern me at all. If this medicine hadn\u2019t been so difficult to buy and the black market price hadn\u2019t been so high, my fans wouldn\u2019t have asked me for help and I wouldn\u2019t have done anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t know your mistake, do you? You will pay for this.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \u201cIf I don\u2019t go to hell, who will? If I\u2019m going to have to pay for it, so be it. I\u2019m already prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter*</p><br/><p>The other party hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. That guy who called really was amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWho knows? But those distributors who were stockpiling aren\u2019t able to sell their medicine anymore, so they\u2019re blaming me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, another call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m the person-in-charge of Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company. I respect you. I really respect you. I didn\u2019t think you would really be able to develop the prescription.\u201d The opposite party\u2019s friendliness could be heard through the phone. It seemed that he wasn\u2019t angry at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt was nothing. I just casually meddled around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I have to ask you to have mercy on us in future. Once you do something like this, us pharmaceutical companies can\u2019t withstand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cHow can you ask me to have mercy? I just saw that this medicine was difficult to purchase and since it seemed that your company couldn\u2019t manufacture enough, I decided to help to develop a new prescription. If this medicine could be purchased anywhere, why the hell would I want to develop a new prescription? Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. This time, it was because of our company. We didn\u2019t manufacture enough.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cSigh, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that if you had manufactured enough, those distributors wouldn\u2019t have had an opportunity to exploit and I wouldn\u2019t have had to waste my time on this. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cLook, even those pharmaceutical companies are afraid that I\u2019m on to them and that I\u2019m trying to go against them. But they\u2019re overthinking it. Why would I have so much energy to do such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, tell us honestly. What can you not develop? Do you think you can develop a cure for AIDS?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. He backed away from Zhao Zhong Yang and exclaimed, \u201cYou don\u2019t have AIDS, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. How could I?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang quickly waved his hands.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s good. If you ever do have AIDS, come and look for me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that! How could I ever have AIDS?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang retorted.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed coldly. \u201cLooking at you, it\u2019s hard to say. Your life is in a mess.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Fraud, you\u2019re going overboard. You\u2019re falsely accusing me. Since when has my life been a mess?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang rebuked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there, playing with his phone and looking at the two of them quarreling. He didn\u2019t participate in it. Then, he opened his Weibo and prepared to post another comment.</p><br/><p>When you are powerless, your warning to others may be taken as a joke.</p><br/><p>But when you are powerful, one word from you will be remembered for life and other people won\u2019t dare to forget it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cThe prescription for infantile spasms has already been developed. If there are any problems, I am willing to bear all responsibility. Also, I\u2019d like to welcome any requests from all netizens. If there is any medicine that can\u2019t be purchased or that the black market has inflated the price unreasonably, I welcome everyone to come to me for help. I feel that, with my current ability, developing some prescriptions for small illnesses is possible. As for terminal illnesses or things like that, that will have to wait. I\u2019m not capable enough yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 I support Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, with these words from Master Lin, I don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, let\u2019s see who else dares to act impudently and sell overpriced medicine from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen some distributors and pharmaceutical companies see this, they\u2019ll probably be scared to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, if you act so dominantly, aren\u2019t you afraid that other people will take revenge on you?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When some pharmaceutical companies and distributors saw this post, their expressions changed. They felt that this Master Lin was too loathsome.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw Brother Lin\u2019s Weibo and was dumbfounded. \u201cBrother Lin, do you really want to do something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYup. If there\u2019s nothing to do, I can develop some prescriptions. It shouldn\u2019t affect me too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. I just feel like you\u2019d offend a lot of people.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang had given in. In the past, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to imagine such a thing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was fearless regarding this matter. If he offended someone, so be it. After all, he had already offended many people. He wasn\u2019t afraid of adding a few more people to the list.</p><br/><p>The previous two times, he hadn\u2019t impaired the benefits of too many people. It had only been the hospitals that had been dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>But this time, it was different. Those distributors who had stockpiled the medicine probably hated him to death.</p><br/><p><em>How scary. I might get beaten to death someday.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

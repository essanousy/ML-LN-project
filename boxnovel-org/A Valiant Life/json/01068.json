Everyone was curious as to who this new substitute was.</p><br/><p>From afar, they couldn\u2019t see his facial features clearly. They could only hope that this substitute was a little more reliable.</p><br/><p>At the very least, they hoped he would be able to guard the post and not let in any balls.</p><br/><p>The reporters were filming the situation on site. The Golden Flowers goalkeeper getting injured was a very bad sign. The match hadn\u2019t even started for long when it happened. It really made everyone feel as if their hearts had knotted up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s strange. Isn\u2019t the other goalkeeper from Golden Flowers sick? Then who\u2019s that?\u201d asked someone from the film crew curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZoom in on him. Let\u2019s see just who he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the film crew zoomed their lens in on him, the person manning the camera suddenly jolted. He looked up into the distance before aiming his camera once again.</p><br/><p>This time, he was sure. Then, he yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! How could it be him?\u201d</p><br/><p>His surrounding colleagues almost jumped from surprise. \u201cWhat the f*ck is wrong with you? Why are you shouting about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat goalkeeper is Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>His colleague was dumbfounded. \u201cWhat? What did you say? The goalkeeper is Master Lin? Are you f*cking playing around with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If you don\u2019t believe me, come and see for yourself. See if it really is him.\u201d</p><br/><p>His colleague definitely didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cMove aside. I\u2019ll see for myself. What kind of eyes do you have? Master Lin must be selling scallion pancakes at Cloud Street now. How could the f*cking goalkeeper be Master Lin? Without any training, how could he be a goalkeeper?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he walked over and shot his colleague a glare before going to see for himself. \u201cA few seconds later, he slowly and stupidly turned his head around, looking at his colleague. \u201cIs it really Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d His colleague nodded, a little dumbfounded as well.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected the Golden Flowers\u2019 goalkeeper to be Master Lin. Was it a f*cking joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Flowers is going to lose for sure. How could Master Lin know how to be a goalkeeper? It\u2019ll be as if there\u2019s no one guarding the goal post at all. The opposition will be able to score anytime they want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be? Just look at Wu Ze for yourself. He\u2019s just slumped on his seat now and he looks so lifeless. He must know that they\u2019re done for, that\u2019s why he let Master Lin go up to play around. Otherwise, why would he do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Wu Ze himself goes on the field, it would be better than Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them kept discussing. They had now given up on the situation. They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to go on the field. If this wasn\u2019t a joke, what was it?</p><br/><p>Huang Jun was still broadcasting with his phone. Then, his gaze shifted towards the coaches\u2019 stands but he couldn\u2019t find Master Lin\u2019s figure. He couldn\u2019t help but be dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere has Master Lin gone? Why is he suddenly missing?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, his Internet buddies in the broadcast room were in anguish as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere else could he have gone? He must have gone home. This match isn\u2019t worth watching anymore. I\u2019m not watching anymore too. Host, keep broadcasting by yourself. I won\u2019t continue watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. I can\u2019t bear to watch the tragedy that\u2019s about to happen. For my own sake, I can\u2019t keep watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the infirmary.</p><br/><p>The goalkeeper shouted, \u201cI\u2019m still fine! Let me go. Our team doesn\u2019t have any more goalkeepers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Your shoulder bone has already been fractured. And there\u2019s already a substitute goalkeeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>The goalkeeper was startled. \u201cHow could that be? Our team only has two goalkeepers. I\u2019m here and the other one is sick. How could there be another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cThere is. Master Lin just went in. He\u2019s wearing number 1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d When the goalkeeper heard this, he was instantly stupefied. Master Lin has <em>gone in? Is this a joke?</em></p><br/><p>On the field.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was standing there, watching all the other players in the distance and feeling a little bored. The ball was just flying around there, getting passed here and there. He wondered when it would come to him. It couldn\u2019t be that it wouldn\u2019t come for the whole match, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei was sprinting as he shouted, \u201cWatch your man! Don\u2019t let them enter our side. Otherwise, Master Lin won\u2019t be able to defend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe got it. Don\u2019t worry, Captain. We\u2019re going to put it all on the line and defend,\u201d the players shouted in response.</p><br/><p>They knew that the person guarding the post now was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Although they knew that Master Lin was amazing in other aspects, they didn\u2019t believe that Master Lin was any good at football at all. Guarding the goal post, in particular, was no joke.</p><br/><p>It required lightning-fast reflexes.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it required a strong and powerful physique because the power behind a professional player\u2019s kick was exceptional.</p><br/><p>Even they didn\u2019t dare to block the ball with their bodies. After all, it would really hurt a lot. Sometimes, when the ball hit someone\u2019s hip region, that person\u2019s hip would fracture. This kind of incident had happened before.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A change occurred on the field.</p><br/><p>Wang Fei was startled. \u201cSh*t. Hurry up and follow them. The ball is going over to our side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The players from Yokohama F. Marinos had kicked the ball over and they were charging towards Golden Flowers\u2019 goal post.</p><br/><p>Moreover, because of the change in goalkeeper, the Golden Flowers team was in a mess. Everyone had charged forward and tried to contest for the ball. At that moment, it was completely too late to return to defense.</p><br/><p>The players from Yokohama F. Marinos cried out ferociously as they increased their speed and widened the distance between them and the Golden Flowers players.</p><br/><p>The player in possession of the ball raised his leg up before passing it to his teammate in front.</p><br/><p>The spectators\u2019 hearts were all tangled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. It\u2019s over. They\u2019ve broken through. Yokohama F. Marinos have broken through our defense. They\u2019re going to score.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Tanaka Hiroshi. He\u2019s the striker from his team. I heard that his shooting power is no joke. Even if you manage to reach it, it would slip from your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. Look. That guy\u2019s speed is increasing. The Golden Flowers players are still ten meters away. They can\u2019t possibly catch up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t. What\u2019s up with that goalkeeper. Why is he still standing there stupidly at this point? Doesn\u2019t he know how to get into position to defend the goal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessional goalkeepers actually look at the opposition\u2019s kicking posture in order to decide which side to defend. However, many goalkeepers can\u2019t react in time at all, so they can only gamble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. They\u2019re getting close. Why isn\u2019t he defending? He\u2019s just standing there like an idiot. Motherf*cker. If they score, I\u2019m going to beat him to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Yokohama F. Marinos player, Tanaka Hiroshi, looked at how the Golden Flowers goalkeeper wasn\u2019t defending at all and he started laughing coldly in his heart.</p><br/><p><em>It seems that he has been scared stiff by my imposing manner or perhaps he knows who I am. He knows that trying to defend will be useless.</em></p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>With a powerful kick, the ball flew from under Tanaka Hiroshi\u2019s feet like a bullet towards the goal post.</p></div>\n</div>"}

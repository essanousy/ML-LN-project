We can\u2019t do anything about it besides seeking help from the leader.\u201d Lin Fan looked at Leader Wang helplessly. This matter wouldn\u2019t be resolved by an average citizen.</p><br/><p>Unless they were to go to arbitration.</p><br/><p>However, who could afford to waste so much time?</p><br/><p>Leader Wang was frustrated. This matter was really troublesome and even he might be useless for it. However, the reporters were all waiting. If he were to do nothing about it, things were going to get worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a call to ask about it,\u201d Leader Wang said. Then, he dialed the number that was given.</p><br/><p>The phone call got through.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, is this Manager Wu? I am the director of the Ministry of Manpower, Wang Shan.\u201d He had the \u2018accent\u2019 of a government official and one would know he was a public service leader after hearing his voice.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Manager Wu was stunned. He immediately greeted politely, \u201cHi, Leader Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is happening at the construction site in Chao Hai Road? Why aren\u2019t the workers paid? You have to know that we care a lot about the workers\u2019 salary problems. The documents have been passed down the chain of command,\u201d Leader Wang said.</p><br/><p>Manager Wu didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cLeader, you don\u2019t know how helpless we are. We signed a contract with external companies and we gave them the funds on time. They didn\u2019t give the salaries and we can\u2019t do anything about that. They can only look for the labor services company. I hope Leader Wang can understand our situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Wu dared to speak rudely to Lin Fan but didn\u2019t dare to do so to Wang Shan. After all, he was a leader from the Ministry of Manpower.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was just a temporary show since it involved his interests. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have given face if it didn\u2019t concern him.</p><br/><p>Wang Shan said, \u201cSo, does that mean that you don\u2019t care about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Wu continued to act, \u201cWe want to be involved but we don\u2019t have the power to do anything. We signed a contract with the construction company. Everything has been given to them. Hence, we really can\u2019t do anything about their salaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to labor arbitration then.\u201d Wang Shan didn\u2019t want to talk too much. As the leader, he knew what the problem was.</p><br/><p>It was just that arbitration needed time and he had to think of something to temporarily resolve the shortage of funds.</p><br/><p>Manager Wu was stunned after hearing that, \u201cLeader Wang, wait. Do we have to go there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Shan said, \u201cLet me ask you this. Did you develop that plot of land?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s developed by our company,\u201d Manager Wu admitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s good. This time, the workers have come here to complain about their salaries. The government takes this very seriously. We have the right to be doubtful of your company\u2019s ability. We will seriously consider this and assess your company to see if it is useful to the development of Shanghai,\u201d Wang Shan said with a stern tone.</p><br/><p>This matter wasn\u2019t really serious initially but Master Lin and the reporters had joined in.</p><br/><p>If this were to be reported, things would definitely go out of hand.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t do anything, who knew what the reports would say about him?</p><br/><p>They might say that the person in charge was incapable.</p><br/><p>If so, people would definitely lose their jobs.</p><br/><p>With respect to the situation with the Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation, the Ministry of Manpower didn\u2019t have any power to handle it. However, other departments will not be quiet about it.</p><br/><p>Manager Wu wasn\u2019t stupid. When he heard that, he was anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Wang, that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished his sentence but Leader Wang had hung up the call.</p><br/><p>Wang Shan sighed, \u201cEveryone, the Ministry of Manpower would definitely follow up with this problem. I will send someone to the labor services company, construction company, and real estate developers to discuss with them about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was prepared to invite them over for \u2018tea\u2019.</p><br/><p>This was at least something for the workers.</p><br/><p>The workers were really satisfied with what he did.</p><br/><p>They had been to the Ministry of Manpower but all they did was fill in some forms. Then, the people just pushed the blame around before everything returned to ground zero. However, now a leader was involved and even reporters were there too.</p><br/><p>They felt that they had to thank Master Lin. If not for him, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach this stage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect the problem to be so complicated and difficult to handle.</p><br/><p>Young Zhao said, \u201cMaster Lin, thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cWhat for? This matter isn\u2019t resolved yet. When it is over, you can thank me then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Zhao smiled and didn\u2019t say anything else but he was really happy. He was determined to be a hardcore fan of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Wang, thank you so much,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wang Shan said, \u201cMaster Lin, I will definitely watch over this and give you an answer in three times. Alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>They left the headquarters of the Ministry of Manpower.</p><br/><p>However, this matter was far from over. They had to follow up with it closely.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was furious, \u201cD*mn it, I get angrier the more I think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said helplessly, \u201cWhat can we do? We have to follow the chain of command.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything. He just ranted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation developing estates when the company has no money? They didn\u2019t give the workers their salaries and kept pushing the blame around. It isn\u2019t an honest company. Everyone, please take note when you\u2019re buying houses.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said it really directly.</p><br/><p>Others wouldn\u2019t have dared to say it so directly. They were afraid of being sued.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid. If they dared to sue him, he was confident of going against them.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin seems really furious today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I haven\u2019t seen Master Lin so furious before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Mother Earth Corporation doing? They actually made Master Lin so angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose that owed salaries deserved to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>At a random luxurious feast.</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng was the boss of Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation.</p><br/><p>He was eating with a bunch of directors and they were discussing some corporate matters.</p><br/><p>One of the directors smiled, \u201cDirector Zhou, your company got in the headlines today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng smiled, \u201cWhat is it? Why didn\u2019t I know anything about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhou, you really don\u2019t know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng replied, \u201cI really don\u2019t know anything. Tell me, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. The matter was blown up. I\u2019m impressed by your calmness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng was confused. He took out his phone and looked at Weibo.</p><br/><p>He was a rather frequent user of Weibo and he knew who Master Lin was. However, when he saw the post, the smile on his face slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Owed salaries?</p><br/><p>How could that be?</p><br/><p>However, there were other directors around and Zhou Guo Sheng didn\u2019t want to seem too agitated. He placed his phone down and faked a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much, this is a small matter. I don\u2019t know what Master Lin is doing. Let\u2019s eat and drink. Let the others resolve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the directors smiled, \u201cElder Zhou, are you really not going to care about this? Master Lin isn\u2019t really a kind man. If he were to start flaming you on Weibo, things are going to get worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of caring about this? We are real estate developers. The houses are there. They\u2019d be there regardless of whether people buy them or not. How could this affect their decisions? This will be resolved by tomorrow.\u201d Zhou Guo Sheng sounded really calm.</p><br/><p>Although he was furious, he didn\u2019t seem to care too much about it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Zhou Shi Ming was not Shanghainese but he wasn\u2019t so easy to take advantage of. Especially when he saw his son in this state, his heart burned with a fury that was hard to extinguish.</p><br/><p>The doctor cut open his pants. When he saw the wound, he gasped. It was quite a deep bite. \u201cThis was from a big dog, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>But what made the doctor curious was that this dog was really strange. The dog had bitten so deep into his leg, it should have torn off a piece of flesh as well. Why was it that there was only a bite mark but not a piece of flesh missing?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis d*mned dog. I have to beat it to death,\u201d Zhou Shi Ming grumbled furiously. His fury had reached its limits. It was as if he would explode at any time.</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cWe have to disinfect it and bandage it up first before injecting the vaccination. But it\u2019s good that his flesh didn\u2019t get bitten off. Otherwise, it would have been troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I can\u2019t just let this be. That Lin has gone overboard. He\u2019s asking for death,\u201d Zhou Jun growled.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t swallow this anger. No matter what, he had to vent it.</p><br/><p><em>Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. I have never been treated like this all my life.</em></p><br/><p><em>I didn\u2019t just get slapped by that Lin, even some normal commoners dared to hit me.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Just rest and recover properly. Dad definitely will not forgive him.\u201d Zhou Shi Ming was furious as well. This matter wouldn\u2019t end here. However, getting back at that Lin would be troublesome.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t an average person. They had to think of a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey even call him \u2018Master Lin\u2019. If he didn\u2019t have this little bit of capability, no one would respect him,\u201d Zhou Jun said angrily. He really despised this Master Lin.</p><br/><p>When the doctor, who was preparing to disinfect the wound, heard this, he frowned. His hands stopped and he placed the medication at the side. \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t treat you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people who were angrily ranting were startled when they heard this.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun started cursing uncontrollably, \u201cWhat the f*ck are you doing? Why can\u2019t you treat me? Weren\u2019t you just about to treat me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor looked at the two of them and said, \u201cMaster Lin is my idol. If you two are scolding my idol, why should I treat you? Get out now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming erupted snapped when he heard \u2018Master Lin\u2019 again. He pointed at the doctor and barked, \u201cCall your director here right now. I want to see whether you\u2019re really so fearless.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor placed his things on the table, then took off his mask. \u201cSorry, this is a private hospital. I am a doctor, but I am also the hospital director. Hence, you\u2019ve already found me but it\u2019s useless. And please don\u2019t talk to me about a doctor\u2019s morals. Master Lin didn\u2019t treat you either. It seems that there\u2019s a problem with you two. I trust my idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201dZhou Shi Ming was cursing his own luck. <em>How did things become like this since we arrived in Shanghai?</em></p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cStop it. Go somewhere else. If you try to sue me, that\u2019s fine too. You can do whatever you like and it\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll just say this: I can\u2019t treat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, you\u2019re good. You\u2019re awesome.\u201d Zhou Shi Ming had given in. The people here were really good at bullying others.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, let\u2019s hurry up. I can\u2019t endure much longer,\u201d yelled Zhou Jun. He was dying from the pain.</p><br/><p>Then, with the support of the driver, they hurriedly left the place to the next hospital.</p><br/><p>But this time, they were smarter. They didn\u2019t talk about the incident anymore. Obviously, they were afraid that this doctor would be another crazy fan of that Lin.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, it would really be f*cked up.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and sighed. Sometimes, things really happened strangely and suddenly.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at Elder Dog. \u201cDoggy, don\u2019t bite people as you like from now on. It\u2019s hard to say if these people have viruses in their blood. If you get infected, it would be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog looked up at Lin Fan and barked gently. He had remembered his words.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to the shop early in the morning. He wasn\u2019t bothered about yesterday\u2019s incident anymore.</p><br/><p>That Zhou Shi Ming or whatever was a tycoon and tycoons might have seemed high and mighty to other people but to Lin Fan, that title didn\u2019t harbour much meaning.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were all queuing outside. They were really looking forward to the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>And within the crowd of people who were queuing, there was an unusual figure.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man was pushing a wheelchair. And in this wheelchair was an elderly lady.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was watching her with great care and he occasionally spoke into her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I heard that this shop\u2019s scallion pancakes are really delicious. If we manage to buy it, let\u2019s go elsewhere to enjoy the scenery.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elderly lady in the wheelchair had a bit of dementia. She wasn\u2019t very responsive to the middle-aged man\u2019s words but she still gave a small acknowledgement.</p><br/><p>Li Hong Shan had come from another part of China to bring his mother to various places across the country to visit. It was considered fulfilling one of his mother\u2019s dreams.</p><br/><p>For many years, he had been grinding at work and bringing his elderly mother around the country.</p><br/><p>The destination this time was Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Back when he was young, his father had passed away early. His mother had been afraid that if she married another man, her son would feel neglected, so she had single-handedly and painstakingly raised him up.</p><br/><p>This time, before coming to Shanghai, Li Hong Shan had done his homework. He had memorised Shanghai\u2019s must-go places. Master Lin\u2019s shop\u2019s scallion pancakes were particularly popular even though he wasn\u2019t certain he would be able to buy the scallion pancake,</p><br/><p>However, he brought his mother to come and queue to just have a go.</p><br/><p>At least he would be able to say that he had been here before.</p><br/><p>Although his mother\u2019s condition had led to his previous marriage failing, he didn\u2019t regret it at all. He only blamed himself for being blind enough to fall for that kind of wife.</p><br/><p>Giving up on his own mother and leaving her to be alone by herself, to Li Hong Shan, was not possible. He had quarreled with his wife until they divorced in the end. He independently took care of his mother from then on. As for a future marriage, he had stopped thinking about that. He only thought about treating his mother well until she passed away.</p><br/><p>They queued for a while but didn\u2019t manage to buy it in the end. It was a bit of a shame.</p><br/><p>But just as he was pushing the wheelchair and about to leave, he heard the shop owner say something that made him interested.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you read and understand the poster on the wall, you don\u2019t have to queue.\u201d</p><br/><p>He decided to have a go. Then, he pushed the wheelchair to the front of the poster and took a close look.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was making scallion pancakes as he couldn\u2019t help but have his attention drawn by Li Hong Shan. To Lin Fan, filial people were all kindhearted. Even those who had done many wrong things had probably been forced by society to change.</p><br/><p>He started looking at Li Hong Shan and reading his physiognomy. He looked very closely.</p><br/><p>Li Hong Shan realized at the boss kept staring at him, so he responded with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled back as a form of greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, how do you confirm if I\u2019ve understood this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve already understood it. Wait until I finish these ten servings, then, I\u2019ll make yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hong Shan was taken aback. It\u2019s <em>been confirmed just like that?</em></p><br/><p><em>That\u2019s really mysterious.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

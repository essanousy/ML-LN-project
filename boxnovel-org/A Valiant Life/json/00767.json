Little Boss\u2019 fortune-telling skills are second to none. They\u2019re 100% accurate. If he says that you have a problem, you definitely have one. As long as you listen to him, you\u2019ll be able to resolve all your problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s a pity that Little Boss doesn\u2019t read anyone\u2019s fortunes anymore. I\u2019m in luck today to have Little Boss look at the date and time for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was praising Lin Fan but he didn\u2019t notice that Huang Guo Hui\u2019s face turned as black as thunder.</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui felt that it was as if Master Lin was smacking his face after rejecting his request and agreeing to look at the eight birth characters of another person.</p><br/><p>He had a high status in the country and he had never been so humiliated before.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He looked at Lin Fan in shock. Then, he sighed. It was good to be young. The youth were always fearless.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even give Huang Guo Hui any face. Who knew what was going to happen next?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the piece of paper and after a while, he asked, \u201cWhen are they going to get engaged?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3rd of March.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPush it to the fourth. By looking at their eight birth characters, they\u2019re suitable to get married on 4th of March.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was curious, \u201cLittle Boss, what\u2019s the difference by shifting it to the 4th of March?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really different. If they get married on the 4th of March, their lives would be better in the future. They would have two children, one boy, and one girl. They\u2019d live in happiness. As for the details, you can ask your relatives. If you\u2019d listen to me, shift it to the 4th of March. If not, let them do whatever they want. It won\u2019t be as good as the 4th of March.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was stunned after hearing that, \u201cLittle Boss, you could tell that they will have a boy and a girl? If they were to get married on 3rd of March, does that mean they wouldn\u2019t have a boy and a girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI can\u2019t say. You can make a guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang trusted Little Boss a lot. He didn\u2019t have any doubts at all. He happily took the piece of paper from him, \u201cLittle Boss, I\u2019ll listen to you. Even if I were to lose my life, I would get them to change it to 4th of March. If they really have a boy and a girl, I will give you a big red packet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thereafter, Elder Liang left happily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Huang Guo Hui, \u201cDirector Huang, please leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui looked at Lin Fan with rage, \u201cI came from such a far place, are you really not going to give me any face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to give you face. I just don\u2019t read fortunes of strangers. Fraud, please send him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian felt a little reluctant. It was difficult for a wealthy man to come by. He wanted to take an advantage of him.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to do it and he had no choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang, please leave. In future, if you would like to eat scallion pancakes, you can come and queue for it. Our scallion pancakes are cheap and absolutely delicious. You\u2019d definitely want to eat it again if you were to try it. You\u2019d probably want to live in Shanghai after that,\u201d Fraud Tian bragged and tried to advertise the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t manage to get a hefty sum, he wanted to get some money from him.</p><br/><p>$50 for a scallion pancake wasn\u2019t expensive.</p><br/><p>If he could get a loyal customer, it would also feel good.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Huang Guo Hui said as he left unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Master Lin, you didn\u2019t have to offend him,\u201d Wu Tian He said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders, \u201cI didn\u2019t offend him. I just told him the truth. I don\u2019t read fortunes anymore. How can he force me to do so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He replied, \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have helped Elder Liang right in front of him. He\u2019d definitely be furious with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cElder Wu, it was on purpose. I just wanted him to see that you can\u2019t just do everything with money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He shook his head and smiled bittersweetly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I saw him for the first time, I felt that he wasn\u2019t a good person. What are the Gods thinking? How can someone as evil as him become a wealthy man? Sigh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He looked at Lin Fan. If he didn\u2019t know the answer, how would Wu Tian He know it?</p><br/><p>With Huang Guo Hui\u2019s personality, he would definitely come back again. However, nobody knew what he was going to do.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, I admire you so much. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t have dared to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at him, \u201cAnd that is why you can only do live streams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn you, Fraud. I realized that you\u2019ve been going against me recently. Is it because I showed you the picture of the pretty lady that time and didn\u2019t give you her number? If I had given it to you, wouldn\u2019t you be destroying her life? Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve been using my picture as your WeChat profile picture to talk to other girls,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was furious after hearing that, \u201cD*mn you, you looked at my phone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cWho looked at your phone? Don\u2019t accuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as he watched them argue with each other.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t really care about Huang Guo Hui. He was a powerful individual and there would definitely be more people coming to look for him in the future. He wasn\u2019t afraid of offending him at all.</p><br/><p>If they dared, they could come and settle scores with him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui sat in his car in rage. He didn\u2019t expect the outcome to turn out this way.</p><br/><p>Master Lin made him really angry. He really didn\u2019t give him any face.</p><br/><p>He was one of the top fifty most wealthy men in the country and his net worth was thirty billion dollars. People treated him like a God. He didn\u2019t expect to be treated like dirt in a small shop here.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang, Master Lin really doesn\u2019t know who he is dealing with,\u201d the chauffeur said furiously.</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui sneered, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he is doing. I\u2019ll finish him.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was normal for a person with status and power to be able to mess with the owner of a small shop.</p><br/><p>He could easily crush him.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan was different. Although he was the owner of a small shop, his status and power were really different.</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui\u2019s son, Huang Hao, found out about what had happened.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao was quite famous on Weibo. In his Weibo group, he was one of the top three most popular men with females.</p><br/><p>The other two were some of the richest men in the country.</p><br/><p>This time, Huang Hao had just returned from overseas and he had been seeing the younger generation of wealthy men becoming famous after scolding people on Weibo. He wanted to be famous too and he also joined in the war to attract females.</p><br/><p>Of course, he couldn\u2019t match up to the other two popular men.</p><br/><p>When he scolded people, he would see first if the other party was a powerful individual. If the person was too powerful, he would stop flaming.</p><br/><p>Hence, he always chose those backup actors and some of the directors of web films.</p><br/><p>He also flamed those people whose net worth were under ten billion dollars.</p><br/><p>Anyway, those people weren\u2019t as wealthy as his dad. Hence, he wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui didn\u2019t even respect those people that tried to look for him after messing with his son. After all, they weren\u2019t on the same level.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao started a discussion on a website and he was happily waiting to read the comments. However, he realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>In the past, he would receive generally positive comments whenever he flamed people, with some negative ones.</p><br/><p>However, it was different this time.</p><br/><p>What was happening?</p><br/><p>He read the comments and was stunned at how negative they were.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom. You\u2019re a f*cking id*ot for daring to flame Master Lin. If not for your dad, you\u2019re nothing at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you for flaming Master Lin. Are you trying to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be an id*ot for flaming Master Lin. Does your skull only contain sh*t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

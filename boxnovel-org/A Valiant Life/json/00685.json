I\u2019ve taken a look at you, and you\u2019re definitely going to come in in the last place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed onto the steering wheel. Lin Fan momentarily experienced a strange feeling. He subsequently turned his head over, \u201cLast place? That\u2019s not acceptable. If I don\u2019t come in first, then I\u2019d consider it as my loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, you want to come in in first place? Do you know Irvine? He\u2019s an internationally renowned racer. There are other awesome drivers as well. If you could come in in first place, pigs would be able to climb trees!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cDo you know how to climb trees?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian couldn\u2019t react in time and replied unhappily, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I know how to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIn that case, isn\u2019t that enough? I\u2019ll get first place for you to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Ye Tong Xian managed to understand. She was so angry, you could visibly see her chest expanding and deflating. \u201cAre you trying to call me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian was so furious she didn\u2019t speak anymore, \u201cHow hateful can you be?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the pit babe appeared. It signified that the race was starting soon.</p><br/><p>Qingtian Bay was specially opened for racing. The start and end point were both here. It was also the most popular racing track in Beijing.</p><br/><p>The pit babe held up the flags. It was as if she was going to drop it anytime soon.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian looked at this scene unfolding before her and she got so scared that she put on her seatbelt. Just at that moment before the start of the race, she had slight regrets.</p><br/><p>Why had she hastily agreed to get on the car? What if something was to happen later? What would she do?</p><br/><p>Right now, there was no way back. There was no way she could escape. She would be the ultimate laughing stock.</p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth and decided to go through with it.</p><br/><p>The flags were fiercely flagged downwards. The race had officially begun!</p><br/><p>One by one, booming sounds lit up the Qingtian Bay.</p><br/><p>Each race car looked like an arrow that shot out. The tail lights of the vehicles looked magnificent in the night sky, seemingly forming a long tail.</p><br/><p>The viewers watching the race immediately surrounded their screens.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Irvine is awesome! He\u2019s able to maintain the first position and he\u2019s leading by quite a margin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so good! The race just started but he\u2019s already managed to lead by such a big gap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQingtian Bay has so many turns. I wonder who designed it. It\u2019s impossible to increase one\u2019s speed even if they want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu was also watching the race. He wouldn\u2019t even consider it if someone was to ask him to participate. It was too dangerous, and it was best not to play with his own life.</p><br/><p>After Chang Hai Ge had been through that ordeal, he had developed a phobia of racing. However, at this moment, looking at the race cars dashing along on the screen, his heartbeat also began to increase in pace.</p><br/><p>Exhilarating!</p><br/><p>It was just too exhilarating!</p><br/><p>Inside the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was calm and composed. He kept on speeding up. He didn\u2019t even take the turns seriously.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian\u2019s heart was practically in her throat. She could feel the increase in speed, especially during the turns, which caused her to scream a little each time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlow down, slow down\u2026 Don\u2019t be in such a rush.\u201d Ye Tong Xian swallowed her saliva as she advised Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t listen to her words, but instead stepped harder on the gas pedal, causing them to surge forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian cried out in fear. Who had asked her to be so insistent on sitting in his car? Now, she was going to die of fright.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled slightly. The fun part was at the end, and they were still far from it.</p><br/><p>There was a black car right in front of them and it was leading by quite a margin. Irvine just loved such extreme speeds.</p><br/><p>The reason why he joined the Qingtian Bay Race was not that he would meet an expert, but rather, because he loved the winding roads here. It was because of that that he was able to enjoy the full attraction of winding roads.</p><br/><p>Many others would slow down when they approach a bend, however, for him, he didn\u2019t need to slow down because of this superior skills and his ability to control the vehicle. It was as if he was putting himself in the mad rush.</p><br/><p>He took a glance behind but all he could see was the black road. There wasn\u2019t a single car in sight.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know long it had been since he had left the others.</p><br/><p>Lonely and unrivaled.</p><br/><p>For Irvine, he was feeling unrivaled at the moment. There was no one that could compete with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly sh*t! Irvine is so good! He has been maintaining the first position and is almost 100 meters away from the second position!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, the distance between them is still increasing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA professional is a professional after all. He\u2019s not someone that amateurs are able to compete with. Others reduce their speed at bends, but he, instead, increases his speed. How disgusting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Irvine started to reduce his speed. It wasn\u2019t because he was waiting for the car behind, but rather, there was a turn ahead that was extremely hard to maneuver. From his experience, he would definitely overturn if he kept his current speed.</p><br/><p>Previously, when he had made this turn, he had to maintain a speed of 100 kilometers per hour. Yet, each time he participated in this competition, he would gradually increase this speed. As of right now, he would be able to make the turn if he maintained a speed of 110 kilometers per hour.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, he realized that there was a vehicle behind him, and it was traveling at a very fast speed. He estimated it to be at least 180 kilometers per hour.</p><br/><p>Irvine laughed. This person would rather have speed over his life. Could it be that he didn\u2019t know how difficult the turn up ahead was? At such an extreme speed, he would definitely overturn his car.</p><br/><p>However, from what Irvine could tell, the other party intended to catch up with his vehicle before slowing down. In that case, let\u2019s see when he\u2019ll decrease his speed!</p><br/><p>*cheers*</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, Irvine saw that the car had overtaken his. He couldn\u2019t help but smile a little. It was time for him to display his true skills. He would let the other party see his abilities at the moment he makes the turn.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden!</p><br/><p>Irvine was stupefied.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>He realized that the car didn\u2019t slow down, but instead, it kept increasing its speed. How was this possible?</p><br/><p>Inside the car.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian kept screaming, \u201cSlow down, slow down! I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, she was simply terrified. This fellow beside him kept on increasing his speed. Moreover, when he made turns, he didn\u2019t even slow down. She was scared to death.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and calmly said, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to slow down for? I feel that this speed is still not enough. Take a look, it\u2019s already at 220 kilometers per hour. Don\u2019t you have the feeling that we\u2019re about to take off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian shut her eyes. She didn\u2019t dare to open them at all. Would you dare to picture the turn right in front of you when you open your eyes? Imagine the feeling of the car being able to take off into flight at any time.</p><br/><p>He kept increasing his speed.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian\u2019s face became whiter and whiter. Her stomach was in a complete mess. Her organs were flipping around inside her as if they would burst out of her at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, do you want to see some acrobatics?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian immediately shook her head, \u201cPlease no, please no! I\u2019m begging you not to drive so fast! I\u2019m still young and I don\u2019t wish to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t! Let me show you my famous stunt, 360-degree rotation!\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He then proceeded to step on the gas pedal even more aggressively and violently hit the steering wheel.</p><br/><p>*squeak*</p><br/><p>There was an ear-piercing screech when the car tires rubbed against the road surface. A billow of smoke could be seen in the night sky.</p><br/><p>Just as the vehicle approached the turn, the car began to rotate.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian felt as if she was going to fly out at any time. As she was being rotated, her eyesight was all in a blur and she almost collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa!\u201d She couldn\u2019t take this anymore and began to cry out loud. This baby was on the verge of being scared to death.</p><br/><p>When Irvine saw the butt of the vehicle, all he could see was the car making several rotations. He was momentarily stunned. Then, a string of vulgarities followed.</p><br/><p>He felt as if he had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>However, in a blink of an eye, the car was completely gone. Not even the butt of the car could be seen.</p><br/><p>The audience was left speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dreaming, am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

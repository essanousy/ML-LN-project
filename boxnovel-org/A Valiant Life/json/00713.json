Could the two of them have gotten it wrong? How could something like that happen in Master Lin\u2019s Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute? Moreover, a while ago, all of Master Lin\u2019s children had won prizes at the Youth Cup competition organized by the Chinese Arts Association. Although it didn\u2019t have a huge impact, all the reporters knew about this and even specially reported this piece of news, calling those children Chinese Art geniuses.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan was now filled with a desire to cause public dispute so that he could bring the child back with him and then have the child checked at a hospital. How could he have noticed Reporter Jiang\u2019s expression?</p><br/><p>\u201cNanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. The person-in-charge has the surname Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Jiang was still in disbelief. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan said, \u201cOf course we\u2019re sure. I remember that name clearly. How could we have gotten it wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Jiang said, \u201cBrother Jiang, even if it\u2019s Master Lin\u2019s Welfare Institute, they can\u2019t be so overbearing. These people are the child\u2019s relatives. What rights does the Welfare Institute have to refuse them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan knew what they meant when they said \u2018Master Lin\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, they didn\u2019t think about all this. All they wanted was to cause public protests so that they could bring Lil\u2019 Fatty back.</p><br/><p>The Chief Editor\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>Reporter Jiang couldn\u2019t quite figure it out. He felt that it would be best to report this to the Chief Editor first to see if the Chief Editor would have a solution. \u201cChief Editor, a couple has come and they\u2019re talking about a certain situation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After explaining the full situation, Reporter Jiang asked, \u201cChief Editor, what do you think we should do about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chief Editor stayed silent for a moment before saying, \u201cWe\u2019re news workers and we rely on news to make a living. But you should go to the Welfare Institute to see if the situation is really like what they have said. If it\u2019s true, you can write an article about this but don\u2019t add in your own opinions and emotions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Jiang nodded, \u201cUnderstood, Chief Editor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin was very well known and very well-liked by reporters, they still had to get news. However, they would definitely only report the truth and they wouldn\u2019t add in personal opinions.</p><br/><p>To be able to do this was already pretty good.</p><br/><p>After all, some reporters would add in their personal emotions when writing news articles. Sometimes, their rhythm would be brought up because of this.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A phone call woke Lin Fan up from his sleep. The caller was Han Lu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>A panicky voice came from the other end of the call, \u201cMaster Lin, something has happened. Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s Uncle and Aunt have put up a report online about our Welfare Institute and the two of them are at our entrance right now with a banner in their hands, demanding for Lil\u2019 Fatty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s really happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Just look at the news. The number of spectators around here is increasing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan unlocked his phone. Indeed, a news article appeared before him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Relatives want to bring home their nephew but Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute refuses to hand over the child.\u2019</p><br/><p>With a quick scan, he could tell that this article wasn\u2019t biased towards any side. Instead, it was curiously investigating the incident and was rather fair and unbiased.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the comments below varied greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe child\u2019s own relatives have come. Why won\u2019t the Welfare Institute hand over the child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWelfare Institutes nowadays are very corrupted. There are countless cases of child abuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis f*cking Welfare Institute. The child\u2019s relatives have come, what rights do they have to not hand over the child? The best education is to let the child be with his relatives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person-in-charge of this Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute is Master Lin. I can\u2019t quite understand why Master Lin is doing this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to my knowledge, Master Lin puts his heart into managing Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and the children there are all very fortunate. But now that the child\u2019s relatives have come, I think that the child should be handed over. I feel that Master Lin hasn\u2019t handled this matter well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^that makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, on the other hand, feel that it is best if Master Lin takes care of these children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the relatives aren\u2019t the child\u2019s parents, why should the child leave with them? The child should be allowed to decide for himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I feel like Master Lin is like a news envoy. Just after a short period of time, Master Lin has appeared once again. This is scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The comment section was bustling but there weren\u2019t any extreme actions. To some netizens, this matter was a great topic of discussion and they each had their own opinions.</p><br/><p>The entrance of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped his car and looked into the distance. There was a crowd standing across the road from the Welfare Institute. It seemed very noisy over there.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Director Huang was outside and it seemed like she was relating something to them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan were raising their banner. When they saw Lin Fan, they shouted, \u201cHe\u2019s here! That guy is here! He\u2019s the one who won\u2019t let our nephew go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the child\u2019s relatives. We\u2019ve done all the proper procedures. Why won\u2019t he let him go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! That\u2019s the person who is detaining our nephew in the Welfare Institute. I don\u2019t even know how much our nephew has suffered in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at Lin Fan. Naturally, they all recognized him. After all, there weren\u2019t many people in Shanghai who didn\u2019t know about Master Lin. Even if they hadn\u2019t seen him before, they would\u2019ve heard about him.</p><br/><p>Upon reaching the entrance, Lin Fan walked straight into the Welfare Institute without looking back for a single moment.</p><br/><p>Director Huang followed closely behind. \u201cMaster Lin, what do you think we should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need to care about them. Let them keep making noise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty was cowering behind Han Lu. He had already seen the situation outside and he was very afraid.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s side and patted him on his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Uncle Lin won\u2019t let them take you away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty nodded but it was clear that this incident had affected him greatly.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan saw that the opposition was ignoring them and became anxious. However, they didn\u2019t do anything too drastic. Qiu Yan Lan sat on the ground and started wailing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you, please hand over my nephew. We\u2019ll give you anything you want. Just let our nephew go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy nephew\u2019s father passed away prematurely and his mother remarried. We\u2019re his only remaining relatives. How can you be so heartless\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the older men and women spectating were already tearing. Then, they started yelling our furiously as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you do something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are simply a brute! Hurry up and hand the child over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHand him over! Hurry up and hand him over! His only relatives are here, what rights do you have to keep the child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sisters, don\u2019t worry. If they don\u2019t hand the child over, we\u2019ll snatch him over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. How can something like this happen in our peaceful society? What is the police doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was very easily riled up. To them, Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan were the weak and people would always stand on the side of the weak.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, all this wouldn\u2019t have happened. It had initially just been a small conflict but now, the crowd had been enraged and they were all protesting.</p><br/><p>Hearing all this noise outside, Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed as he stood at the metal gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, shut up. You don\u2019t know anything and yet you\u2019re blindly making such a ruckus.</p><br/><p>However, the shouts did not stop. Instead, the crowd became even more agitated.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

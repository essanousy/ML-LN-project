However, it was different today. The entire Internet was filled with news about the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>A few of the townfolks opened their phones and were given a scare.</p><br/><p>This Shanghai TV must have too much money. They actually bought so much news space. Is there really a need to?</p><br/><p>Even if it was the finale, they need not be so fierce.</p><br/><p>\u2018The \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 had a perfect finale. Master Lin sang a \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 that made the entire audience cry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What kind of magical power does Master Lin have? To actually be able to make everyone cry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Shock! Yesterday, every part of the country had many residents in endless suffering. The reason was actually that of\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The magical voice has appeared, stunning many people.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin has produced a miracle. If you don\u2019t listen to this song you will regret it forever.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The whole news was filled with such of news. Everyone was stunned and did not know what happened. How could something so scary happen?</p><br/><p>Did the authors eat the wrong medication today?</p><br/><p>\u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 had already ended, the champion had already been crowned. However, the thing that made people feel pretty awkward was that there was very little news regarding the champion.</p><br/><p>In the morning, Chen Rui An happily looked at the news. When he saw that it was filled with news about the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 he was very happy. However, when he took a closer look, he realized that it was all about Master Lin and was momentarily dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What in the world was this?</p><br/><p>Was he not the champion? Why didn\u2019t he see any news about himself?</p><br/><p>He felt like this till he saw a small article about him in the news. Chen Rui An could not help but feel gratified and happy. He did not care, as long as he was on the news, that was enough.</p><br/><p>The main page on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this Master Lin\u2019s voice is really very scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, ^ do you feel like dying after listening to it? I had good foresight and did not listen to it. If not, I would not be able to sleep afterward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? You actually haven\u2019t heard it yet? I think you\u2019ll regret that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s singing has left me completely speechless. How is such a sound possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Heavens, oh Mother Earth, please save me. I\u2019m an old man and I haven\u2019t cried in 10 over years. Last night I actually cried like I was breaking down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you guys are too fake. Regardless of how good it is, it can\u2019t possibly be like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it you can go listen to it for yourself. Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>At some office.</p><br/><p>Wang Hua was a regular office worker. When he was bored, he would browse Weibo. When he saw the main page and saw all the news, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Which bigshot is so awesome? To actually be able to dominate the headlines just like that.</p><br/><p>What kind of song is so amazing to be able to make people crying after listening to it? Who are they trying to cheat?</p><br/><p>There were several discussions talking about how good the song was but he still refused to believe it.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was proficient in many other fields, but how could also be amazing at singing? It was a normal thing to play music in the office, as long as it wasn\u2019t too loud that it would not disturb the other colleagues.</p><br/><p>However, he still gave his colleagues a heads up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to play a song. If you guys feel it isn\u2019t nice, then tell me,\u201d Wang Hua said.</p><br/><p>Some of his colleagues momentarily laughed and then said, \u201cWho\u2019s song is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hua did not say much and started typing on his keyboard. He searched for a moment and was able to find the song.</p><br/><p>This was from a big shot who just cut out the part of him singing from the video. The title of it was even more amusing.</p><br/><p>\u2018While trying to get this clip, I ended up breaking down in tears. After listening to it, please give it a like.\u2019</p><br/><p>What made Wang Hua more cautious was that the comments below were pretty mysterious and confusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready liked it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I was crying while listening to it and the people next to me thought I was crazy.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019m begging you, are there any more songs from him?\u2019</p><br/><p>Wang Hua shook his head. These people were really exaggerating. What kind of song would be so amazing to such an extent? A group of exaggerating b*stards. Then, he started playing the song.</p><br/><p>There were no accompanying instrumentals.</p><br/><p>There was a moment of complete silence.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a sound started to come. At that moment, Wang Hua was in disbelief and was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>Originally, there were some of his colleagues typing on their keyboards. However, slowly, the sound of typing started to disappear and everyone was all attentively listening to the sound.</p><br/><p>They felt more and more emotional as they continued to listen to it.</p><br/><p>Wa!</p><br/><p>They started crying.</p><br/><p>Wang Hua rubbed his eyes and there were actually tears.</p><br/><p>This was a feeling that he simply could not control. The sound had struck a nerve and had hit him at his weakest point inside.</p><br/><p>The song ended.</p><br/><p>The office was momentarily in silence. Then, some of his colleagues hurried to ask, \u201cWang Hua, what is the name of this song? How come I\u2019ve never heard it before? It is really too good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hua finally understood what the people online were saying.</p><br/><p>This song really had some indescribable magical feeling. This was not to say that this song had anything supernatural about it, but it was the voice that was impossible for them to resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Teacher Lin\u2019s \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 from \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. It had no accompanying instrumentals and this was not some music channel but just some segment in a TV show.\u201d</p><br/><p>When his colleagues knew about the song, they hurried to go and search for it and played it over and over again.</p><br/><p>Gradually, everyone was sucked into it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Online.</p><br/><p>There were several big shots in the music industry who woke up and realized the Internet was buzzing.</p><br/><p>Also, they were all buzzing about Shanghai TV\u2019s \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>This made many of them feel uncomfortable. The show had already ended and should not continue to be blowing up. There were several celebrities who went on Weibo to express their opinions, saying that they were against this.</p><br/><p>Some of the celebrities who already dominated the headlines were even more expressive with their displeasure when they realized that their spot in the headlines had been stolen.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, some of the big shots in the music industries were unhappy with these headlines.</p><br/><p>Best sounding voice!</p><br/><p>Most moving lyrics!</p><br/><p>The best in the music industry!</p><br/><p>And so on.</p><br/><p>When they saw that this title was being thrown to an outsider, they were extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>There was no number one when it came to literature but there was in martial arts.</p><br/><p>To them, singing was like literature.</p><br/><p>Whether it was the god of singing or the worst, no one dared to say they were the best in the field of singing.</p><br/><p>This was because when it came to judging a song, some people will like it and some will not. Opinions were always different. So even if the song got good results, they will still be very humble about it.</p><br/><p>But now, there was actually someone claiming to be the best in the music industry.</p><br/><p>At this moment, they could not control themselves.</p><br/><p>In the chat group of people in the music industry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too arrogant. The best in the music industry? I feel like laughing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNowadays there are all sorts of people in this world. Just ignore this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already flamed them on Weibo. Are there really people that are this arrogant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s Master Lin, he also can\u2019t be that arrogant. We have to properly subdue him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussion on the chat group was very intense. With regards to this issue, they did not approve of it and they also felt especially annoyed.</p><br/><p>But at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow teachers, have you guys heard this song yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I listen to it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow good can it possibly be? I\u2019ve been in the music industry for ten over years, I\u2019ve heard all kinds of lyrics already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeachers, I suggest that you guys listen to it first before giving your opinions if not you guys will be giving yourself a bad reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKick this b*stard. Don\u2019t boost his ambition while extinguishing our might!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kicked him already.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group leader had already kicked him out of the group.</p><br/><p>However, the famous singers in the group, in the end, decided to just listen to it.</p><br/><p>Once they heard the song, the originally rowdy group quietened down. Not a single person said a word.</p><br/><p>The few famous singers who had flamed him on Weibo suddenly deleted their posts. It was like nothing had even happened.</p></div>\n</div>"}

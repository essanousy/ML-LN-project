Everyone was stunned when they saw her. Then, a beautiful lady involuntarily said, \u201cSis, your stomach is so big and you look like you\u2019re about to give birth. Why are you here at the art exhibition?\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s flora and fauna artworks. Today, I want my unborn child to look at the artworks through my eyes. I hope he can develop an interest in art in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around her laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a pretty good experience. However, where are your family members? Isn\u2019t it inconvenient for you to be here alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady smiled. \u201cThey just went to the washroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she stood before Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s most renown flora and fauna artwork. \u201cThis \u2018Hundred flowers fighting to bloom\u2019 is his best artwork. Today, there were people who offered three million dollars for it but he couldn\u2019t bear to sell it. I guess that\u2019s what makes it even more valuable.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man beside her smiled. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t see the artwork there, I\u2019d have said that this one is the most magnificent floral artwork. However, the \u2018Hundred birds looking up to the Phoenix\u2019 artwork is inarguably the most magnificent one here. I\u2019ve seen many art exhibitions and a lot of vintage works by grandmasters in the past but they can\u2019t match up to this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady\u2019s eyes lit up when she heard what the man said. \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man pointed forward. \u201cIt\u2019s the one there. There are quite a lot of people there. Everyone\u2019s been praising it. It\u2019s impressive. Your first look at it will make it seem like it\u2019s come to life. You will be mesmerized by it after a few looks. It\u2019s simply too grand and captivating. Although Master Lin is an unknown man, the value and precision of this artwork is definitely one of the best. If not, it might even be the best. Perhaps even Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s best artwork can\u2019t match up to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady was stunned. \u201cThat can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Go have a look and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m saying,\u201d the middle-aged man smiled and said.</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady touched Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s \u2018Hundred flowers\u2019 artwork and went forward. She wanted to see the \u2018Hundred birds\u2019 drawing if it was that mesmerizing and captivating.</p><br/><p>When a bunch of men and women saw the pregnant lady walking away from the \u2018Hundred flowers\u2019 artwork, they frowned. However, they still followed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cChange of target.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred birds looking up to the Phoenix.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady was mumbling to herself but nobody heard what she was saying.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hundred birds looking up to the Phoenix.\u2019</p><br/><p>The pregnant woman stood before the artwork and she looked at it closely. She realized that it was indeed extraordinary. What the person had used to describe it was extremely accurate.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s best artwork couldn\u2019t even match up to this. It was literally on another level.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Hundred flowers\u2019 artwork was considered to be one of the best of the arts industry and it was valued at three million dollars. That was because Yue Qiu Ju Shi was still alive. If he died, the price would definitely skyrocket. It was way better than the typical vintage artworks. Furthermore, it would be more exclusive as a collector\u2019s item.</p><br/><p>However, after looking at this artwork, the pregnant lady had a change of mind. The price was no longer based on time and its history. It depended on the artwork itself and even if the artist wasn\u2019t famous, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>Because this artwork\u2019s technique and charm could negate the effects of other factors.</p><br/><p>She just stood in front of the artwork silently and the surrounding art lovers gradually moved behind as they saw that she was a pregnant lady. The artwork wasn\u2019t something that could be fully appreciated by the naked eye. It had to be enjoyed slowly because this would allow one to feel the emotions being conveyed by it.</p><br/><p>The artwork had such a high value as a collector\u2019s piece.</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady only had that in mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the pregnant lady was in pain and she held onto her stomach. She slowly kneeled on the ground and liquid started to flow out in between her legs.</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd was stunned when they saw this sight. They hadn\u2019t expected a pregnant lady to collapse in front of this artwork.</p><br/><p>Then, a man rushed over and asked anxiously, \u201cMa\u2019am, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady cried, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I was too affected by this artwork and now my abdomen hurts. I think I\u2019m going to give birth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man raised his head and took out his work permit. \u201cEveryone, I\u2019m a doctor. This woman is about to give birth. If anyone of you knows anything about this, please come over and help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd just looked at each other curiously. Who would know how to do it?</p><br/><p>Then, a young couple came forward and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security officer came and when he saw the liquid on the floor, he was stunned. \u201cDid her water bag burst?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man nodded. \u201cYes, I called for the ambulance but she has to give birth now. If not, the mother and the child would be in danger. Please take some cloth here and block this area out. Also, if there\u2019s warm water, please bring some too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding people quickly excused themselves. They didn\u2019t stand around to watch to prevent affecting the procedures. The security officers were also at a loss as it was the first time they had encountered this.</p><br/><p>Some courageous men went to tear down some of the curtains. Then, they raised it up, \u201cDoctor, don\u2019t worry about other things. Leave it to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor nodded. \u201cAlright, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a series of cries and the people were anxious after hearing it.</p><br/><p>The security officer in charge quickly went behind to inform Yue Qiu Ju Shi.</p><br/><p>But when he reached the outside of the private room, he was denied entry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to enter. There\u2019s something ongoing inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>He anxiously replied, \u201cNo, something happened outside. We need Master Yue Qiu\u2019s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person guarding the door hesitated for a moment before he opened the door to let him in.</p><br/><p>Then, in the room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood before a drawing table and he was drawing something.</p><br/><p>The man wanted to say something but Yue Qiu Ju Shi glared at him, implying that he should keep quiet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was busy drawing and didn\u2019t raise his head. He just said, \u201cGo out, do not disrupt me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the room looked at Yue Qiu Ju Shi as if they were asking him to get the person out.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi looked at him and raised his hand, gesturing for him to go out.</p><br/><p>The person helplessly left the room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and smirked.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady\u2019s cries were a little frightening. The people around her were extremely anxious and some young men took the initiative to ensure that the procedures could be done smoothly. They hadn\u2019t expected this to happen but they had to do something to help.</p><br/><p>Then, they looked at the area which was covered by curtains. They wondered how the situation was.</p><br/><p>But they felt that it must have been an extremely dangerous case after hearing her cries. They just hoped that the mother and child would be safe.</p><br/><p>Within the covered area.</p><br/><p>The lady was squatting there and she was expressionless. She purposely made the cries and then she nodded at the two people beside her. They were going to switch the artwork for a fake one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They weren\u2019t planning to circulate the handwritten book from Shanghai just within the Association. They were planning to circulate it on the market.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan knew how well the book would do in the market, perhaps only those who were into Chinese medicine would buy it. The others would definitely not buy it, even some Chinese medical Doctors wouldn\u2019t buy it because they wouldn\u2019t know what it was talking about. It was just for them to learn about things that they didn\u2019t really need.</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan was concerned about was the number of people that would understand the content after it was circulated.</p><br/><p>If he was able to receive Encyclopedic Points whenever someone read the book, he would\u2019ve circulated it a long time ago. However, it wasn\u2019t that easy to obtain Encyclopedic Points. Only those that studied it were able to give him extra points.</p><br/><p>At the association.</p><br/><p>The relevant members had reached. They didn\u2019t know why the director called them over.</p><br/><p>This type of meeting was always only used for important things and nothing else.</p><br/><p>In the conference room.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan looked around and said, \u201cEveryone\u2019s here. I have two important things to tell all of you. Now, let\u2019s get Vice-President Wang to show you all the book that was promised this morning. Of course, this is just for everyone to have a look. We have more things to talk about after this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng passed the things down and everyone was a little puzzled by the cover of the book.</p><br/><p>The name of the book suggested that it had something to do with Chinese medicine but they had never seen it before.</p><br/><p>Then, they flipped to the first page.</p><br/><p>Initially, they didn\u2019t care much about it but suddenly, everyone started to look more serious. At first, there were still people whispering but it was totally silent now. There was only the sound of the pages being flipped.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan smiled. The Chinese doctors that were able to enter the association\u2019s management board were capable doctors. Some of the other members entered via connections and some of them couldn\u2019t even get any recognition for their Chinese medical skills. If they wanted to be part of the management board, they had to go through an interview. The interview was simple, it was just a discussion of Chinese medical knowledge.</p><br/><p>Some of the Chinese medical doctors these days didn\u2019t even know the basics. Furthermore, some of them who had the Chinese medical certificate didn\u2019t even know the twelve meridians. Wouldn\u2019t they ruin lives by incorrectly treating patients?</p><br/><p>They all knew about this situation.</p><br/><p>Some of them had been workers in the healthcare system for a long time and were thus issued certificates. After a certain time, they could say that they were old Chinese doctors.</p><br/><p>Therefore, this type of occurrence was common within the country.</p><br/><p>*cough* Zhou Qing Quan cleared his throat, \u201cAlright, you guys have read the content. This book is exceptionally beneficial to Chinese medicine. The content is good and everyone can bring it home to study it slowly. Now, I\u2019m going to talk about something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is, the association will have a new Vice-President soon,\u201d Zhou Qing Quan said.</p><br/><p>This news wasn\u2019t their main focal point. To them, the book was much more important.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, you can handle this matter. We feel that the more important question should be, where did this book come from?\u201d The crowd asked.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan smiled, \u201cThis was written by our new Vice-President. Do you think it\u2019s important now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned and there was a commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, where is the new Vice-President? Although we haven\u2019t read a lot of it, the content of this can\u2019t have been written by an average person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the content is written concisely and it is easy to understand. It\u2019s really beneficial for us to read it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we could speak to him directly, perhaps we might benefit even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan waved his hand, \u201cAlright, please quieten down. This master isn\u2019t in Beijing. He is situated in Shanghai. You can meet him in the future. The Master\u2019s name is Lin Fan. Remember that. We can address him as Master Lin. In the future, please be more courteous to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all a little excited. As Chinese doctors, they wanted to meet this knowledgeable man and speak to him as they felt that they would benefit from it even more.</p><br/><p>They felt that it was an honor for someone like him to join the association.</p><br/><p>The future of Chinese medicine seemed bleak. Everyone knew that. The public didn\u2019t really trust Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lying down leisurely. Suddenly, he opened his eyes and there were notifications from the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopedic Points +1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopedic Points +1.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone had understood it.</p><br/><p>The numbers steadily increased.</p><br/><p>He immediately received fifty Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated. He didn\u2019t expect himself to really succeed. However, fifty Encyclopedic Points were quite little and he expected to gain even more.</p><br/><p>However, he thought about it and realized it had been only a few days. It was remarkable to obtain fifty Encyclopedic Points within such a short timeframe.</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan didn\u2019t know was that the association\u2019s Chinese medical doctors were busy discussing the book.</p><br/><p>When different people read the book, they experienced different things.</p><br/><p>Although the explanations were clear, they were old Chinese medical Doctors and they naturally had their own ways of thinking. The debates were inevitable.</p><br/><p>The people in the association kept discussing it and they experienced different feelings whenever they talked about it.</p><br/><p>It was as if they had entered a new world.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a middle-aged man carried a bucket of water into the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and was stunned. \u201cBro, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smiled, \u201cLittle Boss, nothing much. I saw that you ran out of clean water here as so I bought a bucket for you. You\u2019ve been busy making twenty pancakes a day. I\u2019ve already successfully bought them two days in a row! You\u2019re such a kind Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled awkwardly, \u201cNo, no, there\u2019s no need to trouble yourself. Also, I\u2019m not a kind Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man changed the water and waved his hand, \u201cLittle Boss, I\u2019m not just praising you for the sake of it. You really are a kind man. Twenty pieces a day! It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve never dared to think about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Little Boss, please rest. It\u2019s tiring to make twenty scallion pancakes a day. Please take care! I\u2019ll make a move now,\u201d the middle-aged man said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved, \u201cAlright, thanks! Have a safe journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at him as he left and smiled. \u201cA kind man. Looks like I\u2019m indeed a kind man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian turned around and said, \u201cI think something has been wrong with you recently. If you\u2019re not going crazy, then it means that you\u2019re going to go away for another long trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Am I that kind of person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d Fraud Tian shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sneered, \u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

They even brought out the appointment of Vice-President, what else could Lin Fan say? Of course, he had to accept it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was giggling, \"President Lin, please take care of us from now on.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tilted his head, \"Just do your work properly.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded his head and bowed, \"Don't you worry, President. I will do my work well, you will surely be satisfied.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them made eye contact, then burst into laughter simultaneously.</p><br/><p>\"Outrageous\u2026\" At that moment, the sound of Wu You Lan's exasperation could be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan were both laughing happily when they heard her. They were curious, \"What's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was looking at her phone with a furious look on her face. Then, she brought the phone over to them and said, \"Look, these 'role models' are outrageous. To do things like that. Now, they're even sending out letters from their lawyers to say that it's all fake and asking for the real troublemakers to take responsibility.\"</p><br/><p>\"What's the situation? Let me take a look,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said furiously, \"I'll send you the link. It's that Weibo news article that's been trending.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Fraud Tian unlocked their phones and opened the link. Then, they both looked curiously.</p><br/><p>It wasn't long before Fraud Tian started to cry out in rage, \"This is really outrageous! For this old dog to make a move on such a beautiful lady\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, on the other hand, was much calmer. It was indeed a little outrageous.</p><br/><p>\"I'm the best friend of the victim. I know where I stand. I love my alma mater, but there are impurities wherever you go. I'm not afraid of offending anyone, I just want justice for my best friend. Starlight Film School's Professor Jiang Li and Cheng Juan often use their authority for personal gain. They threatened to withhold graduation certificates and fail courses of the students. They would also do inappropriate things to the students. My good friend Huang Miao Miao was violated to a great degree by Professor Jiang Li. And was threatened that if she dared to tell anyone, she wouldn't receive her graduation certificate. At the same time, her class teacher Chen Juan forbid other students from interacting with her...what I've said above is 100% true. If it's fake, I'm willing to face the law and take responsibility for it.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had a great sense of righteousness. At that moment, her small face was red as a tomato, \"These people are disgusting! These students have spoken the truth, yet, not a single person has dared to report it, nor has any other student spoken out. If no one lends a hand in this, the matter will slowly die down and just be swept away.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the article but didn't say anything. Then, out of curiosity, he searched for Jiang Li and Chen Juan on Baidu.</p><br/><p>With one look, they were really impressive. They both had high standings in Starlight Film School. In fact, they were influential people in the education scene. A significant number of current superstars were once students of theirs. What's more, that Jiang Li had an impressive background. His father used to be a famous director.</p><br/><p>He had their photos. He had their birth dates. It was enough for a rough fortune reading.</p><br/><p>According to his reading, this Chen Juan was the teacher of the victim, Huang Miao Miao. Also, this Chen Juan and Jiang Li worked together. It wasn't the first time that Jiang Li had performed such a deed. Those students that were victimized by him either just suffered in silence or received enough benefits for them to just keep it to themselves.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's final conclusion was: They were indeed two old b*stards.</p><br/><p>For a man and a woman to be partners in these evil deeds, it was unusual.</p><br/><p>Starlight Film School.</p><br/><p>Huang Miao Miao sat at the school lawn. She was in a bit of a daze. She had been faced with a large amount of stress recently and her energy levels suffered as a result.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yi Mo was that good friend of hers. At that moment, she held Huang Miao Miao in her embrace, \"Don't worry, Miao Miao. I'll definitely get justice for you.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Miao Miao murmured, \"Yi Mo, you'll offend someone and they won't forgive you. Let's just forget about this incident. I don't want to drag you into it.\"</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo shook her head, \"Don't worry, I'm not afraid. It doesn't matter even if I don't get my graduation certificate. I already have shows to act in. They can't do anything to me. You told me about this incident. As your best friend, I won't just sit still and do nothing. If I just did that like the rest of them, I won't be at peace with myself. It doesn't matter how this matter turns out. I'm not afraid of being expelled or being outcasted from this industry in future. At least next time, I will be able to tell my children proudly that their Mum has lived a life without any shame.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, her phone rang.</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo answered the call, \"Good morning, Director Li.\"</p><br/><p>Director Li: \"You're not suitable for this show. Someone else has been chosen as the female lead.\"</p><br/><p>*beep beep*</p><br/><p>The call was hung up.</p><br/><p>Huang Miao Miao looked up, \"Yi Mo, that call just now\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo was a little upset, but she didn't show it, \"It was nothing. Some idiot called, so I hung up.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, two girls passed by the lawn. They pointed at Huang Miao Miao as they gossiped to each other.</p><br/><p>\"That's her. She's really a problem child. It's not the first or even the second time that Professor Jiang Li has done this, but she just has to spout nonsense all day, trying to make a big deal out of it.\" A rather good-looking girl who had shot a few commercials before said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo stood up, \"Hold it there! What are you trying to say? It's not you in her position, so of course, you feel that it's nonsense. Oh wait, maybe if you guys were in her position, you would be happy. You superficial whores!\"</p><br/><p>\"You sure talk a lot!\" barked the two girls in anger.</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo rolled up her sleeves, \"What? Do you want to fight? Come at me if you dare! If I don't break your faces, my surname isn't Xia!\"</p><br/><p>The two girls got frightened and left.</p><br/><p>At that moment, another call came. It was from the Headmaster.</p><br/><p>Headmaster: \"Xia Yi Mo, are you so great that you have to have to interfere with every matter? You better remove that post from Weibo right now. Do you know how much of a negative impact your false remarks have on the school?\"</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo argued angrily, \"I'm not making false remarks, it's the truth!\"</p><br/><p>Headmaster: \"I don't care if it's false or real, just remove it right now! Unless you don't want your graduation certificate. Professor Jiang Li and Professor Chen Juan are already carrying out the legal procedures to look into your doings.\"</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo, \"Don't give me the graduation certificate then. Do you think they can just hide the truth from the masses? I'll get support from celebrities on Weibo to help me spread the truth regarding this matter. I'm not afraid of causing a ruckus, nor am I afraid of any threats. The truth is the truth and they will face the law for what they have done.\"</p><br/><p>The headmaster laughed coldly, then hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>The headmaster said, \"Professor Jiang, Professor Chen, this idiot doesn't know what's good for her. She wants celebrities to spread her message on Weibo and cause a ruckus.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Li was fifty years of age. He wore spectacles and appeared gentle and polite. His face was that of a righteous man, but it was all just a facade. He couldn't help but start laughing.</p><br/><p>He had been in this field for tens of years, he wasn't inexperienced.</p><br/><p>What can some little girl do? Is she waiting for some celebrity to spread the message? Let's see which celebrity dares to do so.</p><br/><p>Chen Juan was a well-groomed lady. Regarding this matter, she wasn't bothered at all. This matter would eventually die down and it won't affect her at all. A little lady who hadn't even stepped into society wants to challenge them? She had a long way to go.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

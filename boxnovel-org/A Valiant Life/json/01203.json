Thank you for all you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s what I ought to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan received the commendation certificate, he raised it up high. Although it was not of much use, it was a great sense of achievement.</p><br/><p>Then, he put it down before shaking the prize presenter\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>It was Lin Fan\u2019s proudest moment thus far.</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at the cameras in front.</p><br/><p>The camera shutters clicked repeatedly.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin clapped enthusiastically for the man on the stage was his son.</p><br/><p>At Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s close friends and relatives were gathered in front of their televisions.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, that\u2019s Lin\u2019s son! I\u2019m so, so proud of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The relatives smiled as they watched the scenes on television.</p><br/><p>It is normal to have some conflicts between relatives due to trifles but these conflicts did not have great impacts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was never involved in such conflicts because it was something that was between the elderly and it was not appropriate for him to interfere.</p><br/><p>Even though he finally became a successful man, he still could not interfere with things like this.</p><br/><p>After all, these things had to be resolved by the people of the older generation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook \u2018The Great\u201ds hand and even took a picture with him. This made all the relatives proud of his achievements.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess Elder Lin is going to become cocky in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? Lil\u2019 Fan is so remarkable. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if only my son was half as powerful as Lil\u2019 Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not been in touch with most of his college classmates.</p><br/><p>Now that the event was being broadcasted everywhere, all of them were stunned. They knew that this classmate of theirs was really capable but they did not expect him to become so successful.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he spoke to the middle-aged man. They were practically whispering to one another and besides them, nobody else could hear what they were talking about.</p><br/><p>Soon, the award ceremony ended.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the award with great satisfaction and he waved to his group of friends and family members.</p><br/><p>The award ceremony was then closed with some stunning performances but most people did not focus too much on them.</p><br/><p>After some time, the entire ceremony ended.</p><br/><p>Everyone went to crowd around Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang went over and hugged Lin Fan. \u201cBro, you\u2019ve really made it this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not that great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang tried to take the award from Lin Fan\u2019s hands. \u201cLet me have a look at it. It must be extraordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian immediately held onto Lin Fan\u2019s hands tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, what are you doing?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled. \u201cI just want to have a feel of the elder\u2019s aura. Perhaps my luck would become better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Fan was speechless at how ridiculous Fraud Tian\u2019s actions were.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, I\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d Papa Lin walked over with puffy eyes. It was obvious that he must have cried earlier.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDad, did you cry just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t that normal? How could I have thought that you would be achieve such great things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin,\u201d Yun Xue Yao went towards Lin Fan and greeted. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, why are you here? Don\u2019t you have a lot to attend to in Haojiang?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao replied, \u201cBrother Lin, it\u2019s the most important award ceremony in your life. How could I miss it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and did not know what to say. He was just thinking about how to complete the task in the Encyclopedia. If he did not complete it in time, it would be impossible to unlock any new knowledge classifications.</p><br/><p>However, was it really that simple to complete the task?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s parents were there and Yun Xue Yao and the other ladies were being really passionate towards them.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin knew what the situation was like but she felt really helpless. She could not possibly choose any one of them as all of them were really eligible. Hence, she decided to just be nice to all of them.</p><br/><p>She did not want to seem biased towards any of them.</p><br/><p>Her son suddenly created this dilemma for her and it was causing her a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>In the past, she kept trying to rush her son to find a partner. However, he suddenly created this dilemma for her.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan knew about what she was thinking, he would have argued that he was innocent.</p><br/><p>They left the Assembly Hall.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and the others suggested to have a celebratory outing. After all, it was near lunchtime.</p><br/><p>However, there were a lot of people and they had to find a suitable place.</p><br/><p>Everything was not a problem as Wu Yun Gang had always been living in Beijing and he was more familiar with the place than anyone else there.</p><br/><p>But they definitely had to spend the night somewhere.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng specifically asked Lin Fan to visit him at night. If he did not go to his place, he would probably be furious about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan already knew what Elder Zheng wanted to do. He just wanted to make Lin Fan drunk so that he would draw several art pieces for him. Elder Zheng would probably feign ignorance the next day.</p><br/><p>He had already seen through his tricks but it would require a great effort for Elder Zheng to make him drunk.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang said, \u201cMaster Lin, I have booked the transport needed to bring everyone to our destination.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDirector Wu, sorry for the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not troublesome at all. I have to do my best to give Master Lin a great time here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cYun Gang, you\u2019ve changed. Why don\u2019t you do this for me whenever I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang replied helplessly, \u201cMing Yang, how could you say that? You frequent this place. Master Lin comes here once in a blue moon. I obviously have to prioritise him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The large group of people left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s car was filled with no one but ladies.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan obviously had to drive because if not, there would not be enough space for everyone in the car.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, Master Lin is definitely going to go big. Who would dare to go against him in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, especially the haters on the Internet. They have to be careful with what they say online now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I\u2019m a little disappointed that Master Lin did not decide to make himself known worldwide earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ what do you know? Master Lin is really famous now and the foreigners must be wondering why Master Lin did not exist in their countries. They must be really envious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Back then, if Master Lin had concealed himself, they probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to trace him.</p><br/><p>Being in the back-end of computing was like being in no man\u2019s land. And there was no limited scope. It was all-encompassing.</p><br/><p>Hence, to them, Master Lin was the most dangerous existence. In this Internet age, he was God.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news came out.</p><br/><p>The reporters had reported the previous day\u2019s incidents about the old man getting his money back so that everyone could relax.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min had become well-known. After all, he had acted so impudently to Master Lin in front of the cameras. Many people were scolding him.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This is the guy. He actually dared to act so impudently to Master Lin. He\u2019s simply asking for death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, this guy is despicable. I want to beat him up after seeing this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Master Lin just hammer him at the scene? He actually allowed this guy to act so cockily. This doesn\u2019t suit Master Lin\u2019s style at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Hitting people is against the law. Master Lin is a cultured man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^I really don\u2019t know what to say about that. Master Lin is a cultured man? You probably haven\u2019t seen those videos of him beating people up in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. Look, this Master Lin has nothing to say anymore. The bank doesn\u2019t even care about him. You guys are the only ones still licking his boots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, several large news agencies posted an urgent news.</p><br/><p>\u2018According to the latest update, Zhu Yu Min and Director Jin have already been brought in by the relevant units for investigation.\u2019</p><br/><p>When this piece of news came out, the netizens were completely stunned.</p><br/><p>What exactly was going on? Why had they been brought in so quickly?</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his phone and he saw the latest news. He felt very pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s really terrifying when I say that I\u2019ll use a computer. But with their capabilities, they should be able to find out the truth after some investigating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was looking at his phone full of concentration. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cBrother Lin, those two guys have been captured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced over. \u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? I\u2019ve never seen anyone who can survive the grasp of your Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang giggled. The longer he stayed here in Cloud Street, the more mystical he felt Brother Lin was. If he hadn\u2019t seen all those things for himself or if he hadn\u2019t been by Brother Lin\u2019s side, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to believe all this.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was very curious. \u201cBrother Lin, do you think this kind of incident is common?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback for a moment. Then, he looked at Wu You Lan. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely common. It\u2019s just that many of them aren\u2019t discovered. But when some things happen very commonly, they will start to draw attention. When that happens, it will start to diminish.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was just an ideal situation. As for what would really happen, no one could be sure.</p><br/><p>But one could only do his or her best. If everyone came across these things but treated them as if it didn\u2019t concern them, then things would become terrifying.</p><br/><p>Without breaking out of the silence, one would eventually die in silence.</p><br/><p>This was a very truthful statement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m going out. You guys carry on working in the shop then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was now thinking about one thing, which was to quickly finish the task. This task was actually very easy to complete. It just depended on his luck.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at his silhouette as he walked away and became curious. \u201cWhat exactly is this kid going to do? Recently, he has been going out every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Several days later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood in the public square. After giving the last wooden carving to a middle-aged woman, he suddenly heard a sound that he hadn\u2019t heard in a long while.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe task of giving ten blessed wooden carvings to ten kindhearted people has been completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the twenty-third page of knowledge. As it is the twenty-third page of knowledge, a class of knowledge will be randomly picked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the sub-class of the technology major class of knowledge: Prosthetic limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: Make the children of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute who are missing limbs physically complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReward: Encyclopedic Points +100\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrent Encyclopedic Points: 8520\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan stood rooted to the spot as his expression slowly changed. He hadn\u2019t expected to get this class of knowledge.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a large amount of knowledge appeared in his brain. It was all related to manufacturing prosthetic limbs.</p><br/><p>In his heart, the most worrisome and the most anticipated thing had been to obtain the Xianxia class of knowledge. Because, with that, perhaps he could use the immortal techniques to make the children of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute physically complete again. However, he hadn\u2019t expected this prosthetic limbs knowledge to appear.</p><br/><p>Although it was miles away from the immortal techniques, it was still a huge progress.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this is fantastic!\u201d Lin Fan was still at the public square. Without a care for all the surrounding people, he shouted out.</p><br/><p>The passersby almost jumped as they got shocked by his voice. The people from far away all looked over in puzzlement. They even thought that this guy might be retarded.</p><br/><p>But what made Lin Fan unsure was who he should look for. With his current ability, he might not be able to find the materials.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he would have to rely on help from others.</p><br/><p>He had initially wanted to look for the government regarding this. But thinking about it, it was better to look for Wang Ming Yang first.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan stupidly as if he didn\u2019t dare to believe what he had just heard. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was completely dumbfounded. His brother had just said that he wanted to research prosthetic limbs. To Wang Ming Yang, it was like a fantasy. He felt an indescribable astonishment.</p><br/><p>Then, he put his palm on Lin Fan\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hot. Your body temperature is normal. Why are you spouting nonsense all of a sudden?\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slapped his hand away. \u201cI\u2019m serious. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re causing me to panic. This prosthetic limb thing you said, I don\u2019t even believe it.\u201d Wang Ming Yang really couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan was a scientist, perhaps he would have believed it. But after knowing Lin Fan for so long, he had never seen Lin Fan as a scientist.</p><br/><p>Now that Lin Fan was talking about researching prosthetic limbs, who would believe him?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTrust me. It\u2019s really possible. Your business doesn\u2019t have a direction to progress towards, does it? Let me give you a development. If you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll look for the government. This is a great thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand. \u201cWait a moment. Let me take it in. My heart hasn\u2019t even settled down yet. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to believe you. It\u2019s just really too hard to believe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how much money must be invested in this research? And in the end, it might even reap no rewards and all the investment might be for nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019ve already finished researching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you looking for me?\u201d asked Wang Ming Yang in surprise.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m giving you a new line of production. I\u2019ve already seen it. It\u2019s not difficult. There are only a few main points that are more complicated but now, I\u2019ve already resolved them. Don\u2019t worry. As long as you get the research lab ready, I\u2019ll definitely give you a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang really found it hard to believe but he saw that Lin Fan didn\u2019t seem like he was joking. \u201cAre you really not joking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not joking. I\u2019m serious. If you believe me, help me to make a research lab. I\u2019ll give you a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed. \u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll believe you. You better not be tricking me. Money is really hard to earn nowadays.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cForget it, forget it. If you don\u2019t trust me then it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll look for the government.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I said I believe you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d said Wang Ming Yang hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019ll be waiting for good news from you. I\u2019ll write down everything I need. Think of a way to get them all.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

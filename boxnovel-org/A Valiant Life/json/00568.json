How did Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan know Master Lin? They were from Beijing.</p><br/><p>He could see the current situation clearly. Master Lin had appeared right there and of course, he had come because of those two.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui said in a puzzled tone, \u201cMaster Lin, they\u2019re your friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Then, he looked at the two men at the side. It seems that these were the two people involved.</p><br/><p>Young Chang started speaking. His tone was a little unkind. \u201cChief He, what is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui was at a loss. Both sides were not to be messed with. This Master Lin wasn\u2019t someone he could infuriate and this Young Chang was even more so. This was a very hard situation to handle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Chang, don\u2019t be impatient. This is Master Lin. He is very well-known in Shanghai. These actors under me are good friends of his, so this\u2026\u201d He Ming Hui didn\u2019t explain very clearly but his meaning was clear: Why don\u2019t you forget about them and pick someone else?</p><br/><p>To be able to find an influential person to cling onto was something that he really wanted but at this moment, the situation didn\u2019t allow for it.</p><br/><p>Perhaps foreigners wouldn\u2019t know but how could he, He Ming Hui, not know about the famous figure, Master Lin? He was definitely considered someone who was hard to deal with.</p><br/><p>And the scariest thing was that this Master Lin was f*cking awesome. He Ming Hui didn\u2019t dare to infuriate him.</p><br/><p>Without talking about money and wealth, Master Lin had medical skills, hacking skills and more. It was difficult to say that he wouldn\u2019t need Master Lin\u2019s help in future.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin had personally appeared here, his intention was clear: I\u2019m already here, are you still going to mess with my friends?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin?\u201d Young Chang took a look at Master Lin. Then, he said arrogantly, \u201cI don\u2019t know him. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s Master Lin or B*stard Lin. Chief He, tell us, what do you plan to do about this. We came all the way from Beijing and we didn\u2019t come for sightseeing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui\u2019s heart and mind were in a mess. What was he supposed to do?</p><br/><p>This was a f*cked up situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you two specially came here to have sex? Let me tell you that I don\u2019t care where you go to have sex but these two are my friends. You better put away your \u2018bullets\u2019 and don\u2019t fire them however you like,\u201d said Lin Fan disdainfully.</p><br/><p>F*ck.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui looked at Master Lin. He didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to speak so irascibly. He just said it out so bluntly without giving any face to the opposition.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan looked at Lin Fan and felt touched. They hadn\u2019t expected that Master Lin would really care about their situation. Anyone with eyes could tell that this matter would definitely not be easily resolved.</p><br/><p>Of course, Young Chang and Young Shen couldn\u2019t take it. \u201cWhat did you f*cking say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan totally ignored them. \u201cChief He, say something. My friends are breaking your contract. What do you have to say about the termination fee?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui was startled. Then, he said embarrassedly, \u201cMaster Lin, this agreement has already been signed. How can they just break the agreement? Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t want them to terminate the contract?\u201d Lin Fan stared at He Ming Hui. He Ming Hui\u2019s heart was trembling. However, he said firmly, \u201cMaster Lin, this agreement was signed by themselves. If they really want to terminate it, then they should do it according to the agreement. I don\u2019t like forcing people to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although He Ming Hui didn\u2019t want to offend Lin Fan, he wasn\u2019t afraid of him. This agreement was written clearly in black and white. Even if they went to court, he would still win.</p><br/><p>How could they just terminate the contract just by saying so? If that happened, wouldn\u2019t all his previous investments be wasted?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Young Chang and Young Shen were now thoroughly pissed off. If he gave in to Lin Fan, it would offend them. If that happened, then He Ming Hui\u2019s life would become miserable.</p><br/><p>Young Chang and Yang Shen hadn\u2019t expected Lin Fan to ignore them. They clenched their teeth and snarled, \u201cWho the heck are you? Do you know who we are? Let me tell you that today\u2019s matter has already been settled. It doesn\u2019t matter who comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, he erupted with the aura of a son of a rich family.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Young Chang flipped over a stool with a kick. \u201cMr. He, remember this. If you dare to play around with the two of us, you should know the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui hastily said, \u201cI definitely won\u2019t. Young Chang, this is a misunderstanding. It\u2019s just that Master Lin came and I am put in a tough spot. I shan\u2019t involve myself in this. You guys discuss it and it would be best if it can be resolved peacefully. If it can\u2019t be, then I have no choice. I hope you can understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Push the blame away. He Ming Hui didn\u2019t want to be involved in this. So he immediately pushed the blame away.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to offend either side. He could only leave them to resolve this themselves.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. He never thought that things would develop to such an extent. This was really a good plan by He Ming Hui but it was understandable. It seemed that the background of the two young men were not simple.</p><br/><p>Young Shao glared at Lin Fan angrily, \u201cKid, do you know who we are? Do you believe that we can make sure that the two of them will never make it in the entertainment industry? Do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \u201cYoung Chang, right? I don\u2019t want to cause trouble but I\u2019m not afraid of trouble. If you two mess around with others, I wouldn\u2019t care but these two are my friends. If you give some face, I won\u2019t be unreasonable either. In future, if you need to look for me for anything, I won\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the f*ck are you? Give you face? What capabilities do you have? Tell me. How unafraid of trouble are you?\u201d Young Chang said aggressively. He went forward and extended his arm to slap Lin Fan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>But then, Lin Fan grabbed Young Chang\u2019s hand. \u201cYou really won\u2019t give me face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Chang had an arrogant look in his eyes. \u201cFace? Are you even worth giving any face to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed helplessly. \u201cYou should always choose diplomacy over violence. But since it\u2019s like this, come at me as you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone\u2019s jaws dropped.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui was dumbfounded. He never thought that Master Lin would make a move on them.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his fists and hammered Young Chang to the ground. Then, he scolded, \u201cRemember, I don\u2019t look for trouble but I\u2019m definitely not afraid of trouble. I gave you face but you were still so unbridled. Haven\u2019t you heard of how I, Lin Fan, am not someone to mess with?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Young Shen saw this, he immediately picked up the stool and came charging at Lin Fan. \u201cYou\u2019re f*cking asking for death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately grabbed the stool and threw it back at him. The two men were had both fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed Young Chang\u2019s collar with one hand and picked him up from the ground. \u201cWill you give me face now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Chang had already been beaten stupid. How could he have expected Lin Fan to really dare to hit them? \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. Even if you are an emperor or my father, it\u2019s useless.\u201d Lin Fan then flung his palm and violently slapped him to the ground.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan were in a panic as they stood there. They were flabbergasted by the scene before them.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to make a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d He Ming Hui was had lost his mind in fear. \u201cMaster Lin, you can\u2019t hit them. They\u2019re young masters from Beijing. You\u2019re asking for trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine the consequences anymore. After this, Master Lin would probably not be the only one in trouble. Even he would be in trouble.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Master Lin consider the consequences at all?</p></div>\n</div>"}

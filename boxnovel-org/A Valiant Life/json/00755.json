However, as for singing, this is my first time. You guys can relax. I guarantee it won\u2019t be too terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, no matter how bad it is we will still love it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, everyone give him a round of applause!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone took the lead.</p><br/><p>Then, the entire scene erupted in applause.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li and the rest of them lamented Master Lin. He was too popular.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t even part of their circle but yet had the love of everyone. What kind of secret did he have?</p><br/><p>At Haojiang.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao had her eyes locked onto the television.</p><br/><p>Some of her girlfriends next to her laughed and said, \u201cXue Yao, you keep watching this show every day and care about that Master Lin so much. Is he your boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao laughed and said, \u201cYou guys are right, he is my boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her best friends were all the daughters of rich and famous people in Haojiang. As a result, they naturally just came together and became friends.</p><br/><p>In private, Yun Xue Yao was no different from any other girl. However, in work, they were not the same anymore.</p><br/><p>She watched the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 every day and would not miss an episode.</p><br/><p>Especially since today was the finale, she felt a little sad as she would not be able to watch it on television anymore. As a result, she treasured this episode even more.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was finding lyrics in the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even know which song to sing.</p><br/><p>In the end, he just chose one from the best-sellers chart.</p><br/><p>This is the one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next song \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 is for all of you guys,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>According to the description from the Encyclopedia, this song was pretty awesome. It had received a lot of awards and had sold over 2.5 million copies in the market.</p><br/><p>It was rather unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Also, this song was written through the collaboration of the five top producers. It was definitely not an ordinary song.</p><br/><p>Since it was an acapella, there were no accompanying instruments.</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan opened his mouth, everyone was all clueless as to how it would be.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan knew that once he opened his mouth, it would definitely scare people to death.</p><br/><p>This was because when he had received this knowledge, he had also gained the \u2018Encyclopedia\u2019s Mythical Boost\u2019.</p><br/><p>As long as there were these three words, the knowledge would be unbelievable and would scare everyone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath, calmed his feelings down and then opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur past stories have become clouds and smoke, dispersed right before our eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound in the hall that was present before all disappeared.</p><br/><p>Everyone all stared at Lin Fan with their eyes wide open, looking on in disbelief.</p><br/><p>He did not have any accompanying instrumentals at all but when they heard Master Lin sing, it gave them the feeling that there were.</p><br/><p>The feeling of sadness and beauty was shaking their spirits.</p><br/><p>There was a sort of mysterious force penetrating their eyes and attacking their spirits.</p><br/><p>Huo Jiang Xiang opened his eyes wide. He was an expert, but when Master Lin opened his mouth, he was equally dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was thoroughly astonished, so much so that he thought it was rather unimaginable. You could even say that it was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven as we\u2019ve said \u201cgoodbye\u201d to each other, I don\u2019t see you feeling sad at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll that you\u2019ve given to me, you didn\u2019t mean from your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The audience were all sucked into it. They did not know why, but as they listened on, they had an indescribable feeling. It stirred some mysterious emotions at the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan became even more engrossed in his song.</p><br/><p>The situation at the scene had a massive change.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that I can\u2019t control myself from crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had the same thoughts in their minds. They were trying to hold it back.</p><br/><p>However, it was becoming harder and harder to hold back. Finally, someone gave in.</p><br/><p>Some of them started crying.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At an Internet cafe.</p><br/><p>One of the network managers was wearing earphones and watching the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>He was initially very happy watching it, but now, he had unknowingly started crying.</p><br/><p>One of the staff members, who was a soft young girl, saw that this big man next to her was crying and felt intoxicated. However, when she saw this tears flowing out, she kindly passed him some tissues.</p><br/><p>\u201cClean your tears. What happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the man did not reply. His eyes were fixed on the show.</p><br/><p>The girl was pissed.</p><br/><p>She was trying to comfort him and he actually ignored her. Was he tired of living?</p><br/><p>Then, she gave the man a push. She pushed a little too hard and his earphone was knocked off his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the man roared. \u201cI am listening to a song. It is really very emotional.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Since his earphones had been knocked off, the sound was pouring out from it.</p><br/><p>The Internet cafe that was in a frenzy was suddenly quietened down.</p><br/><p>Some of them were busy playing DNF and were enthusiastically playing it. However, they suddenly stopped what they were doing and were thoroughly affected by the music.</p><br/><p>In the game.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing? Attack them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, select quickly. We can\u2019t defeat them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man snapped back to life but then, he tossed his earphones aside and was crying while playing his game.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is this song so nice? Everyone that\u2019s listening to it is crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not only him that was experiencing this.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people in the Internet cafe were like this also. They had all immediately turned their games off and quietly sat there, listening to the song and crying.</p><br/><p>In a small district.</p><br/><p>Some parents saw that their child was playing computer games and crying at the same time. They were dumbfounded. They had no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>This was a scene that was happening all over the country.</p><br/><p>Especially in some small restaurant.</p><br/><p>There was a television hanging from the wall that was showing the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>The initially noisy restaurant had suddenly quietened down.</p><br/><p>The diners heard the sound coming from the television and one by one, they were lost in it. They were drinking alcohol and crying at the same time.</p><br/><p>When the people walking along the street outside saw this, they were all stunned. They had no idea what happened.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s voice was still echoing around the scene.</p><br/><p>The three of them, Liu Ying Dong, Zhao Li, and Huo Jian Xiang all had their mouths wide open.</p><br/><p>They felt that this song had hit a nerve somewhere inside them.</p><br/><p>They did not know why but as they listened more, they felt even more hurt. Their eyes also slowly became redder.</p><br/><p>After awhile.</p><br/><p>The song finished.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his eyes and when he saw the entire scene, he was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>D*mn, what is going on?</p><br/><p>Who made all of these people cry?</p><br/><p>Then suddenly, he thought of it.</p><br/><p>Could it be because of him?</p><br/><p>Although this music class was awesome, but even so, it could not make people cry. There could only be one possibility. It was caused by the Encyclopedia\u2019s Mythical Boost.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan smiled and then he grabbed on to the microphone and said, \u201cSo, what do you guys think about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang waved him off and said, \u201cDon\u2019t speak anymore, let me relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li and Liu Ying Dong were like that as well. When the song was finished, they slowly calmed themselves down.</p><br/><p>They did not know why, when they heard this song, they couldn\u2019t hold back their tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the audience erupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the best song I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo emotional. It made me cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can you add the accompanying instrumental in? I think it\u2019ll be even more beautiful like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSing it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do if I can\u2019t hear this song again?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone did not dare to believe that there was such a sound in this world. All those godly singers were nothing compared to this. They were not even fit to lace his shoes.</p><br/><p>This song doesn\u2019t belong in the human realm, but rather, it was that of a goddess.</p><br/><p>That sort of feeling was simply indescribable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan definitely would not sing again. This closing performance was just to let everyone see the power of a master.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t something you could listen to as and when you like.</p><br/><p>Why hasn\u2019t the Encyclopedia task been completed?</p><br/><p>Did I not sing how I was intended to?</p><br/><p>That shouldn\u2019t be the case.</p><br/><p>Forget it, I will not think about that anymore.</p><br/><p>I should not sing too lightly anymore. The Encyclopedia\u2019s Mythical Boost is really too scary.</p></div>\n</div>"}

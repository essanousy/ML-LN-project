The higher-ups are very pleased.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Liu Xiao Tian took up the appointment of Inspector, he had cracked a number of cases but compared to today\u2019s case, those all paled in comparison. They were simply incomparable.</p><br/><p>Capturing Li Hu was quite a happy thing but capturing \u2018Scorpion\u2019 really raised their spirits. Moreover, capturing \u2018Scorpion\u2019 allowed them to get more information from him.</p><br/><p>He was a big drug lord and he carried many secrets. With their previous leads, even if the police sent people to go undercover, they couldn\u2019t make much progress. However, now it was different. They could now obtain much more information just from \u2018Scorpion\u201ds mouth.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said embarrassedly, \u201cStation Chief, I didn\u2019t do much. This was Master Lin\u2019s contribution.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Station Chief shook his head helplessly. He didn\u2019t know how Liu Xiao Tian knew Master Lin. After Liu Xiao Tian had gotten to know Master Lin, his luck had been too great. One after another, big cases were cracked by Liu Xiao Tian. This Master Lin completely gave credit to Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>If that Master Lin were to become a police officer, who knew what appointment he would be promoted to?</p><br/><p>The raid on the human trafficker organization.</p><br/><p>Shocked the entire nation!</p><br/><p>This time, capturing \u2018Scorpion\u2019 helped the police solve an even more troubling problem.</p><br/><p>The leader waved his hand. \u201cAlright. You may not have had any idea about this incident but Master Lin informs you every time and not anyone else. Regardless of why that is the case, you\u2019ve gotten very good interpersonal relationships. The higher-ups are looking into you. Perhaps your appointment as Inspector may change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s face lit up with delight. Then, he said embarrassedly, \u201cLeader, I haven\u2019t even been Inspector for long. If I get promoted even more, wouldn\u2019t it be too quick? People will talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader said, \u201cDon\u2019t bother about this, just follow the organization\u2019s arrangements. So what if there is talk? This Master Lin informs you whenever something is up. It seems that you have some outstanding quality. That itself is worth learning from.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had nothing to say to that. It did make a lot of sense. His outstanding quality was that he trusted Master Lin too much.</p><br/><p>Whenever Master Lin called him, he wouldn\u2019t even consider the possibility of the situation and he would just rush over immediately. It seemed that he would have to trust Master Lin even more in future.</p><br/><p>But to Liu Xiao Tian, ever since he had gotten to know Master Lin, his luck had gotten better and better. Every time he got promoted, it was for no reason. He hadn\u2019t even done anything but he still got promoted.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it was a little scary.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Liu Xiao Tian remembered Master Lin\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, Master Lin had a large part to play in capturing Scorpion. I think that he should be presented with a Good Citizen Award and an Honors Ceremony should be organized for him. Is going to happen?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked.</p><br/><p>The leader replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about these things. The organization will consider it. Don\u2019t worry, there will definitely be an Honors Ceremony at the very least. After all, the organization pays a lot of attention to people like Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian nodded. At least this would make Master Lin feel pretty good.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan reached the store as usual. However, all the shop owners were there.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you really scared us to death. When we saw the news on the Internet, we thought it was real.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese immoral reporters really report whatever they like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re amazing. You actually did such a great deed. You\u2019re a hero!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he waved his hand, \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about it? I just caught a wanted criminal, it\u2019s not much. It\u2019s not even worth mentioning. As for the false rumor on the Internet, I\u2019m not bothered by it. I have a really big heart.</p><br/><p>These words didn\u2019t sound quite right. How could he not have been bothered by it? When the rumors had just come out, he had been the first to flame the rumor-spreaders.</p><br/><p>The shop owners sighed. Little Boss was really Little Boss after all. His attitude was amazing.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth as she sneakily laughed. When she had called Brother Lin in the morning, Brother Lin didn\u2019t say it like that.</p><br/><p>However, now that the problem had been solved, Brother Lin could say whatever he liked.</p><br/><p>The local police station.</p><br/><p>When Li Yang found out that his dad had been arrested for trafficking drugs, he was dumbfounded. The reason he had dared to be so unlawful was because of his dad.</p><br/><p>Because of his family background, he knew many people in the society. Whenever he had met with obstacles in school, he would call people over to support him. Now that his pillar of support had collapsed, to Li Yang, it was as if the sky had fallen down.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t of age yet but his guardian had gotten involved in a problem, so he would be sent to the Youth Detention Centre.</p><br/><p>As for what would happen over there, it was hard to say.</p><br/><p>But there would definitely be many beatings and scoldings.</p><br/><p>In the Youth Detention Centre, there was no use trying to talk and reason with them. The Detention Centre could only use sticks to beat them, on top of using reasoning, in order to be effective.</p><br/><p>If he was going to be obedient, it would still be alright. But if he wasn\u2019t obedient, no one would treat him nicely.</p><br/><p>The hospital!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was carrying fruits as he entered the ward. \u201cElder Chen, how is Lil\u2019 Liang recovering?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin.\u201d Chen Liang knew that it had been Uncle Lin who saved him. Naturally, he was filled with gratitude.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said, \u201cLittle Boss, you didn\u2019t have to bring anything for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cHow could I not bring gifts if I\u2019m coming to see Lil\u2019 Liang?\u201d Then, he patted Lil\u2019 Liang on the head and said, \u201cYour child must not be so rash in future. When this kid recovers, I\u2019ll personally train him myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Liang had an introverted personality and he wasn\u2019t good at social interactions. When he had been met with a great upset, he thought of committing suicide. This sort of behavior was very dangerous. No matter what, Elder Chen was Lin Fan\u2019s good neighbor. Since his child was facing an issue, Lin Fan had to help.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen smiled, \u201cLittle Boss, that would be great. With you training him, there will definitely be great results.\u201d</p><br/><p>He trusted Little Boss very much. If his child were to be placed in Little Boss\u2019s hands, his child would definitely go through an immensely positive change.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Li Yang\u2019s father has been arrested for drug trafficking, is that true?\u201d asked Elder Chen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm, he\u2019s been arrested and locked up. Furthermore, the situation is severe. Whether he\u2019ll be able to come out again in this lifetime is a question to be asked.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Chen Liang heard this, especially when he heard Li Yang\u2019s name, his body trembled. It seemed that in his heart, he still feared this person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Chen Liang on the shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. That kid has been sent to the Youth Detention Centre and he\u2019s undergoing a correction. Someone like him, without proper teachings, will harm himself and everyone around him when he grows up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, how have the discussions been with those parents?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said, \u201cWe\u2019ve met already. They\u2019ll pay the medical bills and they\u2019ve also apologized to me in person. I don\u2019t know what I should say either. What should be compensated has been compensated. After getting them to apologize to my son, I didn\u2019t pursue this matter any further.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Elder Chen. He had never expected that Elder Chen would be so accommodating. \u201cElder Chen, if you have any grievances in your heart, you should say them out. I will definitely stand by your side. Don\u2019t ever let your son and yourself lose out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen waved his hand, \u201cForget it. What has happened has happened. Lil\u2019 Liang is fine. Those children have received the appropriate punishment. Moreover, they still have long roads ahead of them, so they should be given a chance. I only hope that after receiving this lesson, they\u2019ll correct themselves. That is what Lil\u2019 Liang wants as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Liang nodded timidly, \u201cUncle Lin, they\u2019re my classmates too. I\u2019m fine now, so I won\u2019t hold a grudge against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Chen Liang on the head once more and didn\u2019t say much else. Since they had already said this much, what else could Lin Fan have said?</p><br/><p>What a magnanimous child.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since you\u2019ve said that, we shall do as you want. But, Lil\u2019 Liang, if you come across such situations in future, don\u2019t ever do something like this again. You\u2019d scared your dad to death,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang nodded, \u201cMmm, I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

He had a refreshing personality and he would be a good guide for Wu Huan Yue.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chief Yang had wanted to say that Teacher Chen Bao Guo was already tired and didn\u2019t have time to act. But before he could speak out, Chen Bao Guo spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Master Lin has already spoken, how could I not act? Just give me any role and I\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Chen Bao Guo with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTeacher Chen is a veteran artist. Even if it\u2019s a small role, you can act it out beautifully. But I think that Chief Yang and Chief Wang definitely won\u2019t give Teacher Chen a small role.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Yang felt helpless. Hadn\u2019t he said that he wasn\u2019t free before? Now that it was Master Lin asking, he immediately agreed. This really left Chief Yang helpless.</p><br/><p>Wang Xun said, \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. For Teacher Chen to act in the show, it\u2019s an assurance for us. He will definitely bring something special to the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they casually chatted, Wu Huan Yue finished changing and came back with the manager.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what are you guys chatting about?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied with a smile, \u201cNothing much. We\u2019re just talking about Chief Wang\u2019s next show. They want you to be the first female lead. I think it\u2019s pretty good, so I accepted it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu Huan Yue was stunned. She hadn\u2019t thought that something like this would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to \u2018Huh\u2019 about? Since Chief Yang and Chief Wang are actively inviting you, you have to act in it and do a good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue\u2019s brain was still in a daze. She had just gone to change her outfit but now, all these things had been arranged for her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she felt a gaze fixated on her.</p><br/><p>Xie Qing was furious. This was all supposed to be hers but it had been snatched away. She was really unwilling.</p><br/><p>Under such a gaze, Wu Huan Yue felt helpless. She didn\u2019t even know the situation. But since Master Lin told her to act, she decided that she would do it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>She could only ignore the displeasure of others.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that things were pretty much settled, so he said, \u201cAlright, I shan\u2019t disturb you guys anymore. Huan Yue, let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded. She didn\u2019t want to stay here any longer. It was better to spend some private time with Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Director Zhu said, \u201cMaster Lin, tonight is the banquet for the finalization of the show. Would you please honor us with your presence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Wang and Chief Yang were eager as well. They wanted very badly to get to know Master Lin better.</p><br/><p>The purpose of them offering the first female lead role had been to pull themselves closer to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment before replying, \u201cIt should be fine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan and Wu Huan Yue left, the crowd pretty much dispersed.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo went back to his hotel to rest. He had to gather his energy to attend the banquet that night.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Initially, he had planned to go home right after finishing the filming but now, his plans had changed.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In private.</p><br/><p>Xie Qing was restless. \u201cYou promised me that I would be the first female lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Yang was having a headache. \u201cAlright, alright, stop thinking about it. Besides the first female lead, I can still arrange an important role for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I only want the first female lead.\u201d Xie Qing wouldn\u2019t accept this arrangement.</p><br/><p>Chief Yang was annoyed as well. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t want it, you have to accept it. You should know what\u2019s good for you. The first female lead has already been decided. Don\u2019t cause trouble for me. Let me tell you, Master Lin isn\u2019t someone we can offend. Don\u2019t go and find trouble with Wu Huan Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do just that,\u201d growled Xie Qing who was overcome with rage.</p><br/><p>Chief Yang looked at her. He wasn\u2019t angry, instead, he laughed. \u201cAlright, alright, go ahead. But let me tell you, when you regret it, no one will be able to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he shoved the door open and left.</p><br/><p><em>What an idiot. She still wants to look for trouble. It\u2019s already good that trouble hasn\u2019t come and found us.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Xie Qing was in a rage but she gradually calmed herself down. Thinking about what she had said, her heart shifted and she felt a little afraid now.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even know where she had found the courage to say that. How could she say something like that?</p><br/><p>Chief Yang had been right. If she really offended Wu Huan Yue, who knew how she would end up dying?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, how long are you planning to stay here?\u201d Wu Huan Yue asked as they walked along the pavement, with her arm around Lin Fan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019ll go back tomorrow. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue replied helplessly, \u201cI can\u2019t go back to Shanghai. After the filming, I still have to promote it. I\u2019ll have to attend programmes and promote the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wu Huan Yue\u2019s regretful expression and smiled. \u201cIt must be tiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Wu Huan Yue nodded. \u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid of that. I feel that if I just stick it out, it won\u2019t be too tiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that Wu Huan Yue valued her work greatly and she was able to endure hardships. \u201cWork hard then. After all, this is the path you\u2019ve chosen for yourself. Besides the little help I can give you, the rest depends on you. You have to give it your all.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cOh right, aren\u2019t you going to learn from Huang Xiu Fang? Have you confirmed the time for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue shook her head. \u201cNot yet. Teacher Chen hasn\u2019t spoken on my behalf yet, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work out. If it does, I\u2019ll have to focus and study hard for a period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMmm, work hard. You haven\u2019t released any songs this year, have you? Wait a while more until you\u2019ve settled your work and I\u2019ll give you a few songs. Then, you\u2019ll be able to do some recording.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue heard this, she was stunned for a moment. \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ve been thinking about something for a while now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked curiously, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you have in your brain? Why do you have so many songs? I\u2019ve heard from other people that you are really perverse. Those songs that you give me are such good songs that other people wouldn\u2019t be able to write even if they spent their whole lives on it. You just come up with so many songs all of a sudden.\u201d Wu Huan Yue was really in admiration of him. He was simply nature-defying.</p><br/><p>In the musical world, who knew how many people worshipped him?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan instantly started laughing. For her to say that he was perverse, it wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>How could he be perverse? That was plainly slander.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue really appreciated their time alone now, walking casually on the pavement and not being recognized by other people. Even when people looked over, Wu Huan Yue had such a calm look and didn\u2019t look dazzling or outstanding, so they thought that she only looked like a celebrity.</p><br/><p>Nighttime, at the finalization banquet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan attended it as a guest. And he was the main focus at the banquet. Those celebrities that Wu Huan Yue had gotten to know during the filming had been pleading with Wu Huan Yue to introduce Master Lin to them but when he really arrived, they were so frightened that they didn\u2019t dare to speak at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there the whole time, having people proposing toasts to him one by one. They came pretty much nonstop.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t have an outstanding family background, nor an impressive wealth, he was already giving Chief Yang and Chief Wang immense pressure.</p><br/><p>Because the two words \u2018Master Lin\u2019 were really way too resounding.</p><br/><p>Also, his network of connections was way too broad and it made them fearful.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He turned to the beautiful Wu You Lan and said, \u201cAlright, you\u2019re home. Was today fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had an exceptionally great time that afternoon. She nodded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m so happy. This is one of the best days of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and patted her head, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. If we have the opportunity in the future, I\u2019ll bring you to ride lions or bears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Wu You Lan\u2019s eyes dazzled. She realized that she suddenly loved to ride animals after being together with Lin Fan. She would definitely be over the moon if Lin Fan were to bring him to ride lions or bears in the future.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan promised, \u201cOf course. Do I look like someone that brags?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled and said mysteriously, \u201cBrother Lin, close your eyes. To reward you, I\u2019ll give you an important prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wu You Lan, \u201cI know your trick. Let me put it clearly, you can\u2019t kiss my face. I\u2019ve been in this position before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan blushed, \u201cI\u2019m not going to kiss your face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, let me close my eyes and guess what you\u2019re going to reward me with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Brother Lin who shut his eyes. She gently bit her lip and moved slowly towards him.</p><br/><p>*buzz*</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan felt her soft lips against his. He quickly opened his eyes and Wu You Lan immediately opened the car door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, didn\u2019t I say to not kiss my face?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan placed her hands behind her back and said embarrassingly, \u201cI didn\u2019t kiss your face. I kissed your lips. It\u2019s my first kiss. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important.\u201d Then, she blushed and quickly went up the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, stay safe! I had a really good time today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head. He drove and left the place. He didn\u2019t expect to be played by Wu You Lan\u2019s words. However, it felt pretty great.</p><br/><p>His heart was full.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, a call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s weird. Why is Xu Zi Le calling me?\u201d Lin Fan was curious after seeing the incoming caller ID. It was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s wife. Why was she calling him?</p><br/><p>If Wang Ming Yang were to find out about it, wouldn\u2019t it cause a conflict?</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan quickly dismissed that thought. What was he thinking about? They were like brothers and sisters to him. It was normal for a sister to call him. There wasn\u2019t a problem at all.</p><br/><p>He picked up the call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cZi Le, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le said, \u201cBig Brother, can you come and pick me up?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Lin Fan was stunned. It was Shanghai. Why did she ask him to fetch her? He couldn\u2019t get too close to the wife of his friend. He was Justice Fan of Shanghai and Wang Ming Yang was like his brother. He couldn\u2019t let it happen.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le felt that her question might have sounded a little weird. She quickly said something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, I\u2019m at a finalization party for our event. The main investor is here and the situation is a little complicated. I called Ming Yang but his phone is switched off. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan understood what she meant even before she finished talking. \u201cWhere is it? This is Shanghai. Which blind idiot dared to make things difficult for my sister? He must be tired of living.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xu Zi Le heard him call her \u2018sister\u2019, she smiled. She knew that it was because of Lin Fan that she could get together with Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDongyue Entertainment Hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that the hotel that Liu Xu opened?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be there in less than ten minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sometimes, Lin Fan felt that he was a firefighter. He was expected to go to places with \u2018fire\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Dongyue Entertainment Hotel.</p><br/><p>A skinny middle-aged man was sitting beside Xi Zi Le. \u201cMy sister, you\u2019re just asked to drink with Chief Chen. This project was entirely sponsored by Chief Chen. You gotta give him some face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le sat there and looked away, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go there. Go if you want to. Look, Chief Chen is definitely not a good guy. He took advantage of all the girls that served him drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was helpless. He knew that Xu Zi Le was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s girlfriend. Based on their status, he couldn\u2019t have done anything to her. However, they couldn\u2019t afford to offend the old northern Chief who had a lot of authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Snowy, go serve Chief Chen some drinks. Chief Chen had been waiting for a long time. Just go and serve him first.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a beautiful lady that was sitting beside Xu Zi Le whose beauty was comparable to her. However, her status was far from Xu Zi Le\u2019s status. She had been a clean slate since she started out in this business.</p><br/><p>She was a little afraid of Chief Chen when she saw how he acted towards those girls that served him. However, she couldn\u2019t not serve him drinks.</p><br/><p>When Snowy was having a difficult time, Xu Zi Le immediately stopped her. \u201cSnowy, you don\u2019t have to go. The show is over. Why do you care about him? That time, a man wanted to take advantage of you. If not for your good luck, you wouldn\u2019t have escaped. If you were to go now, you\u2019d be entering the lion\u2019s den. You\u2019d be left with nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man turned to Xu Zi Le, \u201cSister Xu, if you don\u2019t want to go, at least let Snowy go on behalf of you. If not, this matter would be complicated. Furthermore, you should know that Chief Chen is not a simple man. He is powerful in both the corporate and underworld. If we were to offend him, you just wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the northern side in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Snowy was in a dilemma, \u201cSister Xu, just let me go for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le replied, \u201cDon\u2019t go. Ignore him. This is just for money. We can\u2019t let them do whatever they want. I already asked my big brother to come. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour big brother?\u201d The middle-aged man was stunned. Then, he shook his head, \u201cWhat use will your big brother\u2019s presence have? An interaction between two males can easily cause a conflict.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Chief Chen walked over. He was furious but he acted normally.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, these two beauties are difficult to deal with. I, Chen He, have been sitting there for a long time. Everyone had been there but the two of you. It looks like I have to invite the two main actresses over personally,\u201d Chen He said and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Chen, don\u2019t worry. Xu Zi Le and Snowy were about to walk over to serve you. We didn\u2019t expect you to walk over yourself,\u201d the middle-aged man said and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Jin, what are you doing? They are celebrities. It\u2019s normal for me to walk over. After all, I only invested $10 million in this show. How could I ask them over? Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d Chen He said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>Snowy stood up, \u201cChief Chen, I\u2019ll give you a toast.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, she stood at a distance away and was prepared to finish the glass with one gulp. She didn\u2019t want to have any physical contact with him.</p><br/><p>Chen He smiled and waved his hand, \u201cYou can\u2019t drink that way. You have to come closer, that\u2019s more intimate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Le, you too. Come, let\u2019s play a game. How about \u2018wedlock\u2019? Haha,\u201d Chen He laughed.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said anxiously, \u201cChief Chen, Zi Le\u2019s boyfriend is Wang Ming Yang of Shanghai Eastern Han Group. You should know him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He was infuriated, \u201cI know Wang Ming Yang. He depended on the company and built an empire on it. What can he do to me? Are you saying I can\u2019t match up to him? Let me tell you this. Even if he were to come here now, he has to call me Brother Chen. When I came into society to make a living, he was still playing with mud. Furthermore, what\u2019s wrong with drinking with his girlfriend? What can he do to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Humiliation, utter humiliation.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was so furious that her face turned red.</p></div>\n</div>"}

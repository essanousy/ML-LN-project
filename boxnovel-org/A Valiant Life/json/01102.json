Judging by the looks of things, it seemed as if they had all come. To him, it was a little scary.</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s chopsticks fell onto the table. He stared blankly at the scene and he didn\u2019t even dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>They had barely started eating and these people had already appeared.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan leaned closer to Lin Fan. Although she wasn\u2019t fearful, it was really quite shocking for a large group of people to suddenly fill up the restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, my name is\u2026\u201d Before that person could finish, loud noises filled the place. Everyone was clamoring at the same time and their voices echoed in the restaurant. No one could hear anything clearly.</p><br/><p>They were way too excited.</p><br/><p><em>An expert. This is a true expert.</em></p><br/><p>Amongst them, they respected their elders very much but they would never submit to anyone. However, after seeing that scene from before, they had really submitted.</p><br/><p>To them, there was no choice but to submit. This person was simply on another level.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God. They\u2019re going to tear the restaurant down!\u201d Fraud Tian exclaimed. He didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>These people were too crazy, so much so that he couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei, Wang Yun Jie, and the rest were staring blankly at the scene. As association members, they had experienced a lot. However, this scene was spectacular. It was truly spectacular.</p><br/><p>Every single person here was an inheritor of a different martial art style.</p><br/><p>Although they weren\u2019t well-known, one had to admit that they had abilities.</p><br/><p>Those young members felt that they were too lucky to have been sent here to attend this meet. Otherwise, they would never have been able to see such a sight.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was still broadcasting through his phone.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room started commenting maniacally when they saw this as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! These people are here to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already said it. Master Lin has gone too far this time. He was so fearsome in the arena just now. It would be strange if these people didn\u2019t get shocked to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. That\u2019s why he\u2019s my idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been recording the broadcast since the beginning. After it ends, I\u2019ll post it on the Internet for everyone to see how f*cking awesome our Master Lin is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brain was getting fried by all the noise. There were way too many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe quiet. Everyone, be quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it had been anyone else, these people definitely would not have complied. However, the person who had spoken was the master. How could they not obey?</p><br/><p>Then, all of them shut up.</p><br/><p>However, the maniacal look in their eyes was hard to overlook.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up. He felt as if there was no space to even stand properly. \u201cEveryone, be patient. I know why you\u2019re here but we\u2019re eating right now. Could you wait until we finish before we discuss?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a few hundred people and there was still a large bunch of them waiting outside.</p><br/><p>If things were to get out of hand, this place would fall apart.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, voices started sounding out in the restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Master. We\u2019ll be patient. Please take your time to eat. We\u2019ll just wait here,\u201d the crowd said.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Lin Fan looked at these people with a dumbfounded look. <em>Who would be able to eat with so many people watching?</em></p><br/><p>Wu You Lan definitely felt that she wouldn\u2019t be able to eat with so many people here. After all, it would feel really weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake way. Elder Huang is here.\u201d At that moment, a voice rang from outside.</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong and the old-timers, accompanied by some young people, got the crowd to disperse. With Elder Huang\u2019s status, these people were very obedient.</p><br/><p>But even though they had dispersed, they couldn\u2019t bear to leave.</p><br/><p>To them, this was a true master. If they were to miss this opportunity, they wouldn\u2019t get another one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose in the restaurant, come out now. Elder Huang will talk to the master about this. Look at yourselves just cramming inside the restaurant. You\u2019ll get nothing done,\u201d a man shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. <em>Let\u2019s get everyone out first. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to leave this place.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Go out first. We have time. There is no hurry,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at each other, then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Master, you mustn\u2019t leave all of a sudden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Master, we really admire you. You\u2019re way too incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually, the people in the restaurant exited. However, some of them sat at the other tables. They had become a little hungry after all that. It would be nice to get something to eat.</p><br/><p>In a moment, all the seats in the restaurant were occupied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, give me a seat. Let me sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no more space. Don\u2019t push.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough space. Give me a chance. Otherwise, I\u2019ll sit on your legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Are you f*cking retarded? There were so many seats previously but you didn\u2019t sit. Now that there are no seats, you want to sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know? You were all so quick in claiming all the seats.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of these people were very clever. They had seen all the empty seats previously and immediately sat down. They wanted to see how Elder Huang would speak to the master.</p><br/><p>They were very shocked and they didn\u2019t know the background of this master. He was so f*cking awesome and he had gained their admiration.</p><br/><p>They had no choice but to admire him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan saw three old men enter. One of them was the one he had seen previously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, President Lin.\u201d Huang Ru Zhong went forward and extended his hand. He was wearing a smile on his face and there was a glimmer of shock in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up. \u201cElder Huang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing an elder, Lin Fan was rather courteous. Then, a young man brought a chair over and placed it behind the old-timer.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin, you\u2019re the Vice-President of the Shanghai association?\u201d asked Huang Ru Zhong. He was a little astonished. He had not known that there was such an amazing person in the association. This was a little hard to believe.</p><br/><p>He had interacted with the association before and he would go there occasionally. Sometimes, he would serve as a judge at some competitions.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t respect the type of kung fu performed by the association but he knew that it was in trend. It was something that the public could accept. It allowed martial arts to be passed down to more people and gain the attention of the masses.</p><br/><p>As for those inheritors of martial arts, they might be good at fighting but asking them to promote martial arts was difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the Shanghai association,\u201d Lin Fan answered with a smile. He knew what would happen following this. After all, he had accidentally made his performance a little too domineering.</p><br/><p>But to him, it wasn\u2019t much at all. Those had been very normal moves. There was nothing to be surprised about.</p></div>\n</div>"}

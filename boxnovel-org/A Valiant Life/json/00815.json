However, this situation left him speechless.</p><br/><p>This fella didn\u2019t even care about Michelin stars at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I have one? It is simply too difficult to buy one here,\u201d Henry Wang said.</p><br/><p>He hoped that he would give him a scallion pancake for him to judge it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I only sell ten pieces a day. If I were to give it to you, the others would be unhappy. I am really fair here. Therefore, just come here tomorrow. I believe you\u2019ll be able to buy it tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang wanted to curse his mom. Buy my a*s. Couldn\u2019t he see how many people there were? There were a few hundred people trying to buy ten scallion pancakes. It was literally impossible.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to imagine how things would be like if he were to wait for a month just for a scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that things couldn\u2019t be negotiated further after seeing Lin Fan\u2019s expressions.</p><br/><p>The other townsfolk nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, that is our Little Boss. The fair Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if he is from the Michelin company? Our Little Boss doesn\u2019t care about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t ever think of our Little Boss to be a typical man. That doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang sighed and felt really helpless. He felt that the stupid rules here were terrifying.</p><br/><p>However, he was really craving for the scallion pancakes. He had smelled the aroma for so many days and his only aim was to taste the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t given a chance at all.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang kept his documents and wanted to leave the shop. At that moment, the re-sellers found out about this Caucasian and wanted to sell a scallion pancake to him.</p><br/><p>Especially since a re-seller managed to get a scallion pancake that day.</p><br/><p>He hurried over to Henry Wang, \u201cHey, my international friend. Hi, do you want to buy a scallion pancake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang nodded sadly, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve said it earlier. I have it with me,\u201d the re-seller said as he took out a well-packaged scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was ecstatic when he saw the scallion pancake, \u201cAre you really willing to give it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. You have to give me this\u2026\u201d the re-seller said as he made a hand gesture.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the situation and was speechless. \u201cHey, do you think it\u2019s really good to let a re-seller sell our pancakes outside our shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. He was lucky to have it. Why can\u2019t we let him sell it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed, \u201cSigh, how helpless. If only you raised the prices. That would be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not a dishonest man.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was the average price of his scallion pancakes in the black market?</p><br/><p>Previously, when they asked a re-seller, the prices started from $10,000. Lin Fan was filled with pride when he heard that.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the re-seller was still talking to Henry Wang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much is that?\u201d Henry Wang asked.</p><br/><p>He felt that he was the most pitiful judge ever. The other judges got to taste free food while he had to spend money to taste it. If people were to find out about this, his friends would definitely laugh at him.</p><br/><p>The re-seller raised two fingers, \u201c$20,000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Henry Wang was stunned, \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><br/><p>The re-seller said, \u201c$20,000. Don\u2019t belittle this scallion pancake. This was made by Master Lin. The taste is simply out of this world. Look at my phone. There are a lot of people asking me to sell them the scallion pancake. I saw that you needed it and therefore I wanted to sell it to you to show that I care about our foreign friends here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to say anything else. He felt that he was being sucked into a trap. He got lured to Cloud Street and smelled the aroma of scallion pancakes for a few days. He didn\u2019t manage to buy any of it and there was a re-seller that was trying to sell him a scallion pancake for $20,000. That was insane.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive,\u201d Henry Wang shook his head.</p><br/><p>The re-seller replied, \u201cSigh, this Michelin judge doesn\u2019t know what he is buying. Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes are worth more than $20,000. There are a lot of gourmets who are dying to try this scallion pancake. They\u2019re offering high prices. I think you can\u2019t compare to them. Forget it, I\u2019ll sell it to someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Henry Wang heard that, he didn\u2019t want to give in to him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect someone to belittle him. It was an insult to him and his professionalism.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave. I\u2019ll buy it.\u201d Henry Wang didn\u2019t think too much about it. He just wanted to try the scallion pancake. He couldn\u2019t stand being insulted anymore.</p><br/><p>If his colleagues were to find out that he spent $20,000 on a scallion pancake, they would think that he was crazy.</p><br/><p>He took the scallion pancake and went outside the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, can I review it in front of you?\u201d Henry Wang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk hadn\u2019t left yet. They gathered there and were waiting to see what this Caucasian was up to.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang opened the bag and the aroma filled the air. He smelled it and observed it. \u201cThe aroma is so good. It\u2019s something I have never smelled before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. He wanted to let him continue commenting on it.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang continued, \u201cHowever, the ingredients can\u2019t make it. Look at it, they\u2019re probably really cheap. Look here too. Although it looks really exquisitely made, the ingredients aren\u2019t scattered evenly. If I were to judge it professionally, I can only give it a really low score.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this fella trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think he is trying to criticise Little Boss\u2019s scallion pancake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, he\u2019s probably trying to take revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, why is he saying so much rubbish? He should just eat it. It\u2019ll make him cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang observed it closely and shook his head regretfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know why so many of you love this scallion pancake so much. With my professional observation, this scallion pancake is a failure. It just has a really good aroma. I\u2019m afraid the taste would disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the key to making a delicious dish is the ingredients. You have to use the best ones. If not, it would greatly affect the taste. Sigh, I can\u2019t believe I queued up for four days for this. It is a little disappointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang kept commenting about the scallion pancake but he hadn\u2019t taken any bites yet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t angry. He knew what the outcome was going to be like.</p><br/><p>This situation was pretty common and it was normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a bite then,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang shook his head, \u201cInitially, I wouldn\u2019t eat it but since I spent $20,000 on this, it\u2019d be a waste if I were to throw it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking a bite.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Everyone became silent.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang\u2019s eyes widened. It was as if there was a fire in his eyes. All of his taste buds were tantalized by the scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>He felt as if his soul had been shaken.</p><br/><p>In his mind, he felt as if he was being surrounded by a lot of delicious dishes. However, he couldn\u2019t bear to eat any of them. Then, a giant scallion pancake appeared in the skies and dropped on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang suddenly screamed. He touched his chest and looked licentious.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned when they saw his expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this Caucasian doing? What is he experiencing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why are his expressions more exaggerated than ours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Henry Wang and shook his head helplessly. Then, he waved towards the townsfolk.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s disperse. Let this foreigner enjoy this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! It\u2019s so delicious. How can it be so delicious?\u201d Then, Henry Wang shouted as if he didn\u2019t care about what the others thought of him. He started to take bigger bites and talked to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people at Cloud Street were already used to this situation. It was just that this Caucasian\u2019s expressions were more exaggerated than others.</p><br/><p>However, they decided to forgive him.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it wasn\u2019t really a shameful matter.</p><br/><p>It was a normal sight at Little Boss\u2019s shop.</p></div>\n</div>"}

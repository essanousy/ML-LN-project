They\u2019re just alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could they be \u2018just alright\u2019? They\u2019re really amazing!\u201d said He Cheng Han. He really envied Wang Ming Yang to death. However, when he heard from Wang Ming Yang that those artificial limbs would only be sold for three thousand dollars each, he had been completely astounded.</p><br/><p>Then, he realized that these sales weren\u2019t for money-making but for charity. How could such perfect artificial limbs possibly be sold for just three thousand dollars? That was simply shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s not talk about all these during our gathering. Today is the day that Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le have obtained their marriage certificates. Everyone, let\u2019s congratulate them!\u201d announced Lin Fan with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the crowd went into an uproar. They were all truly happy about this.</p><br/><p>They had all known Wang Ming Yang for quite long. They also thought that Wang Ming Yang should get married since he was so young.</p><br/><p>Now, it had happened so quickly.</p><br/><p>The lively banquet began. The crowd was chatting incessantly amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fraud Tian was eating non-stop. He seemed not to care about the looks from those around him.</p><br/><p>But the people around were also very friendly to Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. I never thought that, in the blink of an eye, I would get my marriage certificate. I really didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d Wang Ming Yang and Lin Fan leaned back on their chairs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhat? Are you sure you didn\u2019t expect this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it to be so fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThis isn\u2019t fast at all. This is perfectly normal. Zi Le is a pretty good woman and she\u2019s devoted to you. She will be able to support your family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cMmm. I know all that. But now I\u2019m thinking about you guys going overseas tomorrow and I won\u2019t be able to go. That\u2019s really saddening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. \u201cWait for the next time. There\u2019s no hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows if you\u2019ll even tell me next time? Oh right, let me ask you something,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the news on the Internet. Do you have any suggestions regarding those people from overseas? I\u2019m talking about the price of the artificial limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cThe price will be the same. We won\u2019t charge them any more. Secretary Chen has the same idea as me, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cMmm. Secretary Chen said that as well. We\u2019ll charge them the same price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave this matter to you guys but you can ask me if you have any questions. If you put a nationalistic youth like me in charge, wouldn\u2019t the price be raised sky-high?\u201d said Lin Fan with a chuckle. He wouldn\u2019t treat people from other countries unfairly. Those crippled people had already suffered enough. If he were to discriminate against them, it would really be unbefitting of the traditional Chinese morals that he had been passed down.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know, although other countries may enjoy bullying us, we can\u2019t stoop to their level.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s the right way to think,\u201d said Lin Fan as he patted Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat do you think? Do you still want to challenge me in drinking tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang heard that, he immediately waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t. Alcohol is bad for the body. I\u2019m abstaining from drinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared with laughter. He could tell that Wang Ming Yang had grown fearful of drinking because of him.</p><br/><p>On this night, everyone chatted cheerfully. He Cheng Han and the rest had not met with Lin Fan in a long time, so they drank quite a lot of wine. But to Lin Fan, this amount of alcohol was nothing at all. He could drink as much as he wanted and be perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The airport.</p><br/><p>It was a direct flight from Shanghai to Haojiang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest had reached the airport early in the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why isn\u2019t that Fraud here?\u201d Lin Fan looked at the time and asked. \u201cCould it be that he overslept?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sighed. \u201cI just called him. He says that he has to prepare for a while. Who knows what he\u2019s preparing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Fraud\u2026 If I knew this would happen, I wouldn\u2019t have let him come with us. It\u2019s so late but he\u2019s still not here. I really want to give him a good kick,\u201d said Lin Fan helplessly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A figure appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker\u2026\u201d Lin Fan saw that figure in the distance and was stunned.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang and Wu You Lan were dumbfounded as well. They rubbed their eyes in disbelief as if they thought that there was something wrong with their eyes.</p><br/><p>In the distance, in green pants and a red shirt, wearing a pair of spectacles, with his hair combed back, and pulling an old luggage bag behind him, he walked over with his head high and chest out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Fraud Tian seemed not to be affected by the stares. He just waved at Lin Fan and the rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first and wait for you guys over there.\u201d Lin Fan felt as if he would be laughed at if he were to stay with Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d said Wu You Lan hurriedly. She felt as if this wasn\u2019t the same Fraud Tian that she knew.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang stood stiffly in his position. He was stunned. In his heart, he grumbled. <em>How can you just leave me with this Fraud? Do you have no shame?</em></p><br/><p>But very soon, Fraud Tian was in front of Zhao Zhong Yang. In an elegant manner, he took off his spectacles and revealed his yellow teeth as he said, \u201cWhat is it? Don\u2019t you recognize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang took a deep breath and said, \u201cFraud, have you been possessed? What\u2019s up with your dressing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Fraud Tian looked at himself, then nodded contently. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong at all. How do I look? That girl you introduced to me is really pretty good. She\u2019s a big inspiration for me to dress up. Although I\u2019m already quite old, I\u2019m still young at heart. I look fashionable and dashing, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang almost couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cYou look like the chief of hippies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck does that mean?\u201d Fraud Tian was taken aback. He didn\u2019t quite understand.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the people who passed by sneakily took out their phones and took photos of Fraud Tian. Fraud Tian\u2019s style had surprised all of the passersby.</p><br/><p>But one had to admit that Fraud Tian actually seemed alright dressing up like that.</p><br/><p>He had trained in martial arts his whole life and he had a unique aura.</p><br/><p>Although he was dressed flashily, he still emitted an indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! That\u2019s perfect!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a trendily dressed man with long hair suddenly appeared in front of Fraud Tian. He stared at Fraud Tian and his eyes seemed to light up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really perfectly matched. You look brilliant!\u201d said the long-haired man excitedly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at him with a look of disdain. \u201cWho the heck are you? A grown man with long hair\u2026 You look neither male nor female.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m a fashion photographer. Can you be my model? Your style is really brilliant. Those clothes you\u2019re wearing have such color and luster and they are made of great material. They must not be cheap!\u201d said the long-haired man in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot cheap?\u201d Fraud Tian was taken aback. Then, he looked down. \u201cThese pants cost twenty dollars, the top costs thirty dollars. If that\u2019s not cheap, how poor must you be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had not expected someone to appreciate Fraud Tian\u2019s clothes. He was speechless. \u201cFraud, are you leaving or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go,\u201d Fraud Tian immediately replied. He was completely uninterested in that long-haired man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment, this is my name card. Please call me when you\u2019re free.\u201d The long-haired man saw that such a perfect model was about to leave, so he quickly took out his name card.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? Is this guy retarded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian couldn\u2019t quite understand. He saw that the long-haired man kept looking at him and he trembled. This man was quite scary. Looking at the name card, it was in English. It was indecipherable to Fraud Tian.</p></div>\n</div>"}

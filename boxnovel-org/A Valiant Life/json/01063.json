He asked curiously, \u201cBrother Lin, has that matter been resolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been resolved halfway,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was confused. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? I don\u2019t quite understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was too lazy to explain. \u201cHalfway just means halfway. I shan\u2019t tell you for now. Anyway, you\u2019ll understand after it\u2019s over. I\u2019m going to upload a Weibo post first to see how things are going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang really couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. What the heck did \u2018halfway\u2019 mean? He felt that it was a little strange. But he knew that it might be a good thing too. As for the remaining half, perhaps it had to do with something else.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw the Weibo post by Brother Lin, he understood what the other half was.</p><br/><p>It was to completely wipe out the opposite party.</p><br/><p>Seeing this Weibo post, it was simply stirring trouble. Brother Lin was directly challenging the opposition.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cA very big problem exists in Rong Mao. The old man didn\u2019t sign the contract but they somehow have the completed documents. They even just brushed it all off as a mistake. That leader by the name of Zhu Yu Min, in particular, is very rude and unreasonable, not to mention problematic. I\u2019m afraid he has already obtained a lot of money through illegal means. I hope that the relevant departments can investigate this. If you don\u2019t manage to find anything, I don\u2019t mind using a computer to investigate it for you @AntiCorruption @BankSupervision @DisciplinaryInspectors\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang raised his head and stared at Lin Fan with his eyes gaping. \u201cBrother Lin, are you trying to fight to the death with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing much. Just a casual Weibo post.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a casual Weibo post? This is stirring up a huge storm!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, after Lin Fan\u2019s post got sent, the netizens went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Master Lin is trying to defy nature! He\u2019s just calling names out directly and accusing them of corruption. Does he have evidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel that it\u2019s really domineering. If he doesn\u2019t have evidence, they can sue Master Lin for slander.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in Master Lin. If he says that they\u2019re corrupted, they\u2019re definitely corrupted. Enough talk. I\u2019ll just wait and see you all get slapped in the face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^I support you too. Did you see the last part? Master Lin said that if they can\u2019t find any evidence, he doesn\u2019t mind using a computer to investigate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Master Lin knows how to use a computer too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Are you joking? Master Lin\u2019s abilities are not a joke. Do you know why Master Lin went to jail? If you don\u2019t know, I suggest you search it up. When you do, you\u2019ll know what all this is about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I just searched for it. That\u2019s way too crazy. Doesn\u2019t that mean that Master Lin\u2019s computer skills are really powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPowerful is an understatement. They\u2019re perverse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering now just how much darkness there is in this Zhu Yu Min\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min was on the phone. \u201cAlright, no problem. We can loan you as much as you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. That\u2019s not a problem. As long as you know, there\u2019s no need to say so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he hung up. He shook his head as he thought about today\u2019s happenings.</p><br/><p><em>What </em>the heck is <em>up with that Master Lin? He actually came to find trouble with us. Doesn\u2019t he know where this is? Does he really think that he\u2019s so powerful that he can do whatever he wants?</em></p><br/><p>*Knock knock!*</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d said Zhu Yu Min.</p><br/><p>Director Jin ran into the office hastily, \u201cLeader, things are bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Why are you acting all panicky?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, look at this. This Master Lin is really too ridiculous. He actually posted this on Weibo.\u201d Director Jin placed his phone in front of the leader. He had been given a scare. He hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to say this directly on Weibo.</p><br/><p>How big must his guts be?</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min looked at the phone. But once his eyes were set on the phone, they could not shift away. It was as if his whole body was frozen stiff. Then, he bellowed furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he dare to say this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was in disbelief. There was actually someone who dared to say something like this on Weibo. It was simply asking for death. It was plain slander.</p><br/><p>Director Jin was feeling panicky. This matter had already gotten big. With this post from Master Lin, probably the whole Internet knew about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, how are we going to handle this? If this makes an impact, it will be irreversible. And with the things we\u2019ve done, if someone comes to investigate, we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Zhu Yu Min shot him a glare before taking out his phone and giving a call to Weibo.</p><br/><p>In the past, they had cooperated with Weibo before. Right now, he wanted Weibo to block Master Lin\u2019s Weibo account and it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. However, when he stated his request, the reply from Weibo\u2019s side left him stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, our platform\u2019s aim is to provide freedom of speech. If it really is slander, we will block it. But there isn\u2019t any evidence as of now that Master Lin has committed slander, so we can\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>What a joke. It was a post from Master Lin, how could they possibly block it? Unless their brains had been fried, they wouldn\u2019t block it. Moreover, the higher-ups had already said that, unless Master Lin posted something that tarnished the country\u2019s image or some kind of news with severe impact, they could just let it be.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min hadn\u2019t expected this kind of reply from Weibo\u2019s side. He yelled furiously, \u201cWhat is this? You even need evidence for this? Call your leader over!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the reply from the phone almost made Zhu Yu Min puke blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the leader. I\u2019m the one you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>The call was hung up.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at his messages and realized that, in this short period of time, a huge stir had occurred. He also realized that many big Internet celebrities had reposted that post. This incident had been completely spread to the masses.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have that Lin\u2019s phone number?\u201d asked Zhu Yu Min.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Director Jin immediately went to dig up Lin Fan\u2019s number, then dialed it for the leader.</p><br/><p>Over at Cloud Street, Lin Fan was playing with his phone when the call suddenly came. When he saw that it was an unknown number, he couldn\u2019t help but smile. Without thinking, he already knew who it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve gone overboard. This is slander! I can sue you for this. I suggest you delete it immediately and apologize for this. If you do that, I won\u2019t pursue this matter further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Is there anything else? If not, I\u2019m hanging up. I still have things to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do? Do you have a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. I have a sickness that will kill me if I don\u2019t cause trouble. Do you have a cure?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min immediately hung up. He felt that this Master Lin was a f*cking maniac.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, what do we do now?\u201d asked Director Jin.</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. I\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the people from the Internet Safety Bureau saw Master Lin\u2019s Weibo post and instantly jumped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad. Master Lin is stirring trouble again. He wants to use a computer again. He can\u2019t let him have that chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even dare to imagine what would happen if they let Master Lin touch a computer again. Hence, they viewed this matter with great importance.</p><br/><p>Then, the notice was passed down to the various departments. They absolutely could not allow Master Lin to touch a computer.</p></div>\n</div>"}

They couldn\u2019t take it anymore. They felt that this guy was just too impudent.</p><br/><p>He was in China, yet this b*stard didn\u2019t even give them any face. During the show, he showed his impudence and didn\u2019t put anyone in their eyes.</p><br/><p>If they could, they would rush over immediately and fiercely slap that b*stard\u2019s face till it swelled up.</p><br/><p>However, they didn\u2019t have a choice. Although they were separated by just a screen, in reality, they were actually miles apart.</p><br/><p>All they could do was look at the other party flaunt on stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! I can\u2019t take it anymore. Shanghai TV is too f*cking ret*rded! They called this id*ot over just to mock us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally! I hate Shanghai TV from now onwards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, I can\u2019t take it anymore. I have already gone to express my anger on the official Shanghai TV Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s band together and do it! They really know how to boost their own ego! Do they think that just because they hosted \u201cStrongest Heavenly Voice\u201d, they can do whatever they want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the backstage.</p><br/><p>Director Liu had a very ugly expression. He really wished that he could just walk up on stage and slap Zhenping Yiming multiple times. Couldn\u2019t he speak nicely? Who was he trying to provoke?</p><br/><p>At this moment, an employee rushed over. He looked nervous as if he didn\u2019t expect something like this would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, something major has happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Director Liu was shocked. He had a feeling that it was something bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Internet has gone crazy. Our official Weibo account has been hacked, and our current ratings are going down. Many people have expressed that they hate us!\u201d The employee said nervously. He realized that this show was falling through.</p><br/><p>Just because Shanghai TV was a big business, it didn\u2019t mean that they could do things any way they liked. Fundamentally, they still had to rely on the netizens to watch their show. But right now, since the netizens aren\u2019t watching the show, what\u2019s the point of even hosting the show?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did it become like this?\u201d Director Liu was dumbstruck, \u201cHurry up and clarify it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already clarified it, but it\u2019s useless! There\u2019s just no way of putting a stop to it. Zhenping Yiming\u2019s words have really infuriated our people!\u201d The employee said.</p><br/><p>As of now, he even had the thoughts of killing himself. Initially, he really anticipated this show.</p><br/><p>However, looking at the situation now, it seemed like this show would prematurely come to an end.</p><br/><p>It was the first episode but it was getting destroyed by that sc*m. Who was he going to find to talk about this?</p><br/><p>Director Liu quickly took out his handphone. He looked at the official Weibo and was so stunned that he remained dazed while sitting in his original seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck this Shanghai TV. F*k your whole family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the directors ret*rded? There\u2019s no need for an explanation, I\u2019ve already reported you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking dogs! Why bring over a Japanese just to disgust us? I think you guys are just rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I ever watch any show from Shanghai TV again, I\u2019m not f*cking human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoycott Shanghai TV!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Everyone, boycott Shanghai TV!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly end this ret*rded show. The more I watch it, the more frustrated I get. I can\u2019t stand watching this Japanese show off anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Japanese Broadcasting Station.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Let me tell you guys something funny. The Chinese\u2019s Internet has completely exploded! Zhenping Yiming\u2019s words had really infuriated the Chinese, but yet there\u2019s nothing they could do. Let me translate it for you. Just watch!\u201d</p><br/><p>After which, many of the Chinese\u2019s discussions appeared in the Broadcasting Station.</p><br/><p>When the Japanese audience saw this discussion, they also laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m laughing to death. I\u2019m afraid the Chinese must be furious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Zhenping Yiming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t the Chinese very proud in the past? Right now, our person is showing off on their national TV. Let\u2019s see what they can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the venue.</p><br/><p>The host felt very awkward watching Zhenping Yiming show off. He was furious. He never expected that this b*stard would be so despicable.</p><br/><p>The TV station invited him over to have a civilized sharing of sports knowledge. But they didn\u2019t expect that the other party wouldn\u2019t think the same way, but rather belittle the Chinese sports scene from the side. Or rather, openly belittle the sports scene. He bluntly showed his intentions of taunting the Chinese.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah!\u201d The host was very professional, but at this moment, all he could do was to agree. \u201cOkay, we have talked quite a bit already. Does anybody in the audience have any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>He decided to quickly switch the topic. He didn\u2019t want to let Zhenping Yiming speak any further.</p><br/><p>Or else, who knew what he would say?</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t know what the situation was online, but he felt that it probably had gone haywire.</p><br/><p>One of the guests couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He picked up the microphone and asked, \u201cMay I ask, the Japanese have only ever got one championship, moreover, it is only the Asian Championships. What confidence do you have to say that you have already broken the \u2018unbeatable myth\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming said arrogantly, \u201cOnce is enough. From what I know, Xu Song is a member of the Chinese team, and he is third in the world. Since I have beaten him by a definite margin, it already proves that my skills are better than his. Could it be that you Chinese refuse to admit your defeat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this were the case, then it really is a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The guest was completely lost for words. Right now, they were at the disadvantage, since they did in fact, lose the competition.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the score was a huge margin. It was indeed a clean sweep.</p><br/><p>The guest looked at Zhenping Yiming with hatred. He speechlessly put the microphone down.</p><br/><p>Initially, he did look forward to being a guest on this show. However, as of now, he didn\u2019t have a single bit of expectations left for the show.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere at the show right now was very tense. If it was someone ordinary, he would definitely not dare to offend so many people.</p><br/><p>However, to Zhenping Yiming, it didn\u2019t really matter to him. He was a Japanese, not a Chinese.</p><br/><p>He wanted to show his might on today\u2019s show and also to put out the Chinese\u2019s over-confident attitude. He would be a national hero after getting back to Japan.</p><br/><p>When that time comes, he would be warmly welcomed by the citizens. He got really excited thinking about that scene.</p><br/><p>Just at that moment, a certain guest stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no question for Xu Song\u2019s abilities. He once single-handedly defeated Fujiwara from Japan. His defeat this time was because he aggravated an old injury which affected his display.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, everybody could already see that.</p><br/><p>When the competition first started, Xu Song used his unquestionable ability to crush Zhenping Yiming in the first set, winning 1-0. However, from the second set onwards, it was obvious that Xu Song\u2019s movement had a problem.</p><br/><p>Moreover, his originally calm expression showed traces of pain and agony.</p><br/><p>And in the end, he lost the competition.</p><br/><p>From a professional point of view, Xu Song definitely had a problem, or else, nothing like that would have happened.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming laughed, \u201cAt that time, Senior Fujiwara was indeed strong, however, he was getting rather advanced in age. His strength and reactions were as sharp as before. Moreover, at that time, Xu Song was still very young and could, therefore, win Senior Fujiwara. It\u2019s not something to be proud about. As for the aggravation of his old injuries, I don\u2019t agree. It\u2019s probably just finding an excuse for losing the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

He saw that quite a number of people were around, so he avoided them. He didn\u2019t want others to see him fishing up all kinds of strange items. If people saw Master Lin fishing up a bra, they would die of laughter.</p><br/><p>He cast the fishing line and waited quietly. He knew that this required time and he wondered what would come up this time.</p><br/><p>In the distance, a seven-year-old boy passed by a small shop. He stood outside the entrance for a long while before going in.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, do you have Da Luo Jin Xian* for sale?\u201d asked the little boy, staring at the shop owner with his big, round eyes. He was small in size, even shorter than the counter.</p><br/><p>The owner, who was playing with his computer, waved his hand and said, \u201cNope, nope.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy was disappointed. Then, he went over to another small shop.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAuntie, do you have Da Luo Jin Xian for sale?\u201d asked the little boy eagerly.</p><br/><p>The female owner looked at the little boy and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. This boy was really amusing. \u201cChild, Auntie doesn\u2019t have it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy left, disappointed. But he didn\u2019t stop. He went to shop after shop to keep on asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you come from, kid? Scram! Don\u2019t bother us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. Hurry up and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose family is this kid from? So naughty. Hurry up and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy went asking at many different shops and some of the owners waved him off impatiently. They felt like this kid was here to cause trouble. And some owners did not even bother with him.</p><br/><p>By the river.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The harvest this time was pretty good. Lin Fan had managed to fish up two items. One was a medicinal pill which didn\u2019t belong to this world. When he fished it up, he knew at once. This was a healing pill, and the medicinal power it possessed was enough to cure all diseases that currently existed.</p><br/><p>This angling class of knowledge was really mystical. It could even be considered the most mystical among all of the classes of knowledge that Lin Fan possessed.</p><br/><p>The second item was a medicinal ingredient. A hundred-year-old piece of Chinese knotweed. When he fished it up and saw this sh*t-looking object, he had wondered what the heck it was. But when it entered his hands, he knew that this was a hundred-year-old Chinese knotweed. This made Lin Fan very excited.</p><br/><p>For him to be able to obtain these things that didn\u2019t even exist, he felt really fortunate.</p><br/><p>Looking at the time, it was about time to leave. He had a clearer idea about the angling class of knowledge now. If he was lucky, he would be able to fish something up in an hour. If not, he might not even be able to get anything in two hours. And in between, some fish might even get hooked. It was pretty f*cked up.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was about to keep his fishing rod, a soft and immature voice came from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Uncle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and saw a little kid staring at him, looking exhausted. He was a little curious. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cWhat is it, kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a little strange. Where were this kid\u2019s parents? Why didn\u2019t they take care of him?</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, do you know where I can buy Da Luo Jin Xian?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*Pfft!*</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he burst into laughter. <em>Where is this kid from? Why is he so amusing? Da Luo Jin Xian? F*ck, who taught him about that?</em></p><br/><p>But Lin Fan didn\u2019t say that there was no place that sold it. Instead, he decided to play along with the kid. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the little boy heard this, he was so moved that he nearly cried. \u201cWhere is it, Uncle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cLet me ask you, what do you want to buy Da Luo Jin Xian for? This isn\u2019t something you can buy so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy really wanted to buy Da Luo Jin Xian, so he hurriedly answered, \u201cI wanted to buy Da Luo Jin Xian for my uncle to eat. My uncle is sick and all the aunties say only Da Luo Jin Xian can save my uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. He couldn\u2019t quite make sense of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The little boy said, My dad and mom are in a faraway place and now, I only have my uncle with me. Uncle, please tell me quickly, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he was momentarily stunned. Then, he read the kid\u2019s fortune, looking very closely. He was slowly taken aback. He could already see it.</p><br/><p>Pitiful. It was really pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your uncle?\u201d Lin Fan continued to ask.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The little boy appeared very excited. He had asked around for so long and finally, someone knew what he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy uncle was working when he fell from a high place. He has been on the sickbed since and never woke up. I want to buy Da Luo Jin Xian for my uncle so he\u2019ll wake up,\u201d explained the little boy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed, then patted the little boy\u2019s head. \u201cGood boy. Your uncle is lucky to have a nephew like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, can you tell me where to buy it?\u201d asked the little boy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cKid, you\u2019re in luck. Uncle has one with me right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was going to give the medicinal pill that he had fished up to the kid. This pill was a priceless treasure to others but to Lin Fan, it was just a pill. He could craft another one anyway.</p><br/><p>The little boy jumped up in excitement. Then, he became a little nervous. \u201cUncle, how much are you selling it for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan could tell that the kid was nervous. \u201cUncle will give it to you as a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy immediately shook his head. \u201cNo way. My Uncle told me that I can\u2019t just take things from people. I have to use my own money.\u201d</p><br/><p>This little kid\u2019s uncle had taught him pretty well.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. How much money do you have?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The little boy inserted his white little hand into his pocket and took out a very old ten dollar note. Then, he asked cautiously, \u201cUncle, I only have ten dollars. Is it enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you really are lucky. Uncle was just going to sell it for ten dollars. Here you go\u2026\u201d Lin Fan took out that pill from his pocket and placed it into the kid\u2019s palm. \u201cTake care of it. This is Da Luo Jin Xian. It\u2019s very valuable. When you go back, put it into your uncle\u2019s mouth and he\u2019ll wake up very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The way Lin Fan saw it, this kid probably wanted to buy Da Luo Jin Xian because many people had said, \u2018Only Da Luo Jin Xian can save him now\u2019. There must have been no other way to save his uncle.</p><br/><p>How would this kid have known what Da Luo Jin Xian was?</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, here\u2019s the money.\u201d The little boy handed the money over to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept the money and smiled. \u201cAlright, how about Uncle send you home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, Uncle. I can go back myself. It\u2019s very near.\u201d The little boy shook his head. Then, he said in a grateful tone, \u201cThank you very much, Uncle. I\u2019m leaving now. See you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved at the little boy. \u201cSee you. Watch out for cars on the way home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, I know.\u201d Having bought the \u2018Da Luo Jin Xian\u2019, the little boy was elated and excited. As he walked with his short little legs, there was a skip in his step. At the same time, he kept the \u2018Da Luo Jin Xian\u2019 well protected for fear that it might drop.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. Then, he kept his things in his car before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>(*Note: Da Luo Jin Xian is the title of a Daoist deity.)</p></div>\n</div>"}

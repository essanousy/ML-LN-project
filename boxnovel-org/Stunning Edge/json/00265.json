It made people forget their original intentions in an instant. The group of people were stunned.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Ao Shuang heard this voice, his heart tightened. Of course she knew who the owner of this voice was. It was the demi-human girl who had been pretending to be innocent by the lake that day. At this point of time, Xiao Ao Shuang did not think that it was a coincidence. Could it be that she was looking for me just now?</p><br/><p>\u201cPa.\u201d Parina, why are you here? \u201d The youths who were about to make their moves all stopped when they saw the young girl. Instead, they asked her these words with some hesitation. His tone was complicated. There was hesitation, pity, and reluctance to please.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, what are you guys doing here?\u201d \u201cAre you playing?\u201d Parina\u2019s clear eyes widened, and she seemed curious to see what was going on. Her pretty face was slightly pink, but it looked even more enticing. Her long eyelashes blinked and her small red lips slightly pursed. She looked so adorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Parina, don\u2019t come over. \u201d Surprisingly, Ashlin was a little nervous, he turned around and shouted at those people, \u201cLet\u2019s go, hurry up and carry me away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows and saw the group of people carrying Ashlin running away in a panic. Qi Ao Shuang did not stop him. Making a scene in the academy was not good for her, nor was it good for Wynes. There must be a reason why Wynes had been coerced into keeping his tongue. If he acted rashly, it might also embarrass Wynes. It turned out that Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s guess was right. Wynes did have his own difficulties.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, they left.\u201d You two are freshmen, right? \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Parina walked up to them with a light heart. She tilted her head to look at Qi Ao Shuang and Wynes. Her eyes were wide open as she asked. Her sweet voice had an indescribable charm to it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang snorted coldly and ignored Parina. She walked forward to support Wynes.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, how are you injured? Are you alright?\u201d Seeing that Qi Ao Shuang ignored her, she secretly bit her lips in displeasure. Then, her face returned to that innocent and pure look from before, she went up to ask Waines.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cThank you for your concern, senior sister.\u201d Wynes took a deep breath and nodded politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Is this redhead your friend? \u201cWhat are they called?\u201d Parina and Wynes looked at each other. The expression in their eyes suddenly became very gentle, as if there was an unspeakable gravitational force. Staring straight at Wynes, his tone became very gentle, \u201cI\u2019m called Parina.\u201d \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Wynes, and this is my roommate, Qi Ao Shuang\u2026\u201d Wynes murmured, looking at the expression in Parina\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang frowned and turned around to look at Parina. Suddenly, he snorted coldly.</p><br/><p>Parina immediately felt a formless, sharp aura pounce on her, shaking her to the point that she was completely exhausted. She even took a step back. As for his chest, it was stuffy and he almost couldn\u2019t breathe. The fascination in Parina\u2019s eyes was gone, replaced by astonishment, but there was no fear.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not look at Parina again. She helped Wynes to get up and slowly walked back.</p><br/><p>Parina didn\u2019t say anything to stop him. Instead, she stood where she was and watched Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back. A crafty smile appeared on her face. After the figures of Qi Ao Shuang and Wynes disappeared, Parina muttered to herself, \u201cQi Ao Shuang?\u201d Hehe, we finally know your name. \u201cStupid boy, wait to be my captive.\u201d Parina smoothed the hair by her ear, but her eyes were heavy. Just now, he was actually able to interrupt his charm, and almost injured himself. Hmmm, interesting.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything as she supported Wynes towards the dorm. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026. On the contrary, Wynes felt a bit nervous.</p><br/><p>After returning to the dormitory, Xiao Ao Shuang brought some hot water and placed it on the table. Then he sat by the side without saying anything else. He just looked at Wynes in silence.</p><br/><p>Wynes took a towel to wash his wounds and applied the medicine. After doing all this, he said in a low voice, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know what happened just now, so I told that person your name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned, but then she sighed bitterly in her heart. This Wynes, what a good man!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to mind, that woman just now used her charm on you, that\u2019s why you lost your composure.\u201d Xiao Aushuang said solemnly, \u201cWhat I want to ask is why you did that?\u201d After Xiao Ao Shuang said this, she looked at the wounds on Wynes and fell silent. Ever since Qi Ao Shuang learned the truth behind this matter, she had a good impression of this young man in front of her. Although he was a bit pedantic, he was a person with his own principles. He would rather be injured and humiliated than do something to frame him. He was just a freshman, yet he didn\u2019t cower in the face of those students with 6-star strength.</p><br/><p>Astonishment flashed across Wynes\u2019s face when he heard Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s explanation. He then thought for a moment, as if he was recalling how Parina had used her Charm on him back then.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not speak again, just waiting silently for Wynes\u2019 next words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do anything that goes against my principles.\u201d Wynes suddenly said in a low voice. Of course, he was referring to the people who had tried to force him to frame Qi Ao Shuang. After a pause Wynes added, \u201cAbsolutely not, even if it cost me my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at the abnormally serious Wynes, looked at his thin and weak body, then looked at the determination in his eyes. Suddenly, Qi Ao Shuang smiled. She stood up and walked to Wynes, clapping him on the shoulder as she said, \u201cEveryone has their own principles.\u201d I\u2019ve made up my mind, you friend. \u201d</p><br/><p>Wynes was stunned. Suddenly, something flashed in his eyes. This was the first time someone had said that they were willing to be friends with him! All those people had ever said to themselves were disdainful, contemptuous, and malicious sarcastic words. And this time, this red-haired arrogant youth actually said that he wanted to befriend him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cIt hurts?\u201d Only then did Qi Ao Shuang remember that she had slapped a person who seemed to be injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d Wynes quickly shook his head, looked up at Xiao Ao Shuang and said, \u201cYou, are you really willing to be my friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied as if it was a matter of course.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you knew about my background, would you still know?\u201d Wynes suddenly felt nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrigin?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not friends with your ancestry, I\u2019m friends with you.\u201d Looking at the nervous expression on Wynes\u2019 face, Xiao Ao Shuang could not help but guess in her heart. Wynes\u2019 birth seemed to be a thorn in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if, even if, I, I am an illegitimate child \u2026\u201d Wynes looked at the young man in front of him and made up his mind. Long pain is better than short pain. If the youth in front of him had really become friends with him and found out that he had been repulsed by him, he might as well know the situation now.</p><br/><p>As soon as Wynes said this, he looked at Xiao Ao Shuang nervously, feeling very nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cHur hur, so what if he is an illegitimate child?\u201d Your mind is strange. Can\u2019t illegitimate children make friends? \u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned and asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>Wynes looked at the expression in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes, but he only saw that there was a clear look in his eyes. There was only sincerity in them, and there was no hint of falsehood in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you \u2026\u201d Wynes\u2019 lips trembled slightly as he spoke with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, alright.\u201d Xiao Aushuang smiled, \u201cI should be the one thanking you.\u201d You\u2019d rather be beaten to a pig\u2019s head than set me up. What did those people tell you to hide in my closet? \u201d From the moment Wynes would rather be beaten into a pig\u2019s head than frame Qi Ao Shuang, he had already won the friendship of Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Ao Shuang asked this question, Wynes\u2019 expression turned strange. He blinked his eyes, wanting to say something but then hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Looking at Wynes\u2019 attitude, Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a girl\u2019s underwear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRumble ~ ~ ~\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was burnt to ashes by Lei.</p><br/><p>A woman\u2019s underwear, hidden in his own cabinet, is framing me as a pervert?</p><br/><p>This, this.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that a bit too much?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also the school belle Bethany\u2019s underwear.\u201d Wynes\u2019s face turned red and he said in a low voice, \u201cThose people stole it.\u201d Trying to frame you. \u201cMake you a public enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s mouth twitched. At this moment, he felt even more grateful to Wynes. What kind of joke was this! Stealing a woman\u2019s underwear, and it was a school beauty! This would definitely make him the public enemy of the youths of the school! The most important thing was that this matter had happened to him. It had all happened to him in June, and it had all happened to him! He couldn\u2019t be more wronged! \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Not bad, not bad. Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s forehead was covered in cold sweat. Right now, the more he looked at this thin kid, the more pleasing he looked to his eyes. Thanks to him, he didn\u2019t make himself the second generation of Dou\u2019e.</p><br/><p>Imagine if those girls were pointing at their noses and screaming, \u201cScoundrel!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it sent chills down her spine.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you\u2019ve done too well.\u201d Very good. \u201d In his excitement, Xiao Ao Shuang patted on Wynes\u2019 injured shoulder again, causing him to grimace in pain.</p><br/><p>Wynes bared his teeth, too painful to say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Wynes, you won\u2019t have much contact with that Parina today. \u201cShe is a demi-human and is very skilled in Charm.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly remembered the young lady with a pure and innocent appearance, but she was not simple at all. Judging from the attitude of Ashlin\u2019s group towards her, this young girl was definitely not a simple person in this academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, alright.\u201d \u201cWhen I see her, I\u2019ll turn around and walk away.\u201d Wynes nodded seriously and agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve bled so much, for all you\u2019ve suffered. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to dinner.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said to Wynes with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cA feast?\u201d Wynes wondered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a street over at the academy? Is there a best hotel?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, but it\u2019s expensive!\u201d Wynes immediately looked alarmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot of money.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly looked like an upstart, pulling out a few crystal cards and laughing out loud, looking as vulgar as possible.</p><br/><p>Wynes broke out in a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>In the evening, they went to the best hotel on the street. Unexpectedly, they ran into the party involved in the matter that almost happened there. The other school belle was called Bethany.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Without waiting for anyone\u2019s response, Xue Longfei snapped his fingers. Instantly, fully armored guards appeared in the plaza.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any orders, sire?\u201d Evidently, this guard was trained well, his aura reserved, his posture steady.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and see if any of the Temple of Light or Black Lightning organization survived,\u201d Xue Longfei ordered indifferently. \u201cIf there are, finish them off. Take care of the bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The guards left the plaza, not even blinking at the command.</p><br/><p>Xue Longfei beckoned at the girl who had just been chasing Dong Fenghou. She walked over obediently.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo. Tell Qian-er to give me her tiara. Send it to the boat docked at the Eastern pier.\u201d Xue Longfei spoke softly, yet in a manner that could not be questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The girl nodded, turned, and left speedily. Dong Fenghou watched the girl leave with lingering fears. He was bewildered. Under the girl\u2019s attack, he was unable to focus enough spiritual power to summon magic beasts. The moment he made a spiritual connection, it would be interrupted. Who exactly was she?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo. This is not a good place to talk.\u201d Xue Longfei stood up and led them away.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang followed without hesitation. Everyone else followed suit. Feng Yixuan was quiet, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>He led them to eastern part of the city until they reached the pier. When the bustling people saw Xue Longfei, they all prepared to bow, but Xue Longfei only waved offhandedly. They immediately stopped and continued with what they were doing. Qi Aoshuang was shocked. The loyalty these commoners had towards Xue Longfei was abnormal. Who exactly was Xue Longfei?!</p><br/><p>Naturally, the most luxurious boat docked there was Xue Longfei\u2019s. The moment they saw how elaborately designed it was, they new. Xue Longfei led them without any change in expression. After entering the boat, everyone sat down. Currently, no one was in the mood to admire the boat\u2019s beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan, the son of the president of the Feng Trade Union,\u201d Xue Longfei said after sitting down, pointing at Feng Yixuan. He paused, then looked at Leng Lingyun. \u201cYou, the Divine Prince tricked by the witch, Leng Lingyun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone frowned, but did not say anything, all waiting for Xue Longfei to finish speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you, the archer who follows Claire, Qiao Chuxin.\u201d His gaze shifted to Qiao Chuxin. Then he looked at Dong Fenghou. \u201cThe summoner who follows Claire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression darkened. Xue Longfei knew everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you two are the twin Dark magicians.\u201d Xue Longfei continued, looking at Xi Shaoqi and Xi Shaosi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Xi Shaoqi said unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Your disguises can trick normal people, but do you think it can trick the Temple of Light or Black Lightning? Do you really believe you could disappear into a crowd?\u201d Xue Longfei laughed profoundly. \u201cDo you think you look so ordinary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was silent, their expression unsightly.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Qi Aoshuang let out a sigh. She slowly closed her eyes. She then opened her eyes, her gaze serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Shaoqi, Xi Shaosi. Return to Yowusali and help Long Sasi. Now.\u201d Qi Aoshuang had an unopposable aura.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi and Xi Shaosi shared a glance, their expressions also serious. They stood up, looking at Qi Aoshuang intensely. \u201cDivine Princess, if it is your command, we will set out immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI command you. Be careful on your way back.\u201d Qi Aoshuang gave a slight nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ll send men to send you out this ocean area and send back Qian-er at the same time,\u201d Xue Longfei said, pleased with his idea. \u201cThe seas here are all under my jurisdiction. No one dares to challenge me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gave him a nod. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to thank me?\u201d Xue Longfei sized up Qi Aoshuang pervertedly. \u201cIf you thank me wholeheartedly in five years time, I definitely won\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing their change in expression, he said hastily, \u201cI was just joking, joking.\u201d The cold gazes told him that his joke was not funny at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cYixuan\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Qi Aoshuang turned to Feng Yixuan who had been silent. It was the first time Qi Aoshuang called him by his first name.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan looked up and was met with Qi Aoshuang\u2019s pitch black eyes.</p><br/><p>The two locked gazes, not saying a word, but understood each other.</p><br/><p>Just as Qi Aoshuang was about to speak, Feng Yixuan said, \u201cAoshuang, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. First return. Don\u2019t let Aunt An be hurt.\u201d Qi Aoshuang\u2019s heart settled down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must return to Yowusali safely.\u201d Feng Yixuan looked at Qi Aoshuang deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Qi Aoshuang revealed a smile, nodding.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes flashed with loneliness, but it quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cChuxin, Dong Fenghou, we will separate here.\u201d Qi Aoshuang faced them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? No, we just met up a short moment ago. I don\u2019t want to leave you!\u201d Qiao Chuxin stood up emotionally.</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou pulled on her sleeve. \u201cChuxin, it will be more dangerous if we stay together. The chances of being exposed will be higher. It is better if we split up to find what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d Because Xue Longfei was present, Dong Fenghou did not specify what they were looking for. This, however, piqued his interest. What exactly was Qi Aoshuang looking for?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Only then did Qiao Chuxin understand. She bit her lip, then said with difficulty, \u201cThen\u2026 then we\u2019ll split up. Dong Fenghou and I will help you find the other stuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang froze. She had not planned on Qiao Chuxing and Dong Fenghou endangering themselves for her. Originally, she was going to tell them to continue traveling or return to Yowusali where the Temple of Darkness had influence.</p><br/><p>On deck, there came the sound of footsteps. Xue Longfei looked up at the noise. \u201cYou guys can continue talking. I\u2019ll go out first. The tiara must have been sent.\u201d Then he left, leaving them alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cChuxin and I will look for the beast clan. I understand their language and likes and dislikes. I will definitely get their artifact.\u201d Dong Fenghou had an unusually staunch expression, his tone of voice also difficult to oppose.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. Aoshuang, Donghou and I will help you look for the artifact. If we separate, our identities won\u2019t be exposed so easily. There are archers everywhere.\u201d Qiao Chuxin nodded hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Seeing Dong Fenghou and Qiao Chuxin\u2019s staunch expressions, she could not say, I am not worthy you endangering yourselves for me\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, we\u2019ll do what you said. After we find the beast clan, we\u2019ll find the dwarves.\u201d Qiao Chuxin nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still artifacts in the hands of the goblins*, the fae, and the dragons,\u201d Leng Lingyun said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>*earth spirits changed to goblins</p><br/><p>When he mentioned the dragons, everyone thought of Ben at the same time. That clumsy dragon, has he avenged himself yet?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will visit the dragon clan with Leng Lingyun. If we find Ben, it will be much easier,\u201d Qi Aoshuang decided. Ben\u2019s strength was evident. Most importantly, he could fly. This would make it much easier for them to act.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll do what we planned.\u201d Qiao Chuxin nodded seriously. She gripped Qi Aoshuang\u2019s hand. \u201cAoshuang, you must be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes flashed with complex emotions. She stole the words right out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must also be careful.\u201d Qi Aoshuang gripped Qiao Chuxin\u2019s hand in turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, no one will suspect our identity. I will take care of Qiao Chuxin.\u201d Dong Fenghou smiled sheepishly. \u201cEven if we can\u2019t beat them, we can run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Qiao Chuxin rolled her eyes, dissatisfied with his cowardly words.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun if you can\u2019t beat them. Chuxin, I hope nothing bad happens to you,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said seriously.</p><br/><p>Qiao Chuxin froze, then nodded obediently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be that dumb. I will return alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded.</p><br/><p>With everything decided, the atmosphere in the boat grew heavy. No one knew what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, come in.\u201d Xue Longfei\u2019s voice came from outside. The next moment, he came in with a triumphant smile, an exquisite wooden box in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCl- I mean, Qi Aoshuang. This is what you wanted.\u201d Xue Longfei handed over the box. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am delighted to send Qian-er back to the mermaids.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang opened the box. It was the tiara depicted in the pendant. This was a part of the God Feather? Besides looking ornate, she could not tell what was special about it. It did not even emit magic ripples. Perhaps just like the god of Darkness said, by itself, it had no power. Only together would they emit grand, terrifying power.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Qi Aoshuang thanked sincerely. No matter what motives he had when doing all this, he had still helped her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to thank me\u2026\u201d Xue Longfei laughed vulgarly. Everyone swiveled to give him an icy stare, stopping him in mid sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give this to the mermaid princess. Tell her her mother misses her.\u201d Qi Aoshuang handed over the pendant the queen had given her. She was not worried anymore whether or not the mermaid princess would return any more. She had handed over the precious tiara just because Xue Longfei told her too. Clearly, she would listen to anything Xue Longfei said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, no problem.\u201d Xue Longfei put away the pendant.</p><br/><p>And so, everyone departed. Xue Longfei sent men to accompany them on ships. He himself accompanied Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun personally. Before leaving, Feng Yixuan did not say a word, only gazing at Qi Aoshuang intensely. Silent, unspoken words were exchanged.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

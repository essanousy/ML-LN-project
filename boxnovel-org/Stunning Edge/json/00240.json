Just like that, it reached into her body and grabbed the life core from her body. Then, he abruptly pulled it out.</p><br/><p>Terrified, Lila\u2019s eyes slowly dimmed. Her body slowly weakened and before she even fell to the ground, she had already turned into sand!</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang stared at Camil in a daze. The Camil in front of her was so strange and strange. Not the Camille she knew at all. The person in front of him exuded an incomparably cold and terrifying aura. The tail fur of the Maneki-Neko in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arms stood up, its eyes wide open as it let out threatening whooshing sounds. Chasing Treasure Cats is more sensitive to danger than any race. The person in front of him was very dangerous, very dangerous. Xiao Ao Shuang was completely clueless as to what exactly was going on with Camil. Just a moment ago, he had wanted to take things easy and fend off that demi-human\u2019s eldest daughter, but now, because of a single sentence, he had killed that eldest daughter.</p><br/><p>Camil slowly turned around, and his gaze shifted to Qi Ao Shuang. Xiao Ao Shuang stared blankly into Camil\u2019s eyes. There wasn\u2019t a trace of warmth in those deep blue eyes, but it was like the most beautiful sapphire in the world, as if it could suck in someone. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind suddenly became a little muddled.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew! Phew!\u201d The Magic Treasure Cat suddenly chomped on the back of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand, awakening her from the pain. Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly woke up from her daze and looked away from Camil\u2019s eyes. She was shocked in her heart at what was going on. Just a moment ago, he was confused.</p><br/><p>Camil seemed to come back to his senses at this moment, frowning slightly. The coldness in his eyes vanished in an instant. He looked at Xiao Ao Shuang and revealed a gentle smile, saying softly, \u201cLittle Ao Shuang, I\u2019m sorry. I almost couldn\u2019t control myself.\u201d Don\u2019t look me in the eye when I\u2019m out of sorts. \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly turned her head to look at Camil\u2019s handsome face. Her heart was filled with shock. Who exactly was Camil? Camille, is that his real name? Maybe not at all? Was his name a taboo? Indeed, no one had ever asked for Camil\u2019s name. Everyone knew Camil\u2019s name from others. Naturally, no one had asked. This demi-human\u2019s eldest daughter was the first to ask Camille\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Little Ao Shuang. This place is not suitable for us to stay in.\u201d Camil said with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang regained her senses, nodded lightly, and looked at the sand on the ground. The young lady who was showing off a moment ago completely disappeared just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow!\u201d The Maneki-Neko hid in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arms with lingering fear. It covered its eyes with its little paws and peeked at Camil.</p><br/><p>Camil waved his hand gently, and a breeze blew past. The gravel on the ground dispersed, and nothing out of the ordinary happened. Camil pushed open the door and walked out with Qi Ao Shuang. The guard guarding the door watched in shock as the two of them walked out unharmed. Suddenly, he felt that something was wrong and rushed into the room, but he didn\u2019t see her. After searching the entire room, there was no sign of her. The guard panicked and hurriedly chased after Camil and Qi Ao Shuang, trying to stop them from leaving. \u201cWhere is my lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you ask us where your lady is?\u201d Camille smiled in reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf xiaojie can\u2019t find the person you\u2019re looking for now, you have to ask the both of you!\u201d Although the guard was panicking, he did not dare to treat Camil too badly. The young mistress\u2019s whereabouts were unknown. Was it related to this person? As Hamms\u2019 guards, they had naturally seen the world. Understand that one cannot judge a person by his appearance. Furthermore, the backing of this human was not something that a guard like them could afford to offend.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour family\u2019s young miss has gone out the window to chase after someone. You can go look for her.\u201d We can\u2019t hide her from a living person like that. \u201d Camil said faintly, \u201cAlright, we still have matters to attend to. Please move aside.\u201d Camil\u2019s tone was polite, but cold sweat broke out on the guard\u2019s back. He could not bear to look at the power of the gentle man.</p><br/><p>The guard carefully stepped aside and watched Camil and Qi Ao Shuang leave. However, he engraved Camil\u2019s appearance into his memory. He then hurriedly turned around to report to Hamms, waiting for his decision.</p><br/><p>Camil and Qi Ao Shuang left the hotel silently. Camille was beside him, still smiling softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamil, you \u2026\u201d The two of them walked on the street for a long time. Qi Ao Shuang finally raised her head and prepared to ask what she wanted to say, but a figure in front interrupted her words.</p><br/><p>The back of the person not far from the street in front was very familiar. Just like that, Qi Ao Shuang froze, her eyes stung by her fiery red hair.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan, Feng Yixuan \u2026</p><br/><p>He was really in the Demon World as well \u2026</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan! It really was Feng Yixuan! Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind was completely blank. She stood still and stared at the person in front of her. Although his clothes and aura had changed, that was still Feng Yixuan!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang saw that Feng Yi Xuan was about to leave, so she quickly stepped forward. Camil stood still, watching her with interest. Qi Ao Shuang quickly walked forward, and without thinking, she reached out her hand to grab onto the corner of Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan turned his head.</p><br/><p>Their eyes met.</p><br/><p>The air seemed to have congealed.</p><br/><p>Surprise, joy, and pain flashed through Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes. All of these complex emotions disappeared in an instant. In the next moment, Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes became completely indifferent.</p><br/><p> Qi Ao Shuang suppressed the joy in her heart. Looking at the person in front of her, she smiled and said softly, \u201cYi Xuan \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the next scene that happened caused Qi Aushuang to be stunned.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi Xuan said coldly, \u201cMiss, you must have made a mistake.\u201d I don\u2019t know you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. The person in front of her had fiery red hair, dark eyes, and a handsome face. This was Feng Yixuan; there was no mistake. However, Feng Yixuan\u2019s arrogant aura was ice-cold at this moment. Even so, Qi Ao Shuang was certain that the person in front of her was Feng Yi Xuan. Moreover, when her and Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes had met just now, the emotions that flashed through his eyes had betrayed him. He must be Feng Yixuan!</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned slightly. Just now, when he was walking over, he noticed that there was no one around with Feng Yi Xuan. Feng Yixuan was alone. It wouldn\u2019t be inconvenient for him to meet her, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d My name isn\u2019t Yi Xuan. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong person.\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s tone was still as cold as before. After throwing those words, he turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang reached out her hand to grab onto the corner of Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s clothes, but her hand was grabbed by a white hand. Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned. She turned around and saw that Camil\u2019s handsome face was filled with gentleness.</p><br/><p>Camil lightly shook her head at Qi Ao Shuang. Qi Ao Shuang did not understand. She turned her head to look ahead, only to see Feng Yi Xuan flying away without turning his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang struggled free from Camil\u2019s grasp, biting her lips gently as she asked in a low voice. It was unknown whether he was asking why Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t acknowledge her or why Camil had stopped her from chasing after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe, he must have his reasons.\u201d Camille whispered back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d \u201cHe \u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang lifted her head to look at Camil and asked anxiously.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou want to ask if he has demonic energy on him? You want to ask if he\u2019s a demon clan?\u201d Camil reached out his hand and gently rubbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head as he asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang bit her lip as she watched Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s back disappear from her sight. She nodded, wanting to chase after him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll I can tell you is that he is not human, nor is he a demon.\u201d Camil patted Qi Ao Shuang on the head with tender affection as she continued, \u201cIt\u2019s better if he tells you himself.\u201d \u201cI stopped you because I felt that it was not appropriate for you to meet in such a situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang watched as Feng Yi Xuan disappeared at the end of the street, her heart empty.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou\u2019ll know.\u201d \u201cNow, let\u2019s go back to the popular city.\u201d Camil sighed softly. \u201cIf Feng Yixuan wants to meet you, he will naturally come looking for you. If he doesn\u2019t want to meet you, what\u2019s the use of chasing after him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. Her eyes gradually dimmed, and she slowly lowered her head in silence.</p><br/><p> In the end, she slowly followed Camil back to the City Lord\u2019s Mansion. At this moment, all she could think about was Feng Yixuan, and she even forgot why Camil knew Wanfeng Liu and why he also lived in his Mansion.</p><br/><p>The night was as cold as water, silent and lonely.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned as she leaned against a huge pillar on the side of the corridor and looked up at the sky. A purple moon was hanging in the sky, giving off an indescribable demonic feeling. This was the Demon\u2019s Moon.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was lost in thought as she stared at the purple moon. Her mind was filled with the cold mind of Yi Xuan. Why would Feng Yixuan appear in the Demon World? Why not recognize her? Qi Ao Shuang recalled Camil\u2019s words. Feng Yi Xuan was not a human, but neither was he a demon. What was Feng Yixuan\u2019s true identity? Was it because of Feng Yixuan\u2019s unknown identity that he had appeared here? Would she not recognize him?</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow ~ ~\u201d The Maneki-Neko squatted on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder, and rubbed its furry head against Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang turned her head around, looked at the treasure cat, then carried her down, revealed a faint smile and said in a low voice: \u201cAh\u2019Bao, are you comforting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow ~ ~\u201d The Chosen Treasured Cat waved its claws, then nodded its head vigorously.</p><br/><p> \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang rubbed the cat\u2019s head and smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>The Maneki-Neko nestled in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arms, with its paws on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arm, it squinted its eyes. Qi Ao Shuang looked up into the night sky and sighed softly. He really wanted to find Feng Yixuan and ask him what was going on. However, just like Camil had said, if Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t want to say it, then it wouldn\u2019t matter even if they caught up to him.</p><br/><p>A wave of cold wind gently blew, and the air was moist and cold.</p><br/><p>The Maneki-Neko\u2019s squinted eyes suddenly widened as it struggled out of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s embrace. It let out a whoop and raised its tail, the fur on it standing up straight.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. After which, she abruptly turned around and saw a silhouette flashing past behind a pillar. The figure that stung her eyes!</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang did not hesitate and immediately gave chase. It was Feng Yixuan, it was him! There must be no mistake!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan quickly and silently left the City Lord\u2019s Mansion. Qi Ao Shuang also tiptoed up and followed closely behind.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan seemed to want to quickly shake off Qi Ao Shuang, who was behind him. He sped up and leapt towards the city gate, with Qi Ao Shuang following closely behind. She wanted to find out what was going on. Feng Yixuan pretended not to know her, but now he was secretly coming to see her. What did this mean?</p><br/><p>Could it be that Feng Yixuan really had some unspeakable secrets? Thinking of this, Xiao Ao Shuang became anxious and sped up to chase after him.</p><br/><p>The city gates were still open, and the guards were dozing off. The gates were always open during the time of the tourney. Feng Yixuan and Qi Ao Shuang left in an instant. The guard only saw a light breeze pass by. He raised his head and saw nothing. He only thought that he was seeing things and continued dozing off.</p><br/><p>After leaving the city gate, they continued to chase to the west until they came to a forest. However, there was no sign of Feng Yi Xuan in front of them. Qi Ao Shuang stood in the middle of the forest with her eyes closed, but she couldn\u2019t feel anything. Just like that, Feng Yi Xuan disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan!\u201d Yi Xuan! Qi Ao Shuang opened her eyes and called out to her in a low voice, but all that answered her was the rustling sound of the wind hitting the leaves.</p><br/><p>There was no one around, nothing.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stood still, her eyes filled with disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow ~ ~\u201d The Maneki-Neko, who had been crouching on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder and hugging her neck, mewled softly, seemingly comforting her.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stretched out her hand and gently stroked the cat\u2019s head. She let out a sigh, then turned around and prepared to go back. Just as he turned around, he met the pair of red eyes. The red eyes were bright and beautiful, and the red eyes were deep and deep. It was like a whirlpool that made one\u2019s heart palpitate. And the arrogance in her eyes and beautiful face was so familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Chieftain!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang stared at the person who had suddenly appeared in front of her. The red-eyed girl in front of him was the Young Master of the Devil Realm that Qi Ao Shuang had met in the Demon Area! That Young Master with the transcendent strength! Just like that, she silently appeared in front of him. At this moment, she was wearing a set of black clothes. The sleeves and hem of her clothes were embroidered with a golden pattern. It was noble and cold, dressed like a man. The Maneki-Neko let out a meow sound, and slid from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder to behind Qi Ao Shuang, grabbing onto the clothes on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back and hanging it on her back. His body was trembling slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, then don\u2019t come near him!\u201d The young master\u2019s tone was no longer as casual and cynical as before. At this moment, her tone was abnormally cold and there was no trace of warmth in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Him? Who? Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. The Young Lord of the Devil Realm actually appeared in the Demon World, and suddenly said these words in front of himself. Qi Ao Shuang frowned. She could feel the killing intent emanating from the young master. This was not a disguise. The young lord in front of her really wanted to kill her!</p><br/><p>Who was the young master referring to him? Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she looked at the young master whose face was covered in frost. Suddenly, she came to a realization that she had been chasing after Feng Yi Xuan earlier. Could it be that the \u2018him\u2019 mentioned by the young master was Feng Yixuan? Qi Ao Shuang was shocked by her own thoughts. So, Feng Yixuan was a demon? And he knew the young master in front of him?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jian City asked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d The young lord\u2019s tone didn\u2019t have a trace of warmth, but a hint of emotion appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned, because she could clearly see the intense hatred in the young master\u2019s eyes! The young master was hating her! Why? \u201cHe suffered so much for you!\u201d I really want to kill you! \u201cI\u2019ll dismember your body into ten thousand pieces, and scatter your soul!\u201d The Young Lord\u2019s blood-red eyes suddenly became even redder, and the hatred and hatred in his eyes grew more and more intense. A faint blush gradually appeared on her body.</p><br/><p>The Maneki-Neko behind Qi Ao Shuang trembled even more intensely. She was very sensitive to danger. She only knew that this guy in front of her was very, very dangerous. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she and her treasured treasure would lose their lives here! What a scary guy. Meow ~ ~ ~ Little Tian Tian ~ ~ Hurry and save me ~ ~ The Treasure Chaser lay on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back, wailing in its heart.</p><br/><p>Heaven Breaker, of course, couldn\u2019t hear the howls of distress in the Maneki-Neko\u2019s heart. As such, Xiao Ao Shuang and the Maneki-Neko had to face this extremely dangerous fellow before them.</p><br/><p> Wei Ao Shuang was a little puzzled, as he did not understand why the young master, who was very friendly towards him before, now hated him so much. Could it be that Feng Yixuan was someone from the devil world, and even more so someone the young lord loved? That was why the young master was so resentful towards him? Could it be like this? However, the Young Lord\u2019s eyes were different from Liu Xue Jing\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>The Young Master\u2019s feelings towards Feng Yi Xuan was not the same as Liu Xueqing\u2019s feelings towards Leng Lingyun! Qi Ao Shuang was certain of this.</p><br/><p>The red light on the young lord\u2019s body was getting brighter, and he was getting closer to Xiao Ao Shuang step by step. An immense pressure bore down on Qi Ao Shuang, and she subconsciously retreated backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d A vicious light flashed in the young lord\u2019s eyes. He suddenly raised his hand, and a frightening red light condensed in his palm.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes darkened, and she immediately took precautions.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the young lord\u2019s hand was grabbed by a large hand, and a cold voice rang out: \u201cIf you want that person to hate you forever, then attack her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang froze, staring blankly at the person who suddenly appeared beside the young master.</p><br/><p> \u201cHmph!\u201d The young lord\u2019s eyes were filled with emotion, and then his gaze became distant, filled with indignation and unwillingness. Finally, he violently shook his hand free and turned around to leave in a rage.</p><br/><p>That person just stood there silently, looking at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang opened her mouth and called out this name.</p><br/><p>There was no mistake. In this world, only Leng Lingyun had this sort of appearance, and this sort of temperament. She had a head full of silver hair, a handsome face, and charming purple eyes. However, at this moment, a strand of hair was hanging down in front of Leng Lingyun\u2019s forehead, obstructing one of his eyes, which no longer had eyes. This not only did not reduce his charm, but instead added a trace of indescribable charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang.\u201d A trace of a smile appeared on Leng Lingyun\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s lips trembled. There were many things she wanted to say and many questions she wanted to ask. However, when the words reached her mouth, she couldn\u2019t even utter a single word. He could only look deeply at the person before him as he slowly approached him. Leng Lingyun did not move. She just stood there silently, waiting for Qi Ao Shuang to come closer.</p><br/><p>After what seemed like a long time, Qi Ao Shuang finally arrived in front of Leng Lingyun. Qi Ao Shuang extended her hand and slowly extended it towards Leng Lingyun\u2019s face. Leng Lingyun did not move, only looked at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s bright and beautiful face.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang carefully brushed aside the hair that was hanging down from Leng Lingyun\u2019s head. In the next moment, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s pupils contracted. She clearly saw that one of Leng Lingyun\u2019s pupils had lost its eyeball! It was a strange void! In other words, this purple crystal earring on his ear was really one of Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy \u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked with some difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuhe \u2026\u201d I thought that Feng Yixuan was just an ordinary human. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not!\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s cold voice sounded out slowly, \u201cSo, I think he can give you what I can\u2019t give you.\u201d \u201cBut, I was wrong \u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s voice was faint and empty, yet it contained an indescribable determination.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang withdrew her hand, but her gaze didn\u2019t leave Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not human.\u201d I\u2019m not going to let go so easily. \u201d Leng Lingyun suddenly stretched out her hand, gently stroking Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hair, and smiled, \u201cAo Shuang, I will protect you.\u201d I will fulfill all your wishes for you. As long as you are happy, I will subvert everything for you. \u201cAnd what hurts your heart, I will destroy your mouth for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at the determination in Leng Lingyun\u2019s purple eyes, an indescribable feeling welled up in her heart. She didn\u2019t even know what this feeling was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis earring is half of my strength.\u201d Even if I am not with you, it will protect you in my place. \u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s hand slid towards Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s ear. She gently touched the purple earring and said those words that caused Xiao Ao Shuang to be shocked.</p><br/><p>What? This earring was half of Lingyun\u2019s strength?!</p><br/><p>Then, who was Lingyun? What was his true identity?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d Leng Lingyun looked around and said in a deep voice, \u201cWan Fengliang, this person is not simple.\u201d Be careful of him. \u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Qi Ao Shuang knew that. To be able to stay outside of any influence in such a chaotic world, just from this, one could tell that this person was definitely not simple. However, it was unknown whether or not he was as uninterested in power as he appeared to be.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang spoke softly. Before she could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, I know you have many questions.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s handsome face was filled with seriousness as she spoke slowly in a deep voice. Due to the disorder of the spatial tunnel, there were some people from the Devil Realm that came in. However, I\u2019m not sure if anyone from the God Realm came in. Yi Xuan is from the Demon race, that\u2019s all I know. No one could predict what would happen during this competition. I don\u2019t want you to risk it. I\u2019ll take care of it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Was Feng Yixuan a demon?</p><br/><p>Although Qi Ao Shuang had already guessed this, but after Leng Lingyun confirmed it, she still had an indescribable feeling in her heart.</p><br/><p>If Feng Yixuan is a demon, then what about you? Lingyun, what about you? You\u2019re not human, then who are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am of the Monster race.\u201d Leng Lingyun seemed to notice Wei Ao Shuang\u2019s confusion. A faint smile appeared on her handsome face. \u201cI\u2019ve been floating in the Mortal Realm for a thousand years, and my memories were slowly recovering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA thousand years?\u201d \u201cIn that case, are you the same as the White Emperor and Black Feather, having gone to the Mortal Realm after the Holy War?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said in a low voice.</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes flashed with an indescribable glint, as if she was hiding something. She only replied with a faint \u201cEn!\u201d before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something else to do. I\u2019ll come back for you. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not around, you have to take care of yourself and be careful of this Feng Liu guy.\u201d Leng Lingyun sent Qi Ao Shuang back to the city gate. Before she left, she repeatedly told Qi Ao Shuang to be careful of Wan Feng.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stared at Leng Lingyun, but she didn\u2019t say anything else. In the end, the words that came out of his mouth only turned into one sentence, \u201cEn, you have to be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Leng Lingyun\u2019s figure disappearing from sight, an indescribable feeling arose in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan, Leng Lingyun, the Young Chieftain of the Demon World, White Emperor, Black Feather, Camil, Wanfeng \u2026 Why did it feel so messy? However, there seemed to be a connection between them.</p><br/><p>hat was going on behind all this?</p><br/><p>As Xiao Aushuang carried the Maneki-Neko and walked on the street in the darkness, occasionally a Demonic Beast would pass by, and upon seeing a human like Qi Aushuang walking on the street alone, they would be surprised and confused. After seeing the rose badge under Qi Aushuang\u2019s collar, they would all show understanding expressions and then leave. Xiao Aushuang stroked the rose emblem as he thought in his heart, Wan Fengliu truly wasn\u2019t a simple person with such deterrence.</p><br/><p> After Xiao Ao Shuang returned to the Mayor\u2019s mansion, the guards at the entrance and the beautiful female servants in the main hall all felt a little strange when they saw Qi Ao Shuang coming back. They did not see Qi Ao Shuang leave, but now Qi Ao Shuang came back.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the suspicious gazes of these people, Qi Ao Shuang walked straight to her own room. Tonight, the White Emperor and Black Feather did not return to the City Lord\u2019s Mansion. Instead, they sent word to Wan Fengliang to take care of Xiao Aoshuang, and also to Qi Aoshuang. Both of them said the same thing, and came back to fetch her as soon as they were done.</p><br/><p>In the corridor, Qi Ao Shuang saw the white figure quietly leaning against the pillar, waiting for her.</p><br/><p> Camil watched as Qi Ao Shuang approached. He smiled faintly and said softly, \u201cHave you seen them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang stopped, lowered her eyes and said softly, \u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Camille asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang shook her head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what the situation is right now.\u201d I saw the man. The Young Chieftain of the Devil world \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside, it\u2019s cold outside.\u201d Camil stepped forward and gently rubbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head as he spoke in an affectionate tone.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at Camil with a complicated expression. In the end, she nodded lightly and walked with Camil to his room.</p><br/><p>Entering the room, Camil poured a steaming cup of scented tea for Qi Ao Shuang. It was obvious that she had just made it not long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why the young lord of the Oasis World killed me was because of Yi Xuan. Lingyun suddenly appeared and saved me. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang held the teacup in her hands, but she did not take a sip. She lowered her head and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Little Ao Shuang, I won\u2019t let others kill you.\u201d Camil sat beside Qi Ao Shuang and said those words lightly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned, turning to look at Camil\u2019s gentle smile. Could it be that Camille was here as well? Did he follow me out? But Lingyun made his move, so he didn\u2019t make his move?</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang did not relish Camil\u2019s words. I won\u2019t let anyone kill you. Then, isn\u2019t it fine if you\u2019re not someone else\u2019s person? \u201cWho else could it be?\u201d \u201cThis \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan is a demon \u2026\u201d Why did he come to the Demon World? \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang seemed to be asking Camil, but she also seemed to be asking herself \u2026 Lingyun is from the Monster race, he went to the Mortal Realm after the Holy War, and now he has returned to the Demon Realm \u2026 Don\u2019t think too much about it. You don\u2019t have anything to think about right now. \u201d Camille comforts gently, \u201cSo think of nothing.\u201d You\u2019ll always know what all this is about. You\u2019ll know when you know. \u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Camil\u2019s dark blue eyes, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart was filled with complex emotions. In the end, she nodded gently.</p><br/><p>After a cup of scented tea, Qi Ao Shuang said good night to Camil and returned to her room. Lying on the bed, Qi Ao Shuang felt an indescribable sadness in her heart. Why did it always feel like people who were very familiar with the surroundings had become so unfamiliar? What was going on with all this \u2026</p><br/><p>Early the next morning, Camille knocked on the door, smiled and said to take Qi Ao Shuang for a stroll to see the prosperity of the Demon World.</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t know was that he was in trouble the moment he stepped out of the door.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

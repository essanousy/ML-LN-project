The next moment, Feng Yixuan covered his eye and crouched down, groaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time you dare to do this, I\u2019ll hit your other eye.\u201d Claire said icily, retracting her fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch, I was telling the truth.\u201d Feng Yixuan stood up and dropped his hand with a mournful expression, revealing a panda eye. This was Claire\u2019s masterpiece from just then. During the moment when everybody still hadn\u2019t come back to their senses, Claire\u2019s hand was even faster than her thoughts. Pulling her hand out of Feng Yixuan\u2019s tight grasp, she punched Feng Yixuan\u2019s eye socket.</p><br/><p>While Feng Yixuan grimaced with pain, Shui Wenmo watched gleefully at Feng Yixuan\u2019s sorry figure, taking delight at his misfortune.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing about!\u201d Feng Yixuan vented his heart\u2019s rage onto Shui Wenmo, an icicle flying over.</p><br/><p>But Shui Wenmo was already on guard for a while, pulling out his sword to block and then nimbly deflecting it. The two started fighting noisily again.</p><br/><p>Claire sat down, looked at the girl who was completely covered in blood, thought for a moment, turned around and pulled out a set of her own clean clothes and a set of Jean\u2019s clothes from her travel bag, and threw them at the two people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys planning on doing next?\u201d Claire asked insipidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLive while hiding our identities and go to and settle in Yowusali. Find a desolate village and live there for the rest of our lives.\u201d The fallen knight answered like so.</p><br/><p>Yowusali was the most backward country in the entire continent where the Temple of Light\u2019s influence was the least deep.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Temple of Light won\u2019t let you guys go.\u201d Claire said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand. I know the dark side of the Temple of Light that common people don\u2019t know, naturally, they won\u2019t let me go. But even though it\u2019s like this, I\u2019m still not going to wait for them to capture me. I will use all my power to protect her.\u201d The fallen knight looked deeply at the girl sitting beside him. The girl looked deeply at the fallen knight. The two\u2019s hearts were communicated without words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey really are a bitter fated couple.\u201d Walter shrugged and said to Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, benefactors, for saving us today. Thank you.\u201d The fallen knight struggled to get up and bow. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you, I\u2019m afraid we would have died mysteriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire stopped him. \u201cNo need to bow. First, take care of your wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t trouble my benefactors any more. We will cross the border as soon as possible to Yowusali.\u201d The fallen knight said seriously. He understood very deeply that if the holy knights who were chasing after them didn\u2019t return to report, the Temple of Light would soon make new moves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl, come, come.\u201d Cliff beckoned at the girl. \u201cCome, I\u2019ll change your hair and eye color. It should stay for ten years and save a lot of trouble. Take care of yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The girl brightened, because her hair color and eye color had always hurt the people around her and she had been betrayed many times. Now that she heard her hair and eye color could be changed for so long, of course she was exceptionally happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can. Of course the medicine I make can last for about ten years.\u201d Cliff said haughtily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you, sir.\u201d The girl happily thanked hurriedly.</p><br/><p>The fallen knight looked at Cliff. He believed everything said by the holy knights. This elder was definitely the wizard sage Cliff. That was why he could easily overpower the five holy knights. But this was already not important.</p><br/><p>Jean silently roasted the wild fare, not giving so much as a glance. Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo were still fighting fiercely. Cliff was dying the girl\u2019s hair, the fallen knight watching them gratefully.</p><br/><p>Claire sat down underneath a tree. Looking at the tree trunk, she looked up at the night sky that was getting darker and darker. Lightly touching her right hand\u2019s glove, Claire frowned slightly. There were still many annoying matters: white emperor who was still in deep sleep and the dark mark on the back of her hand.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo went farther and farther away, fighting in the middle of the forest. When they were out of Claire and them\u2019s sight, the two stopped. The two crouched down at the same time. Shui Wenmo said, \u201cWas that my hallucination?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt first, I also thought I was hallucinating, but it definitely wasn\u2019t.\u201d Feng Yixuan said certainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Claire\u2019s flame actually turned gold! What is going on?\u201d Shui Wenmo stroked his chin suspiciously. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a flame that color. Although it was only for a split second, it definitely changed color.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I know. We\u2019ll just inspect it carefully in the future.\u201d After he finished speaking, Feng Yixuan rapidly hit Shui Wenmo\u2019s head and ran.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit, you actually took advantage of the situation to hit me.\u201d Shui Wenmo lept up and started attacking fiercely.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan counterattacked and the two started fighting fiercely again as they made their way back to the encampment.</p><br/><p>At night, after everyone finished eating, Feng Yixuan gave his tent to the fallen knight and girl and squeezed into Shui Wenmo\u2019s tent. Claire was lying down calmly in her own tent, looking at the magic lamp hanging from above, thinking back to the Treasured Lotus Style\u2019s mental cultivation method.</p><br/><p>After thinking back over and over, Claire became more and more awake, unable to sleep. So she simply sat in the lotus position and started cultivating the Treasured Lotus Style\u2019s mental cultivation method.</p><br/><p>An indescribable fluidity encompassed Claire\u2019s whole body. Heat flowed through her four limbs and bones, wandering slowly. The slow flow of the heat became faster and faster. The moment Qi infused with her dantian, suddenly, something seemed to emerge in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Claire opened her eyes. She had already finished learning the first level of the Treasured Lotus Style! A light smile appeared on Claire\u2019s lips. This metal cultivation book, even if people from this world could read it, they wouldn\u2019t be able to learn it, because probably nobody from this world knew the acupuncture points written in the book.</p><br/><p>With a slight flick of her finger, a small, golden fireball appeared. It appeared instantly without any incantations.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you, you didn\u2019t seem to have chanted anything. Don\u2019t tell me you can already instacast low level magic? It can\u2019t be.\u201d Walter\u2019s amazed voice sounded. At this age and the high level of it, how could Claire instacast? \u201cAlso, why is your flame golden? Today, when you were destroying the corpses, it seemed like your flame was a bit golden. At first, I thought I was hallucinating.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice was filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know in the future.\u201d Claire said perfunctorily. It would be hard to explain. How could she tell Walter that her soul was actually from another world and the language wasn\u2019t the same and the strange book she had gotten from the little thief was a really awesome, rare mental cultivation book?</p><br/><p>Walter whispered. \u201cYou can\u2019t say right now? What is going on? Why is the flame you release golden? It seems a bit stronger than other flames. It could even melt those armor so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d Suddenly, Claire\u2019s expression changed drastically because a pain that was as if she was on fire suddenly came from her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Walter was frightened. Seeing Claire\u2019s drastic change in expression, he thought he had annoyed Claire and immediately shut up, but quickly discovered something was off. Slowly, cold sweat appeared on Claire\u2019s forehead. It seemed like she was experiencing something really painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what\u2019s wrong with you? Is it something urgent? Was it that tonight when you ate Jean, that jerk\u2019s, hare it wasn\u2019t roasted properly so your stomach hurts?\u201d Walter asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy back, there\u2019s something growing!\u201d Claire squeezed out with clenched teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Walter was super shocked. Something was growing?! Was she joking? What was going on? Was it that Claire didn\u2019t learn properly and forming things randomly?</p><br/><p>\u201cLook and tell me what\u2019s going on!\u201d Claire turned, rapidly lifting her clothes, exposing her back. The unbearably hot feeling from her back became more and more intense. Something was continuously spreading, spreading\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Walter reflexively closed his eyes. He had the reflex developed as a habit now; whenever Claire undressed, he would immediately obediently close his eyes or fade away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Claire asked angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t look.\u201d Walter replied, trembling. \u201cI don\u2019t dare to look. You said before that if I dared to look at your body, you would slaughter me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m letting you look right now!\u201d Claire rebuked angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s just looking at my back! If you don\u2019t look right now, I\u2019ll slaughter you immediately.\u201d She didn\u2019t have a large mirror right now. If she did, then would she need to let Walter see what was going on?</p><br/><p>Slowly, Walter opened his eyes, looking at the bright skin of Claire\u2019s back. When he saw it clearly, it was as if his whole body was struck by lightning, unable to think.</p><br/><p>On Claire\u2019s back, a golden lotus bud was blooming. From Claire\u2019s waist, it grew all the way to Claire\u2019s shoulder, golden bright, emitting an indescribable beauty, directly stunning the soul. The golden, huge lotus grew in Claire\u2019s pure white skin as if it was completely natural. In total, there were twelve petals, but out of the twelve, only one had blossomed and the other eleven were tightly folded.</p><br/><p>Walter watched dumbfoundedly, profoundly stunned by the devilishly beauty. He forgot the think, forgot to speak. There was actually something as beautiful as this in the world?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter!\u201d Claire shouted angrily, pulling Walter back to reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what? Claire, what?\u201d Walter made a mouth-wiping movement. If he had saliva, it would have already dripped onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Currently, Claire already didn\u2019t feel any more pain and put her clothes down, asking angrily, \u201cWhat on earth did you see? What\u2019s on my back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA, a golden lotus. There are twelve petals. One flower petal has blossomed, but the other eleven haven\u2019t. So, so pretty. I\u2019ve never seen anything so pretty before.\u201d Walter was still deeply stunned. \u201cBut, Claire, how did a lotus grow on your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire was silent, but her mind was working very fast. Golden lotus? Just when she completed the first level of the Treasured Lotus Style, it had appeared on her back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

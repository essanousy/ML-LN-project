However, he pervertedly agreed with Feng Yixuan\u2019s words. His current body was indeed not bad. Pah! What was he thinking! Xi Shaoqi immediately dispersed his thoughts and pitifully asked Qi Aoshuang for clothes to wear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enclosure is not in the city. It is in a village some distance away from here.\u201d Only now did Feng Yixuan resume his seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you didn\u2019t know where it was?\u201d Xi Shaoqi asked angrily as he put on clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lie to you?\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s devious response left Xi Shaoqi filled with anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go there now.\u201d Leng Lingyun looked up at the sky. \u201cCan we get there before the sky darkens?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should be able to.\u201d Feng Yixuan also looked up at the sky, then looked around their surroundings. \u201cJust continue in that direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once everyone arrived at the small fishing village, the sky had already darkened. The villagers were extremely cautious towards outsiders, exhibiting one message with their gazes clearly: unwelcome!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why are you here at our village?\u201d A middle aged man faced them, brandishing a harpoon. The other villagers stood behind him with cautious expressions.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and the rest had been discovered the moment they entered the village, and then had been surrounded by the fishermen.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan saw their hostile gazes. He smiled and walked forward, saying amiably, \u201cWe are merchants here for trading. If you may inform your village chief, we would be most grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of trade? All of our business is scheduled in advance. Leave, you are not welcome here,\u201d the leading man said aggressively, his eyes filled with hostility. He was completely unwavered by Feng Yixuan and the rests\u2019 beautiful appearances.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are here to buy the biggest products.\u201d Feng Yixuan continued to smile.</p><br/><p>For a moment, he wavered, but then his hesitation disappeared. \u201cThey\u2019re all scheduled to be sold, none left.\u201d He refused just as impolitely, just a little less fierce than before.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan took a step forward, then created a strange hand signal with both hands.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and the rest were then amazed to see the hostility in the middle aged man\u2019s eyes disappear. He lowered the harpoon.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you bring us to the village chief now? We are really here to discuss trade.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle aged man took two steps back. With a wave of his head, all the other villagers dispersed. Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes narrowed. These fishermen were definitely not as simple as they appeared. They surrounded them so quickly, and dispersed in orderly fashion so quickly as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d The middle aged man turned around.</p><br/><p>Under the dim light of the moon, they could see small houses made of stone bricks everywhere. Many houses had fishing nets in front of them. Dried fish hung from roofs and many houses had fishing gear laying before them. No matter how you looked at it, it looked like an ordinary fishing village. If not for the brief conversation between Feng Yixuan and the middle aged man along with the actions of the other fishermen, no one would be able to know that the secret enclosure was here.</p><br/><p>After bringing everyone to the biggest stone house, the middle aged man stopped and turned to Feng Yixuan. \u201cPlease wait here. I will go to inform the village chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Feng Yixuan smiled and stayed put.</p><br/><p>The middle aged man gently knocked on the door. A muffled voice came from within. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, it\u2019s me,\u201d the middle aged man said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d the voice said quietly.</p><br/><p>The middle aged man entered, the closed the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Feng, what was that hand signal just now?\u201d Xi Shaoqi stood close to Feng Yixuan and asked quietly.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan rolled his eyes, not responding.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi suddenly understood and covered his mouth. Since there were merfolk raised here, then the people inside were definitely unordinary. If they heard what he said, then it would be bad.</p><br/><p>Luckily, it did not seem they heard him. After a while, the door opened. The middle aged peeked out and looked at Feng Yixuan. \u201cPlease enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone followed Feng Yixuan into the door.</p><br/><p>The house was arranged simply. One square table, a few wooden stools. At the head of the table sat who appeared to be an ordinary old man. He wore simple clothing that was even patched in places. His hair was white, and he squinted to see. The old man coughed before speaking. \u201cI am the village chief. Please sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone sat down. The village chief remained seated, squinting at everyone, his expression unchanging.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask where you all are from?\u201d the village chief\u2019s voice was weak. He looked completely like a sickly, old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cLagark,\u201d Feng Yixuan replied quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so.\u201d The village chief still appeared extremely feeble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe want to look at the goods, is that ok?\u201d Feng Yixuan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. It is too late today.\u201d The village chief squinted at Feng Yixuan. Before Feng Yixuan could respond, he turned to the middle aged man and said, \u201cIan, bring the guests to their resting quarters.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, the village chief closed his eyes and stopped speaking.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan wanted to say something, but Ian walked up to them. \u201cPlease follow me.\u201d He had a hard to refuse tone of voice.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and the rest stood up and followed Ian out the door.</p><br/><p>Ian led them to the west side of the village until they arrived at a row of stone houses. He called out, \u201cLola, we have guests! Take care of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ian then turned around and left, not giving Qi Aoshuang and the ret so much as a glance.</p><br/><p>Soon, a stone house\u2019s door opened. A chubby woman with a dress walked out, laughing. \u201cGuests who have traveled a long distance, please come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, they all entered.</p><br/><p>Their lodging was simple and crude, yet clean. The four beauties shared a room, whereas Qi Aoshuang had a room of her own.</p><br/><p>At the dead of night, only the sea breeze brushed past.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang lay in bed, looking out the window at the swaying dried fish. She frowned. Wasn\u2019t everything going too smoothly?</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang\u2026\u201d said a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan?\u201d Surprised, Qi Aoshuang sat up and looked out the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Feng Yixuan said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Without another thought, Qi Aoshuang hastily put on clothes and quietly leapt out the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one problem. That old thing is definitely not ordinary.\u201d Feng Yixuan said quietly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang paused. So Feng Yixuan also realized this problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hand signal I made is a secret signal between them and customers. However, the village chief\u2019s reaction was very strange. He didn\u2019t ask any questions at all. Perhaps, he was already suspicious,\u201d Feng Yixuan continued quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we go check right now?\u201d Qi Aoshuang frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the enclosure is. I heard that they only bring out the mermaids after customers have scheduled in advance and won\u2019t bring customers to where the enclosure is. We should first scout out the area before deciding what to do. I let Leng Lingyun and the Xi brother stay in their room temporarily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang nodded. Those three were not trained in assassination skills. If their opponents were experts, then they would be discovered easily. Only she and Feng Yixuan could go scouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Feng Yixuan concealed his aura, then advanced silently. Qi Aoshuang followed him closely from behind.</p><br/><p>The two arrived at the village chief\u2019s house, both with concealed presences. They heard his feeble voice. \u201cIan, when are you going to mature?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, boss. I was too careless,\u201d said Ian\u2019s low voice. Ian now addressed the village chief as boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink before you act in the future. Don\u2019t be completely convinced by just our hand signal.\u201d The village chief sighed. \u201cWhen have you seen such beautiful people personally come to buy the goods?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss is correct. For such beautiful people to buy mermaids is strange, and there are so many of them too,\u201d Ian responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we cannot fully reject them. There are many questions in the world that cannot be answered. I am only suspicious. I cannot tell if they are genuine or fake.\u201d The village chief\u2019s voice was still casual.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich is why Boss left them first to see?\u201d Ian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. We are businessmen. There is no need for us to become enemies with money.\u201d The village chief\u2019s voice was calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Boss is correct.\u201d Ian nodded again deferentially.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. Send men to watch them carefully. Also be careful that no one follows you.\u201d The village chief motioned for Ian to leave. \u201cGo. I am tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ian nodded, then left.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Qi Aoshuang shared a glance, then both nodded.</p><br/><p>Following Ian would definitely lead them to the secret mermaid enclosure.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

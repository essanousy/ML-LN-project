Heath was very smart, telling the whole truth and then he told everyone Claire had already invited the nemeses of the Dark magician \u2013 magicians from the Temple of Light \u2013 and even the Temple of Light\u2019s Divine Prince had personally come. As long as they just received a Light baptism, they wouldn\u2019t receive any more of the Dark aura\u2019s negative effects.</p><br/><p>The popularity of the Temple of Light was extraordinarily useful; people assembled together in the public square very quickly. They all looked expectantly at the silver haired Divine Prince standing on stage. Violet eyes and silver hair had already become a symbol, a symbol of peace and the Temple of Light.</p><br/><p>The people below talked back on forth, becoming more and more restless.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that suddenly a voice came from the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t be fearful. I believe everybody also understands that this so-called epidemic is just a Dark magician stirring up trouble from behind the scenes. We will quickly find out the perpetrator and also purify the air. His highness, the Divine Prince, will immediately baptize everything. Every difficulty will pass. Soon, everyone can reunite with their dear ones outside the city. Before then, I hope everybody obeys the soldier\u2019s plans. I swear on the Hill family\u2019s name this matter will definitely be resolved. Also, my Master sir Cliff and the Magician Council will also assist. Everybody, please be at ease, we will pass this crisis together.\u201d Claire stood on the stage, her expression grave as she declared. Cliff used a small magic that transferred Claire\u2019s voice everywhere so that everybody could hear.</p><br/><p>Gradually, everybody calmed down, their expressions also becoming serene.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, with the Divine Prince from the Temple of Light and the wizard sage, sir Cliff, what could they be afraid of?</p><br/><p>Just like what the Castellan said, they would definitely be able to ride out this crisis.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the people below, who had calmed down. She sighed softly and then turned towards Lingyun Leng. \u201cDivine Prince, now what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust leave it to me.\u201d Lingyun Leng said insipidly. He took a few steps forward, closed his eyes and gradually raised his head. His raised both of his hands slowly and started chanting a long and tedious spell.</p><br/><p>The white light slowly expanded, Lingyun Leng\u2019s chanting not yet stopped.</p><br/><p>The white light slanted down from the sky, becoming a huge shield, enshrouding the entire public plaza.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap! This fierce guy! He actually wants to baptise them all! Although his magic power is very strong, this action is truly harsh on himself, harsh on himself!\u201d Walter cried in surprise.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t say anything and only frowned. Who knew what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>The white light slowly shined on everybody. Everyone felt not only their body feel warm, but also their hearts. It was an indescribable feeling of comfort.</p><br/><p>The white light was still continuously shining down diagonally and Lingyun Leng\u2019s chant still hadn\u2019t stopped. But his complexion was already gradually paling.</p><br/><p>Walter was so happy he wanted to just start jumping up and down. Pretty boy, continue, continue, the earlier you die and reincarnate, ahaha, don\u2019t stop, continue. But Walter only dared to say these in his heart. He didn\u2019t dare to let Claire hear again. Right now his whole body was sore incessantly, Claire\u2019s life-threatening pinch was truly life-threatening!</p><br/><p>Cliff raised his brow slightly and his mouth twitched. No wonder that old thing bragged to him whenever they me. His disciple truly wasn\u2019t simple. This public square could be said to have over ten thousand people, and he was actually baptizing them like this. Hmph, no big deal, there would be a day when his own darling disciple could also do this. No! His darling disciple will definitely surpass him.</p><br/><p>Claire watched Lingyun Leng\u2019s face that was becoming paler and paler and knit her brows slightly.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this too much for him?</p><br/><p>But as she thought about it, she became relieved. This man with an ice-cold personality, doing this for the only soft spot in his heart wasn\u2019t strange. Every person had a weak spot, someone or something they cared for the most.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Lingyun Leng finally stopped his chant. The white light slowly dispersed. Cold sweat had already perspired from Lingyun Leng\u2019s forehead. Once he stopped chanting, Lingyun Leng started wobbling. Standing beside him, Claire hurriedly reached out to support him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Lingyun Leng turned towards Claire and revealed a faint smile and calmly moved away his arm. Claire felt that clearly, when she had supported Lingyun Leng, his body had become rigid. It was very obvious that he also wasn\u2019t used to touching other people.</p><br/><p>Claire turned to Jean and said, \u201cJean, from now on, protect and follow the Divine Prince closely, until his magic power is recovered.\u201d Next, she looked coldly at Lingyun Leng and said, \u201cDon\u2019t refuse, I hope the Temple of Light\u2019s Divine Prince doesn\u2019t have a mishap in my fief. I can\u2019t afford to carry the blame.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words Lingyun Leng was about to say to refuse were blocked by Claire\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay everybody stop worrying, you can return to our former lives today. The Castellan and Cliff will definitely capture that necromancer quickly and also give everyone peace.\u201d Heath quickly declared to everyone in the public square.</p><br/><p>The popular sentiment had been stabilized, their former lives also restored.</p><br/><p>What they needed to do now was capture that necromancer.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, remember, this necromancer is definitely not simple. If you discover his tracks, you definitely can\u2019t be careless and act on your own. You must immediately contact me, do you understand?\u201d Cliff was exceptionally serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Master, I understand, I will act within the limits.\u201d Claire promised.</p><br/><p>Cliff\u2019s worry wasn\u2019t without reason. Right now Claire\u2019s guardian knight went to protect the Divine Prince. If Claire encountered danger, she wouldn\u2019t have a shield anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry, I also have the treasure you sent me.\u201d Claire smiled, shaking the bracelet on her wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, in any case, you can\u2019t act on your own. Let\u2019s all go back to eat and rest now. It\u2019s been busy for so long, everybody must be all be tired.\u201d Cliff yawned.</p><br/><p>At last, Niya City had resumed its former peace, but the city gates were still sealed off. Before they found and killed that necromancer, the ban could still not be removed.</p><br/><p>Night, a peaceful Niya City.</p><br/><p>Claire lied on the bed with clothes on, pondering while looking at the curtains. White Emperor laid on Claire\u2019s chest and slept peacefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Suddenly Walter coldly shouted. \u201cDark aura! Very dense! I felt it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Claire frowned and immediately asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderneath your bed!\u201d Walter was exceptionally certain. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderneath my bed?\u201d Claire froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that, it\u2019s deep from below the location of your bed! There\u2019s a secret chamber below!\u201d Walter\u2019s tone began to become hurried. \u201cHe\u2019s moving rapidly! Quick, he\u2019s currently moving towards the west. Outside the window! Look, look quickly, that black smoke!\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire immediately sat up and rushed towards the window. At night, a normal person wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything, but Claire had already trained to be able to see clearly at night. Sure enough, a faint black smoke was moving rapidly. White Emperor swiftly crawled onto Claire\u2019s head, tightly grabbing onto Claire\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>To an assassin, the night was their paradise. The night was their greatest protection. Claire squinted slightly, watching the black smoke speedily leave in the darkness, a cold light arose in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Claire pulled out a small bird puppet and released it in the air, letting the small bird puppet to find Cliff. Claire flipped out the window, chasing after the rapidly leaving black smoke, and disappeared into the night.</p><br/><p>Walter was also a bit confused. Although this Dark aura was very dense, he didn\u2019t seem to have enough to disperse Dark aura throughout the entire city, because he wasn\u2019t strong enough!</p><br/><p>Perhaps there wasn\u2019t just one necromancer?!</p><br/><p>Walter frowned and an ominous feeling arose.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

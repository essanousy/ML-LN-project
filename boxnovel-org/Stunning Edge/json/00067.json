Evidently, they hadn\u2019t thought that even without the commander of the Tempest Warrior Regiment, they would still fail. After standing there for a moment, they were about to leave immediately.</p><br/><p>Reminder: (I had forgotten too oops)</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the person covered in black and coldly humphed. \u201cYou want to leave?!\u201d The next moment, numerous golden flameballs flew over. But the next moment, the black clothed person had already disappeared. The corridor had been riddled with holes from the flameball attack, the burnt odor filled the air. Such a large action naturally drew many imperial guards over. Princess Maurice and Katherine had also rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to rush, they\u2019ve already run away. It was the assassin from last time.\u201d The second prince was already standing. Looking at the nearby Claire, he said, \u201cClaire, you saved me. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire turned and looked at Nancy. \u201cIt was the assassin from last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This assassin\u2019s skills are very high.\u201d Nancy frowned. \u201cLast time, luckily, I had the commander of the Tempest Warrior Regiment by my side. Otherwise, I would have lost my life already. The commander injured the assassin heavily, but also suffered heavy losses. The assassin actually recovered already. If you weren\u2019t here today, I\u2019m afraid he would have succeeded already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent because\u2026 she was familiar with the assassin\u2019s figure! She definitely didn\u2019t see wrong! It was him, definitely him.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, how did you sense the assassin?\u201d Nancy saw that Claire was in a indescribable mood.</p><br/><p>Claire turned and looked towards the worried Katherine and princess Maurice, ignoring Nancy. Instead, she grasped Katherine\u2019s hand. \u201cMother, it\u2019s alright now. No need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did an assassin secretly get in?\u201d Katherine\u2019s face was a bit pale. She gripped Claire\u2019s hand tightly. \u201cAre you alright? Claire, did you get hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t worry, the assassin\u2019s target was his highness, not me.\u201d Claire consoled Katherine. These words were actually pretty disrespectful, but nobody dared to reprimand Claire\u2019s rude words.</p><br/><p>Once again, they went through the formalities, until in the end, Nancy accompanied Claire out the palace.</p><br/><p>Standing at the entrance of the palace, Nancy watched Claire deeply, about to say something. But Claire turned and looked at Nancy and said coldly, \u201cYour highness, I don\u2019t care about royal power struggles, I only hope you don\u2019t involve my mother. If my mother gets in danger, I won\u2019t let it go. Please remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nancy froze. His expression changed a little, but he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>Jean stood at the side, head lowered, also silent.</p><br/><p>Just as Claire was about to go on the carriage, Nancy quietly called, \u201cClaire\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire turned and looked coldly at Nancy, her expression without warmth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for saving me today. Also, I promise, even if I get into deep trouble, I won\u2019t let your mother be involved.\u201d Nancy said, exceptionally serious.</p><br/><p>Once she heard this, Claire stopped for a moment, her expression easing a bit. She said quietly, \u201cI hope your highness remembers the words your highness has said today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will remember forever.\u201d Nancy stared at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded lightly, then turned around to the carriage.</p><br/><p>Jean followed from behind. On the carriage, he abruptly turned to glance at Nancy. Nancy\u2019s gaze was still on Claire.</p><br/><p>The carriage slowly started moving. Claire leaned on the side of the back of the carriage, silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u2026\u201d Jean started saying, wanting to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo my teacher, Camille\u2019s house.\u201d Claire closed her eyes and said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt such a late time, you want to find your teacher?\u201d Jean asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I have some business with him.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t say any more and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>There was a flash of confusion in Jean\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he instructed the coachman to go to Camille\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s house was at a quiet street. It was a white house surrounded by a white fence that was filled with green vines. Under the dim streetlight, it felt warm.</p><br/><p>The carriage stopped. Claire came out, entered the courtyard, and rang the doorbell.</p><br/><p>Soon, Camille appeared in casual clothes. Camille was still as gentle and refined as before. Such a gentle and considerate handsome man, no wonder many young ladies at the capital were interested.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Camille seemed to be surprised to see Claire. \u201cWhat are you doing here so late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just missed teacher, so I came to see you.\u201d Claire showed a harmless smile.</p><br/><p>Walter reflexively shivered. He knew another person had landed in hot water.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Then come in.\u201d Camille moved out the way and let Claire in.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, wait for me at the carriage. I have some things to talk about with teacher.\u201d Claire turned and said to Jean.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d Jean turned and went to the carriage.</p><br/><p>An unnoticeable sliver of profoundness flashed through Camille\u2019s eyes, then vanished immediately.</p><br/><p>As Claire and Walter entered, Claire sized up Camille\u2019s house. It was simply, but extremely tasteful. Everywhere, it exuded comfort and harmony. Soft furniture, beige crystal chandeliers, showing how Camille was completely gentle and indoor man.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I never expected the plague at Niya city to be settled so quickly by you. Sit, I\u2019ll make you tea.\u201d Camille went to the coffee table and poured a cup of tea.</p><br/><p>Claire withdrew her gaze. After setting on the sofa for a few moment, and seeing Camille\u2019s figure, her smile became a flower. She said quietly and gently, \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t have thought such a cultured and refined scholar would actually be an unordinarily skilled assassin, actually completely able to hide their aura.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s expression seemed to change a little, but he turned while smiling poured tea for Claire as before. \u201cClaire, what are you talking about? I don\u2019t understand. You should like this tea, it\u2019s scented tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, do you know why I was able to discover you? Your aura was surely completely hidden, but you were discovered by a magician like me.\u201d Claire accepted the tea, gracefully sipped, and smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>Camille didn\u2019t speak, smiling as he sat down. He looked at Claire kindly. \u201cHow is the tea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery fragrant, I can tell that Teacher is a person who actually values life very much.\u201d Claire set down the elaborate tea cup and leaned on the sofa. \u201cI can also tell that teacher loves himself the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do those words mean?\u201d Camille raised a brow, looking interested.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2019s gaze carries nothing within it.\u201d Claire tilted her head and also raised a brow. \u201cDoes Teacher really not want to know how I discovered you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille cast his gaze low, laughed quietly, then looked up, his face completely cold. \u201cSpeak, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never would have thought Teacher actually endorsed the crown prince\u2019s faction. I also don\u2019t really want to do anything about it, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve grasped Teacher\u2019s weakness by the tail. Perhaps when I need to, I might pull on this little tail a bit.\u201d Claire was unmoved. Instead, she smiled brilliantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat tail!\u201d Unexpectedly, the always elegant and refined Camille suddenly started talking with a foul mouth, glowering at Claire. \u201cWhat bullshit endorsement, I\u2019ve done this business for many years. The failure last time already made me very depressed, this time I was actually wrecked by you, little girl, my reputation\u2019s gone! My legendary reputation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire felt a bit awkward. It turns out Camille was actually a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, and was actually a two-faced guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you, you cussed.\u201d Claire was a bit shocked, completely not daring to believe this elegant, refined, considerate, always smiling gently person would cuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I, your father, cussed? I, your father, wants to choke you to death right now! What did you retardedly go to the palace? Why did you retardedly save the second prince? I, your father, haven\u2019t thought of how you sense my, your father\u2019s presence.\u201d Fiery anger in his eyes, Camille itched it would burn Claire until nothing was left.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s mouth twitched, looking at the person before her, who had completely blown their cover. Camille gracefully raised a tea cup and sipped, sitting on the sofa with good posture. His dignified manners would win people\u2019s heart. But no matter how elegant this person\u2019s actions were, the words he spit out would burn and scar people. But he still drank his tea gracefully. He set the teacup down.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk, you annoying child. How did you sense my, your father\u2019s presence? You even said that my, your father\u2019s, aura was completely hidden. Last time, it was all the commander of the Tempest Warrior Regiment was a lucky bastard, just happened to just have obtained some kind of magic thing that discovered I, your father. You older brother is still wet behind the ears. How did you discover me?\u201d Camille said and then gracefully stood up to pick up the teapot and added more tea into Claire\u2019s tea cup. Then, he set down the teapot and gracefully sat.</p><br/><p>Walter twitched, doubting. Did the guy in front of him have a split personality? Actually able to do one thing, then say the other. Who knew if those upper class ladies and girls who had become infatuated with Camille would be brokenhearted if they saw the true colors of the person they envisioned as a refined, kind scholar.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I answer, can you answer a question of mine?\u201d Although Claire felt doubt, she still wanted to confirm it herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you got any shit to say, say it!\u201d When Camille said such words with a gentle tone, Claire shivered a bit. It felt too strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is your employer?\u201d Claire frowned. \u201cIs it the crown prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille squinted, his eyes becoming slits. His response stunned Claire.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

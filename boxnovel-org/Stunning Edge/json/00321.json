Xiao Ao Shuang stood at the edge of the castle garden, quietly looking down at the endless blue sea. The sea breeze gently blew her long black hair, dancing with the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang \u2026\u201d At some point, Feng Yixuan had stood behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not turn around, only gave a soft reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun\u2019s memory has yet to recover. Don\u2019t mind her too much, just wait for her to remember everything.\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s voice rang out from behind Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang smiled and shifted her attention to Feng Yi Xuan, gently opening her red lips: \u201cYi Xuan, are you speaking up for Lingyun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I just don\u2019t want to see you upset about it.\u201d With a faint smile, Feng Yixuan shook his head gently. Then, he walked forward and leaned against the wall, which was half the height of a human, and looked at the quiet sea below.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was slightly startled, then she smiled and was about to say something when she heard footsteps behind her.</p><br/><p>The two of them turned around and saw Wings King standing behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWings King.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan greeted him softly.</p><br/><p>However, the Wings King didn\u2019t say anything and looked at the two with a gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned slightly. He had never liked this woman. This woman always showed her gentleness in front of Leng Lingyun. As the ruler of a kingdom, how could he be so weak?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d Not the tone of a question, but certainty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Looking at the dark expression on the Wings King\u2019s face, Qi Ao Shuang slightly raised her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you are the woman in white who cares about you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not much.\u201d After saying that, the Wings King straightened his ample chest and looked at Qi Ao Shuang with disdain.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s blue color turned unsightly. For now, he could only bear with it. What exactly did this woman want to do?</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang smiled faintly. Was this woman here to demonstrate her might? Show off her body and height? I\u2019m afraid not.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the Wings King\u2019s expression changed, and he looked coldly at Xiao Aoshuang, saying solemnly: \u201cQi Aoshuang, I warn you, the white clothes are mine.\u201d \u201cIf you want me to help you unseal the Asura Seal and exterminate the Heavenly King, then stay far away from my white clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWings King, you overestimate yourself!\u201d White clothes weren\u2019t an accessory to anyone, they didn\u2019t belong to anyone, he was just himself. \u201cIf he chooses you, we have nothing to say, but if you use this as a threat, you will lose your status as the Wings King!\u201d Before Qi Ao Shuang could react, Feng Yi Xuan was already furious and started to scold him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cAs long as you keep your distance from Bai Yi and immediately disappear from our sight after you achieve your goal, I am confident that I will be able to make Bai Yiyi into me.\u201d The Wings King raised his head proudly as he looked at Xiao Ao Shuang and said with a cold humph.</p><br/><p>\u201cWing King!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re shameless!\u201d Feng Yixuan was enraged, and his face darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take note of your wording. Ah\u2026 \u201cEh \u2026\u201d Wings King only said half of what he wanted to say, but he couldn\u2019t say the rest.</p><br/><p>Her neck was already being gripped by Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s right hand, and Qi Ao Shuang slowly raised her hand, lifting the Wings King off the ground. The Wings King held onto Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s right hand, trying his best to struggle, but he couldn\u2019t do it no matter how hard he tried. Her legs started kicking wildly, and her breathing became more and more difficult. Her originally pretty face was becoming redder and redder. Finally, panic began to appear in her eyes. She realised that she was unable to resist the force of Qi Ao Shuang. The strength of this seemingly weak girl was actually so unfathomable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are? You dare to threaten me\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s cold and ethereal voice sounded softly, her tone containing a hint of disdain.</p><br/><p>The Wings King looked at Xiao Aushuang in horror, why did she feel as though she was being watched by the god of death? The young girl in front of him was so cold and terrifying, as though she wasn\u2019t even warm at all. She looked completely different from before. What was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, Ao Shuang!\u201d Of course, Feng Yixuan knew what was going on. It was another Qi Ao Shuang who had come out. The bloodthirsty and cold Qi Ao Shuang appeared once again!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to touch my things?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled coldly, that smile almost scared the Winged King out of his wits. For the first time in his life, the Wings King felt an unprecedented sense of oppression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, don\u2019t kill her.\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned slightly, somewhat nervously stopping Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s actions. If he killed the Wings King here, the future would be very troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like her?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slowly turned around and looked at Feng Yi Xuan. Her eyes started to turn cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible, but she can\u2019t die now, otherwise it will be very troublesome.\u201d \u201cKill her, and we\u2019ll find a new Wing King.\u201d Feng Yixuan shook his head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang slightly closed her eyes and gently waved her hand. The Wings King crashed into the ground. The bones in its body were almost shattered, and a hole was created on the ground. A loud sound reverberated through the entire castle, and the Wings King fainted on the ground in a sorry state. Xiao Ao Shuang turned to look at the castle expressionlessly. The sound of hurried footsteps came closer and closer. It was the people in the castle who had heard the sound and came looking for him.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan looked at the wounded Wings King on the ground, feeling somewhat irritated. This Wings King had indeed brought this upon himself, but with the current situation, how could he explain it?</p><br/><p>Very quickly, people arrived. Yue Wang, Mishus, and Bai Yi, Jin Yan, and Lily were not far behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Did the Heavenly King\u2019s men come again? \u201d When the Moon King saw the injured Wings King lying unconscious on the ground, he hurriedly went forward to support him.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s face sank and he remained silent.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes were cold as she shifted her gaze to the man in white.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Matthews frowned slightly. He could sense that something was amiss. In addition, there was a strange expression on Feng Yixuan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly walked towards Leng Lingyun. For some reason, Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart started to panic. Just like that, she met the gaze of Qi Ao Shuang. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes seemed to be misty, but at the same time, burning hot \u2026 Slowly, slowly, Qi Ao Shuang reached out her hand and gently pinched the chin of her white dress.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will bring you back \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s faint voice seemed to resound in the hearts of everyone present, stirring up their heartstrings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang \u2026\u201d The expression in Bai Yi\u2019s eyes was extremely complicated. Doubt could be seen in his eyes, as well as deep sorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait till I regain my strength \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes became more and more lax, and then her body shook and she fell down.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Bai Yi immediately reached out to hug Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>There was a deathly silence as everyone stared blankly at Qi Ao Shuang in her arms. He knew that Xiao Aushuang was different from before.</p><br/><p>Lily looked at Qi Ao Shuang in astonishment before looking at the heavily injured Wings King. She gently tugged on Jin Yan\u2019s sleeve in a daze. \u201cElder brother Jin Yan, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan lowered his gaze and sighed softly. \u201cDon\u2019t ask anymore.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Li looked curiously at Jin Yan\u2019s face before she looked at Qi Ao Shuang. Finally, she obediently nodded and no longer asked any further.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the guards of the castle ran over. Seeing the Winged King injured made him panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here, you can all go now.\u201d Bai Yixue said to the guards in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>The guards looked at the Wings King in the Moon King\u2019s embrace with doubt, then looked at the white-robed Qi Ao Shuang in his embrace. They looked at each other with doubt in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Don\u2019t let me say it a second time. \u201d The voice of the man in white gradually became cold.</p><br/><p>When the guards saw the attitude of the white-clothed person, they quickly saluted and left.</p><br/><p>The man in white looked at Qi Ao Shuang in his arms. Pain flashed through his eyes for a moment before he raised his head and walked towards Feng Yi Xuan. \u201cCarry her in to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan frowned, wanting to see what Bai Yixue would bring him. However, his white robes were missing and his eyes were unperturbed.</p><br/><p>After Feng Yi Xuan carefully carried Qi Ao Shuang, Bai Yi turned around and took the Wings King from the Moon King\u2019s hands. He then turned around and headed back to the castle.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan frowned slightly as he followed behind with Qi Ao Shuang in his arms. Moon King and Mishus followed.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan stood where he was for a long time without moving. He looked at the hole in the ground and didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. Lily stood quietly beside him, silently accompanying him.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Jin Yan raised his head slightly, looking at Lili who was by his side. With some surprise, he asked, \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll follow by elder brother Jin Yan\u2019s side.\u201d Lily said as a matter of course.</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on Jin Yan\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t say anything else. Instead, he softly said, \u201cThen, let\u2019s go back and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Jin Yan, you have something on your mind.\u201d However, Lily didn\u2019t move. Instead, she clasped her hands behind her back and spoke seriously to Jin Yan.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan didn\u2019t deny it, but nodded instead. \u201cYes, I\u2019m worried about the young lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you worried about Sister Ao Shuang?\u201d Why? \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d The doubt in Lily\u2019s heart grew.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did Miss feel?\u201d Jin Yan asked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cTerrifying, very cold, and very powerful. It doesn\u2019t seem to be the same person as before.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re all alone.\u201d Lily answered seriously and also voiced her doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they are one and the same. Young Miss\u2019s willpower, there were actually two of them. One of them is what you just said, powerful and cold, deep in hiding. \u201cSometimes.\u201d Jin Yan\u2019s expression grew uglier. \u201cA person can\u2019t have two conscients at the same time.\u201d Just like a person\u2019s body can\u2019t hold two souls. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWhat then?\u201d Lily\u2019s face changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevour.\u201d Jin Yan said these two words with some difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean that this powerful Big Sister Aushuang will devour the previous one?\u201d Lily opened her mouth wide in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a body has two wills, the result will be the same. However, there were exceptions. That was the fusion, the fusion of the two wills. \u201cBut, this is too difficult \u2026\u201d After Jin Yan said this, his face turned pale.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

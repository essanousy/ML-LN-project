She dispersed her flame sword, then turned pick up the Azure Ripple blade that she had casually thrown away just a moment ago. Surveying the area, she raised a brow. \u201cWow, so poor you only use candles as lights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen instantly turned furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, when are you going to change your impulsive attitude?\u201d Claire turned and grinned at Li Yuewen, then added, \u201cIt\u2019s just money, you can make it whenever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEasier said than done. Nobody in the Li clan is talented at commerce. Even if there were, it would be futile. The Feng clan has practically monopolies of everything! Eighty percent of all industries are under the Feng clan,\u201d Li Yuewen said, somewhat vexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Claire stroked her chin, blinking as she said, \u201cSo what? Just because you don\u2019t have the talent for commerce doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t.\u201d Claire said meaningfully.</p><br/><p>An inexplicable gleam flashed through Jean\u2019s eyes. Was Miss planning on finding Feng Yixuan for help? But he quickly dismissed the thought. With Miss\u2019s personality, she definitely would not do that. Then, what exactly was Miss thinking?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep first. I\u2019m tired to death. Cousin Yuewen, Cousin Mingyu, good night. I\u2019ll deal with everything else once I\u2019m rested.\u201d Claire stored the Azure Ripple blade back into her interspatial ring, then turned away and headed towards her bedroom. Jean silently followed her from behind.</p><br/><p>Inside the main hall, only the Li siblings were left. They glanced at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, do you think that brat can really change our current situation?\u201d Li Yuewen said softly. She bit her lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only know that a storm is coming,\u201d Li Mingyu said with a solemn expression.</p><br/><p>The east was gradually brightening. Claire was in deep sleep.</p><br/><p>Black Feather and White Feather were on Claire\u2019s pillow, one on the left, one on the right.</p><br/><p>Swoosh\u2026</p><br/><p>Hair white as snow, eyes like the moon.</p><br/><p>White Emperor\u2019s true form appeared, his expression cold. His handsome face was entirely cold as he stared icily at Black Feather.</p><br/><p>Black Feather flapped his wings.</p><br/><p>Swoosh\u2026</p><br/><p>Hair black as ebony, eyes like the night.</p><br/><p>A man clad in black emerged. His handsome face carried a trace of arrogance, as beautiful as a masterful painting. He glared coldly towards White Emperor.</p><br/><p>White Emperor waved his finger. Claire\u2019s fluttering eyelashes stilled. Once again, she was in deep slumber.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we last saw each other.\u201d Black Feather smiled icily, his cocky attitude distinct in his provoking tone.</p><br/><p>White Emperor was silent, still staring at Black Feather coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. Lucky for you, we have the same contractor at the moment, although the little girl is a bit weak currently,\u201d Black Feather laughed coldly as he watched the sleeping Claire. \u201cI never expected you would have chosen such a weak little girl as your contractor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you also choose her?\u201d White Emperor said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you want something, I want it too!\u201d Black Feather smiled madly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you ended up being restricted by the girl,\u201d White Emperor said coldly, his mocking tone clear.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Black Feather\u2019s expression changed. Anger and a wild look passed through his eyes. \u201cNot for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, not for long. But whether or not you become the master, or the little girl you speak of becomes our master remains undecided.\u201d White Emperor coldly watched Black Feather\u2019s expression change.</p><br/><p>Black Feather frowned. \u201cI really am curious whether or not she can truly become my master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen wait and see.\u201d White Emperor nodded likely. Watching the deep asleep Claire, an ineffable gleam flashed through his eyes. He reached out and stroked Claire\u2019s face gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, do you feel something for this little girl?\u201d Black Feather watched White Emperor with ridicule in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really think she\u2019s a little girl?\u201d White Emperor didn\u2019t look up, still looking deeply into Claire\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Black Feather\u2019s expression changed once more. He also lowered his head to look at Claire, saying in a low voice, \u201cThis body\u2019s soul is beautiful. And her original form is actually doubly black, black hair and black eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>White Emperor was silent, acknowledging Black Feather\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this why the god of Darkness shamelessly took a liking to her? And marked her?\u201d Black Feather grabbed Claire\u2019s right hand roughly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If it were only this, the god of Darkness wouldn\u2019t have chosen her,\u201d White Emperor shook his head.</p><br/><p>Black Feather pulled off the glove on Claire\u2019s right hand, asking as he stared at the black mark, \u201cThen why?\u201d In any case, the current owner of the body was his contractor. Of course he had to understand clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is the perfect union of darkness and light, evil and righteousness,\u201d White Emperor said solemnly looking at Claire\u2019s peaceful face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! In other words, she will become an offering for that\u2026\u201d Black Feather\u2019s expression finally changed drastically.</p><br/><p>White Emperor was silent, but his serious expression revealed that Black Feather\u2019s conjectures were right.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Just been reborn and found a contractor but it\u2019s already such a nuisance,\u201d Black Feather cursed in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce my power returns, I will stop it.\u201d White Emperor grabbed the glove from Black Feather and carefully slipped it onto Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever, whatever.\u201d Black Feather clicked his tongue in annoyance. \u201cI can\u2019t stay in this form for long and my power hasn\u2019t recovered completely either.\u201d Black Feather floated back next to Claire\u2019s pillow. With a swish, he turned back into the black ball. He laid down on the pillow and started sleeping again.</p><br/><p>White Emperor watched Claire calmly, quiet for a while. Finally, with a swish, he turned back into a white ball, curled up next to Claire\u2019s pillow, and also started sleeping.</p><br/><p>Murkiness and darkness surrounded her. Underfoot was a uneven stone path. Claire raised her head, but it was a field of darkness. She couldn\u2019t see anything, not a soul in sight. The Li siblings weren\u2019t there, Jean wasn\u2019t there, Walter wasn\u2019t there, Summer and Qiao Chuxin weren\u2019t there, Camille was also not there\u2026 All there was was deathly silence.</p><br/><p>Where was she?</p><br/><p>Claire took a few steps forward on the stone path and stepped on a sharp shard, injuring her foot. Blood slowly flowed out of the wound.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the darkness around her slowly condensed into a mass of black gas with a pair of blood red eyes within, staring piercingly at Claire.</p><br/><p>God of Darkness?!</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you have already been marked by me. You are my precious offering,\u201d the ice cold, terrifying voice said with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI! Will not be your offering without a fight!\u201d Claire clenched her fist and bellowed at the frightening mass of black gas.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you can escape me? You\u2019re mine, remember. Once the time is ripe, I will definitely be back,\u201d the god of Darkness laughed, cold and menacing.</p><br/><p>Claire felt a burning sensation from the back of her right hand. She looked down and saw that the mark had already turned completely black.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t escape and you can\u2019t beat me.\u201d The god of Darkness sneered. Then, a cold, black net enveloped Claire, binding Claire tightly, then gradually tighten, tighten\u2026 The suffocating feeling made Claire sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Claire shouted. She opened her eyes abruptly, but only saw gorgeous bed curtains hanging overhead.</p><br/><p>A dream?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d Jeans knocked on the door frantically, his voice full of worry. \u201cMiss, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire tried to sit up, but found that the two little things were lying on her chest, round little Black Feather and furry White Emperor. They were both in deep sleep. Claire bit her lip. No wonder she had a nightmare. It was all because these two little fellas were sleeping on her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jean. It was only a nightmare,\u201d Claire said quickly to console Jean. She knew that if she didn\u2019t say anything any longer, Jean would break open the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. As long as you are fine, Miss.\u201d Jean\u2019s voice was obviously relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should go rest.\u201d Claire let out a small sigh. She reached out and scooped the two little fellows off and set them beside her pillow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jean replied, about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment. What time is it right now? How long have I been asleep?\u201d Claire asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning now. Miss, you\u2019ve slept for a day and a night,\u201d Jean replied from outside her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Claire got up. Her stomach rumbled awkwardly. Claire frowned slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be up soon. Call someone to prepare me food. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d The sound of Jean\u2019s footsteps gradually disappeared.</p><br/><p>After Claire got up and was dressed, she was still thinking back to her dream. The suffocating feeling was so intense, so realistic. She would definitely not let it come true! Claire clenched her fists. After she finished dressing, she left out the door.</p><br/><p>Today, the morning was unusually busy. Because Claire had woken up safely, everybody ate a peaceful meal joyfully.</p><br/><p>Claire gracefully wiped her mouth after eating and then said, \u201cCousin Yuewen, tell me about Lagark\u2019s capital\u2019s current economic situation. Also, tell me as much information as possible about the chairmen of each chamber of commerce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEach chairman?\u201d Li Yuewen was a bit puzzled. It was reasonable to want to know about each chamber of commerce, but each chairman?</p><br/><p>Claire accepted the flower tea Camille passed over, took a large, satisfying sip, then continued asking, \u201cMm. Are there going to be any big events in the capital soon? Anything that would attract people\u2019s attention?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What does that have to do with making money?\u201d Li Yuewen asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>Claire couldn\u2019t explain to them the effects of advertising. She could only respond confidently. \u201cYes. So, are there any big events?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Yuewen nodded. \u201cTwo weeks later, the capital will hold a donating convention. The donated money will be construct a clinic for the poor people who can\u2019t afford to be treated. That day, both the crown prince and the capital\u2019s number one beauty will be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrince? Number one beauty?\u201d Claire asked, puzzled. She set down her teacup.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Claire, in truth, there are three great beauties. Of the great beauties, one is the Hua clan\u2019s Hua Xiuning and one is the Shui clan\u2019s Shui Xinmei.\u201d Li Mingyu explained, amused.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the last one?\u201d Claire raised her teacup and Camille poured in more tea for her. Claire took a small sip. He had only mentioned two. Who was the third beauty?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The scholar, Camille? Jean was puzzled.</p><br/><p>Claire felt somewhat gloomy. Was it lucky that she found out about those facts today?</p><br/><p>Why did she feel an invisible net drawing close, and then continuously tighten, tighten\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, don\u2019t be this fidgety. The situation will definitely be settled. Don\u2019t forget, Duke Gordan is able to keep the Hill clan towering, naturally he is very capable. Your father and your elder brothers are all not to be trifled with.\u201d Walter consoled Claire.</p><br/><p>Father? Elder brothers? Claire became a bit muddle headed, feeling that these two phrases were unfamiliar. Now that Walter brought it up, Claire remembered that indeed, she really did had a father and two elder brothers who all seemed to dislike her. And up until now, she hadn\u2019t met them before except for the one time at the two countries\u2019 competition when she saw her second brother, the man who had become the captain of the Griffin Squad at such a young age.</p><br/><p>The next day, Claire and Lashia went to classes together. Claire told the maids to take good care of Summer and Ben, then repeatedly warned the two not to get into trouble. Only then did she leave.</p><br/><p>But right after Claire just had a peaceful morning at school, at noon, someone came, flustered, reporting to Claire that there was a mishap at the Duke\u2019s castle, and he wanted Claire to go back quickly. If she didn\u2019t go back, the black clothed man she brought back was about to flip the Hill castle over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth is going on?\u201d Claire sat in the carriage, a faint trace of anger in her voice. Before leaving, she had repeatedly warned that uneducated dragon. Perhaps that idiot forgot it all? Not long after she left, he had actually made such a ruckus, it was about to get out of hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe, the Marquis came back.\u201d The servant answered cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Marquis?\u201d Claire was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss\u2019s father.\u201d The servant was also confused as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. What does that have to do with Ben making a ruckus?\u201d Claire didn\u2019t understand. If he came back, then he just came back. She had the impression that man didn\u2019t like Claire one bit, so much that it could be said he loathed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 Because the Marquis said some unflattering words about Miss, so, so the guests you brought back weren\u2019t happy.\u201d The servant said, exceptionally cautious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what did he say?\u201d Claire raised a brow and coldly laughed. Some unflattering words? Perhaps it\u2019s not as simple as that?</p><br/><p>\u201cBe more thorough about the matter.\u201d Jean said coldly from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The servant gulped and hurriedly said, \u201cThe Marquis came back and his Grace, the Duke, wasn\u2019t there, so sir Emery led him in. He told the Marquis that Mr. Ben was Miss\u2019s friend. Then the Marquis said, said\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant didn\u2019t dare to finish what he was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he say the man-chasing idiot actually has friends?\u201d A cold smile appeared on her face as she said it insipidly.</p><br/><p>The servant was silent, his face paling, revealing that Claire\u2019s guess was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then Ben was in a bad mood?\u201d Claire asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Ben still hadn\u2019t flared up when Miss Summer first retorted. Then, then\u2026\u201d The servant\u2019s voice lowered. \u201cThen the Marquis\u2019s words started to become a bit unflattering, and then it developed out of hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire slowly closed her eyes, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoachman, quicker!\u201d Jean instructed the coachman to accelerate. Jean looked at the silent Claire. He didn\u2019t know why, but a trace of an unbearable and heart wrenching feeling appeared in his heart. The person who had demeaned Claire was her relative, the person guarding Claire was an outsider\u2026</p><br/><p>Currently, a storm had already started at Hill mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cApologize! Take back your words.\u201d Summer bellowed at Roger Hill, who was also Claire\u2019s father, her whole face red, hands at the hip.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my own daughter, what gives you outsiders the right to talk about her?\u201d Marquis Roger said in contempt, but he felt an unspeakable anguish. Since when did that useless daughter of his actually have friends who would protect her like this? She could actually have friends? Everybody avoided her. He had heard recently that she had done some things, but maybe it wasn\u2019t by her own abilities and instead, Father pulling some strings from behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving a father like this for Claire is a tragedy! It\u2019d be fine if you just didn\u2019t understand, but you actually humiliated your own daughter.\u201d Summer was so mad, she was about to kick something, anything. During the life-threatening moment, Claire didn\u2019t abandon them and run off by herself, but shielded them herself instead. If it was someone else dishonoring Claire, she wouldn\u2019t feel much, but the person who had dishonored Claire was actually Claire\u2019s father!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand my daughter the most, since when did you guys have the right to speak?\u201d Marquis Roger said impatiently while looking at the furious girl. But he didn\u2019t dare to have a more excessive attitude. Just then, the threatening Qi the black clothed man had emitted from his entire body, along with Emery\u2019s constant meaningful glances let Marquis Roger know that the black clothed man definitely wasn\u2019t someone normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou vile guy, what qualifications do you have to dishonor Claire!\u201d Summer was still completely stubborn. \u201cYou must take back the words you said just then, must apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent!\u201d Marquis Roger finally got angry. He was a grandiose Marquis. Since when was it that little girl\u2019s turn to shout at him like this, and in his own home too!</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the way I see it, it\u2019s because you\u2019re Claire\u2019s friends that you guy do a lot of bickering, but you guys can\u2019t be too discourteous. Such uneducated people being with Claire, is it not birds of a feather flocking together?\u201d The Marquis Roger finally couldn\u2019t resist his anger, despite the constant meaningful glances Emery gave him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard uncle! Who do you think you are? Are you really educated? You kept repeating over and over your daughter is an idiotic man-chaser and what good was giving birth to her.\u201d Summer also became furious, loudly and angrily rebuking Marquis Roger.</p><br/><p>Now Marquis Roger\u2019s face greened. Claire had always been a thorn in his heart. It was because he heard Claire had some small accomplishments that he returned to confirm, but he never thought he would be scolded and opposed like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you actually dare to scold me!\u201d Marquis Roger was also furious. As a majestic Marquis, he was actually disgraced by a little brat, and even in the Hill Castle!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I cuss at you? You are a bastard. I have never met such a bastard father like you. Some people are born without a father and don\u2019t have a father\u2019s care. Claire has a father, but it\u2019s even worse for her!\u201d It seemed like something had touched Summer\u2019s weak spot, her eyes wide, flickering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Marquis Roger was so mad his whole body shook. He pointed at Summer. \u201cBring her away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dares!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dares!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two voices sounded at the same time.</p><br/><p>One was Ben, the other was Claire, who had just reached the entrance.</p><br/><p>Marquis Roger turned and saw the cold-faced Claire standing at the doorway. Although Claire was standing there calmly, she emitted an indescribable boldness that made the people behind Marquis Roger not dare to touch Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Once Summer heard Claire, she ran over and grabbed Claire\u2019s hand. \u201cYou came back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire looked at summer, a trace of a smile appearing on her face. In a low voice she said, \u201cI heard everything you said. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything I said was the truth.\u201d Just by thinking of the argument, Summer became angry and said, \u201cYou actually have this kind of a father! Too evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire! What kind of friends did you make?! So uneducated!\u201d Marquis Roger angrily shouted the moment he saw Claire. In his vague memories of her, every time he scolded Claire angrily, Claire would become completely scared, and then Katherine would come out and shelter the useless child.</p><br/><p>But Claire\u2019s response was completely out of his expectation. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to question what kinds of friends I make. Also, you have never asked about my life. You haven\u2019t done it before, and you don\u2019t need to do it now, and you\u2019re not allowed to do it in the future even more so!\u201d Claire said coldly, her voice resonating with power. \u201cAs an esteemed Marquis, isn\u2019t bickering like this with a little girl who isn\u2019t even fifteen years old too disgraceful, too humiliating to the Hill family name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Emery\u2019s expression changed slightly. Claire\u2019s words just now would only exacerbate the conflict. Thinking of this, Emery gave a meaningful glance at Claire, but Claire didn\u2019t pay attention. Naturally, she had something else planned.</p><br/><p>Marquis Roger was thoroughly shocked. This was the Claire that people hated? The Claire who would act like a rat meeting a cat whenever she saw him? Was he imagining things? Why did he feel like she had this kind of boldness and aggressiveness?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking to me? Are you talking to your father?\u201d Marquis Roger asked coldly, his expression serious. As a father, being challenged was not allowed. No matter how capable his child was, it still wasn\u2019t allowed!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many fathers do I have? If I\u2019m not talking to you, then am I talking to another father?\u201d Claire replied cynically. Within her memories, she didn\u2019t seem to have many impressions of him besides him shouting at Claire.</p><br/><p>Everybody\u2019s expressions changed. The Miss actually dared to go against the Marquis like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!! You impudent!\u201d Marquis Roger\u2019s face darkened. Claire actually dared to say such disgraceful and unfilial words, actually dared to go against him rudely!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it that first didn\u2019t treat me like a daughter but is now acting like he is a father? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s quite funny?\u201d Claire looked at Marquis Roger, sneering mockingly. \u201cThat day when I fell of the horse and almost died, did you even see me once right before you went out the front door? If I didn\u2019t wake up at the time, would you not have met me until now? To you, it didn\u2019t matter whether or not that happened, because you have already long before disregarded me as your daughter. What are you doing? Pretending to be a father now?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

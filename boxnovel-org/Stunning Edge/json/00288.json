While Xiao Ao Shuang was sleeping, she did not notice that anyone had come.</p><br/><p>Outside the city, two figures were chasing after each other. He kept his distance until he entered a small, dark forest.</p><br/><p>The person in front finally stopped and stood with his hands behind his back, but he did not turn around.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan, who was chasing after them, also stopped and looked at the people before him silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, why are you chasing me?\u201d The man in front spat out those words softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jin Yan frowned slightly as he looked at the person in front of him, his eyes burning.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it important who it is?\u201d the man in front whispered.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan was silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bear her no ill will.\u201d the man said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jin Yan affirmed with a deep voice, \u201cOn the contrary, I still have some concerns.\u201d Jin Yan voiced the question in his heart. Who was this man? Why is the attitude towards the young lady so strange?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d For the time being, don\u2019t get involved in the Star Academy\u2019s affairs. I\u2019ll take care of it, and when the time comes, you\u2019ll understand. \u201cAt that time, it won\u2019t be too late for you to make a move.\u201d The person in front said slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d \u201cYou are the mysterious man that Miss talked about!\u201d Jin Yan was shocked, \u201cYou were the one who almost destroyed the Star Heavenly Pagoda back then?!\u201d No wonder this person\u2019s strength was unfathomable. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that his soul had been ejected and was abnormally sensitive, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed that he was standing in the young lady\u2019s bedroom. And the chase just now was clearly because he hadn\u2019t tried his best. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep up with him. He stopped here to wait for her. Was there something he wanted to say to her?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It\u2019s been a long time. \u201d \u201cThe Skysplit Tower must be destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jin Yan\u2019s heart tightened. The mysterious man in front of him clearly knew some inside information, but what was inside information?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know eventually.\u201d \u201cBefore that, protect her.\u201d After the mysterious man finished speaking, his figure instantly vanished from where he stood. Only the cool breeze blew by and the soft rustling of the leaves could be heard.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan hastily took a few steps forward, unable to detect the aura of the mysterious man.</p><br/><p>Who was he?</p><br/><p>Why are you so concerned about the young mistress?</p><br/><p>Why did he feel a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?</p><br/><p>A deja vu? How could he have such absurd thoughts?</p><br/><p>After standing in the forest for a long time, Jin Yan slowly returned, his heart filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>The next morning, crisp sounds of birds could be heard. Sunlight shone through the windows and onto the floor. Qi Ao Shuang slowly opened her eyes, looked at the gorgeous bed curtain above her, then slowly stood up with a yawn.</p><br/><p>A soft voice came from outside the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed to be the voice of Dittas.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart tightened as she suddenly remembered that Jin Yan hadn\u2019t even touched their heads last night. With his somewhat eccentric personality, Dittins might even clash with Jin Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang hurriedly got off the bed and opened the door. As expected, she saw the cold face of Dittos.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan stood silently by Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s door. He wore a cold expression. He didn\u2019t reply to Dentance\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, who is this person?\u201d Stay by your door. \u201d Dittos frowned slightly as a trace of darkness flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my attendant, Jin Yan.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang thought about it for a moment before following Jin Yan\u2019s instructions to introduce him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttendant?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d When he heard this, his expression eased a little. From the looks of it, what this person called Jin Yan had done just now was indeed like a loyal attendant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh ~ ~ ~ ~ Ohhhh ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\u201d Jonathan stretched and yawned. A strange cry came from his mouth as he walked out of his room. His eyes were squinted and his face was filled with satisfaction. When he opened his eyes and saw the three of them, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201d \u201cEh, who is this?\u201d Jonathan looked at Jin Yan curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s attendant.\u201d \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go eat. We\u2019ll take a look at the layout of the venue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan stood silently to the side.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked doubtfully at Dittos and then at Ember.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wash my face first.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned around and walked in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll wait for you in the restaurant.\u201d Jonathan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Dittos and Jonathan left, Jin Yan lowered his head and crossed his arms before his chest. He silently leaned against the wall beside Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s door, silently waiting.</p><br/><p>Dittos glanced at Jin Yan from afar, deep in thought.</p><br/><p>At the dinner table, Jonathan was chewing on food with narrowed eyes. His expression was satisfied, but he didn\u2019t know what he was thinking about.</p><br/><p>Dittos ate his breakfast quietly, the corner of his eye looking in the direction of Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan stood behind Qi Ao Shuang, pouring hot tea for her with a natural expression. The sweet scent of roses is intoxicating.</p><br/><p>Rose tea.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her head to look at Jin Yan and smiled knowingly.</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on Jin Yan\u2019s ice-cold face. After pouring the tea, Jin Yan silently retreated behind Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>All of this fell into Dittas\u2019 eyes, and Dittas\u2019 eyes became a little darker.</p><br/><p>After eating breakfast, he prepared to head to the largest martial arts arena in the west side of the city.</p><br/><p>The three of them got into a carriage. Jin Yan sat beside the horse driver, still not speaking.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the Martial Skill Grounds, the carriages had just stopped when someone came forward to welcome them. The three of them walked in front while Jin Yan followed silently behind. Looking around the venue, Jonathan yawned impatiently, looking around in boredom. Dittos was expressionless as he looked through everything. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, go and talk to the manager at the meeting, over there \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, go take a look as well. Let Jonathan explain to you.\u201d Dittos ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The two of them nodded. Qi Ao Shuang was about to follow Jonathan, while Jin Yan was about to follow.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than the envoys from the Star Academy, no one else is allowed to enter.\u201d Dittos\u2019 cold voice floated over.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan turned his head slightly and glanced at Dittins, but Dittins remained cold and expressionless.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jin Yan and smiled faintly, \u201cJin Yan, it\u2019s alright. Wait for me here. I\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan nodded. \u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Jonathan and Qi Ao Shuang left, Dittens withdrew his gaze and slowly turned his head to look at Jin Yan.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan slowly raised his head and looked into the incomparably cold eyes of Dittens.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, pay attention to your identity.\u201d \u201cIf you let Xiao Ao Shuang distract me, I will kill you.\u201d There was no ripple in the cold voice of Dittos. The only difference was that the Concourse of the Underworld was so obvious. This so-called \u2018attendant\u2019 suddenly appeared, and the feeling he had with Qi Ao Shuang made him feel uncomfortable. One thing was certain. Qi Ao Shuang cared a lot about this man. If this man was to implicate Qi Ao Shuang, she would definitely eliminate him without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>With a faint smile, Jin Yan softly asked, \u201cWhat is your relationship with my family\u2019s young master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only one I admit to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen does he admit you?\u201d The corners of Jin Yan\u2019s mouth curled into a mocking smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d Of course, according to what Dylan knew, Qi Ao Shuang had to acknowledge him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what young master wants the most?\u201d Do you know why young master had to step into the Space Shattering Realm? \u201cDo you really think that Young Master is the same person as you?\u201d The mocking smile on the corner of Jin Yan\u2019s mouth became even more obvious.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, an enormous aura suddenly assaulted Jin Yan. Endless terrifying killing intent enveloped Jin Yan\u2019s entire body at this moment. A trace of blood slowly appeared on Jin Yan\u2019s handsome face. A trace of blood silently flowed out in fear.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Yan didn\u2019t have any reaction. His face was still filled with a faint mocking smile.</p><br/><p>The two of them stared at each other, neither of them showing any intention of dodging.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are all of you doing?\u201d In the distance, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s anxious voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>Dickens withdrew his aura in an instant, turned around and looked at Xiao Ao Shuang with a faint smile, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Your attendant is not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jin Yan through Dentance. She saw the trace of blood on Jin Yan\u2019s face, but Jin Yan\u2019s expression was relaxed. In the end, Xiao Ao Shuang glanced at Dittas but didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>After the tour, Jonathan called out that he had finished the day\u2019s work and went shopping to see what the shop had to offer. Jonathan went into the shop excitedly. Behind him was an emotionless group of Dittas and his men. Originally, Dotans would not do such boring things, but Qi Ao Shuang came with Jonathan, so he stayed.</p><br/><p>Inside the jewelry store.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Qi Ao Shuang, take a look at this, this is quite suitable for you.\u201d Jonathan sounded excited.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aushuang looked at it, Jonathan was pointing to a lilac necklace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt suits your earring very well.\u201d Haha. \u201cAnyway, you\u2019re more beautiful than a woman.\u201d Jonathan said.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes stopped. A lilac necklace \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly touched her earring and fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, if you keep talking nonsense, cut off your tongue.\u201d Dittos spat out coldly.</p><br/><p>Jonathan stuck out his tongue and said nothing. Looking at the silent Qi Ao Shuang, Jonathan thought that his claim that Qi Ao Shuang was even prettier than women made him angry. That\u2019s true. Which man wouldn\u2019t be angry when they said he was prettier than a woman?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d After saying that, Qi Ao Shuang turned around and left. Jin Yan lowered his head as he followed.</p><br/><p>Jonathan hurried after her.</p><br/><p>Dittos looked at the lilac necklace and thought of the earring on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s ear. Is there a problem with that earring?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly walked on the street, looking at the scene before her, lost in thought.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan chased after him and said in a low voice, \u201cYoung Master, you want to be cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not deny it, and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Young Master, do you want Breezy?\u201d Yet, Jin Yan suddenly said something else.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was slightly startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, sooner or later, you will have to choose one of these two people\u2026\u201d Jin Yan\u2019s words were very, very soft.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned and stopped.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was smiling, yet not smiling. Claire raised a brow. Of course Claire understood what the pope meant. Claire had already used the gift of the goddess and it was time for her to reciprocate.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, what can your servant do for the Temple?\u201d Claire sighed in her heart. Afterall, she <i>did</i> take their stuff and the sly old fox <i>did</i> do her a huge favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, of course\u2026\u201d But before the pope finished, footsteps sounded at the door, followed immediately by knocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d The pope seemed to know who it was.</p><br/><p>As the door opened slowly, Leng Lingyun and Liu Xueqing appeared. As they walked in, when they saw Claire, their eyes flashed with shock. Claire turned to see the two. After a slight nod, just when she was about to turn back, she noticed what they were holding.</p><br/><p>Each person was carrying a box, one large, one small.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it resolved?\u201d The pope smiled at the two. Although he was asking, his gaze was certain and he was satisfied. The two had never disappointed him.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing glanced at Claire and hesitated. Leng Lingyun was unexpectedly frowning.</p><br/><p>But the pope smiled and nodded at Liu Xueqing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Claire is now a priest of our Temple, not an outsider.\u201d</p><br/><p>A complex emotion flitted across her eyes, but she still opened the box. Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes were also filled with ambivalence. He wanted to say something, but was halted by the pope\u2019s knowing gaze.</p><br/><p>When Claire saw what was inside the box, she stiffened.</p><br/><p>Inside the box was a glass bottle containing two bloody eyeballs! With black irises! And a handful of black hair!</p><br/><p>Claire felt her blood run cold. Her gaze rested on the bottle and the black hair, unable to look away. Her heart hardened, her fist clenched. Her palms were already drenched in cold sweat.</p><br/><p>An ineffable light flashed through the pope\u2019s gaze when he saw Claire\u2019s expression. \u201cHas the traitor, the fallen knight Shack, been executed?\u201d he asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 \u201d Leng Lingyun said slowly. He sighed in his heart. Naturally, he understood what the pope intended. But wasn\u2019t the pope a little hurried? Was it fine for Claire to be exposed to this so soon? Wasn\u2019t it too early to test Claire\u2019s opinion of the Temple?</p><br/><p>Peering from the corner of her eye, Liu Xiuqing saw Claire\u2019s face pale slightly. \u201cThose who betray the goddess of Light, betray the Temple of Light, can only die. He also eloped with the filthy woman of Darkness, adding to his sins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s gaze shifted to the box Leng Lingyun was holding. Did the large box Leng Lingyun carrying contain the head of the fallen knight?!</p><br/><p>Claire recognized that it must have been the two ill-fated lovers they had saved in the valley! Unfortunately, they had not escaped the clutches of the Temple of Light. How cruel, they had actually pulled out her eyes and ripped out her hair! Claire clenched her fists tightly, her knuckles whitening and cracking softly. She trembled slightly, her complexion frighteningly pale.</p><br/><p>The Temple of Light! The Pope! The Pope whose every word was supposedly filled with virtue!</p><br/><p>The pope strode forward indifferently. He inspected the items in Liu Xueqing\u2019s box, nodding praisingly. \u201cYou two have done well this time, exterminating the fallen and scum so the Light will once again shine \u2013 \u201d</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s words were cut off abruptly. A terrifying power had suddenly burst forth.</p><br/><p>The pope and Liu Xiuqing turned in shock to see Claire\u2019s entire being glow with golden light, her gaze completely icy. The wild power was being released by Claire!</p><br/><p>Liu Xiuqing\u2019s eyes flickered excitedly. Was Claire going to attack the pope? Did she want to die? The pope stared in shock at Claire, who was on the verge of exploding. The atmosphere was so tense, it was a string that would snap at any time! But before the pope could make a move\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Leng Lingyun hollered. With this one yell, the atmosphere instantly dispersed.</p><br/><p>Claire came back to her senses and the golden glow faded. Her clenched fists slowly loosened. She glared coldly at every individual, then turned away and opened the door. She walked out without a word and slammed the door behind her, leaving the room in dead silence.</p><br/><p>The three were left frozen, each with a different expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, isn\u2019t Reverend\u2019s attitude crossing the line?\u201d the Divine Princess asked. Because Leng Lingyun was there, her tone was somewhat kind.</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s eyes slitted and he remained silent. Leng Lingyun looked at the pope. Although he did not say anything, the pope understood the meaning in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cXueqing, you may leave.\u201d The pope gave Liu Xueqing a nod. \u201cI have a few questions for Lingyun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing\u2019s eyes flashed with unwillingness, but in the end, she left without a word.</p><br/><p>After the door closed, the pope turned to face Leng Lingyun. \u201cLingyun, if you have anything to say, say it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun spoke directly from the heart. \u201cYour holiness, your actions are too hasty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pope let out a sigh. \u201cYes, I too realized I was too hasty. However, I did not expect Claire\u2019s strength to grow so quickly in the short time she was gone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer potential is truly astonished,\u201d Leng Lingyun agreed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps that was why she was chosen by the goddess.\u201d The pope stroked his chin and leaned back in his chair. \u201cShe is different from you two. She has only entered the Temple recently and grew up in the Hill clan, which supports the crown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your holiness. Please give her time to adjust.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I will. However, Leng Lingyun, this seems to be the first time you have shown so much care to anyone other than Xuanxuan.\u201d The pope smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun froze for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cYour holiness, I just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just want to say you do not wish for the Temple of Light to loose such potential?\u201d The pope was smiling, but his meaning was clear.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun fell silent. He knew saying anything else would only worsen the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, after settling this matter, you can go visit Xuanxuan and comfort our priest,\u201d the pope instructed. He was smiling faintly, his expression ambiguous.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Leng Lingyun replied. His expression had never changed.</p><br/><p>Now, only the pope was left in the room. He slowly approached the window, sighing softly as he gazed out. The goddess had decreed adding Claire into the Temple, but was this the correct path? The pope couldn\u2019t help but be worried recalling Claire on the verge of exploding. It was only for an instant, but the aura Claire had emitted was so powerful. What would happen if they continued to let her grow? Would she be help or would she be danger?</p><br/><p>At this time, Claire was hurrying out of the Temple, her expression heavy as she walked to Camille\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>She kicked open the door with a loud bang. The door creaked as it swung on its hinges, thoroughly broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?! Who would\u2026\u201d Camille started yelling, but then he saw Claire storm in, her expression dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you\u2019re back. But what\u2019s with your face, why are you so angry? Were you kicked out?\u201d Camille\u2019s voice was gentle, handsome, but his venomous tongue had not changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille, you are the number one scholar in the capital, correct?\u201d Camille had already surpassed his master who was supposed the number one scholar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, of course,\u201d Camille answered lazily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me ask you, when the world worships a horrible, shameless, unfair, vile being, what do you do?\u201d Claire sat down on the sofa, emitting a murderous aura. Her gaze piercingly cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when were you so righteous?\u201d Camille joked, smiling.</p><br/><p>But Claire\u2019s gaze remained icy. Camille finally realized the situation was not simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I do not know what occurred, but if what you said is true and the entire world worships that being, then they must be extremely powerful. If you want to overthrow them, you must have the power and status to crush them, crush them <i>underfoot</i>,\u201d Camille answered, his expression solemn, his tone heavy. It was extremely rare for Camille to be serious.</p><br/><p>But after hearing Camille\u2019s serious words, Claire suddenly stood up and started laughing. The more she laughed, the more crazy her laughter became. But the laughter was filled with realization, domination, and endless confidence.</p><br/><p>Camille was at a loss for words. Only after a long time was he able to sputter, \u201cCl-Claire, are you ok? Did you go crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense,<i> you\u2019re</i> the one who\u2019s gone crazy!\u201d Claire glared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you doing?\u201d Camille tilted his head, not understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did I not realize!\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes hardened, becoming more and more icy. \u201cThere will come a day when I become powerful enough to pull her off that throne and beat her up!\u201d Claire humphed coldly. This one sound was filled with wild power, so much so that Camille\u2019s ears vibrated and his sight went dark for a moment. Camille thought to himself nervously, Claire\u2019s strength had grown a lot again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look for you another day.\u201d And with that, Claire stood up and left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

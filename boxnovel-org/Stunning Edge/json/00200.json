As she suspected, the alluring woman was nowhere to be found. Naturally, Leng Lingyun noticed as well. The two shared a glance, understanding what had happened.</p><br/><p>The guard flew after them for a while, but returned in the end. Evidently, he had not been able to catch up to Carter.</p><br/><p>Once the dragon returned to the ravine, he saw Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun. Currently angry, he was unwilling to acknowledge them. He merely gave a nod.</p><br/><p>But Qi Aoshuang spoke. \u201cThese people were only here to attract your attention. That woman must have slipped in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dragon froze. He recalled what just happened. Thinking carefully, his expression changed. He immediately flew back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did that woman go in?\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned, watching as the dragon left.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Qi Aoshuang also frowned. Using beautifying potion to attract the brainless prince Banis and using his squadron to attract the dragon\u2019s attention to slip in. Naturally, that woman could not directly fight the dragons. What was she trying to do in secret?</p><br/><p>It was unrelated to her, but Ben was the current dragon king. She could not just sit still and watch. No matter what that woman was planning, one thing was certain: it definitely would not benefit the dragon race!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun did not enter Dragon Valley. Warning the guarding dragon was already enough. Because they could not be identified, hastily entering was not necessarily the right choice. The best decision was to wait until Ben came out of seclusion.</p><br/><p>Merely two days later, after Ben left seclusion, after hearing the report by his underling, he immediately went to the ravine.</p><br/><p>Ben was like a completely new person. The Ben before them had elegant, flowy hair with profound eyes as cold as the night sky. His handsome face emanated a firm, domineering aura. He gave off the air of a king. Two people in grey followed behind him, or more accurately, two dragons in human form.</p><br/><p>Once he saw the ordinary two people, he paused for a moment, then asking cautiously, \u201cClaire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled. Before she could say anything, White Emperor and Black Feather suddenly bounced out, jumping onto Ben\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! It\u2019s really you!\u201d he exclaimed happily.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang nodded. Ben then looked at Leng Lingyun suspiciously. \u201cThen who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun,\u201d he said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you guys look like that? You\u2019re almost ugly, haha\u2026\u201d Ben was back to his old ways, still that uncultured black dragon. It was just now, he was not a prince anymore, but the dragon king!</p><br/><p>Clearly, Ben had not heard what had happened. Of course, living in Dragon Valley, the dragons would not interact with humans, and Ben had been receiving his inheritance, so naturally, he would not know what had happened to Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later. There is another pressing matter at hand. A woman infiltrated Dragon Valley, have you found her? Her motives are unknown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat happened?\u201d Ben frowned, then turned to look at the two people in grey behind him. They had terrified expressions. \u201cDid you find the woman yet?\u201d Ben did not ask if there was a woman who infiltrated, but if they had found the woman or not. He would never doubt Qi Aoshuang\u2019s words. The two people in grey were a little surprised at their king\u2019s faith in the human.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, that woman is currently\u2026\u201d one of them started to say apprehensively, then trailed off.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say if you found her!\u201d Ben was already a little angry, his eyes flashing coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgive me, your majesty. We have already hastened the search,\u201d they said fearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cBen, that woman is no ordinary person. She used a beautifying potion to use a group of people as bait to attract attention, and then slipped in. Think carefully, what could it be that she wants?\u201d Qi Aoshuang could see from Ben\u2019s intense gaze that he was now truly the dragon kind.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ben had a strange expression on his face. \u201cSummer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSummer?\u201d Qi Aoshuang frowned, but then suddenly said, \u201cThe Ai Luo clan! That woman must be from the Ai Luo clan, so she is after dragon teeth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is a thief.\u201d Ben was currently calm. He ordered the two in grey, \u201cImmediately send people to the Dragon Hollow. Bring that woman to me the moment you find her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d The two in grey immediately turned and left. The Dragon Hollow was the burial ground of the dragons and was not to be disturbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, come to my palace.\u201d Ben revealed a toothy grin, delighted with himself.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang nodded. Ben muttered something, transforming back into his true form, then started to fly. Qi Aoshuang smiled, unfurling her golden wings. Leng Lingyun also flew on his own. The two followed Ben from behind.</p><br/><p>Entering with Ben, naturally they were not obstructed. When the guarding dragon saw Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun flying behind Ben, he stared blankly, his mouth wide open. Inwardly, he thought to himself, luckily he had not rashly offended the king\u2019s friends.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang surveyed the entire valley from her vantage point. The long mountain range was covered with dense forest. Once in a while, she would spot dragons atop mountains. Deep in the mountain range, there was a lake with dark green waters, a few dragons lounging next to it. Even further in, a grand palace appeared before them. It appeared to be made of pure white, lustrous jade. The palace was much larger than human ones.</p><br/><p>\u201cBen, do you dragons typically live in your dragon forms or in your human forms?\u201d Qi Aoshuang was curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce a dragon matures, they can assume a human form. Of course, it is their choice which form they choose. However, you must assume your human form to enter the palace.\u201d Ben sighed gloomily. \u201cAlthough the dragon race is proud and looks down on humans, they can only assume the human form once they mature. To be forced to assume the human form in the palace is a bit ironic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps, the dragon god deeply wishes for dragons to coexist with humans,\u201d Leng Lingyun uttered in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d When they reached the palace, Ben descended, instantly assuming his human form as he did. Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun also descended. Immediately, two beautiful maids appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two beauties bowed respectfully. Their eyes were filled with unconcealable reverence. To dragons, strength equated to law.</p><br/><p>Ben nodded offhandedly. \u201cPrepare two rooms for my friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d The two maids bowed, then withdrew.</p><br/><p>Ben led Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun to the main hall, then through a corridor to arrive at a small palace hall.</p><br/><p>Another beautiful maid came to offer the three fresh water, then left. The dragon race did not enjoy tea, all choosing to drink underground fresh water.</p><br/><p>\u201cBen, I came here to ask you for something,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said solemnly after getting seated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Seeing that Qi Aoshuang had a serious expression, he too became serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what the God Feather Heaven Slayer is?\u201d Qi Aoshuang asked in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelic weapon?\u201d Ben asked probingly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe do have what you want, but\u2026\u201d Ben rubbed his temples. \u201cBut who knows which nook or cranny it fell into. It will be difficult to find. I think it was a pair of wristguards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang started to sweat. She hadn\u2019t expected the dragon race to treat it like nothing. At the very least, the mermaids had given it to their princess as a gift. The dragons, on the other hand, didn\u2019t even know where they put it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what do you want it for? Don\u2019t the sprites treat theirs like some kind of offering from their god?\u201d Ben asked, not understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cBen, my name is now Qi Aoshuang\u2026\u201d she said quietly. Her eyes flashed through a myriad of emotions: grief, heartbroken, anger, hate\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

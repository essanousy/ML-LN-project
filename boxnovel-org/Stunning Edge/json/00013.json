The old man leaned on the horse, unwilling to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo Gale Gorge.\u201d After a long time, Claire finally replied lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, this is such a coincidence. I am also going there. As your compensation for bumping into me, let\u2019s go together. You guys are young and strong, so it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask you guys to protect such a frail, old man like me.\u201d The old man deviously looked at Claire\u2019s bosom.</p><br/><p>This old man isn\u2019t simple. Not only does he have such a thick face, he is also perverted! Claire looked at the old man\u2019s devious gaze, confirming her suspicions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only have two horses. I\u2019ll hire a carriage for you then.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t want to tangle up with this annoying, perverted old man, so she said this decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that won\u2019t do. It\u2019s so far away, no carriage would be willing to go there. And do you think those coachmen, who run faster than horses in times of danger, could protect a frail old man like me?\u201d The old man obviously planned on not letting Claire go and shamelessly said these words. A coachman can run faster than a horse? He had the face to say that?!</p><br/><p>Jean looked at the old man\u2019s crafty eyes and felt puzzled. This old man seemed very familiar, but who was he? Although he had definitely met him before, for the time being he couldn\u2019t figure out where.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what do you want?\u201d Claire frowned. It seems like this old man has made up his mind to follow them. Although his intent isn\u2019t clear yet, one thing could be sure: this old man didn\u2019t mean any harm.</p><br/><p>Jean searched thoroughly in his brain for information on this old man, and all of a sudden, Jean\u2019s eyes widened. It\u2019s him! It\u2019s actually him! His whereabouts were always erratic, so what a surprise to encounter him here! But why was he obsessed with Claire? Jean didn\u2019t understand, couldn\u2019t figure it out. But if they could keep him with them throughout this trip, the word \u201cdanger\u201d virtually wouldn\u2019t exist!</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Claire to speak, Jean hurriedly said, \u201cSure, senior, I\u2019ll immediately buy a quality horse for you, please wait a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s sudden change in behavior let Claire understand he had figured out something. If so, she would just watch and see what happens.</p><br/><p>Jean bought a horse very quickly and the old man nimbly flipped onto the horse. And he called himself a weak, frail, old man?</p><br/><p>And so the three left the capital city gates.</p><br/><p>The early morning air was refreshing, and birds flew around chattering. Tall, emerald-green trees stood on both sides of the road, with crystal clear dewdrops hanging from the leaves.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Little beauty.\u201d The old man started to chat cheekily the whole time. The names he called Claire were also very strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Claire replied without much thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Claire? Hmm, very good very good. How old are you then?\u201d The old man\u2019s gaze flitted to Claire\u2019s bosom furtively. He thought to himself, this girl can\u2019t be too old, but she\u2019s developing pretty well, heehee.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d Claire threw back coldly.</p><br/><p>But, a sliver of worry appeared in Jean\u2019s eyes. You simply couldn\u2019t afford to make this person unhappy! Even the emperor tried to please him, afraid to make him the tiniest bit angry. Because he was the legendary figure who had the power to destroy a whole city!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let me guess. Twelve? Thirteen? Fourteen? Fifteen?\u2026\u201d The old man didn\u2019t pay the slightest attention to Claire\u2019s attitude, and started noisily guessing. Claire felt like there were multiple flies humming back and forth about her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you are a magician, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Due to Claire\u2019s complete ignorance of his noisy chitchat, the old man switched topics to talk about.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire spit out the word coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire has just started her studies at the Sunrise Institute, and hasn\u2019t yet gone before Magicians\u2019 Council for her assessment.\u201d Jean was overjoyed. By bringing up the topic himself, did he mean to instruct Claire? If so, then Claire is so lucky! Because this person isn\u2019t just anyone, but the one and only wizard sage of Amparkland! He was constantly traveling, and also the mentor of the principal of Sunrise Institute \u2013 Cliff! His name was eulogized around the continent. He is a living legend, because although other countries also have wizard sages, he was the only one to achieve this level at the young age of twenty-six! He was the genius of geniuses. But, the world also knew that this legendary figure had this one tragic flaw, which was \u2013 lust! And not just any type of lust, but a world-shaking, future-destroying, gods-and-humans-angering lechery!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then do you have a master?\u201d Cliff asked enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>This sentence made Jean\u2019s jaw almost dislocate! What did Cliff\u2019s words signify? Did that mean he wanted to make Claire his disciple?! No way, right? He had only very few disciples, one of them being the principal of the Sunrise Institute! Did he really take a fancy to Claire? Lashia was way, way more talented than Claire, but Cliff didn\u2019t even so much as glance at her. But today he asked Claire this question?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Claire\u2019s cold answer almost made Jean falip off his horse. Did she not understand how great of an opportunity she had in front of her?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you be willing to be my disciple?\u201d Cliff asked, not paying the slightest attention to Claire\u2019s answer and asked while laughing merrily.</p><br/><p>Jean felt like his heart had soared to the skies, fallen down, and now flew up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire rejected indifferently. She knew clearly that one person could have only one master.</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s heart plummeted. He felt as if his heart had been on a over-exciting roller coaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Cliff began to pout. Did she not know how many people wanted to become his disciple? But on the other hand, this little beauty in front of him doesn\u2019t know who he is. This must be the reason for her attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn obscene and perverted old man.\u201d Claire\u2019s mouth started to become poisonous. Jean\u2019s expression instantly changed. Even though what Claire said was the undeniable truth, this person was Cliff!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, ahem~ \u201d Cliff coughed slightly, but he didn\u2019t get embarrassed or angry. Instead, he opened up a new topic, \u201cI\u2019m Cliff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat master Cliff, so it\u2019s you! As our country\u2019s only wizard sage, you were always a legendary figure. What brings you here today?\u201d Jean immediately pointed out Cliff\u2019s identity, obviously to let Claire know that this perverted old man could not be offended. It would be best if she could become his disciple.</p><br/><p>Claire raised her eyebrows slightly. Cliff? That legendary person who was a genius among geniuses? The master of the Sunrise Institute\u2019s principal? Amparkland\u2019s only wizard sage? Actually had this kind of disgusting behavior! Thick skinned, lust that reached the skies, and extremely vulgar.</p><br/><p>But Jean felt extremely puzzled. Why did the legendary Cliff take a fancy to Claire? And wanted to accept her as a disciple? It would be too far-fetched to say he only wanted to recruit her based on her beauty, because beautiful female magicians were everywhere. The only reason would be that Claire had something special that he and others didn\u2019t know, but it was discovered by Cliff!</p><br/><p>Claire thought back to Gordan\u2019s counsel, telling her not to reveal to any outsiders her over-the-top talent before she met that person. Never before. And only that person could be her master. Was it this person whom Grandfather was talking about? Claire guessed.</p><br/><p>From his status and identity, nine out of ten it was him.</p><br/><p>If it was like that\u2026</p><br/><p>An imperceivable, crafty grin appeared in Claire\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to be my master?\u201d Claire asked as she turned to look at the lascivious old man, Cliff, who was closely following on his horse and still looking at her bosom vulgarly.</p><br/><p>Cliff came back to his senses, looked at Claire with raised brows, and released a strange ripple of magic from his body. Cliff\u2019s voice sounded directly in Claire\u2019s head without Jean hearing. \u201cLittle beauty, your talent is rarely seen in a millennium, heehee, be my disciple and I promise you will be treated more than fairly.\u201d That vulgar voice sounded exactly like a child trafficker tricking a little girl.</p><br/><p>Claire understood this must be a very high level magic, to go so far as to directly talk into the mind and not let anyone else hear. By showing her this move, the old man was indicating that he was very powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell~~ \u201c Claire frowned, seemingly thinking very deeply, unable to decide.</p><br/><p>Her hesitant appearance made Cliff a little worried.</p><br/><p>At the city gates he had seen the pretty Claire at once, and then was amazed as he discovered Claire\u2019s hidden talent. How could he give up on such a treasure? He must make her his disciple! If it was this girl, his legacy could definitely be passed on! And she could definitely rival that old man\u2019s disciple! Humph! That despicable, loathsome, shameless, vulgar, pretentious, and deserved a beating old man! Just wait and see, old man!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

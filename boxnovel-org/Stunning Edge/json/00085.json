If they wanted to eat anything, food would come, if they wanted any particular clothes to wear, they would just reach for it. Content, Summer and Walter were dizzy with delight. Only Qiao Chuxin was anxious. A hundred gold coins per year for working, but she still hadn\u2019t done anything besides living luxuriously. It didn\u2019t seem right.</p><br/><p>On this sunny day, Claire and Jean were currently sparring in the courtyard\u2019s training ground. Seeing it, Ben felt the urge to fight too. Summer and Qiao Chuxin were lying on rocking chairs, bathing while watching Claire and Jean spar. Walter still stayed inside, doing doing his closed cultivation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to do it too.\u201d Ben was eager to give it a try.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight with you? I don\u2019t want to lose an arm or a leg.\u201d Claire refused with a cold snorted. Who didn\u2019t know that dragons were beings with terrifying strength. With one swipe of their claw, they could flatten someone, completely unfair.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll control my strength, I\u2019ll be very careful. If you spar with me, you will definitely improve quickly. After all, we\u2019re the best at strength and controlling it too. Come on, come on\u2026 I\u2019ll be very careful.\u201d Ben eagerly tried to persuade. He was itching to have a go at it.</p><br/><p>Claire thought about it, then said, \u201cThen you can only use one hand, tie up the other hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine, fine.\u201d Ben nodded hurriedly, rubbing his palms together expectantly, looking like he wanted to start now.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the divine princess and divine prince, Liuxue Qing and Leng Lingyun, arrived together at the same time to visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine prince, divine princess, we\u2019re honored with your presence.\u201d Duke Gordan wasn\u2019t there, so naturally, the person who greeted them was Marquis Roger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is we who are bothering you.\u201d Liuxue Qing smiled warmly. \u201cWe came to find miss Claire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFind Claire?\u201d Marquis Roger froze. These two well renowned people came specially to find Claire? An ominous feeling arose. He asked immediately, \u201cIs it that the matter with the Roman clan hasn\u2019t been settled properly? Is it that Claire hid information? Is it\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, my lord. That matter has already been dealt with properly. Claire was the victim.\u201d Leng Lingyun interrupted Marquis Roger indifferently. Leng Lingyun himself didn\u2019t know why, but just seeing the man in front of him hold prejudice against Claire, he felt uncomfortable inwardly.</p><br/><p>Liuxiu Qing\u2019s was the same as before, still smiling gently and elegantly. Nobody noticed the sudden flash of darkness in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll call Claire over to greet you.\u201d Marquis Roger said promptly, calming down.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun declined. \u201cNo need. Can someone bring us to meet her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll bring you there myself.\u201d Marquis Roger got up, wanting to say something, but still brought the two to the training grounds in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Just as they entered the courtyard, without any warning, they saw Claire\u2019s body fly across the sky like a kite and collide into the training ground\u2019s barrier. Claire spit out blood, then slowly slid off the barrier and passed out.</p><br/><p>The loud bang echoed within everyone\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Multiple voices rang out at once.</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing only felt something flash by before her eyes. It was Leng Lingyun\u2019s figure, already rushing over.</p><br/><p>The barrier was instantly opened. Everybody rushed to Claire\u2019s side at the same time. Jean was the closest and first to arrive. Once everybody rushed forwards, Jean was already holding Claire tightly.</p><br/><p>Ben just froze, standing from afar. He extended his hand and stared at it intensely. It was this hand that had subconsciously hit Claire flying. Claire\u2019s attacks were too crafty and fierce, so much so that in response he hadn\u2019t been able to control his strength.</p><br/><p>Screwed, he was finished!</p><br/><p>Ben twitched his mouth, then also rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, are you alright?\u201d Summer and Qiao Chuxin worried, deep frowns appeared. Claire didn\u2019t respond no matter how they called, however.</p><br/><p>Jean raised Claire, about to go to head inside, but was stopped by Leng Lingyun. \u201cLet me heal her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did everybody come back to their senses and see that the divine prince and princess had arrived at the courtyard without them knowing. Roger stood behind them, his expression complex.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do and hurry, your highness.\u201d Jean carefully set the unconscious Claire down. The divine prince was an outstanding healer, everybody at the capital knew. Calmness flashed across Jean\u2019s eyes. It was great that the divine prince was there.</p><br/><p>Without a word, Leng Lingyun waved his hand, desperately casting healing magic. White light instantly enveloped Claire\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Nobody noticed Liuxue Qing\u2019s lips pressing together tighter and tighter, her eyes staring intensely at Claire.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the white light on Claire dissipated. When everybody saw Claire\u2019s face, they all let out a sigh of relief. The originally pale face was currently becoming rosy red again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer internal organs are damaged. She still needs rest after I\u2019ve healed her.\u201d Leng Lingyun instructed after healing. \u201cShe can\u2019t make any extreme movements and needs to rest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jean was still frowning after Claire\u2019s color returned. He stood up and bowed towards Leng Lingyun. \u201cThank you very much, your highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was nothing, really.\u201d Leng Lingyun waved his hand softly, indicating the Jean didn\u2019t need to be courteous.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, your highness, for extending a helping hand.\u201d Roger said at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d Leng Lingyun said without emotion. \u201cSend Claire to her room to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Claire slowly opened her eyes and saw the group of worried faces.</p><br/><p>Summer and Qiao Chuxin happily shouted when they saw Claire awake, \u201cClaire, you\u2019ve awakened! That\u2019s great!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Claire frowned slightly. Her body was still a bit out of sorts. She only remembered Ben\u2019s beserk, powerful attack that had hit her flying.</p><br/><p>Crouching at her side, Leng Lingyun asked Claire, \u201cDo you feel anything wrong anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, it was you who healed me?\u201d Claire softly stroked her spine. Good, it didn\u2019t break. The collision just then was really intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You should go in and rest now.\u201d Leng Lingyun extended a hand, wanting to support Claire up.</p><br/><p>But Jean quickly reached out and carried Claire. He looked at Leng Lingyun and said, \u201cMany thanks for extending a helping hand, your highness. Protecting Miss is my responsibility, but I\u2019ve failed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Claire saw that standing behind Leng Lingyun was Liuxue Qing. \u201cYour highnesses, did you come here to find me?\u201d She asked weakly.</p><br/><p>Just as Liuxue Qing was about to say something, Leng Lingyun spoke first.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun nodded. \u201cYes. But, seeing the situation now, it\u2019s best to wait for you to get better first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for healing me, your highness.\u201d Claire thanked again, a trace of a smile on her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so courteous. You should go inside now.\u201d Leng Lingyun looked up at the brilliant sun rays, indicating that it wasn\u2019t sensible for the heavily injured Claire to stay there.</p><br/><p>The group escorted Jean and Claire back inside. Ben stood there, frozen, fearfully not daring to join. Roger had a complex expression the whole time and also stood there, rooted in place.</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing watched Lingyun Leng from behind, all sorts of feelings welling up in her heart. Just as she was going to catch up to him, she saw the uncomfortable Ben from the corner of her eye,</p><br/><p>Black clothes, black hair, black eyes, looking otherworldly, so striking. Liuxue Qing frowned slightly, glancing at Ben again. Suddenly, Liuxue Qing felt something off. She was completely unable to see through this black clothed man\u2019s strength! Also, the black clothed man seemed to have an inhuman aura?!</p><br/><p>Her woman\u2019s sixth sense made Liuxue Qing start to become suspicious. Claire\u2019s small pet was the animal that had appeared on the black dragon\u2019s back that day, and now she couldn\u2019t see through this man\u2019s strength at all and he had an inhuman aura. Could it be? Could it be this man was that black dragon?!</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing suppressed the excitement in her heart and didn\u2019t follow everybody inside. Instead, she hurriedly bid Marquis Roger farewell and then went directly back to the temple. She needed to tell this matter to the pope. Only if the pope saw the black clothed man personally could they tell the man\u2019s true identity. Only the pope had such power!</p><br/><p>As Liuxue Qing hurriedly left Hill mansion, nobody noticed anything unusual.</p><br/><p>Claire was surrounded by a group of people, all worriedly looking at the weak Claire on the bed.</p><br/><p>Ben stood outside the door, his head held low, not daring to enter. From time to time, he would receive some murderous gazes from the bedside.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m fine now. There\u2019s no need to blame him.\u201d Claire leaned on the bed post. Naturally, she had seen everybody glare at Ben every so often.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Just as Summer was about to say something angrily, she suddenly saw Leng Lingyun there and immediately said angrily, \u201cI already told you he\u2019s so violent. Now look, there\u2019s been an accident. He just can\u2019t control his strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! You\u2019re now wounded like this.\u201d Qiao Chuxin angrily turned to look towards the doorway at Ben.</p><br/><p>Ben drooped his head, not saying a word, allowing their attacks.</p><br/><p>Now Leng Lingyun noticed the ashen faced person at the door. The moment he saw him, he was shocked. This man emitted a dangerous aura from his entire body, terrifyingly strong. He seemed to not be human?! That\u2019s how Claire had been so wounded?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m already much better. Luckily, his highness appeared at the right time.\u201d Claire said gently, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if the divine prince didn\u2019t appear in time?\u201d Summer retorted angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I would have just been unconscious for a little longer.\u201d Claire knew it was only because she forced Ben out of control that Ben didn\u2019t control his strength at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Summer snorted, in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, your highness, what did you come to find me for?\u201d Claire turned and looked at Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should talk another day. You\u2019re so weak today, we\u2019ll talk once you\u2019ve recovered.\u201d Leng Lingyun said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, you should know how powerful your healing magic is. I don\u2019t have any big problems now.\u201d Claire smiled.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun hesitated, but still told his purpose for coming. \u201cI, I came to ask you about that morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire suddenly understood. She turned to everybody else and said, \u201cYou all should leave now, I\u2019m going to speak with his highness privately for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody had worried and unwilling expressions, but left under Claire\u2019s resolute gaze. Once they walked out the door, they saw Marquis Roger was about to go in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lord, Miss has some matters to speak with the divine prince privately.\u201d Jean stopped Marquis Roger from entering, neither servile nor overbearing.</p><br/><p>Marquis Roger looked at Claire who was leaning on the bedpost and Leng Lingyun sitting at the side. His lips moved, wanting to say something, but in the end, didn\u2019t say a word, turned, and left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The force that had repelled her was the exhibited the same pressure as she when she approached the barrier. It was the exact same as hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell is with this barrier?!\u201d Xi Shaoqi cursed. He bent down, picked up a rock, then threw it at the barrier. As they expected, just as the rock was about to touch the barrier, it was bounced back.</p><br/><p>There was no way out. No matter how much strength they used, it would all be bounced back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me try.\u201d With a wave of his hand, a giant blade of wind appeared in Feng Yixuan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Qi Aoshuang shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I attack with a force larger than the barrier can bear, then perhaps it won\u2019t be reflected and break the barrier instead.\u201d Feng Yixuan surmised. He was about to use all his strength to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if not?\u201d Qi Aoshuang asked quietly.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s heart shuddered. If not? Who could block Feng Yixuan\u2019s attack? Feng Yixuan\u2019s power was not insane. If he used all his strength to attack, perhaps no one would be able to block it, including himself.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan blinked. He experimentally slashed at the barrier. The reflected force made his jaw drop. Its speed and power was the exact same. Feng Yixuan immediately erected a barrier to dissipate the attack. Inwardly, he was sweating cold sweat. What if using all his strength didn\u2019t break the barrier?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Feng Yixuan sheathed his sword, a little gloomy. The thought of being killed by himself was a little depressing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, what are we going to do? Are we just going to stay stuck here?\u201d Xi Shaoqi glanced at the other people, then shivered. They were already dead, but they still continued what they did when they were alive. It was too creepy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, don\u2019t waste your brain. No matter what strength you use, you can\u2019t break this magic formation. If you want to die quickly, just attack the barrier. If you want to die slowly, just obediently stay inside, hahaha\u2026\u201d a sinister laugh came from outside of the barrier. It was definitely the person who had set up the barrier. Then the voice disappeared. He obviously thought there was no way they could break the barrier, so he left to stay somewhere else more comfortable. He thought that just after waiting, he would be able to collect their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck! You bastard!\u201d Xi Shaoqi cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you once we get out!\u201d Feng Yixuan gnashed his teeth.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun uttered in a low voice, \u201cI have never seen nor heard of such a magic formation spell. There is no record of it in the library of the Temple of Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, just because the Temple of Light doesn\u2019t know doesn\u2019t mean that no one else knows.\u201d Although Xi Shaoqi knew Leng Lingyun was on their side, he still couldn\u2019t help but be annoyed hearing the Temple of Light brought up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying you know then?\u201d Qi Aoshuang said coldly, shutting him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first rest. Standing here won\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s sit inside the inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone agreed. Xi Shaosi led the way to the inn, whereas Xi Shaoqi stubbornly attacked the barrier, but the result was still the same. It always reflected the attacks the way they had came. Although Xi Shaoqi was prepared for this, he was still unsatisfied. Everyone else simply ignored him.</p><br/><p>In the inn, there were no guests in the main hall. The owner continued to clean a cup behind the counter without stopping, while a waiter continued to wipe a table. The two\u2019s movements never stopped.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi shivered inwardly. He sat at the furthest table, swallowing, trying his best not to look at the undead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, I dislike this place\u2026\u201d Xi Shaoqi\u2019s voice carried a tremor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Qi Aoshuang looked out the window. Out on the streets, the sparse people continued to walk back and forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo break the spell, we must either forcefully shatter the barrier or kill the spellcaster.\u201d Leng Lingyun said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is only one choice then. The spellcaster is outside, so if we want to kill him, then we must leave. But we can\u2019t leave,\u201d Feng Yixuan said with annoyance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is, how did he cast this spell? This village is not big, but it\u2019s not small either. In the end, we only saw him. The barrier was also erected immediately after we entered.\u201d Qi Aoshuang frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven master would need us two or other people to assist him to erect such a barrier.\u201d Xi Shaosi stroked his chin. \u201cBut this barrier is so large. How did he create it by himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if he used a treasure?\u201d Xi Shaoqi blinked. He sat down and scooted towards Xi Shaosi. Every time he saw those two undead, he would shiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cA treasure?\u201d Everyone looked at Xi Shaoqi.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a guess.\u201d Xi Shaoqi shrugged.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Aoshuang thought of something. \u201cDo you guys remember how the barrier appeared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething flashed overhead, and then the barrier formed,\u201d Feng Yixuan answered, recalling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich direction?\u201d Qi Aoshuang pressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich direction? Yes, it did seem to spread from a center.\u201d Everyone was impressed that Feng Yixuan was able to see everything so clearly that short moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Qi Aoshuang stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Everyone asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe center of the village.\u201d Qi Aoshuang was excited. The people of this world did not know, but she did. There was a certain kind of magic that required a spiritual Eye. If Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t see wrong and her guess was correct, then the huge barrier had an Eye in the center of the town. It was the key to break the spell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe center of the village is the lake. At the bottom is a spring,\u201d Xi Shaosi said. He was confused. What could Qi Aoshuang be thinking? What was there? It was just water, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust follow along, the words of my wife are truth!\u201d Feng Yixuan glanced sideways. Xi Shaosi remained silent, rolling his eyes.</p><br/><p>Currently, Qi Aoshuang wasn\u2019t in the mood to slap Feng Yixuan. Instead, she hurried along to the center.</p><br/><p>As Xi Shaosi said, the center of the village was indeed just a small lake. Along the shore grew a few plants they had never seen before, lush and green. Steps built of stone were around the lake, making it easier for people to go down and fetch water.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with the lake?\u201d Xi Shaosi frowned, unable to see anything out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang did not respond. Instead, she sat down and closed her eyes, concentrating on sensing underwater. Feng Yixuan followed suit, also sensing underwater.</p><br/><p>Just when Xi Shaoqi was about to ask what they were doing, Leng Lingyun motioned for him to stop, to be quiet.</p><br/><p>As expected!</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>There was indeed something in the lake. In the depths, there was a faint magic ripple coming from something.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang withdrew her consciousness, then opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan also opened his eyes. Before Qi Aoshuang could speak, Feng Yixuan frowned and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bright, circular object that seems to be emitting a slight magic ripple. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to the magic formation spell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was shocked. Feng Yixuan was actually able to know the appearance of the object. She hadn\u2019t be able to see it, only sensing the ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Really?\u201d Xi Shaoqi was doubtful. \u201cIsn\u2019t it related to the person outside? What does it have to do with something that\u2019s inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps the disk is the spiritual Eye of the magic formation,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual Eye? What\u2019s that?\u201d Xi Shaoqi asked. This time, it was not he that was confused, everyone else didn\u2019t know either.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe core of a high level magic formation, like the heart of a person.\u201d Qi Aoshuang could not explain it in any other way.</p><br/><p>They understood vaguely.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, how did you know?\u201d Xi Shaosi suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Qi Aoshuang with a complex expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to know?\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled prettily.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xi Shaoqi felt a chill down his spine. He knew that every time Claire smiled like that, someone was going to suffer. He would bet his life that her next words would be, because you want to know, I won\u2019t tell you. Too nasty, too too nasty. It was best if he didn\u2019t ask. If she wanted to tell him, then she would.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, what do we do now?\u201d Xi Shaoqi was not focused on why Qi Aoshuang, but rather how they could leave this creepy place.</p><br/><p>Wait until it is night. At night, we will fish out that object. If the spellcaster sees us go underwater, he might do something. At night, he will loosen up.\u201d Qi Aoshuang replied.</p><hr/><br/><p>\u00a0</p><hr/><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he is watching us right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun walked forward. His hand flashed with white light. \u201cThe water is not poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you care if the water is poisonous? I definitely won\u2019t drink the water here.\u201d Xi Shaoqi looked at the water with revulsion.</p><br/><p>But Qi Aoshuang ordered, \u201cGo get some water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Whyyy? My lady, don\u2019t you have enough water in your storage ring?\u201d Qi Aoshuang howled, feeling wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool! Just pretend. If he sees us here, he\u2019ll be suspicious why we\u2019re here.\u201d Feng Yixuan crossed his arms.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi dejectedly filled his water pouch with some water. Xi Shaosi followed suit.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s guess was indeed correct. The strange spellcaster was indeed watching them through a crystal ball. When he saw everyone around the lake, his heart tightened, but when he saw Leng Lingyun test the water for poison and the others get water, he relaxed. He put away the crystal and readjusted his posture for sleep. Of course, who would guess that the key to the magic formation was under the lake. Their captain was too cautious. Even though one of them was said to have killed twelve cardinals, compared to their organization, the Temple of Light was nothing. He alone was enough to kill them all!</p><br/><p>At night, the temperature started the drop, the moonlight a haze.</p><br/><p>The people on the streets continued what they did during the day, walking back and forth.</p><br/><p>Now, they walked to the center of the village, draped in mantles.</p><br/><p>At the lakeside, Qi Aoshuang turned to Xi Shaoqi. \u201cGo down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?! Nooo why is it me again!\u201d Xi Shaoqi protested in a low voice.</p><br/><p>But Qi Aoshuang\u2019s words stopped him. \u201cBecause you are the one who wants to leave here the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo fair, it\u2019s so cold, you want me, a weak bodied magician to go down? Are you trying to kill me?\u201d Xi Shaoqi wailed, walking towards the pond.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Qi Aoshuang ordered coldly, then flicked her finger.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi crouched down subconsciously, but the pain he was expecting did not come. Instead, he was filled with warmth. Only then did he look down at his body to see that he was wrapped in a faint, golden barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo down quickly. In a while, the barrier will disappear,\u201d Qi Aoshuang pressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do anything for you, my lady. You are the most kind hearted person in the world.\u201d Xi Shaosi stood up, entering the water without another word.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaosi stood at the shore, his lip twitching. What an idiot! Giving him a barrier was normal, but he acted as if it were a favor from a god.</p><br/><p>As Xi Shaoqi descended into the water, much to his delight, the water didn\u2019t touch him. Recalling Qi Aoshuang\u2019s warning, Xi Shaoqi knew that there was a time limit, so he dove in quickly.</p><br/><p>The lake was not deep, so Xi Shaoqi soon felt the slight force of the spring. A round, shiny disk appeared within his line of sight. Approaching slowly, he felt the magic ripple. What was this? The something-eye?</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to reach out and touch it, he suddenly remembered Qi Aoshuang\u2019s warning, so he hastily withdrew his hand and swam up, deciding to first report to Qi Aoshuang before doing anything.</p><br/><p>Above water, everyone was waiting. \u201cSo?\u201d Qi Aoshuang walked up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bright, round disk emitting a slight magic ripple. I didn\u2019t touch it,\u201d Xi Shaoqi reported.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded. \u201cThat should be it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, what do we do now?\u201d Xi Shaoqi looked down to see the barrier gradually disappear. He blinked. He wanted to leave as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go down and look. You guys wait up here.\u201d With a flick of her finger, a thin, golden layer wrapped around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Feng Yixuan approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Qi Aoshuang shook her head. \u201cYou guys will alls stay here. You are all magicians. Your bodies don\u2019t have enough strength to sustain if we are down there for too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once she said this, everyone realized that indeed, Qi Aoshuang was the only magician warrior among them, able to use both magic and Dou Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d Feng Yixuan wanted to say something, but then Qi Aoshuang raised her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help me either. It\u2019s better if you stay up here as reinforcement. Do you know what a spiritual eyes is?\u201d Feng Yixuan could not respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Breaking the spell will take time. Just stay up here.\u201d Then, Qi Aoshuang went underwater.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood at the edge of the lake, worriedly looked into the water.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang dove down following the magic ripple. Indeed, there was the small, crystal disk. Only when she swam close did she see it clearly. It was only as big as an infant\u2019s palm and was spinning slowly. The top side smooth like a mirror, made of crystal, and the back was made of copper, carved of mysterious, ancient runes.</p><br/><p>Should she take it? But how?</p><br/><p>She pondered for a moment. In the end, she reached out and touched the crystal disk.</p><br/><p>As soon as her fingers brushed the disk, the scene before her changed!</p><br/><p>Before Qi Aoshuang was an endless beach. The sea was dried up, not a drop left. Many colorful shells dotted the landscape.</p><br/><p>Swish\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang whipped around alertly at the slight noise, only to see a face that was exactly like hers.</p><br/><p>She took two steps back.</p><br/><p>Illusion?</p><br/><p>Strangely, they too also took two steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d The other person frowned and asked Qi Aoshuang. Her voice was also exactly like hers!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was shocked. It was the exact question she was going to ask.</p><br/><p>She watched quietly watched the person before her whose appearance and even dress were the same as hers. Even their expression was the same, it was like looking into a mirror.</p><br/><p>Their expression darkened. Her ice cold expression was so familiar. Her thin lips spat out disdainfully, \u201cIllusion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Qi Aoshuang could act, a giant sword of golden flames appeared in her hand! The pressure of the sword Qi made Qi Aoshuang shocked! She quickly dodged as the sword struck past. A green thread fluttered to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d They sneered seeing Qi Aoshuang dodge the attack, then brandished the sword again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Qi Aoshuang once again agilely dodged the attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire Hill!\u201d The other person continued to attack. \u201cI must quickly destroy this illusion, they\u2019re waiting for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, \u201cClaire\u2019s\u201d eyes widened. Blood trickled out of her mouth. She stared at Qi Aoshuang\u2019s cold face incredulously. Her body had been impaled by Qi Aoshuang\u2019s sword. The blood continued to flow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The so called \u201cClaire\u2019s\u201d eyes were wide. She didn\u2019t understand why she had been killed. She had copied everything, how had she been killed so easily?</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, the name Claire died along with Mother. Second, you talk too much.\u201d Qi Aoshuang pulled out her sword, smiling coldly. Claire Hill\u2026 this name was gone the moment Katherine died. Was this the power of the treasure? Able to create a barrier that could reflect all attacks, and able to copy a person to stop them from taking it when they touched it? But it seems this treasure had not seen deeply enough. She was no longer called \u201cClaire Hill\u201d!</p><br/><p>The next moment, \u201cClaire\u201d disappeared. The blood on the ground disappeared along with the blood on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s sword. The dried up seabed was suddenly overflowing with azure seawater. Wave after wave crashed onto the shore.</p><br/><p>On the beach, a little girl in a white dress appeared, smiling brightly at Claire.</p><br/><p>Before Qi Aoshuang could realize what was happening, everything before her disappeared. The dark blue sea, the beach littered with colorful shells, and the smiling little girl all disappeared.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aoshuang returned to her senses, she looked down to see that she was holding the small, round disk.</p><br/><p>The four people above ground looked up at the sky in awe.</p><br/><p>The barrier gradually faded, and then disappeared.</p><br/><p>The spell was broken!</p><br/><p>The weird man suddenly woke up, his face pale, then green, then black!</p><br/><p>The spell was broken!</p><br/><p>And his treasure, the Rainbow Inkstone, had changed owners!</p><br/><p>Damn it all! How could the Rainbow Inkstone have changed owners just now! He could not sense her presence at all now.</p><br/><p>Who? Who was it that was able to make the Rainbow Inkstone acknowledge them as her master?! The strange person pulled his hair, wanting to how at the sky, but afraid to catch the attention of person who had broken the spell. He definitely was not their match if they worked together! It seems he had underestimated them!</p><br/><p>The strange man was regretting so much, his heart hurt. If he had known how strong they were, he would have listened to the captain and worked with everyone else. That way, he wouldn\u2019t have failed and even lost his precious treasure without even killing a single person.</p><br/><p>Damn it all!</p><br/><p>The strange person was extremely angered, but he stood up and left wisely. He needed to tell the captain what had happened. He had to get the Rainbow Inkstone back!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

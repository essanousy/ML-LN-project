After finding the pope, she set up a magic barrier in the study, making him confused. Only after the pope finished hearing Lixue Qing did he understand why she was so serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you saw correctly?\u201d The pope asked seriously. She was Cliff\u2019s disciple and also someone from the Hill clan, and recently rose in the capital. But even so, there was no way she could summer a grand, three headed dragon!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, I promise I saw correctly. The furry meatball that I saw Claire with today was the little animal that was crouching on the back of the black dragon that day. I know it seems outlandish, with Claire\u2019s strength, there\u2019s now way for her to summon a dragon, not to mention order one to do something so shameless. But, I promise, the little animal I saw today in her embrace was the once crouching on the black dragon\u2019s back that day.\u201d Liuxue Qing frowned, exceptionally serious.</p><br/><p>The pope fell silent, not sure. The reason why Liuxue Qing was able to become the divine princess wasn\u2019t because of her appearance or elegance, but because of her undeniable strength. Illusions didn\u2019t work on her because of exceptional senses and strong fighting power.</p><br/><p>If Liuxue Qing didn\u2019t see wrong, then was that girl from the Hill can able to summon a dragon then order him? He had personally seen the dragon that day, it was definitely real. And he definitely felt the despicable dragon\u2019s spit.</p><br/><p>If it was really related to Claire, then he would have to take time to think about it. But that didn\u2019t mean he was going to let her go easily! Actually daring the steal the goddess\u2019s gift! Humph! No matter who it was, they would all receive due punishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Don\u2019t publicize this information for now. I\u2019ll leave it to you to investigate. You know her so investigating should be relatively easy. If she really stole the goddess\u2019s gift, she will definitely receive due punishment. Even the emperor won\u2019t be able to shield her!\u201d The pope said coldly, immediately improving Liuxue Qing\u2019s mood.</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing suppressed her urge to laugh and said to the pope solemnly, \u201cYou holiness, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely investigate and report everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You may leave now.\u201d The pope nodded.</p><br/><p>Not long after Liuxue Qing left, there was a quiet knock at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Naturally, the pope could tell from the footsteps who it was. It was the Temple of Light\u2019s highest clairvoyant, L\u2019Or\u00e9al.</p><br/><p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al had always had strange eyes and piercing green hair. She opened the softly and said concisely, \u201cThe person the goddess is looking for is in the capital. The anomaly in the sky was caused by that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d The pope stood up swiftly. When the divine prince, Leng Lingyun, went to Yowusali, he didn\u2019t find any clues, but now they were actually in the capital again?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe divine prince and princess were both there in the early morning when the anomaly happened, it should be easy to get an answer if we ask them.\u201d L\u2019Or\u00e9al voice was incomparably empty, devoid of emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Thank you for your trouble.\u201d The pope was always very polite to L\u2019Or\u00e9al because she was the equivalent of the goddess\u2019s eyes and mouth and had always passed on the goddess\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cI well take my leave.\u201d L\u2019Or\u00e9al said concisely and slowly withdrew.</p><br/><p>The pope let out a sigh of relief. They hadn\u2019t been able to find any clues about the person the person the goddess was looking for after all this time. He was even a little afraid the goddess might lose her patience and blame them for not working hard enough. Now there was finally progress, how could he not let out a sigh?</p><br/><p>Soon, Leng Lingyun arrived at the study.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, were you looking for me?\u201d Leng Lingyun said, neither servile nor overbearing.</p><br/><p>The pope looked at the person standing before him and felt somewhat regretful. This outstanding young man didn\u2019t work wholeheartedly for the Temple of Light because he believed in the goddess, but because of his little sister.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The pope recollected his thoughts, stood up, and slowly approached Leng Lingyun, saying, \u201cLingyun, I have always treated you as my own child. I saw you when you entered the Temple of Light, saw your each and every step of progression to this level. I hope you will live up to my expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun knows and won\u2019t fail to live up to your holiness\u2019s expectations.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s tone of voice still hadn\u2019t changed.</p><br/><p>The pope sighed internally. As expected, this child still didn\u2019t open his heart to others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the anomaly happened outside the city walls in the early morning, you were there. Can you tell me in detail what exactly happened?\u201d The pope turned to the main topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it was early morning and I was heading to the city gates, I saw the dark clouds cover the sky, thunder and lightning booming\u2026.\u201d Leng Lingyun started saying in detail, including that Claire had almost been murdered, but held back the matter of the earth spikes suddenly changing in direction</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying Claire Hill was also there?\u201d The pope frowned slightly, wanting to say something, but couldn\u2019t. How was that girl also involved? Coincidence?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Leng Lingyun saw the pope\u2019s expression change and wanted to ask something, but resisted in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else, you can take your leave. Investigate what exactly caused the anomaly.\u201d The pope ordered, still frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Leng Lingyun left the room, leaving the pope to ponder in the study alone.</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s house:</p><br/><p>When Claire woke up, it was already night time. Summer came to get Claire to wake up and eat dinner. Qiao Chuxin, that shy and pretty girl, was smiling widely and seemed to getting along with everybody else pretty well. When she saw Claire and Summer enter, she immediately got up to greet them.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, today, big sister Summer bought me so many things.\u201d Qiao Chuxin said happily.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Claire saw that Qiao Chuxin looked like a new person. Clothes make the man, as the saying goes. Currently, Qiao Chuxin was lovely, wearing fitting pink clothes and gotten a brand new, pretty case for the bow that was on her back before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still carry your bow when you\u2019re eating?\u201d Claire sat down and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mother has said if the bow is there, the person is here. If the bow isn\u2019t there, then there\u2019s no need for a person.\u201d Qiao Chuxin replied seriously.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded. As a fighter, she understood this kind of mentality.</p><br/><p>After everybody ate, Summer suggested that they stroll around the most flourishing night market of the capital.</p><br/><p>Claire glanced at the eager Qiao Chuxin and nodded, agreeing. Qiao Chuxing and Summer cheered.</p><br/><p>Little did they know, this stroll would bring them an unexpected encounter.</p><br/><p>As night fell, the capital bustled with activity.</p><br/><p>The noisy downtown area had lights brightening each street.</p><br/><p>Summer and Qiao Chuxin were at the front, excitedly look at this, touching that. Jean and Ben silently followed Claire from behind. Pitiful Walter had to stay with Camille at home. If he didn\u2019t pay attention for even just one second, his Dark aura would be discovered. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t appear at the crowded downtown area.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, buy me this.\u201d Summer pointed at some ornaments displayed by a peddler on the side of the road.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake anything you guys like.\u201d Claire replied nonchalantly. Claire had no interest in the ornaments for little girls.</p><br/><p>Summer and Qiao Chuxin happily chose what they liked, grabbing anything they took a liking to, and the Claire would pay.</p><br/><p>The bustling streets make Qiao Chuxin\u2019s eyes wide. She had never seen such a lively night.</p><br/><p>Amidst the crowd, a gaze landed on Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, it\u2019s that little girl again.\u201d It was the mysterious golden haired, blue eyed woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe keep on crossing paths.\u201d The golden haired, blue eyed man laughed quietly. Suddenly, expression changed greatly, because he felt the bronzeware vibrate in the bag!What did this mean? It meant that the pearl that had originally been part of the bronzeware was close, developing a resonance between the two!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, what is it?\u201d The golden haired, blue eyed girl frowned slightly. Naturally, she discovered the man\u2019s strange response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Azure Pearl is close by!\u201d The man said with a low voice, very certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The blonde woman said exclaimed quietly, surprised. \u201cClose by? Elder brother, are you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. The Azure Ripple is vibrating, he can feel the Azure Pearl is nearby.\u201d The blonde man\u2019s expression started to become anxious, then he looked in all directions. But it was so crowded, where could he find the Azure Pearl?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the blonde man\u2019s expression changed again, because he saw clearly that a girl pull out an ordinary looking pearl clearly, and the pearl was vibrating!</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, how strange. The pearl seems like it\u2019s having spasms, it keeps on vibrating.\u201d Summer didn\u2019t understand why the pearl had been vibrating her bag continuously and had taken it out to give it to Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire looked suspiciously at the pearl in her hand and starting pondering. The pearl was vibrating for no reason? It seemed like it was resonating with something.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Claire felt two burning gazes on her. She looked up instantly and saw a man and women who looked similar to each other staring fiercely at her from within the crowd, or to be more accurate, staring fiercely at the pearl in her hand! And the woman gave Claire a familiar feeling. That pair of eyes\u2026.Ah! She remembered, it was the assassin from that night who could have killed her but didn\u2019t and also the woman who she had bumped into after stealing the goddess\u2019s gift.</p><br/><p>What relation did they have with this pearl? Claire withdrew her gaze, looking at the pearl in her hand. She thought about the two\u2019s intense stare, then realized something.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this pearl wasn\u2019t as simple as it seemed.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Summer\u2019s puzzled voice called Claire, making her come back to her senses.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The mere sound of her voice would almost give one goosebumps. She rushed forward, running after a disappearing figure. The figure was tall and thin, with long, flowy maroon hair that could capture one\u2019s heart. He gave no indication to stop or look back. Although his decision was perfectly clear, the girl behind him continued to chase.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the pretty girl increased her pace, concern written all over her face. Following behind her was a handsome man in black. His breathing was controlled and his steps were steady. A long sword was strapped to his waist. He followed the girl without emotion, seeming cold and aloof.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, stop the second prince! Hurry! He\u2019s about to leave.\u201d The pretty girl stopped walking, livid, and stamped her feet at the young man behind her. \u201cAre you blind.?Can\u2019t you see he\u2019s about to leave?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, my duty is only to protect you,\u201d the handsome young man replied quietly with an attitude that was neither respectful nor overbearing. In the depths of his eyes were loathing and disdain, but of course the girl didn\u2019t see it. His meaning was very clear: my job is to protect you, not to help you chase men.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d The girl\u2019s complexion darkened with fury and she stamped her foot while shouting angrily, \u201cYou dare disobey my order! Just wait until I tell Grandfather! You\u2019re supposed to be my knight, but you actually have such an arrogant attitude!\u201d After spitting out these words, the girl lifted up her skirt hem to run after the second prince again.</p><br/><p>Jean followed coldly without a word. This kind of farce happened often. Every time the foolish young girl met a handsome man, she would buzz around them like a bee seeing fresh flowers, always buzzing and never stopping, annoying the men so much it became unbearable. The second prince had already been bothered many times. This time, he was only trying to visit the duke but tragically, he bumped into the lady. Seeing the hurriedly escaping second prince, Jean felt sympathy.</p><br/><p>The second prince rushed out the entrance, jumped in the carriage and told the coachman to return to the palace. The coachman was confused by the second prince\u2019s haste, but then he saw the blonde girl giving chase and understood immediately. So it was the Hill family\u2019s male-chaser! Although this male-loving lady from the Hill family was not favored, she was still the granddaughter of Duke Hill. The coachman understood that naturally, the second prince would not be impolite to the lady for fear of offending the Duke Hill, so he quickly whipped the horses for the carriage to start moving. The pretty girl ran to the entrance, only to see the carriage already leaving. She got so mad, her face was red and her whole body was shaking. As a chamberlain who happened to be leading a horse passed by, she grabbed the whip out of his hands, got on the horse, and cracked the whip to pursue.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Jean\u2019s expressionless face flickered. This obstinate, male-chasing lady, did she forget that she doesn\u2019t know how to ride?! Can chasing men unlock hidden talents? Jean humphed coldly. Although he looked down on her, he still had to ensure her safety, so he prepared to run after her. He looked for a horse, but there were no more at the entrance. Meanwhile, the lady\u2019s figure became smaller and smaller.</p><br/><p>The servants at the gate watched, stunned. Who knew that this male-chasing, incapable Miss could release such potential for the sake of chasing men! As a member of the Hill family, she had completely shamed her family name. With absolutely no horsemanship and a great hatred of studying \u2013 in short, she knew nothing that she should. This was also why Duke Hill disliked her.</p><br/><p>Just when Jean frowned and was about to use Dou Qi to catch up, the male-chasing, headstrong young girl was thrown off the horse. As she cried out, her petite frame fell onto the ground. By now, the second prince\u2019s carriage already had been long gone.</p><br/><p>Jean frowned and caught up to the girl on the ground. Looking at the unconscious Miss, Jean frowned even more. This time, it was his mistake. Never would he have even imagined that the lady would make such a senseless decision.</p><br/><p>After the Miss was escorted back to the castle, everything become chaotic. Her grandfather, Duke Gordan Hill wasn\u2019t at home, nor was her father. Her mother was the only one present.</p><br/><p>In a magnificent bedroom, on a huge gold gilded, luxurious poster bed with soft, thick bedding, the young girl lay, still unconscious and pale. A golden haired, beautiful woman sat next to the bed, worry etched on her face. The similar features of the two illustrated that the beautiful woman was the girl\u2019s mother, Katherine Hill. Contrary from her foolish, obstinate daughter, Katherine was a kind and virtuous woman instead. Anxious over the girl on the bed, she felt resigned. This daughter of hers, no one in the family liked her, not even her father, grandfather or even her brother; they all didn\u2019t like her very much. It was all because of her personality. No one knew whose attitude her\u2019s resembled.</p><br/><p>A doctor went over promptly, and after a careful examination, concluded that the young lady was fine. They only needed to wait for her to wake up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam, it was my fault for not protecting the Miss, putting her in this kind of a situation,\u201d Jean confessed. He lowered his head, standing aside while saying in a low tone for forgiveness, \u201cI accept any punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Jean.\u201d Katherine smiled and shook her head, resignation in her voice. \u201cI understand this child\u2019s personality. It was not your fault. You may leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan hesitated for a moment, but bowed his head and left. Only Katherine remained in the room.</p><br/><p>In the evening, the girl on the bed slowly moved her fingers, seemingly about to awaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Katherine, who had been staying next to her all this time, cried her name out joyfully, grabbing the hand of the girl on the bed.</p><br/><p>The girl on the bed slowly opened her eyes but didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, how do you feel? Let me see,\u201d Katherine asked eagerly as she happily supported the girl up.</p><br/><p>But the person on the bed still didn\u2019t speak. Katherine hugged her with small sobs. No one was willing to visit Claire, her darling child, even though she was knocked unconscious in an accident. Not even her grandfather, father, or brother after arriving home, visited her once. The unjust treatment pained her.</p><br/><p>The pretty blonde girl on the bed opened her eyes, looked coldly at her surroundings. For a moment, her eyes showed a sliver of confusion but disappeared quickly, replaced by a cold, profound look.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, how do you feel? Dizzy? Hungry?\u201d Kathleen asked, concerned, while suppressing tears.</p><br/><p>The young girl looked at her reflection in the beautiful woman\u2019s irises, immediately understanding. She replied quietly, \u201cYes, I am a bit hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, Claire, just a moment, I\u2019ll call people to send food.\u201d Katherine, delighted, stood up quickly but wobbled because she had sat too long. Immediately, a force propped up her elbow so she wouldn\u2019t fall. Katherine looked back and saw Claire\u2019s peaceful face. Was it Claire? The thought passed briefly through her mind but she thought nothing of it. She hastened out the door to the waiting maids.</p><br/><p>The young girl on the bed looked around slowly, taking in the unfamiliar surroundings, squinting, her eyes cold and piercing. She smirked ever so slightly, almost unnoticeably. It was a truly cold look.</p><br/><p>It seems I\u2019m truly dead and my soul has traveled to this foreign world. Based on these elaborate decorations, my new family is both rich and powerful.</p><br/><p>Claire Hill. Was this the name of the previous owner of the body? The person on the bed with cold eyes massaged her temples gently. Her head hurt so much it felt like it would split while the past memories of the body began to combine with her own.</p><br/><p>The more memories surfaced, the stranger her facial expression became, because the memories had such limited information. Most were memories of beautiful men, all chaotic and useless. The only useful piece of information was that her family seemed to be very prominent in its country.</p><br/><p>The young lady\u2019s eyes became slits as she let out a long breath.</p><br/><p>Claire Hill. The lady lowered her head slowly. This will be my name from now on.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

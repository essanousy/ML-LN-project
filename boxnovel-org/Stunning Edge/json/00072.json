What is it?\u201d Summer, that little girl, had left with Ben in the early morning. They said they were going to stroll around and buy some tasty things and then come back. Now she had such an excited tone, perhaps she had bought something tasty?</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this, haha.\u201d Summer quickly rushed up to Claire and pulled out a pearl about the size of an egg and waved it in front of Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire squinted, not caring. She said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this just a pearl? It\u2019s just bigger than other pearls, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s mysterious isn\u2019t this!\u201d As a thief, Summer had naturally seen many treasures, but now she pulled Claire up excitedly and then ran to her room, leaving Ben and Jean behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so mysterious?\u201d Claire still held a teacup in her hand as she asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, just come and you\u2019ll know.\u201d Summer hurriedly dragged Claire into the room, drew the curtains, and closed the door tightly. Now she pulled out the pearl.</p><br/><p>Claire sipped some tea absentmindedly, looking at the pearl. The pearl slowly radiated light in the dim room.</p><br/><p>Bright Moon Pearl? Claire started to become a little shocked.</p><br/><p>Summer looked at the pearl in her hand and said happily, \u201cAwesome, right? The darker it is, the brighter it becomes. At night, it can be used as a light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get it?\u201d Of course Claire didn\u2019t believe that Summer would spend money to buy such an expensive thing.</p><br/><p>Summer put the pearl away and swung her hips, saying cockily, \u201cI grabbed it in passing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was so unlucky?\u201d Claire blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boss of the Red Light auction house.\u201d Summer said, proud of herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cPffft~~\u201d Claire spit, spraying gorgeously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fat guy actually carried around such a good thing.\u201d Summer was still cocky. Summer looked at Claire\u2019s doubting expression and said, \u201cWhat? What\u2019s so strange about this thing? It is a bit weird though, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen a pearl that can glow in the dark. In the beginning I thought it was just an average pearl.\u201d Summer said to herself.</p><br/><p>Claire started to have a little cold sweat. \u201cSummer, how can you steal like this? Do you know that two days later, the Red Light auction house is going to auction off three one of a kind treasures? One of them is a precious pearl that can radiate light in the night. It can be said that this time the auction is the focus of tens of thousands of people, the tickets hard to get even with a thousand gold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, then what about the other two?\u201d Summer became interested, questioning closely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still two others that\u2026\u201d Claire thought back.</p><br/><p>What Claire and Summer didn\u2019t know at this point in time was that this precious pearl would give them much danger and fortuitous encounters.</p><br/><p>Claire and Summer discussed together for a very long time. Finally, Claire told Summer, \u201cRemember, the pearl cannot be shown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, haha. I will safeguard it well.\u201d Summer put away the pearl, and then became excited again as she said, \u201cCan we go see the auction? You definitely have a way. Claire, bring me to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the eager looking Summer and started smiling. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll find my Grandfather to get some tickets to go watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, finding your Grandfather is ok. If you said you would find your disgraceful Father, then forget it, I would rather not go.\u201d Summer said, her lip curled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Claire handed over the cup in her hand to Summer. \u201cMaster Emery said before to find him if I have any business. Grandfather made it clear he will satisfy my requests. Getting a few tickets should be easy to Grandfather.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s good.\u201d Summer happily said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink of a way to deal with the pearl, otherwise if other people recognize it, there\u2019ll be trouble.\u201d Claire thought deeply, stroking her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst find sir Cliff to get some of that dye, it\u2019s very well made. No one else can recognize you after, and then we\u2019ll put on a layer of that cheap, shiny powder.\u201d Summer giggled. \u201cI use that kind of method a lot. Everyone else all think it\u2019s a cheap item.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. In a moment, I\u2019ll first let Jean go find my Grandfather and get some tickets, then find Master.\u201d Speaking of this, Claire\u2019s heart tightened. This was because ever since Cliff came back, he shut himself in the Magician Council and didn\u2019t come out. Cliff wanted to advance into a Sorcerer as soon as possible. That was also for her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a while, go find Jean, tell him and Ben to help you work, I\u2019ll first go back to my room. Don\u2019t come and bother me. I\u2019m going to be meditating; recently I\u2019ve been slacking off a lot.\u201d Claire thought of how hard Cliff was working. She definitely couldn\u2019t continue ignoring it. Last time, she had already broken through from the second level of the Treasured Lotus Style, so now she should look at the third level.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, alright. You should meditate without worry, haha, become a grand wizard quicker, and then wizard sage, then sorcerer, that way I can really walk sideways.\u201d Summer smiled widely.</p><br/><p>Claire laughed helplessly. This girl\u2019s ideal really was\u2026</p><br/><p>Arriving back at her room, Claire put on a magic barrier and pulled out the Treasured Lotus Style. At this moment, Walter said, \u201cClaire, why can you understand the words on the book?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t answer and shot back a question instead. \u201cWalter, do you think I\u2019m like an idiotic man-chaser?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not if you seem like it or not, but that you\u2019re basically not one at all.\u201d Walter replied certainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s fine. Go and stay over there quietly, don\u2019t bother me.\u201d Claire waved her hand impatiently, indicating for Walter to go away.</p><br/><p>Walter floated over to the side, his brows furrowed tightly, pondering about Claire\u2019s words. Ever since he had been with Claire, he had always heard the surrounding people say she was some kind of man-chaser, idiot, and useless guy. But this little devil was wicked, two-faced, faked kindness, sinister, despicable, and shameless. She was a magic warrior, and currently already advanced into the wizard level, her flames also a strange golden color. Such a person could also be a man-chasing idiot? Was it that Claire had meticulously hid her strength before?</p><br/><p>From the side, Walter was thinking so much his head was about to explode, but still couldn\u2019t think of a reason.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Claire was training the lotus flower power nearby and trying infusing it with the book. The words on the book were like ants as they slowly started flowing, the lines intertwining, changing the words. Gradually, the words on the book all turned into the contents of the second level.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t think much of it and started reading it carefully, frowning while reading. When Claire had accomplished the second level of the Treasured Lotus Style, she had suffered tribulation lightning because she had produced a golden lotus core, which was also that big golden lotus that had suddenly appeared. If she didn\u2019t produce the golden lotus core, then she wouldn\u2019t have suffered tribulation lightning. On the book, it had been written that people who had given birth to a golden lotus heart were very few. The most important point was that the personality of the golden lotus heart would be greatly influenced by the cultivator\u2019s personality. In other words, chickens give birth to chickens, ducks give birth to ducks, and the host\u2019s personality would give birth to type of personality of the golden lotus core.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at this and felt a bit awkward. She asked herself, her personality wasn\u2019t that bad, was it? That time, before the god of Darkness descended, that golden lotus seemed to have cussed some profanity, saying something like f*ck, there\u2019s going to be someone who\u2019ll save you, what do I need to come out for? Waste of time. It was like this, right? In other words, that golden lotus core was something that she had given birth to? Pah! Claire immediately spit. What kinds of words was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, what are you going pah about? Of course you gave birth to me.\u201d Suddenly during that moment, an abrupt voice sounded in Claire\u2019s mind. Claire was shocked, the book in her hand dropping to the floor. Last time, the situation was too hurried, that\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t heard the voice clearly, but now, she heard it clearly. It was a young but arrogant voice.</p><br/><p>Ma??? Claire opened her mouth wide, and then reached out her hand, silently pointing at her own nose. Are you calling for me?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am calling you.\u201d That young voice snorted, \u201cThat vulgar guy called Walter always is stubbornly speaking nonsense with you, that why I wasn\u2019t willing to come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, can you give me an explanation for what on earth is going on?\u201d Claire asked awkwardly. \u201cAlso, can you change how you address me? Even though your birth is perhaps related to me, but, this address doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Ma. Listen to me. The second level of the Treasured Lotus Style is the most crucial point. If at that time I wasn\u2019t born from you, then even if you completely cultivated this arcanum to the tenth level, you still wouldn\u2019t advance to the level of a sorcerer and also wouldn\u2019t be able to comprehend the higher levels of the mental cultivating method.\u201d Golden Lotus\u2019s young voice was exceptionally severe. \u201cDo you remember the twelve flower petals on your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire nodded, and then said helplessly, \u201cCan you not emphasize the matter of your birth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Golden Lotus didn\u2019t hear Claire\u2019s protest, and continued to say, \u201cThe moment when you were in danger and comprehended the second level, you gave birth to me smoothly. That\u2019s why the tribulation lightning came. But I don\u2019t care about that little bit of lightning. Only after giving birth to me can you learn the levels past the tenth level, the eleventh and twelfth level. Once that happens, all the flower petals on your back will unfurl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of existence are you?\u201d Claire asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, the question you asked is really stupid, you gave birth to me, so what do you think?\u201d Golden Lotus said somewhat disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you just born?\u201d Claire asked in a bad mood. If this guy was a child, they would definitely be a disobedient child! Not cute at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Walter or whatever, looking at him makes me uncomfortable. Ma, get him a body as fast as possible. If he\u2019s here, I\u2019ll only come out if you\u2019re in danger.\u201d Golden Lotus snorted, and then went silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus? Golden Lotus?\u201d No matter how Claire called, Golden Lotus didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Walter asked as he floated over, not understanding. \u201cThere\u2019s something off with your complexion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked up and glanced at Walter. Seeing her stare, Walter\u2019s hairs stood on end. He didn\u2019t know how much at a loss Claire was mentally. How could she not be at a loss? Suddenly, another strange thing appeared in her mind, calling her Ma!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Walter called out in surprise, \u201cAh, Claire, White Emperor woke up.\u201d seeing White Emperor\u2019s claw, who Claire had put next to the pillow, move slightly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Don\u2019t you remember when we first met? That\u2019s the real you. \u201cYou won\u2019t disappear. I won\u2019t let you disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang only had a desolate look on her face. Her eyes dimmed and she slowly raised her head to look at Feng Yi Xuan with a sad smile. \u201cLike fire, you will eventually return with her \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I am not fire, I am wind Yi Xuan, your wind Yi Xuan. From the beginning until now, I have never changed my mind! \u201cNot in the future.\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart ached as he looked at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s desolate face. His heart hurt so much that he almost couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><br/><p>The man in white looked at the scene in front of him quietly, his eyes full of complicated emotions. As for the others, they were all extremely shocked, not knowing what to say.</p><br/><p>Lily held onto the corner of Jin Yan\u2019s clothes tightly, bitterness in her eyes. At this moment, her heart was filled with intense sorrow. Originally, she was very envious of Qi Ao Shuang, but now, she only felt deep sympathy for Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Something is calling me from the depths of the ocean.\u201d \u201cRetrieve the power, and it will all be over.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t allow it!\u201d Feng Yixuan shook his head fiercely, hugging Qi Ao Shuang even tighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t allow it, if you don\u2019t do it, sooner or later it will happen. Your memories and those of ice will slowly recover. If you make me disappear with your own hands, why don\u2019t I do it myself? \u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes were filled with sorrow as she said softly, \u201cYou are all hers \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I don\u2019t belong to anyone. I\u2019m me. \u201d Feng Yi Xuan grabbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder and looked at her with shining eyes. \u201cAo Shuang, listen up. The person I love is you. It\u2019s you!\u201d Not the so-called god. I am not fire like, I am wind Yi Xuan. \u201cFeng Yixuan, who will always be by your side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang bit her lips as she stared into Yi Xuan\u2019s bright eyes. She couldn\u2019t say a word, but there were already some tears in the corner of her eyes.</p><br/><p>The man in white\u2019s gaze became deeper, but he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s a way.\u201d At this moment, Jin Yan suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat method?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan immediately asked anxiously and anxiously when he heard Jin Yan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two ways to prevent Miss\u2019s will from being devoured. The first way is to fuse it.\u201d Jin Yan said in a deep voice, \u201cBut this, is really too difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the second method?\u201d Feng Yixuan was on the verge of death when he heard Jin Yan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s separation.\u201d \u201cTo completely separate the will of the young lady from that of the goddess.\u201d Jin Yan said affirmatively.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, can this work?\u201d At this moment, King Yue asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do it, but there may be someone who can.\u201d Jin Yan said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille!\u201d</p><br/><p>Several voices said in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be able to do it.\u201d Jin Yan nodded. \u201cNow we have to find Camil as soon as possible before the goddess awakens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the Winged King\u2019s wounds are healed, let\u2019s go to the Heavenly King\u2019s castle.\u201d Mishus looked at the Wings King, who had been unconscious on the bed, and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s all go rest first.\u201d King Yue said in agreement.</p><br/><p>Everyone left the room in succession, with Feng Yixuan following closely behind Qi Ao Shuang. In the room there was only the white dress and the Winged King on the bed.</p><br/><p>After closing the door, Bai Yi returned to the bed. He looked at the Wings King, who was still unconscious, expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang \u2026\u201d After a long while, the man in white said those two words softly. Suddenly, Bai Yi reached out his right hand and tightly gripped the Winged King\u2019s neck, using more and more force.</p><br/><p>The Wings King\u2019s face gradually turned red and became painful. Finally, she opened her eyes, stimulated by the pain of the outside world. Seeing the scene before him, he was scared out of his wits. Bai Yixue\u2019s expression was cold and cruel as he tightly gripped her neck, causing her to nearly suffocate.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough \u2026\u201d \u201cBai \u2026 Bai Yi, stop! What are you doing \u2026\u201d The Wings King was terrified. He reached out with his hand, desperately trying to pry away the white clothes\u2019 hand. However, the white clothes\u2019 hand was like an iron band that tightly welded around her neck, unable to pry it open.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, don\u2019t have any unorthodox thoughts. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even dream about attacking her.\u201d At this moment, the eerie voice of Bai Yixue was like the voice of death, giving off a sense of oppression and suffocation that overflowed the heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, who are you?\u201d You. \u201cWhite clothes?\u201d The Winged King was extremely terrified. How could this person in front of his eyes be so unfamiliar? He didn\u2019t seem like that gentle white robe from before at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is not Bai Yi, but like ice.\u201d A cold and charming smile appeared on the man in white\u2019s face as he spoke each word in a low voice.</p><br/><p>The Wings King\u2019s pupils instantly enlarged, and his heart became even more alarmed. The man in white smiled coldly, but there was no emotion or warmth in his eyes. The current him and the him just now completely determined who they were. Previously, when he heard what Qi Ao Shuang said, his eyes were filled with puzzlement and bewilderment, but now, his eyes were no longer misty. It was now a profound and clear understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, cough \u2026\u201d \u201cLet go, let go of me \u2026\u201d Just as the Wings King was about to suffocate, Bai Yixue suddenly released his grip, and the Winged King was sent flying back to his original position.</p><br/><p>\u201cI warn you again, if you dare to do anything to her, I will make you wish you were dead.\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s face was cold. He flicked his finger, and the Winged King\u2019s hand was frozen. The Wings King immediately felt that his right hand was completely devoid of any feeling, and at this moment, he could no longer feel the blood flowing into his right hand. The Winged King looked at his right hand in terror. Just when she thought her right hand was going to be crippled, the ice immediately disappeared. When the Winged King looked at the white clothes once more, there was no longer a figure in white in the room.</p><br/><p>The Wings King leaned back against the headboard with lingering fear, looking at his right hand. His mind kept replaying the scene of his encounter with the white robes. He felt as if his white clothes had suddenly changed into a completely different person. It was so unfamiliar and terrifying. Or was this the true face of the man in white? The Wings King felt his scalp go numb, and his heart was no longer as soft as it was for his white clothes, only fear remained.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi stood quietly by the corridor, the wind blowing against his face. His eyes were deep and profound.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike ice \u2026\u201d A soft voice reached the ears of the white clothed person. His eyes darkened slightly as he slowly turned around to face the grave faced Jin Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you had already thought of everything.\u201d He also remembered that you\u2019re Leng Lingyun, and that you look even more like ice \u2026. Jin Yan\u2019s voice was low. It was faint, but it contained an irrefutable affirmation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always so sensitive and annoying.\u201d The man in white raised his head slightly and sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that what you really look like?\u201d Jin Yan narrowed his eyes slightly as he asked faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who are too smart will not live for long. \u201cJin Yan, you must remember this.\u201d With a smile, Bai Yi strode past Jin Yan and left.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan turned his head to look at the departing figure in white. His heart was filled with indescribable complex emotions.</p><br/><p>After a few days, the Winged King\u2019s wounds were almost healed. Everyone decided to head to the Heavenly King\u2019s castle. Qi Ao Shuang remained silent, her spirit very weak. As for Feng Yi Xuan, he was always silently accompanying her. White robes had always been by the Wings King\u2019s side, but his eyes would occasionally glance in the direction of Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan.</p><br/><p>The back of Mishus\u2019 mount was very spacious. Even with so many people on it, it still looked empty. The surface of the sea was very calm. The wind gently blew across everyone\u2019s face, bringing with it a faint salty taste. There were no seabirds flying in the sky, no clouds.</p><br/><p>Mishnu\u2019s mount hovered over the sea steadily, then began to fly in the direction of the Heavenly King\u2019s castle. Everyone was silent as they all had their own thoughts.</p><br/><p>After flying for a while, the strange phenomenon suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSea breeze blowing, sea wind blowing \u2026. Who are you missing \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>That melodious and melodious voice suddenly came from the surface of the sea. It was the voice of the Sea race.</p><br/><p>Wordlessly, carefreely, joyfully, without sadness \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Jin Yan\u2019s expression darkened as he shouted in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Lily\u2019s face changed. She had only heard this song last night, so she naturally knew how powerful it was.</p><br/><p>However, the singing gradually changed from one voice to several voices, and then more and more. The number of people in the sea were constantly increasing, and the sound was getting louder and louder. This sound seemed to be surrounding them.</p><br/><p>The Winged King\u2019s face was filled with surprise. She understood Bluesea\u2019s situation the best among them. The Sea race members of the Azure Sea had always been aloof from worldly affairs. They would always quietly lurk in the sea. Occasionally, there would be people of the Seafolk who could no longer endure the lonely singing, but that was only one person. Today, it was actually so strange. There are so many Seafolk singing. They were all coming towards him. They said they were encircling him, but it seemed like they were trying to hold him back. They seemed to be holding something back.</p><br/><p>\u201cQinghua\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes gradually became misty. She slowly stood up and walked to the edge of her mount.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, come back!\u201d Feng Yixuan reached out his hand to pull Qi Aushuang away. He then extended his hand into the air and a metallic sound rang out. In mid-air, a wall of ice forcefully blocked Feng Yixuan\u2019s hand. Feng Yixuan turned his head in shock and saw that white-clothed man\u2019s face was cold. It was him who had just done this.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun?!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart sank when he saw Bai Yixue\u2019s cold expression. A bad premonition welled up in his heart. \u201cYou \u2026 recovered your memories?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in white revealed a strange smile. He ignored Feng Yi Xuan and looked up at Qi Ao Shuang. Clearly, this action of his had already tacitly allowed him to recover his memories.</p><br/><p>With a cry of surprise from Lily, Feng Yi Xuan turned his head and saw Qi Ao Shuang with a serene expression on her face. She opened her arms and slowly fell forward, falling straight towards the surface of the sea.</p><br/><p>The others on the mounts moved as well. Jin Yan and Feng Yixuan were the first to move, immediately wanting to follow. However, at this time, Leng Lingyun did something no one would have thought of. With a light tap of his toes, he moved away from the horse. His palms were clasped in front of his chest, and a wave of cold air engulfed them, freezing them all. All of them froze into large chunks of ice, landing on their mounts without being able to move.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun gave a strange smile before following Qi Ao Shuang into the sea without looking back.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

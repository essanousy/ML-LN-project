Qi Aoshuang\u2019s sword had pierced through his right chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cBirdmen have red blood too?\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled coldly, then pulled out her sword viciously.</p><br/><p>The eight winged angel howled with pain. His blood spurted out like fountain water. He retreated as fast as he could, to get as far away from Qi Aoshuang as possible.</p><br/><p>When the four six winged angels saw the circumstances, they all stopped what they were doing and rushed over to the eight winged angel\u2019s side. They all made the same symbol with their left hand. A barrier appeared before Qi Aoshuang, stopping her from advancing.</p><br/><p>The five angles then raised their right hands at the same time. Just as Qi Aoshuang was about to strike through the barrier, their made a simple hand gesture. Instantly, dazzling white light enveloped them. Then, they disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cA portal.\u201d Leng Lingyun said quietly, coughing as he approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cPortal?\u201d Jean sheathed his sword. He stared ahead at the empty cavity, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly with five angels can they use it. They are teleported to the nearest source of Light power. It should be the closest temple,\u201d Leng Lingyun explained. He waved his hand to cast healing magic. White light enveloped Qi Aoshuang, healing her wounds instantly. Jean fell silent, because Leng Lingyun\u2019s wounds were visible more serious than Qi Aoshuang\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Vermillion flew over, tears in her eyes. She carefully inspected Jean to see if he was wounded at all, sobbing as she said, \u201cSorry master, I could not help you. I.. I was afraid the dragon god would take be away. But\u2026 but\u2026 master, I\u2026 if they were too\u2026 I would have intervened no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Jean patted Vermillion\u2019s head kindly. \u201cYou were good. We\u2019re perfectly fine. If you were taken away, we would have been much slower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermillion continued to sob.</p><br/><p>Oscar nonchalantly stood to the side, arms crossed as he regarded Qi Aoshuang without a word.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was dark faced, also silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cChuxin and Dong Fenghou are in danger,\u201d Qi Aoshuang managed to squeeze out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Everyone was alarmed. Only Oscar remained aloof.</p><br/><p>The goddess has finally started to make her move.\u201d Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression was exceptionally unsightly. She needed an entire set of deity weapons to kill the goddess of light, but so long as the goddess stole away a single one, all of her efforts would be for nothing. Right now, what was most worrying was Qiao Chuxin and Dong Fenghou were completely not those angels\u2019 match. They had only sent five angels after them, even one that was eight winged. What about Dong Fenghou and Qiao Chuxin? Even a six winged angel would be hard for them to fight!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to find them immediately.\u201d Qi Aoshuang did not care for anything else. Even if the goblins were right ahead, the deity weapon almost in reach, Qi Aoshuang was currently complete fixated on Qiao Chuxin and Dong Fenghou\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>No one objected. They all knew what was most important.</p><br/><p>Vermillion immediately assumed her dragon form, carrying everyone up into the clouds in one huff.</p><br/><p>They soon reached the beastmen race. Dong Fenghou and Qiao Chuxin\u2019s first stop was there. Based off of their calculations, they still had not arrived yet.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ben was all wrapped up on the rainbow cloud. Sitting next to him emanating red light was a mysterious old man. This was the dragon god.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmph, ah\u2026\u201d Ben was still writhing around pointlessly.</p><br/><p>The dragon god looked down upon Ben. Suddenly, he reached out and jabbed Ben. Ben opened his eyes wide, struggling even more now.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut the hell up.\u201d Ben felt as if thunder struck. His voice was resonant and dignified, yet he said such words. He had been all wrapped up and struggling with all his might at the time the dragon king said \u201clil bastard\u201d, so he hadn\u2019t heard him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmph!\u201d Ben wriggled, even more loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be so dumb? Always making trouble for me.\u201d The dragon god stood up, anger rising. He raised his foot and started to step on Ben. Ben howled miserably.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou caused so much trouble, and even provoked the goddess of Light, that wench. Your identity was even found out! Are you a dragon or a pig?\u201d The dragon god\u2019s face had been fuming red, but now, even his ears and neck were starting to flow red. Whether it was anger or excitement was indiscernible.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d Ben realized something was strange. It seemed like he didn\u2019t care about provoking the goddess of light?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to wipe up after your shit? You\u2019re a dragon, not a pig! Use your brain!\u201d The dragon god started stepping on Ben again. With each step, he was more stirred up. Ben was pummeled into a ******. He wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Finally, the dragon god was finished. He withdrew his foot, then sat down, finally satisfied. With a flick of his finger, he loosened Ben\u2019s bounds. Ben desperately held on for dear life, gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally wanted to see you bring down that treacherous, idiotic dragon king. Just when I was about to praise you, you got into this mess. How could you get into such bullshit? The goddess of Light, that wench, came knocking on the door!\u201d The longer the dragon god spoke, the more angry he became. He was prepared to give Ben another beating. At this time, Ben \u201cunlocked his hidden potential\u201d, rolling away, avoiding the dragon god\u2019s claws.</p><br/><p>Ben now understood one thing very clearly. The dragon god they revered had bad character! He was a shameless, two faced bastard!</p><br/><p>\u201cVenerable dr-dragon god, I\u2026\u201d Just when Ben started to speak, he was met with ringing pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to act all nice. I know you\u2019re secretly cursing me.\u201d The dragon god gave Ben a warning smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! So what, you damn old man. Why did you take me away? Are we dragons afraid of the goddess of light?\u201d Ben finally understood the dragon king\u2019s personality, blurting out cheeky words.</p><br/><p>Ben stared at the dark faced old man. When the dragon king heard his words, he was so angry, he was going to give Ben another beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou favor the strong and bully the weak!\u201d Ben ducked to avoid the attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou pighead, you know what that means? Hm? If you know what it means, why do you ask? Are you an idiot?\u201d The dragon god was even more angry. He gave Ben a thorough beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ben hugged his head, crying out. \u201cIs it because you hate people calling you that way, so you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve made progress. You\u2019ve changed from a bastard to a fool.\u201d The dragon gold stopped his attacks. He said disdainfully, \u201cYou finally realized. Dragons are so much stronger than humans, so how could the goddess of Light, that wench, be someone I care about? But if others say I bully the weak, then it would be bad.\u201d The old dragon god sat down crossed legged and said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Ben was shocked. Who would have thought the dragon god would be so shameless, two faced, and care so much about face! \u201cIt\u2019s like that?\u201d Ben\u2019s expression was still filled with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d The dragon god assumed a grandiose appearance. \u201cIf not for that wench pretending to be so pitiful, asking me to sign a pact, pah! You think I\u2019d care?\u201d The dragon god\u2019s mouth twitched. Suddenly, he seemed to say to himself, \u201cThat old wench is too shrewd, I don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Ben heard everything clearly. He felt like that dragon goddess had grabbed hold of his weakness of hating losing face, she she had tricked him into signing the agreement that dragons could not attack humans heedlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like that wench, then let me go help my friends. I\u2019ll just hide conceal myself everywhere we go,\u201d Ben frowned and said, breaking the dragon god\u2019s train of thought.</p><br/><p>The dragon god flew into a fury. He pointed straight at Ben\u2019s nose. \u201cYou idiot, they already know who you are. How the hell would you be able to help them? Don\u2019t cause me more trouble!\u201d He rolled his eyes, then looked into the sky, silent. Now one knew what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Ben now was proficient at reading expressions. Thus, he crouched obediently, waiting for the dragon god\u2019s next words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil bastard, how come I never noticed you were so scheming? You\u2019re so treacherous and deceitful, how come I never noticed before?\u201d the dragon god suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Ben\u2019s mouth went wide. \u201cAre you complimenting me or insulting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can think of it as a compliment.\u201d The dragon god nodded earnestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my human friend who taught me. At her side, I learned many things. Only then was I able to think of an idea to kick that previous dragon king off the throne.\u201d Ben sensed this is what the dragon god liked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm\u2026 not bad, not bad.\u201d The dragon god nodded, smiling. \u201cThat woman has piqued my interest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo can I go help her?\u201d Ben smiled, trying to curry favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I say you could?\u201d The dragon god\u2019s face darkened, his voice low.</p><br/><p>Ben was about to ready himself for another beating, but before he could, the dragon god started to laugh, his eyes darting around. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do this blatantly, then we\u2019ll do it secretly. That wench had been rubbing tme the wrong way for some time now. Getting rid of her should be a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

All that existed was the sound of breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope you uphold your promise.\u201d Claire said indifferent and coldly.</p><br/><p>Gordan and Nancy both let out a quiet sigh of relief, not bad, not bad. Claire forgave her guardian knight.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, I\u2019ll be going first back to my room to rest.\u201d Claire curtseyed towards Gordan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you should rest properly.\u201d Gordan nodded affectionately. After curtseying to Nancy, she left. Nobody saw the profound look in her eyes after she exited.</p><br/><p>After the study\u2019s door closed, Gordan let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuke Hill, I won\u2019t avoid the consequences of today\u2019s situation.\u201d Nancy held a flat expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, your Highness.\u201d Gordan shook his head no, not wanting to discuss the situation any more. \u201cThere\u2019s no more problems. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nancy nodded, a deep expression in his eyes. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, go find a healer to treat you.\u201d Gordan quietly said as he turned to face the still kneeling Jean.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your Grace.\u201d Jean stood up and walked out. The bloodstain stood out sharply on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuke Hill, I\u2019ll also take my leave,\u201d Nancy nodded and said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon my absence. I won\u2019t see you out,\u201d Gordan said rather exhausted. Although the matter had been resolved, of course he would still feel uncomfortable. Both girls were his darling granddaughters, both the future hope of the Hill clan. But such an intense conflict happened. If they couldn\u2019t resolve this issue, then there would be bigger problems. He frowned severely. This matter weighed heavily on his heart. The situation hadn\u2019t been told to their mother, Katherine, yet. If Katherine knew, then there would be another headache.</p><br/><p>Nancy said his farewells to Gordan, then left together with Jean.</p><br/><p>After going to the healer, the injuries on Jean\u2019s thigh were mostly gone and would completely heal soon.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, Nancy\u2019s carriage stopped again in the desolate alley.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you a bit too hasty tonight?\u201d Nancy said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>The carriage was silent.</p><br/><p>After a long while, a voice sounded quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that instant, I felt like she tore my heart out of my chest.\u201d This was no other person than Jean!</p><br/><p>Nancy quieted down, his feelings extremely complicated. It wasn\u2019t just Jean; he had also lost himself in that moment. This night, Claire seemed brighter than the sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe definitely isn\u2019t the Claire from before.\u201d Jean quietly said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Nancy nodded, his face also serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if she\u2019s worthy of my vow.\u201d Jean\u2019s eye flashed an unknown light.</p><br/><p>Nancy was silent, then finally nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should go back and rest properly.\u201d Nancy was obviously talking about Jean\u2019s injury.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Jean said offhandedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go back in order to avoid suspicion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The night was silent.</p><br/><p>Claire lay on her bed, her face cold as ice. Gap, what a huge gap between her and Lashia. If it wasn\u2019t for Lashia having no real battle experience, she would probably already be dead. But also because of this, she now had Jean\u2019s loyalty. Humph! Claire coldly humphed. She didn\u2019t press Jean so hard in front of Gordon just because of momentarily hot headedness. She was too weak right now and she needed a loyal person to protect her with all his might. And Jean was the best person for this job.</p><br/><p>Power can only come from oneself. Authority is based on power.</p><br/><p>Claire flipped on her bed, folded her legs, and then entered the Meditation state.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a light knock sounded on the window.</p><br/><p>Claire slowly opened her eyes. Who was it? They knocked on the window instead of coming in from the door. Claire got up from the bed and opened the window. At the window was a person in a cloak, face covered. But Claire smiled, because it was Emery.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is it? Why did you come at such a late time?\u201d Claire said while moving aside to let Emery in. She knew if Emery came this late and not even from the front door, there must be something important.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I heard all about what happened tonight.\u201d After he entered, Emery removed his cloak and revealed his face. His originally blank face was full of sincere worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, teacher, can\u2019t you see? I\u2019m standing perfectly well in front of you.\u201d Claire smiled and shrugged her shoulders to assure him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you almost lost your life.\u201d Emery\u2019s face turned ugly. It seemed like he already knew the details of the situation clearly.</p><br/><p>It was true that if Claire didn\u2019t trick Lashia into thinking Duke Gordan had come, she might have already become a corpse. No matter how much they punished Lashia, it would have still been irreversible.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I already said there\u2019s no need to worry. I will always survive.\u201d Claire confidently smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere. In a critical situation tear this, it\u2019s set to a secret room in my house. It\u2019s a very hidden and safe area.\u201d Emery took out a scroll from his robe and gave it to Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the scroll uncertainly, because from what Emery had said, this seems to be a\u2026 Claire took the scroll over and was startled. It really was a Space Teleportation Scroll! She had seen this device in the Institute\u2019s library\u2019s \u201cMagic Device Handbook\u201d so she recognized it at once. This item was priceless! Because even if you had the money, you still couldn\u2019t buy an item as valuable as this. Having this meant you have an extra life, so owners of these scroll wouldn\u2019t give up one so easily. Emery didn\u2019t yet have the magic power to make such a precious device, so he must have spent a lot of effort in obtaining this one. But he gave it to Claire so easily! Claire was touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Teacher, this is far too precious. You keep it for times of danger.\u201d Claire shook her head and returned the scroll to Emery.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, listen to me, you keep it. I have a feeling you will need it more than me. Just accept it as a token of appreciation from me.\u201d Emery was persistent.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u2026\u201d Claire was thoroughly moved. Emery gave her such a precious gift after he found out that she had been in danger. She will never forget this token of appreciation, Claire swore in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, and I must be going. Get some rest. When you have time, I\u2019ll teach you more magic. Only knowing the Fire shield is not enough.\u201d After finishing this sentence, Emery put on his cloak and disappeared out the window.</p><br/><p>Claire held the precious scroll tightly in her hand, warmth flooding her.</p><br/><p>The conflict between Claire and Lashia was only known by Duke Gordan, Nancy, Jean, and some retainers that Gordan trusted. No one else was told. So after Lashia didn\u2019t show up at the Institute for several days in a row, some students finally couldn\u2019t resist the urge to ask Claire about her. It was then that Claire finally realize that Lashia was not only the center of attention for those noble girls, but also the dream spouse of many noble young men. Although Lashia was only twelve years old, four years from her adult ceremony, she was already beautifully attractive. Not to mention her background and family, and that the principal of the Institute was very fond of her. With such a strong backing, how could she not attract attention?</p><br/><p>After class, Claire sat on the bench by the Institute\u2019s lake alone, digesting the information taught by the teacher in class. Not far away several noble boys and girls kept throwing their glances her way.</p><br/><p>After a period of time, it seemed like they finally made their decision, and started walking towards Claire. The noble girls walked in the front, while the boys chickened out and carefully trailed behind them as if Claire would swallow them up, raw and whole!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

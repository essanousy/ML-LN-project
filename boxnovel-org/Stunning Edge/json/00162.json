His health?\u201d These people had never read Chinese history, how could they possibly understand the intentions of emperors? If an emperor like Li Yuan* existed in this continent before, then they would be able to understand the mindset of the current Amparkland emperor.</p><br/><p>*Li Yuan (566-635), first Tang emperor Gaozu, reigned 618-626</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor is not yet fifty and in good health,\u201d Xi Shaoqi answered, even though he was confused why Claire asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you normally ate three delicious meals a day, and then one day you were only given a meal a day, leftovers, would you be willing?\u201d A derisive smile appeared on Claire\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, only a fool would be willing.\u201d Xi Shaoqi immediately retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you think the emperor is a fool?\u201d Claire replied calmly.</p><br/><p>Everyone else in the room froze.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaosi immediately understood. \u201cThe current emperor currently has control over everything. Everyone carefully treads around him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he abdicated the throne, he would barely have any power, the leftovers.\u201d Philips was shocked, shocked at the farsighted emperor, shocked by the frightening perception of the girl before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t the emperor afraid Lagark might take the opportunity to attack while the princes fight for the throne?\u201d Philips frowned He didn\u2019t dare to look down on this girl before him any more. Before, he only believed she had made a contract with the god of Darkness by chance to become the Divine Princess of Darkness, but now, he could tell this girl was no ordinary person. She actually had such deep perception.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two princes\u2019 fight for the throne will not affect the true strength of Amparkland. The Tempest Warriors and Griffin Squad only protect the royal family. The real strength of Amparkland has not changed, the army. Of course, Lagark is also aware of this,\u201d Claire explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if both princes die?\u201d Xi Shaoqi frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour intelligence quotient disappoints me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi paused, then curled his lip. Although he did not know what \u201cintelligence quotient\u201d meant, even a fool would know she was not complimenting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Xi Shaosi appeared exasperated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor is still in good health. Having a few more heirs is no problem.\u201d Philips gave Xi Shaoqi a meaningful look.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi\u2019s lip twisted, his face turning a bit green.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Princess, most importantly, the fools of the Temple of Light will definitely find a way to establish your mother as a criminal.\u201d Philips stroked his double chin. \u201cThey will probably create false witnesses to testify your mother was in full control of the drinks. With so many people present and a high enough price, someone is bound to jump out and make up the \u2018truth\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather is already aware.\u201d Claire was not worried about this at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Temple of Light is far more dirty than yu think, Divine Princess. It is better to stay on the safe side. Your mother\u2019s trial will be soon.\u201d Philips was well aware of the true face of the Temple of Light.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Thank you, Philips.\u201d Claire nodded, truly thankful.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, as your servant, this is merely what I should do, Divine Princess.\u201d Philips smiled. After this conversation, Philips had a completely different evaluation of Claire. Perhaps she would really be able to do something.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut right now, I will stay here. I still have not recovered. I need a quiet place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, Divine Princess. Follow me, please. You can request me of anything. I will report all news of the outside to you,\u201d Philips promised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire stood, following Philips out the door.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi rubbed his nose. He faced the door with frustration. \u201cWhy do I always shiver whenever she appears?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Shaosi did not respond. He put away the tea set and then also left the room. Xi Shaoqi hurried after him. Their current job was to gather and report intel to Philips.</p><br/><p>Claire started her recovery in a quiet room. The Treasured Lotus Style had already repaired Claire\u2019s damaged veins in just three days. Currently, Claire was already practicing the tenth level of the Treasured Lotus Style.</p><br/><p>That night, just as Claire was quietly cultivating, there was a slight noise at the window. It was definitely not one of Philip\u2019s men. Claire opened her eyes, got off the bed, and opened the window. Two shadows, one white and one black, jumped in, aiming straight for Claire\u2019s bosom.</p><br/><p>Claire laughed and hugged the two little furballs. Of course it was White Emperor and Black Feather. The two had found her through their contract. Suddenly, Claire remembered the person who had always stood silently behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jean?\u201d Claire remembered that Emery had told her after Jean had reported to Grandfather of her whereabouts, he had left with White Emperor and Black Feather. Although these two little guys were here, Jean was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeep peep!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two started to speak to Claire in a language only they two could understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop talking.\u201d Claire felt a bit of headache. Even if they tried to speak to her, she wouldn\u2019t be able to understand.</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather hopped onto Claire\u2019s shoulders, rubbing against Claire\u2019s face lovingly.</p><br/><p>Inside the Temple of Light.</p><br/><p>The pope stood facing the window, his hands behind his back. There was a quiet knock at the door.</p><br/><p>The pope turned to face the door. \u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door swung open gently to reveal Lawrence.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness.\u201d Lawrence entered, then closed the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will he arrive?\u201d The pope walked to his desk and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is already traveling day and night. Tomorrow morning, he will arrive.\u201d Lawrence\u2019s eyes revealed a complex emotion. Was the pope actually going to go this far? Was this really the best way?</p><br/><p>The pope noticed the Lawrence\u2019s complex expression and sighed. \u201cLawrence, this is a huge opportunity. Amparkland is the strongest country in the continent. If the Temple has control of Amparkland, the goddess\u2019s brilliance will spread across the continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, what about the priest? She is the chosen one and will definitely get entangled in the conflict,\u201d Lawrence said with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe still has not returned ever since the day she disappeared, only informing the Hill clan she would be cultivating. Isn\u2019t this good? She does not have time to care. Once she returns and learns everything, what can she do?\u201d The pope was not worried at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really fine?\u201d Lawrence was still hesitant. He kept on feeling a bit uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf person herself admits that the second prince told her to harm the crown prince, what else could be more convincing?\u201d The pope smiled coldly, full of confidence and disdain.</p><br/><p>Lawrence fell silent. It was true, but would everything go smoothly? His uneasiness grew.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you may leave. Once he arrives, take him to meet <i>that</i> woman. Remember, his arrival must be secret.\u201d The pope motioned for Lawrence to leave.</p><br/><p>Lawrence sighed in his heart, about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait,\u201d the pope suddenly called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, do you have any other orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFind an excuse to bring Cliff away, the farther, the better. Don\u2019t let him get involved,\u201d the pope said, frowning. He had suddenly recalled Cliff would not be so easily fooled. Not only was Cliff powerful, he was Claire\u2019s master. He would not just watch quietly from the side if anything happened to Claire\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness!\u201d Lawrence\u2019s expression changed greatly. He knew what would happen between him and Cliff if he did this.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretend you didn\u2019t know anything. Find an excuse,\u201d the pope ordered. His expression darkened. \u201cI know your relationship with him, but don\u2019t forget your position. Also, even if Cliff is a sorcerer, do you really think no one from the Temple can stop him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lawrence fell silent. The term sorcerer appeared to be almighty, but even he, a red cardinal, was not certain of the Temple\u2019s true strength. The pope\u2019s words were not just a threat but the truth! The power of the Temple was unimaginable. The twelve cardinals above him were scattered in branch temples, not to mention the other twenty three cardinals. These people had unfathomable strength. They were different from Cliff, all unwilling to pursue fame or fortune. Perhaps some of them were already sorcerers, but merely had never revealed it.</p><br/><p>Lawrence\u2019s heart sunk. He could not let anything happen to Cliff, his only lifelong friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand, your holiness,\u201d Lawrence said unwillingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may leave. Implement my orders now.\u201d The pope motioned for Lawrence to leave.</p><br/><p>Lawrence left silently. When he walked out the door, he saw Leng Lingyun standing silently at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun\u2026\u201d Lawrence said with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, are we really doing this?\u201d Leng Lingyun gritted his teeth, frowning.</p><br/><p>Lawrence remained quiet, only sighing slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster! That person is Claire\u2019s mother! What if Claire returns?\u201d Leng Lingyun became more anxious seeing Lawrence\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun, do you think your master really wants to do this? Do you think I want to see that little girl in grief?\u201d Lawrence said helplessly, his voice dispirited.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

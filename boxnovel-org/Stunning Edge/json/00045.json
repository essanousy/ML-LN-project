But Claire and Duke Gordan stopped her because the plague was truly too dangerous; they didn\u2019t want Lashia to also be in danger at all. Of course Cliff and Jean would go.</p><br/><p>That night, the person sent by the Temple of Light arrived on schedule to the Hill castle and went with Claire to Niya City. Duke Gordan specially prepared a cozy and spacious carriage that could carry up to six people. With soft cushions, the carriage also had thick carpets and everything needed was available because this time, the people who accompanied and left with Claire were all unordinary people; the Temple of Light\u2019s Divine Prince and Cliff, the wizard sage.</p><br/><p>After the four got in the carriage, Cliff leaned on the side of the back and started to nap. Jean also sat at the back, silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for Divine Prince\u2019s assistance this time.\u201d Claire elegantly and politely thanked. She had experienced Lingyun Leng\u2019s healing magic, but the plague didn\u2019t seem to be able to be healed? This time, the problem seemed pretty annoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is what our Temple should do.\u201d Lingyun lightly smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>Next, it was silent.</p><br/><p>The mood in the carriage became more and more sombre.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp~~\u201d White Emperor dug out of Claire\u2019s embrace, swaying as he crawled up Claire\u2019s shoulder, then onto her head. After that, he started to tug on her hair unyieldingly.</p><br/><p>Claire stayed silent and didn\u2019t make a move. Lingyun Leng was a bit shocked looking at the furry meatball on Claire\u2019s head. What was it? Claire\u2019s pet? No matter how he looked at it, Claire didn\u2019t seem to be a person who would raise this kind of adorable pet.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp Chip!!!\u201d White Emperor seemed a bit angry Claire ignored him. His two paws grabbed Claire\u2019s hair and gave a fierce tug.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. You can eat this.\u201d Claire begrudgingly got out a basket of food from the backseat, then a silver plate and a piece of roasted meat. She put the cold roasted meat in the silver platter and chanted a spell, creating a little fireball to heat up the roasted meat. White Emperor happily chirped. With a tumble, he flipped into the plate and his two claws hugged the roasted meat and he started nibbling it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of magic beast is this?\u201d Lingyun Leng asked, a bit curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Claire shrugged, answering honestly as she watched White Emperor, who was currently crouched in the plate, eating with relish. White Emperor wasn\u2019t a carnivore or vegetarian, but an omnivore. As long as it tasted good, he liked it, no matter if it was meat, vegetables, or fruit. It was just that he liked roasted meat out of all meat, that was all.</p><br/><p>Then it was silent again.</p><br/><p>It was silent the whole journey. Claire didn\u2019t really want any relation with the Temple of Light, only because to Claire, the Temple of Light was a group of charlatans.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, this guy is so pretentious. It really makes people annoyed and want to rip off his face and look at what\u2019s beneath that mask.\u201d Walter made a racket in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuieter, I want to rest. We also need to hurry to reach Niya City early in the morning tomorrow. There should be many things that need to be dealt with.\u201d Claire closed her eyes and leaned against the side of the back of the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, humph.\u201d Walter snorted resentfully. Divine Prince, humph, he\u2019s just that bitchy Light goddess\u2019s hunting dog. Just wait, there will be a day when he will take revenge!</p><br/><p>Niya City was already completely blocked off. Once Claire arrived before Niya City, she saw the city gates tightly closed and many simple tents set up outside the city gates. These were people who wanted to enter, but were banned. They all had family or friends inside the city and wished that they could go in very much, but the epidemic had already spread. Naturally, in order to prevent more infections, they had forbidden people to enter or leave.</p><br/><p>Once they knew that the person inside the carriage was the Niya City\u2019s Castellan, a large disturbance arose.</p><br/><p>\u201cCastellan, please let us go in. My wife and children are inside, I want to know how they are right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCastellan, my father is still inside. Please let us go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCastellan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pleading voices arose in succession as people gradually started surrounding the carriage, making it unable to go forward.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that the city gates opened. A troop of soldiers in a single file line ran out and started drive away the commoners, letting out a path to let the carriage enter the city. Next, they started driving away commoners who wanted to take this opportunity to enter the city. Although it was a bit cruel, they all still acted very appropriately and didn\u2019t wound anyone. They were able to adopt these measures in a serious situation like this. Evidently, the people Duke Gordan had sent to help Claire deal with Niya City were not to be trifled with.</p><br/><p>Immediately a voice sounded from over the city gates. \u201cEverybody, please don\u2019t be impatient, the Castellan has already come personally, this matter will be resolved very quickly. Please wait for good news, everybody. Forbidding everyone from being able to enter or leave is also for your safety. Also, the Temple of Light\u2019s Divine Prince has also arrived, everybody, please be at ease. Good news will arrive very quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again, the city gates closed. The people were nervous, but not panicky.</p><br/><p>A strange smell pervaded the air in Niya City. The rotting smell was mixed with the smell of incense. Claire lifted the curtains to see the situation outside. There was nobody in the streets and all the doors had been tightly shut. The strange odor was probably caused by burned incense in order to hide the rotting stink of corpses.</p><br/><p>That being said, the corpses of people who had died from the plague weren\u2019t cremated?</p><br/><p>The epidemic would only spread more this way!</p><br/><p>The carriage entered the castle. As Claire waited for people to come off the carriage, someone was there to welcome them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Claire, your subordinate has been looking forward to meet for a long time.\u201d A refined young man approached and respectfully bowed. \u201cYour subordinate is the one Duke Gordan sent to assist you deal with this situation, Heath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201d Claire\u2019s expression was solemn. She didn\u2019t enter the room and issued a stream of orders immediately instead. \u201cPeople who have died from the plague, immediately cremate them. Every door needs to be opened to ventilate in order to get rid of the plague. When the soldiers are carrying out these orders, they must wear masks. Bring me to see the people who have been infected by the plague, I want to see their symptoms.\u201d Claire had seen very clearly that the soldiers who had previously welcomed her into the city gates hadn\u2019t taken any preventative measures. That was very dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cCastellan?\u201d Now Heath had changed his address. A bit surprised, he asked, \u201cYou want to go see right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Exceptionally serious, Claire ordered, \u201cCarry out my orders immediately. Cremate those corpses right now. Incense can only mask the odor, nothing else. Bring me right now to see the people who have been infected by the plague. Right now! Do you understand what right now means?\u201d</p><br/><p>Heath was scared into shock, then came back to his senses and turned to give out orders.</p><br/><p>Soon, a couple of soldiers jogged with masks on, as they scattered to all directions from the center of the city.</p><br/><p>As Lingyun Leng watched Claire\u2019s exceptionally serious expression and heard the orders Claire ordered, a light flashed from the depths of his eyes, then disappeared in a wink.</p><br/><p>Once Claire saw the situation of the people who had been infected by the plague, doubt surfaced in her heart. This plague wasn\u2019t the small pox or the bubonic plague of medieval times. The symptom of the people who had been infected by the plague was that their skin would darken and then darker and darker, until they rotted! The disease spread through human saliva and blood.</p><br/><p>A cold light flashed through Lingyun Leng\u2019s eyes. He had already made a decision.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a plague!</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, this isn\u2019t the plague. This is poison from the dark element. Even though it\u2019s very, very little, it is actually emitting a dark aura. There\u2019s a dark magician messing around in this city! And their level is not low, otherwise there\u2019s no way magicians from the entire Niya City didn\u2019t discover it.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice sounded in Claire\u2019s mind, certain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of course she could tell who it was. It was the one who had always gazed at her disfavorably, Eric!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Is something the matter?\u201d Claire asked indifferently. She still hadn\u2019t turned around.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with your attitude? And what\u2019s what your attitude towards Father!\u201d The ice cold voice now contained a trace of anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, who are <i>you</i> to talk to me like that?\u201d Claire yawned lazily. Only now did Claire remember her haughty second brother had only one virtue: filial piety. In other words, this second brother of hers had come to admonish her rude attitude towards Father?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am your elder brother!\u201d The voice was on the verge of exploding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke, since when have you acted like you were my brother? <i>Now</i> you\u2019re pretending like you are.\u201d Claire laughed disdainfully. Slowly, she turned around, derision in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Eric\u2019s originally fiery expression froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cVenerable second brother, I advise you not to learn from your father, never fulfilling the responsibilities of a father, but stepping in once his daughter\u2019s accomplished. Don\u2019t t you think that\u2019s ridiculous? Shameless?\u201d Claire scoffed. She leaned back on the pillar lazily. \u201cI don\u2019t mind fighting you right now.</p><br/><p>Eric\u2019s expression instantly darkened. The girl before him was not a coward who could be scared off by just a few words any more.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression suddenly turned icy, not a trace of warmth in her eyes. \u201cBut be aware of the price of fighting me. I might just kill you without batting an eye. Do you think you\u2019re my match currently?\u201d Her voice was even more frigid than her gaze, radiating a murderous aura. An enormous, terrifying power burst out abruptly, then disappeared as quickly as it had arrived.</p><br/><p>Chills ran down his spine and he trembled. The sensation the girl gave him was so alarming and cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother word of advice. No matter if you support the crown prince of if you are a spy sent by the second prince, no matter how could fight, do not involve Mother. If anyone hurts her, no matter who, I will slaughter them.\u201d Claire smiled lazily, as casual as if she were chatting with some friends, but the coldness that seeped through told Eric the girl was definitely not lying!</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember my words.\u201d Claire laughed lightly, then walked passed Eric.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe crown prince is the true successor of the emperor!\u201d Eric\u2019s determined voice came from behind.</p><br/><p>Claire glanced over from the corner of the eye and saw the nearly mad loyalty in Eric\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Claire waved offhandedly. \u201cJust remember my words,\u201d she said, then left.</p><br/><p>Eric didn\u2019t move, watching Claire\u2019s retreating figure, his gaze complex. He turned and looked towards the greenhouse. When he saw the crown prince smiling, his eyes softened. Then, he clenched his fists tightly. The crown prince was his god, the true successor of the empire! He had to assist the prince until he was sitting on the throne!</p><br/><p>The capital. Slowly, winter creeping in:</p><br/><p>Cold wind blew past, slightly chilling.</p><br/><p>Nightfall. Claire walked through a colonnade, planning on finding Lashia and give her her old storage ring. The space inside was more than enough for Lashia to use.</p><br/><p>A breeze blew past. Claire frowned and gazed past the courtyard, then relaxed. She lept onto a rooftop, then hurried off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Jean appeared from behind a pillar, watching silently as Claire\u2019s figure disappeared into the night. He did not give chase.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeep peep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perched on Jean\u2019s shoulders, White Emperor and Black Feather conversed. As for what they were saying, no one would know.</p><br/><p>Jean gazed into the night without moving, a lonesome figure.</p><br/><p>It was Leng Lingyun. It was Leng Lingyun who had been inside the courtyard, so Jean didn\u2019t follow.</p><br/><p>What did he come to find his lady for?</p><br/><p>Jean stood silently, staring into the night for a long time.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun flew and Claire followed. They flew all the way out of the city and finally arrived at a secluded area. After a moment, Claire realized it was where Alice and her cousin had ambushed her during one of her breakthroughs. Leng Lingyun descended and stood there silently. The wind ruffled his long, silver hair. He looked like he had stepped out of a painting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you need me for?\u201d Claire said indifferently and also descended. She could not treat Leng Lingyun the same as before after what she had seen at the Temple today.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun turned to look at Claire, his gaze distant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am very grateful for your yell that awakened me, helping me control of myself. I am truly not the match of the pope. I sincerely thank you for saving me once again.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was emotionless and cold.</p><br/><p>When Leng Lingyun heard her words, he felt as if his heart had been sliced.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not think I am mocking you, it\u2019s true,\u201d Claire added indifferently when she saw Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun bit his lip. \u201cI let Shack and the girl go. I told them to get as far away as possible and not to let me catch them again, that if I caught them again, perhaps I would not be alone. Then I would not be able to let them go,\u201d Leng Lingyun forced out with difficulty.</p><br/><p>Claire froze. In Leng Lingyun\u2019s violet eyes, she saw confliction and pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone has someone they treasure the most. For me, that is Xuanxuan. For her, I am willing to have blood on my hands and descend into hell. But I wish that Xuanxuan will be pure forever.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s voice trembled slightly, his eyes full of anguish.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes flashed with realization. \u201cWhen you found the knight and girl, was the Divine Princess the one who attacked?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun fell silent. Slowly, he unclenched a fist, frowning. \u201cI had no way of saving them. I could not give up Xuanxuan for them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent, understanding instantly. Leng Xuanxuan required medicine supplied by the Temple to survive. Leng Lingyun\u2019s every action was to help Xuanxuan live more comfortably. He knew the Temple was fraudulent, but kept his mouth shut for Xuanxuan, striving his best to assist her disability.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour life sure is exhausting.\u201d Claire sighed, sorrow in her heart.</p><br/><p>Every individual had someone they treasured the most and for this person, they could do things others would find hard to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, in truth, you are already aware of the hypocrisy of the Temple. But I do not wish for you to fight the Temple and be harmed.\u201d Leng Lingyun finally revealed the purpose of his visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I am not the pope\u2019s match. The pope\u2019s strength is unfathomable.\u201d Claire frowned, thinking. \u201cHis strength is far above Master\u2019s. Even with Master\u2019s recent breakthrough, he is not the pope\u2019s match.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s strength is not something easily read.\u201d Leng Lingyun sighed. \u201cAnd there are so many archbishops and cardinals. I do not wish for you to face them.\u201d His underlying meaning was, I do not wish for you to get hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your concern. I will not be as rash as I was today again.\u201d Claire\u2019s tone was now genuinely sincere.</p><br/><p>However, Leng Lingyun understood the true meaning of her words. Not being as rash meant she had other plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, remember, the pope\u2019s strength is unfathomable,\u201d Leng Lingyun warned again, worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you.\u201d Claire nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the struggle between the princes is becoming more intense. At the end, the Temple of Light will definitely choose a side,\u201d Leng Lingyun said in a low voice, \u201cAnd the Hill clan will also choose a side. If both support the same prince, there would be nothing to be worried about, but if not, your position would be very special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent, pondering. Duke Gordan had ordered Jean to support the second prince secretly, but her second brother Eric supported the crown prince publically and Duke Gordan did not show any disapproval. What did this mean?</p><br/><p>Seeing Claire deep in thought, Leng Lingyun couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cHas the Hill clan already chosen a side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire shook her head. \u201cI do not know.\u201d She sat down on a nearby stone and patted on the spot next to her. \u201cSit down, I have something to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun paused for a moment but still sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of person do you think my grandfather, Duke Gordan, is?\u201d Claire asked seriously. \u201cI want to listen to an objective viewpoint.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Claire\u2019s solemn expression, Leng Lingyun understood Claire was serious. After some thinking, he responded sincerely. \u201cHe is no simple individual. Someone who is able to maintain the Hill clan\u2019s status for so long and even able to have the emperor fear them is no ordinary person.\u201d Leng Lingyun paused, then added with hesitation, \u201cThis individual is extraordinarily cunning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire switched to another topic. \u201cHas the Temple not chosen a prince yet either? In other words, the pope is waiting to see which prince has a better chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe so.\u201d Leng Lingyun nodded.</p><br/><p>Claire frowned, switching back. \u201cGrandfather must be waiting also. His position is not definite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I have heard the captain of the Griffin Squad, Eric, your second brother, is very close to the crown prince whereas rumors say you are close to the second prince.\u201d This was the reason why no one could tell which prince the Hill clan was supporting.</p><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

This person\u2019s skin was truly thick. It was unknown what he was thinking!</p><br/><p>Jonathan pointed to the surrounding buildings and introduced them. In his heart, he had long since become interested in this red-haired youth. From his outstanding performance in the first round of the examination to the fact that he had sent a 6-star student flying just now, Jonathan was curious and puzzled.</p><br/><p>This red-haired youth clearly didn\u2019t have a deep cultivation, so why did he always have such shocking moves? What secrets did he have?</p><br/><p>Jonathan smiled, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, that is the library of our school.\u201d They were divided into ten levels, which was of course based on their status and power. I can go to the ninth floor. \u201cOne day, I will be able to ascend to the highest floor.\u201d Jonathan shook his head proudly, then turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>There was no one behind him. The only thing that could be seen was the wind blowing the leaves around in the air.</p><br/><p>Where is he? Jonathan was shocked. The red-haired youth had actually disappeared from his back just like that? He had not noticed it at all!</p><br/><p>After a while, Jonathan left slowly. However, he couldn\u2019t let it go.</p><br/><p>Beside the lake, a gentle breeze blew. Under the sunlight, the shadows of the trees were mottled. Qi Ao Shuang sat quietly on a bench by the lake, closing her eyes to sort out her thoughts. The Star Trial was still a few months away. With his current strength, how far would he be able to go?</p><br/><p>Broken Space \u2026</p><br/><p>What does it look like?</p><br/><p>What happened to Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun? Qi Ao Shuang slowly stretched out her hand to touch the two earrings on her right ear, but her heart was heavy.</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Ao Shuang was deep in thought, she was interrupted by a voice. Xiao Ao Shuang slightly frowned, this place was so quiet, and there were people here, and it seemed like there was more than one person.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bitch, you\u2019re always trying to confuse people with your face. \u201cToday, I will tear your face apart!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, why are you pretending?\u201d \u201cYou little bitch, what else can you do other than pretend to be innocent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I\u2019ll let you know, acting cocky will be \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>At first glance, it seemed that a few women had surrounded a petite girl and were cursing at her. The woman in the middle didn\u2019t make a sound and just stood there with her hands on her hips.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang did not want to get involved in troublesome matters, and even more so, did not want to be a hero trying to save a beauty. The best thing to do at the moment was to slap your ass and run away. Xiao Ao Shuang stood up and was about to leave, but she suddenly stepped on a small branch, causing cracking sounds to ring out.</p><br/><p>The people on the other side noticed and shouted coldly, \u201cWho is it?\u201d \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not reply, only showing them her back as she continued walking forward.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of this moment, the woman who was surrounded ran out. However, he ran straight towards Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bitch!\u201d \u201cStop right there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang turned around and saw a group of women chasing after them. This group of women wore three small golden stars on their chests.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, save me!\u201d The young girl who rushed in front of Qi Ao Shuang looked to be around fourteen or fifteen years old. Her petite body trembled slightly, but her curves were beautiful. She had big eyes under long eyelashes, a round face, small lips, and skin that could be broken by the wind. She was a cute little beauty. At this moment, his face was filled with panic. He hurriedly hid behind Qi Ao Shuang and reached out his hand to grab onto the hem of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s clothes. He refused to let go no matter what. She wore two small stars on her chest.</p><br/><p>Oh? It seemed like a show where the strong bullied the weak?</p><br/><p>However, was that really the case?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis student, don\u2019t be fooled by her appearance.\u201d \u201cShe is always showing off her pitiful appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle slut, you\u2019re using this move again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for you to do here. You can leave now and leave that little slut behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a few ladies who came chasing after him, some who tried to persuade him in a friendly manner, and some who spoke ill of him. But there was anger in their eyes. They seemed to have suffered losses from this young girl before.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, big brother, don\u2019t give me to them.\u201d They are not good people. \u201d The girl behind Qi Ao Shuang trembled even more as she begged in a low voice. A trace of mockery flashed in her eyes as she stuck her head out from behind Qi Aoshuang and winked at the group of girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d The leader of the women was so angry that she trembled. Damn Parina, she\u2019d pretend to be innocent and take advantage of a man\u2019s mentality. They were the victims, but the men always protected her. Because she always acted cute and pitiful! Last time, his boyfriend almost broke up because of this little bitch arguing with him. He had to teach her a lesson!</p><br/><p>The other women also looked furious. However, they didn\u2019t make a move when they saw the red-haired man in front of them. There were no marks on his clothes. He was a freshman, but if this matter were to spread, it would cause a huge disturbance.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang remained silent, not saying anything.</p><br/><p>The girl behind him pulled on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s sleeves and said with a trembling voice, \u201cBig brother, save me. Take me away.\u201d They, they want to tear my face apart. \u201d</p><br/><p>Parina\u2019s voice trembled as she said these words. Her tone seemed very afraid, but behind Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s back, she was making faces at those girls. It seemed to announce another victory. Men, all that shit. Be merciful to the fairer sex, haha, then let them be merciful to the fairer sex.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Qi Ao Shuang moved.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and the other ladies looked at Qi Ao Shuang warily.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang did something that surprised everyone. She coldly turned around and stretched out her hand, grabbing onto Parina\u2019s collar before throwing her out and pushing her in front of the group of girls.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother?!\u201d Tears welled up in Parina\u2019s eyes as she stared at Qi Ao Shuang in disbelief. There was an indescribable charm in his eyes when he looked at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression was cold, and she did not even look at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d The group of women chasing after him were all stunned. This was the first time he had seen her ruthlessly thrown out by a man. The men looked at Parina\u2019s lovely face, her pitiful expression. Which one of them didn\u2019t want to protect her first? But this red-haired youth was so cold.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang couldn\u2019t be bothered with him, and was about to leave in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, you can\u2019t leave! Don\u2019t ignore me!\u201d Help me, I, I\u2019m scared. \u201cWuuuuu, I\u2019m so afraid of them ~ They want to scratch my face.\u201d Parina looked pitifully at Qi Ao Shuang, her sparkling tears sparkling in her big eyes. Her long eyelashes trembled, and her face was pale and transparent. Her petite body trembled slightly. It looked so pitiful, so heart-wrenching. She took two steps forward and tightly held onto the hem of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou slut \u2026\u201d The leader of the women was about to shout coldly, but she didn\u2019t finish her words.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Ao Shuang turned around, reached out her hand and mercilessly slapped away Parina\u2019s little hand, and said in a low voice, \u201cDisgusting.\u201d His tone was filled with disgust and disdain.</p><br/><p>After speaking, Qi Ao Shuang didn\u2019t turn back as she dashed forward.</p><br/><p>Parina stood there foolishly, watching Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s determined figure. Her heart was raging. The words and the look in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes before she left seemed to be engraved in her heart. For the first time, a man looked at her with disgust and disdain. It was the first time that a man didn\u2019t show any mercy to her. Furthermore, he was using his Deception Eye!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, little slut, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ll do today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, bitch, I didn\u2019t expect you to be humiliated one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see that person\u2019s eyes? You\u2019re a piece of trash!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of women standing behind Parina were laughing so hard that they leaned back and forth while constantly speaking malicious words to humiliate Parina. How could they not be happy when they saw for the first time that a man was not tempted by Parina?</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Parina turned and looked at the laughing group. After a cold snort, he looked at the crowd silently.</p><br/><p>The group of women were all stunned. At this moment, Parina was no longer as pitiful as she was before. She was no longer as panicked as she was when they first surrounded her. At this moment, her face was ice-cold, and her eyes were terrifyingly cold. Just being stared at by her made him feel a sense of pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cB * tch! B * tch!\u201d \u201cWe will make you pay the price today!\u201d The leader of the women was a bit flustered but immediately shook her head to drive away this annoying feeling. After all, the other party was only a 2-star student. They were all 3-star students. What are you afraid of?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d I don\u2019t want to play with you anymore. \u201cBoring.\u201d Parina coldly spat out a sentence. The next moment, she moved.</p><br/><p>The group of women were stunned. They could only see the afterimage of Parina, who had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang turned around and saw a bunch of water birds flying away from the grove by the lake.</p><br/><p>Was that girl finally showing her true face?</p><br/><p>2-star strength? Hmph. Qi Ao Shuang gave a faint sneer. With his hidden cultivation and charming eyes, would he be harmed by those girls? That girl, although she seemed very cute, very pure and very aggrieved, she was absolutely not what she seemed to be. That young girl probably wasn\u2019t simple. Moreover, that young girl should have the identity of a demi-human.</p><br/><p>This academy was really special.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang shook her head lightly, then turned around and returned to her room.</p><br/><p>As soon as Xiao Ao Shuang left, Parina crawled out. Looking at the departing back of Xiao Ao Shuang, he narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>This red-haired guy was rather interesting.</p><br/><p>Hmph, but I don\u2019t believe I can\u2019t take you. Just you wait, you must kneel under this lady\u2019s dress! Make you delirious!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Walter squinted as he looked up at the grape rack, satisfied. He pretended he didn\u2019t notice that a few people were standing.</p><br/><p>Indoors, the girl watched Camille make tea skillfully, and after hesitating for a while, finally said weakly, \u201cUm, benefactor, I still don\u2019t know your names. Are you all planning on entering the Mountain of Lost Souls to adventure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we are planning on entering the Mountain of Lost Souls. Names are just a formality. The person who saved you is our commander, White Little Moon, and we are Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps.\u201d Camille answered the question good naturedly with a refined manner.</p><br/><p>White Little Moon? The girl stiffened slightly. Wasn\u2019t this name a little effeminate? Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps? What a strange name.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Mountain of Lost Souls is very dangerous.\u201d The girl started to speak softly. \u201cBut you guys are all so strong, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille finished making tea, then smiled as he said before leaving, \u201cYou must be hoping our commander doesn\u2019t have any problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s face instantly flushed red. She immediately covered her face, watching Camille from behind and rejoiced that he didn\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander, drink tea.\u201d Camille gracefully poured tea for Claire then poured another cup for him. He didn\u2019t take care of anyone else.</p><br/><p>Walter angrily grabbed the teapot and drank right out of it, making Summer and Qiao Chuxin roll their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecondary Commander\u2019s skills are unparalleled in the world.\u201d Claire sipped some rugosa rose tea and felt her whole being revive.</p><br/><p>Camille was smiling so widely his eyes had become lines. Everyone else suspected that if he had a tail, it would have already been wagging furiously.</p><br/><p>Walter set down the teapot, watching Claire coldly. He didn\u2019t understand why the little devil liked scented tea so much, her favorite drink was scented tea. From his understanding, the little devil had such nasty character, completely incompatible with scented tea, such a grandiose thing. She should be someone with knives and devouring raw meat!</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter, your gaze seems to be a little displeased with me?\u201d Suddenly Claire\u2019s chilling voice came over dangerously.</p><br/><p>Walter stiffened for a moment, then smiled widely. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare, heh heh, haha\u2026\u201d His forced hollow laugh echoed in the garden, as fake as could be.</p><br/><p>The young lady was a bit uncomfortable as she stood at the door and watched the group of people in the garden. Under the sunlight, the group looked so aesthetically beautiful, like a flawless painting, making her not have the heart to go and break the mood. She felt like if she joined, she would be so out of place. The girl watched a little absent mindedly.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, a thunder of footsteps sounded from outside the garden.</p><br/><p>A few young men ran over, panting, and shouted to the girl anxiously, \u201cRiya, trouble! Your little brother was attacked by a magic beast and is at the mountain pass right now. He\u2019s on the verge of death, you need to quickly go see him for the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Riya\u2019s complexion instantly paled. She looked at the few young men at the entrance of the garden in disbelief, her mind blank. \u201cWhat happened? He was completely fine this morning!\u201d The young men all knew Riya, they were all her little brother\u2019s good friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk anymore, you should take this time to leave. Even the doctor is powerless.\u201d The young men were completely anxious.</p><br/><p>Only then did Riya come back to her sense. She hurriedly departed, rushing out. She ran over quickly with the young men.</p><br/><p>After finishing the scented tea, Claire slowly stood up and said, \u201cGo, let\u2019s go see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when were you so kind hearted?\u201d Walter muttered, followed by a earth shaking miserable cry. Casually, Claire had ruthlessly bonked the Azure Ripple Sword on Walter\u2019s head, hitting him so hard a bump immediately formed on Walter\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>They followed the people ahead out the town, going directly to the Mountain of Lost Soul\u2019s mountain pass.</p><br/><p>They saw from far away a group forming while the girl from before, Riya, was already sobbing, heartbroken.</p><br/><p>As Claire strode forward, she saw in Riya\u2019s embrace a young man who looked a bit similar completely covered in blood. His eyes were already closed, his face drained of color. Nearby, a person who looked like a doctor shook his head, sighing. The group of young men were also looking grieved.</p><br/><p>Claire turned and looked at Camille and Camille glared back. The meaning in his eyes was clear: I\u2019m an assassin, not a doctor nor a healer.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s gave shifted to everyone else, but they all shook their head. Only now was Claire suddenly shocked and realized. In her mercenary group, they actually didn\u2019t have a doctor or healer!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are all fatal wounds, there\u2019s no way for medicine to contain the damage. If there was a healer right now, perhaps they would be hope,\u201d Li Yuewen said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Claire watched Riya cry mournfully, the girl\u2019s heart completely broken, and sighed in her heart. Suddenly, a thought flashed in her mind: if only Leng Lingyun were here.</p><br/><p>The next moment, silver hair flashed before CLaire\u2019s eyes. Claire\u2019s lips quivered slightly as she laughed at herself, laughing internally that she wanted it so much that she had actually hallucinated.</p><br/><p>But the holy light that appeared right after told Claire it wasn\u2019t a hallucination. The silver haired violet eyed Leng Lingyun really was there! He was crouching down for healing the young man who was about to die.</p><br/><p>Claire blinked rapidly, confirming that she hadn\u2019t been hallucinating.</p><br/><p>Camille seemed to understand why Claire was blinking, so he shifted over and said in a low voice, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to blink any more, he just arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire opened her mouth wide, then reflexively turned around, but didn\u2019t see anyone else from the Temple of Light. It was only Leng Lingyun who had suddenly appeared!</p><br/><p>Thankful cries of thanks and admiration pulled Claire back to reality. The blood of the young man in Riya\u2019s embrace had already stopped flowing. Although his complexion was pale as before, his breathing became stable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, healer, thank you for saving my brother\u2019s life.\u201d Riya cried out joyfully, thanking him wholeheartedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to thank me, it was nothing.\u201d Everybody heard Leng Lingyun\u2019s cold voice.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s stared at Leng Lingyun who was in front of her with bulging eyes. She stared at him for a long time without saying anything. Her mind was full of questions. Why did Leng Lingyun suddenly appear here? Why was he alone? Was it to find her and take her back to support the Temple of Light?</p><br/><p>Walter\u2019s expression was extremely entertaining. His enemy was right in front of him, his enemy!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Walter uttered a strange cry and rushed forward, then used all of his might to slap Leng Lingyun\u2019s face and brought him to the ground. He didn\u2019t wait for Leng Lingyun to come back to his senses and kicked his stomach, and then, with more power, stepped onto his enemy\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019ll crush you, I\u2019ll spit on you. Pah!\u201d Walter hacked up a large glob of phlegm and spit it on Leng Lingyun\u2019s head. Then he started to kick and stomp crazily, and then he laughed heartily towards the sky, extremely proud. He finally stomped that damn pretty boy underfoot! \u201cDie, you pretty boy! I want you to have a taste of death too! Ahaha, haha\u2026.\u201d Walter\u2019s mad laughter echoed into the horizon. \u201cThere would a day you be crushed underfoot by me. The incomparably honorable Divine Prince has that day. Be me for forgiveness, perhaps I\u2019m in a good enough mood to let you go!\u201d Walter howled with laughter, about to buckle over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter, what are you doing? Why are you laughing to yourself?\u201d Suddenly, he heard a low voice filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>Walter came back to his senses, stared at Summer whose face was full of puzzlement, and then coldly humphed. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to care!\u201d Walter rolled his eyes at Leng Lingyun who was currently conversing with Claire right with a heart full of hatred. What, he can\u2019t fantasize? Was he not allowed to imagine the scene of him stepping on the pretty boy?</p><br/><p>The previous scene was naturally Walter\u2019s own imaginary scene. What was really happening was Leng Lingyun talking to Claire in his clean, neat clothes with his usual noble aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Prince, why did you appear here?\u201d Claire asked as she looked at Leng Lingyun who was smiling faintly. She had endless questions to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me so distantly, do you wish for me to call you Bishop?\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled faintly. \u201cPlease call me by my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire was slightly startled, thinking of the fact that Leng Lingyun had always called her Claire. Since he had said this, then continuing to call him the \u201cDivine Prince\u201d would seem a bit strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng, Leng Lingyun, why did you suddenly come here?\u201d Claire had some difficulty calling out his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m working for someone.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled as he spoke, but didn\u2019t say anything past that.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at Leng Lingyun, confused. \u201cThen what did the person that sent you here wanted you to do? You didn\u2019t come here just for that youth.\u201d An ineffable and strange feeling suddenly arose in Claire\u2019s heart. Working for someone? It shouldn\u2019t be the pope, if it was the pope, then he wouldn\u2019t be chatting so casually. If it wasn\u2019t the pope, then who was it? When Leng Lingyun saw her, he wasn\u2019t surprised. Could it be that he knew beforehand that she would be there?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should first bring the young man home.\u201d Leng Lingyun didn\u2019t answer, but changed the topic instead. He looked at Riya, saying, \u201cAre you his family member? Take him home first, he needs good care. I only healed his wound, but he has lost a lot of blood already and weakened so he has to rest for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of people took Riya and her little brother back home. Riya took care of her little brother inside while Claire sat on a chair in the garden looking at the relaxed Leng Lingyun with a heart full of confusion. What was this cold faced person planning?</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, you. If the the healer wasn\u2019t here then you would have died, stop talking about the deity beast!\u201d Riya\u2019s angry yell came from inside the house.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

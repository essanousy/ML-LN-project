His heart was in turmoil. He could not calm down. The image in the mirror just now was just a flash, but it was deeply engraved in Jonathan\u2019s heart. There was no mistake. That figure was definitely a woman!</p><br/><p>That is to say, Xiao Aushuang, is he really a woman?</p><br/><p>Dittos walked past Jonathan expressionlessly. He looked at Jonathan, who was still in a daze. Jonathan\u2019s expression was extremely strange.</p><br/><p>Jonathan sensed that Dittos was looking at him. He put the mirror away and hurried after him. However, the inexplicable emotion in the depths of her eyes immediately concealed itself. Jonathan hurried after him. When they arrived at the entrance of the Heavenly Tower, Qi Ao Shuang had already entered, and the two of them chased after her without a word.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xiao Ao Shuang rushed inside. She was already very familiar with the terrain, but that didn\u2019t mean that Parina\u2019s brother Brill knew about it. Therefore, Xiao Ao Shuang quickly gave chase. The indifferent figure in the distance, the chestnut colored hair, the tall and straight back, as well as the black clothes she wore.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrill!\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang called out from afar and stopped the people walking in front.</p><br/><p>Brill turned around and narrowed his eyes at the people who were rushing over. Without thinking, he shouted out Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s name, \u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d Not the tone of doubt, but certainty. The extraordinary youth that her sister Parina spoke of should be her. His hair was fiery red, and his eyes were cold and resolute.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang rushed to the front of Brill, nodded, and looked at Brill from head to toe. After confirming that the man in front of her was unharmed, she was finally able to relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Brill looked into Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes and said in a deep voice. He could tell that this red-haired youth was truly worried for him. His sister\u2019s vision was really good. The aura that this youth emitted from between his brows was very different from that of an ordinary person. It was only a matter of time before this youth stepped into the Space Shattering Realm. Brill looked at Qi Ao Shuang with much friendlier eyes. Firstly, he was worried for her, and secondly, it was because of his sister, Parina. His burning gaze made Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hair stand on end. However, how could she have imagined that the other party had already treated him like a brother-in-law?</p><br/><p>\u201cParina\u2019s worried about you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang paused for a moment, looking at the person in front of her as she spoke slowly, \u201cThis Heavenly Tower, even the first eight floors won\u2019t have much trouble for you.\u201d \u201cThe key point is the ninth floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the dean wants me to go to the ninth floor.\u201d Brill nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat level\u2026\u201d Dangerous. I didn\u2019t go up there. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned, her mind naturally thinking of the mysterious man in white.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to or can\u2019t?\u201d As expected, Brill was no ordinary person. He immediately asked the crucial question.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Someone stopped me. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang lowered her eyes and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it a man in white?\u201d Brill asked such a shocking question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly lifted her head and asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen him before. I just entered the Heavenly Pagoda and met him. He told me not to go up the ninth floor even if I could.\u201d Brill went on thoughtfully. \u201cHe seems to know something we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He just kept us waiting.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang bit her lips gently as she thought back to the mysterious man.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think \u2026\u201d Brill was about to speak when Jonathan\u2019s voice came from a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang!\u201d \u201cWait for us!\u201d As the sound grew closer, Jonathan and Dittos caught up with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you guys come as well?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned around to look at the two approaching people and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Jonathan stared at Qi Ao Shuang and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just came in, how could anything happen to me?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan suspiciously. She felt that there was something wrong with his tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re fine.\u201d Jonathan also seemed to feel that something was wrong with him. He replied in an embarrassed low voice and did not say anything else.</p><br/><p>A cold light flashed across Dittos\u2019 eyes as he silently looked at Brill.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos, why are you here as well?\u201d Xiao Aoshuang looked at Dentance in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, let\u2019s take a look.\u201d Dittas replied coldly and did not say anything else.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere immediately turned stiff. Jonathan lowered his head slightly but kept glancing at her out of the corner of his eye. His eyes seemed to be drifting and hesitant at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to do next?\u201d \u201cDo you want to go up and take a look?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned to look at Brill and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brill shook his head slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt something was wrong.\u201d \u201cI always had a feeling that once I step into the Space Shattering Realm, what awaits me is not another world, but death.\u201d When Brill said this, his tone was flat and his emotions were natural.</p><br/><p>After Brill said this, everyone\u2019s expressions changed. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face sank, because she could faintly feel that what Brill said was the truth. This was the reason why the mysterious man stopped them from entering the ninth floor. But what exactly did the Star Academy want to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering about that, too. But I can\u2019t find out. \u201cOur family can\u2019t find any clues either.\u201d Jonathan spoke in a hoarse voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang was stunned, she did not expect that there were more than one or two people who had such suspicions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d \u201cEven so, I still want to make a breakthrough.\u201d At this point of time, the tone of the voice was as cold as ever, calm and collected. The conversation between the crowd just now had not affected his emotions in the slightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos, you \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned slightly, \u201cDid you sense something earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cThe first person to reach the eighth level of the trial on his first try, do you really think that you have only reached the eighth level?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jonathan frowned and asked cautiously.</p><br/><p>Brill, too, looked stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person reached the ninth level!\u201d Moreover, he successfully broke through the Void Shattering Realm, and then discovered some unknown secret, which is why he broke with the Star Academy and wanted to destroy the Star Heavenly Pagoda! \u201d With a cold glare in his eyes, Dickens clearly stated his guesses word by word, but it was also the truth!</p><br/><p>The expressions of the crowd changed drastically, and Qi Ao Shuang was even more alarmed. In other words, that mysterious man in white clothes was the one who tried to destroy the Sky Tower! It was the person who had passed the ninth level on his first try. Yes, that must be it. All sorts of thoughts were connected in his mind, becoming clearer and clearer.</p><br/><p>However, since he had already broken through the Space Shattering Realm, how could he still remain in this plane and fight against the people from the Star Academy?</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, there is one thing I do not understand. He has already broken through to the Space Shattering Realm, but he is still able to freely travel through this world.\u201d Dylan frowned slightly, whispering the same question that Qi Ao Shuang had.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, I really don\u2019t know.\u201d However, one thing is certain, there is a net behind the Star Academy that we do not know about. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang had a serious look on her face, and before anyone could say anything, she lifted her head and said resolutely: \u201cHowever, even so, I will still step into the Void Shattering Realm, and I will definitely step into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d \u201cYou, you know it\u2019s dangerous, but you still want to go?\u201d Jonathan did not notice that he had changed the way he referred to Qi Ao Shuang and the current Ao Shuang. His tone was also abnormally worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am going, I must go.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not hesitate as she nodded with determination.</p><br/><p>A satisfied smile flashed across Dittos\u2019 eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, don\u2019t go. It\u2019s so dangerous!\u201d Jonathan was so anxious that he could not speak properly. Looking at Jonathan\u2019s anxious expression, a hint of doubt flashed in Dittos\u2019 eyes, but it was only a flash. Jonathan did seem a little unusual. But it seemed to make sense. Jonathan knew Dittos\u2019s character, and once the decision was made, it was only natural that Jonathan would not advise him. However, the attitude towards Qi Ao Shuang seemed a little unusual, but also seemed to be within reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about this for now. What do we do now?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked around and asked indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to stay in this Heavenly Tower and wait for the man in white to appear again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to the ninth floor yet.\u201d Brill said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cYou can find a better place to rest first in the Sky Tower.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019ll be here again soon.\u201d Dittos turned around and casually threw out those words.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang nodded to Brill, then turned around and followed him. Before Jonathan could regain his senses, his eyes glazed over and he stood still.</p><br/><p>Brill looked at Jonathan suspiciously, but did not call him. All he had to do now was to find a place to settle down.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Jonathan came back to his senses. Looking at the disappearing back of Qi Ao Shuang, his heart sank. Then, his eyes flashed as if he had made up his mind on something, and he quickly chased after them.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Sky Tower, Dittas left. Qi Ao Shuang lowered her head as if she was thinking about something. After Jonathan came out, he looked at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back and without thinking, he rushed in front of Qi Ao Shuang and extended his hand to stop her.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan with a serious face and asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, you can\u2019t go to the ninth level!\u201d \u201cI forbid you to go!\u201d Jonathan said so clearly and forcefully!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Stab. As if she did not know how to feel tired, she continuously impaled the blue haired man on the ground. The hatred that had long been accumulating in her heart was finally exploding.</p><br/><p>After a long time, she finally heard urgent voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>A pair gentle hands grabbed Qi Aoshuang\u2019s wrists, stopping her out of control actions.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang turned around abruptly and met with Feng Yixuan\u2019s pained eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, Aoshuang. It\u2019s over.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s voice carried to Qi Aoshuang\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>The red aura around Qi Aoshuang slowly faded away. Her gaze also regained focus. Without giving the mangled body another glance, Qi Aoshuang turned around and left.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood in place, watching Qi Aoshuang\u2019s leaving figure. He shared a glance with Leng Lingyun. The both silently agreed not to follow. Currently, Qi Aoshuang needed some time alone.</p><br/><p>Everything was in messy. All of them had been killed. After searching through the bodies, they found a small badge that Qi Aoshuang had seen before. It was white with a black bolt of lightning, the emblem of the Black Lightning organization.</p><br/><p>They left the stone forest without a word. Qi Aoshuang led in silence, dragging the sword behind her. Everyone else was also silent as they followed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp\u2026\u201d White Emperor called out worriedly from Leng Lingyun\u2019s shoulder. (Translation: Is Aoshuang ok?)</p><br/><p>\u201cPeep peep!\u201d Black Feather called out from Feng Yixuan\u2019s shoulder. He waved his claws at White Emperor. (Translation: The hell you worried about? Why would she not be ok?)</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi led two camels, following gloomily. And so, Qi Aoshuang walked expressionlessly, the Azure Ripple blade leaving a long mark on the ground. The blood had already dried on the blade. No one stopped her, choosing to find her silently.</p><br/><p>Night slowly descended. Qi Aoshuang finally stopped. She stabbed the sword into the ground and then sat down. Everyone else shared a glance, then all silently walked over. Xi Shaoqi and Xi Shaosi started to set up camp. Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun started a bonfire to prepare their dinner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am seeking the earth spirits and dwarves in order to find something the races own.\u201d Qi Aoshuang slowly became to explain.</p><br/><p>Everyone froze and stopped what they were doing. Qi Aoshuang had never explained why they were looking for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to assemble the God Feather Heaven Slayer.\u201d Qi Aoshuang spoke softly. Currently, Qi Aoshuang had calmed down. When she saw everyone working diligently, she had felt a sliver of warmth in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Xi Shaoqi frowned, not understanding.</p><br/><p>No one else spoke. They all knew that now Qi Aoshuang had spoken this much, she would tell them what it was and why she was looking for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe God Feather Heaven Slayer is a matching set of god slaying relics. The Heaven Slayer is a pike, the God Feather a shield.\u201d Qi Aoshuang spoke softly, but her words were like a stone thrown into a peaceful pond, causing ripples and stirrings in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Crunch! Xi Shaoqi pinched what he was holding into pieces. Everyone stopped what they were doing, silently watching Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese relics have been split among the many races. The dwarves and earth spirits have a part, the beastmen and dragons too. Only when they are all assembled can they display boundless might. It can kill the goddess of Light.\u201d Qi Aoshuang looked at her Azure Ripple blade. This weapon was only a sub-relic, incapable of killing the goddess of Light, however the God Feather Heaven Slayer was created by the Father god. Naturally, its power goes without saying.</p><br/><p>Everyone had a look of shock.</p><br/><p>Before they could start asking her questions, Qi Aoshuang continued on quietly, \u201cThe god of Darkness told me.\u201d After she said this, everyone had different expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if humanity\u2019s power surpasses them, they have a Godhead*. Even if we kill the goddess of Light, she can rely on her Godhead to rebirth another body. However, this artifact cann shatter her Godhead so that she can never be reborn,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said icily.</p><br/><p>*Throwback to prologue: a godhead is a personality/trait/nature/stone that appears when you cultivate enough and enables you to become an immortal/god</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are closest to the dwarves currently, so are we visiting them first?\u201d Xi Shaoqi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we are closest to the merfolk.\u201d Qi Aoshuang shook her head. \u201cWe shall visit the merfolk first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Then\u2026\u201d Xi Shaoqi started to say before suddenly remembering something and shutting up. There could only be one reason why Qi Aoshuang had not sent the Temple of Darkness to find the merfolk: she already knew where they were.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the merfolk should treat that item like a treasure.\u201d Xi Shaosi stroked his chin thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d said Feng Yixuan. \u201cEvery race cares about different things. They might not view it as a treasure. Furthermore, they cannot assemble the artifact themselves, so to them, it should not have much use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dwarves are most fond of metallurgy and cherish their beards the most. The earth spirits love to dig and build. The dragon race, of course, loves money and treasure. I am not certain about the merfolk\u2026\u201d Xi Shaosi frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, we\u2019re in the middle of a desert. How are we closest to the merfolk?\u201d Xi Shaoqi tilted his head questioningly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, they are in the deep sea. The merfolk love to live in clean seawater. They value secluded and cleanly areas.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Miss, we don\u2019t know what the merfolk like. However, I am certain they will dislike us.\u201d Xi Shaosi sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey hate humans the most,\u201d Leng Lingyun said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe terrible crimes humanity has committed against merfolk is too disgusting to describe.\u201d Xi Shaoqi shrugged, then continued, frowning. \u201cBecause their tears become the highest quality pearls, they are captured and tortured in any way imaginable so that they can cry. Some even sell merfolk eyes as precious pearls. After killing the merfolk, they dry out the corpses and turn them into candles. There are so many atrocities, I can\u2019t be bothered to list them all.\u201d Xi Shaoqi curled his lip and stopped talking.</p><br/><p>All of a suddenly, they knew it would be extremely difficult to assemble the artifact.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see once we get there. If they aren\u2019t willing, we\u2019ll just steal it,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said righteously.</p><br/><p>Everyone broke out in cold sweat. How could someone act so righteously when talking about stealing?</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, we should not need to. The merfolk are extremely proud. Provided that humans treat them graciously, it might be another story.\u201d Leng Lingyun looked down and pondered.</p><br/><p>\u201cGraciously?\u201d Feng Yixuan smacked a fist into his palm excitedly. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The Xi brothers asked at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a hidden harbor of Yowusali, there is an enclosure that raises merfolk, specifically captured merfolk. Once the merfolk become mature, they give the merfolk a drug, cut their tails, make them grow two legs, and then sell them to humans,\u201d Feng Yixuan explained. \u201cThe merfolk are an extremely beautiful race, and before they come of age, they are genderless. Only after maturing do they select their gender. However, the merfolk and forced to select their gender based off of clientele wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Feng, how do you know so much?\u201d Xi Shaoqi started to look at Feng Yixuan in a strange manner, then whispered, \u201cCould it be that you bought a mermaid\u2026\u201d Before Xi Shaoqi could finish speaking, he was cut off by Feng Yixuan\u2019s murderous gaze. He immediately swallowed back his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe enclosure originally wanted our Feng clan to become investors. Although it is an extremely profitable business, my father believed it was too cruel and refused. Of course, we also don\u2019t have the authority to interfere,\u201d Feng Yixuan said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your plan to save those captured merfolk?\u201d Leng Lingyun asked seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd destroy the place while we\u2019re at it.\u201d Feng Yixuan nodded. \u201cThe merfolk will definitely repay such a great favor. At the very least, they will not attack us when we enter the underwater kingdom, even if we don\u2019t get a warm welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where the enclosure is?\u201d Xi Shaoqi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Feng Yixuan replied honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck, why are you telling us about it then?\u201d Xi Shaoqi cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot. Why can\u2019t we just find it?\u201d Feng Yixuan retorted disdainfully. Xi Shaoqi\u2019s face whitened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Xi Shaoqi clenched his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of an idiot.\u201d Feng Yixuan rolled his eyes and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it with you!\u201d Xi Shaoqi threw himself at Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you can beat me?\u201d Feng Yixuan dodged agiley and clicked his tongue derisively.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi had face planted into the ground and started to spit out sand continuously continuously.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang watched on with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan had been focused on teasing Xi Shaoqi, but he noticed Qi Aoshuang\u2019s rare smile. He let out a sigh of relief in his heart.</p><br/><p>When Leng Lingyun saw Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression, an indescribable feeling flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack Lightning won\u2019t give up now,\u201d Leng Lingyun suddenly said. \u201cThe first time, we tasted their strength. This time, we only broke the barrier from Qi Aoshuang\u2019s knowledge of the Spiritual Eye. What about next time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes also became cold. This time, it was really a lucky coincidence she knew how to break the spell. If she didn\u2019t know about the Spiritual Eye, then perhaps they truly would have been trapped. She had been able to kill them this time because of her increased strength, but how strong were they compared to the rest of Black Lightning? If they were the weakest ones, how powerful was the organization\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She shot multiple arrows without slowing at the people in the cavern.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, you animals!\u201d Qiao Chuxin seethed. She did not hold back, her magic arrows shooting towards the peoples\u2019 heads and chests. Blood spurted in flowery droplets in the entire cavern, splashing into the pool.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan finally realized what was happening. He ran out of his room and was shocked see Qiao Chuxin. He called out to her, but as if she did not hear him, Qiao Chuxin shot a vicious arrow at Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi! Qiao Chuxin! It\u2019s me, Feng Yixuan!\u201d Feng Yixuan yelled as he dodged the arrow. Suddenly, he became annoyed. Currently, he was a woman, which must have been why Qiao Chuxing had not recognized him.</p><br/><p>The Xi brother were wide eyed, mouth agape at the merciless girl who had suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cQiao Chuxin?\u201d Leng Lingyun also discovered Qiao Chuxin. Just as he said this, Qiao Chuxing\u2019s magic arrow viciously greeted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned at the malicious Qiao Chuxin. He immediately flashed over to Feng Yixuan\u2019s side. He had the same thought as Feng Yixuan, that perhaps Qiao Chuxin wasn\u2019t able to recognize him now that he had transformed into a woman.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Leng Lingyun rejected this notion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Leng Lingyun, why are you dressing as a woman?\u201d a familiar voice said. Leng Lingyun looked at the source of the voice to see a vulgar figure hide behind Qiao Chuxin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Fenghou?\u201d Leng Lingyun was confused. From what he remembered, Dong Fenghou was normally reticent, his speech always jumbled, but currently, his words were clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHide first. When Chuxing gets emotional, she cannot differentiate between enemy and foe. Be careful,\u201d Dong Fenghou vulgarly crouched down behind a stone and warned Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>Cannot differentiate between enemy and foe?!</p><br/><p>\u201cChuxin.\u201d Qi Aoshuang arrived at Qiao Chuxin\u2019s side with a light step of her foot.</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d A few people said at the same time. Qi Aoshuang\u2019s guard was currently lowered against the dangerous Qiao Chuxin!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Qi Aoshuang was already at Qiao Chuxin\u2019s side. White Emperor and Black Feather were crouched on each shoulder, staring at Qiao Chuxin. Everyone\u2019s heart was clenched. Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun were about to rush over and save her.</p><br/><p>But something shocking happened next. Qiao Chuxin set down her bow and head tilted, looking at Qi Aoshuang curiously. Suddenly, she flung her bow behind her, hitting Dong Fenghou squarely on the head. Dong Fenghou clutched his head in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026\u201d Qiao Chuxin grabbed Qi Aoshuang into a bear hug and started to weep. She felt extremely wronged, her heart in pain. \u201cClaire, what happened? Exactly what on earth happened? When I heard what happened between you and the Temple of Light, I was so worried. I have been looking for you all this time, waaaaaaaaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou\u2019s mouth gaped. Stupefied, he turned to Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun, then said embarrassedly, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, I don\u2019t know either. No one could stop Qiao Chuxin whenever she was berserk.\u201d It seems Dong Fenghou had learned this through bitter experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cChuxin\u2026\u201d Qi Aoshuang gently patted Qiao Chuxin\u2019s back. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Aren\u2019t I just fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean just fine? You even turned into a man, waaaaaaaah\u2026.\u201d Qiao Chuxing started to cry even more sorrowfully.</p><br/><p>Everyone had a strange expression and looked at each other in dismay. Qi Aoshuang didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cDid you forget about the gender changing potion? We all drank some in order to avoid the assassin the Temple sent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Only then did Qiao Chuxin realize, but she was still a little confused.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the entire cavern started to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cBusiness first, talk later.\u201d Dong Fenghou stood up impatiently. \u201cI summoned a few sea beasts. They are currently breaking the underwater metal net. This pool is connected to the ocean. Let\u2019s save the mermaids first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. We came here to save the mermaids. Who knew that we would bump into you? It\u2019s a miracle.\u201d Qiao Chuxing was beyond pleased, radiating happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLead the merfolk out through the underwater current. We\u2019ll destroy this place while we\u2019re at it,\u201d Dong Fenghou said hurriedly as he handed Qiao Chuxin back her bow.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun did not waste any words, lifting up the entire metal net out of the water. Xi Shaosi and Xi Shaoqi rescued mermaids out from the rooms and ran back and forth from the pool. The mermaids in the pool attended to the rescued mermaids.</p><br/><p>The cavern started to shake more seriously. Debris started to smash down, arousing painful cries. The people Qiao Chuxin had pinned to stones could not move. Many could only watch on blankly as huge stones smashed down onto their bodies.</p><br/><p>All the mermaids in the stone rooms were eventually rescued and returned back to the pool. Up until now, even with the unexpected disturbance, the mermaids had been calm, because they understood that these people were here to save them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d With a flick of Feng Yixuan\u2019s finger, large barrier surrounded everyone. As he gently raised his hand, the barrier brought everyone into the water. The water was turbid. All the mermaids surrounded them, waiting expectantly. Suddenly, there was a low, deep call. The water started to flow.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d Dong Fenghou pointed. \u201cStraight that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan controlled the barrier to move them forward. The mermaids followed closely. The water started to flow even more quickly, the low voice coming closer.</p><br/><p>Straight ahead, they saw a sea beast with a strange appearance that was striking an iron door.</p><br/><p>Bam\u2026</p><br/><p>With a loud explosion, the iron door was finally broken. Feng Yixuan moved them forward as the mermaids emotionally swam at flying speeds. Dong Fenghou extended his right hand, touched the tips of his middle and pinky finger together, then started to chant in a low voice.</p><br/><p>The next moment, a giant sea beast squeezed past them.</p><br/><p>Howl\u2026</p><br/><p>The sea beast opened its mouth wide and emitted a strange voice, then swam furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat place cannot remain.\u201d Dong Fenghao shrugged, casually explaining why he suddenly summoned such a huge sea beast.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned slightly. Of course, she had noticed the change in Dong Fenghao. He was like an entirely different person from the previous Dong Fenghao who only knew how to eat. What exactly happened?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the mermaids swam away as fast as they could.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi watched with wide eyes as the mermaids swam farther and farther away. \u201cIf they leave, how do we go to the underwater kingdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they will wait for us outside.\u201d Dong Fenghou dispelled Xi Shaoqi\u2019s misgivings. \u201cWithout our help, there would be no way for them to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what exactly happened? Why did your hair and eyes turn black? And why did you drink the gender changing potion?\u201d Qiao Chuxin asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled faintly. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk another time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Chuxing was completely worried, but in the end, merely nodded.</p><br/><p>The barrier followed the underwater current all the way to the surface. In the distant night sky, they heard ominous rumbling, the sound of the sea beast Dong Fenghou had summoned wrecking the evil place.</p><br/><p>The barrier bobbed gently on the sea surface. Mermaids surrounded them, watching them with wide eyes. Their gazes were filled with appreciation and hope.</p><br/><p>The mermaids opened their mouths to speak, but no one could understand their language.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Fenghou, quickly translate!\u201d Qiao Chuxin anxiously urged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are thanking us for saving them, but they have many weak companions who are incapable of a long journey. They hope we can escort them to the underworld kingdom. If we agree to protect them, once we arrive at the underwater kingdom, they will reward us greatly,\u201d Dong Fenghou directly translated.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Qiao Chuxing turned to Qi Aoshuang. \u201cAre we going to accompany them back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang nodded. It was their objective, afterall.</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou nodded, then crouched down to say something to the mermaids. The mermaids revealed expressions of happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how will we get there? Get a boat?\u2019 Feng Yixuan stroked his chin. He eyed the barrier. \u201cThis barrier won\u2019t last for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a way.\u201d Dong Fenghou stood up. He clasped his palms together before his chest, then chanted something. However, this time, he seemed chant much longer than before.</p><br/><p>After he finished the incantation, with a loud rumble, a colossus suddenly appeared at the surface before them.</p><br/><p>Everyone was struck by how much larger it was compared to the previous sea beast. What was this creature?</p><br/><p>Moo\u2026</p><br/><p>The sea beast whistled, then suddenly opened its giant mouth. With a sudden gulp, the beast swallowed all the mermaids along with the barrier. All of a sudden, everything was dark.</p><br/><p>Just as Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun were going to make their move, Dong Fenghou hastily stopped them. \u201cDon\u2019t! We are going to rely on it to reach the underwater kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he finished speaking, their surroundings suddenly brightened. They had all been swallowed into the sea beast\u2019s belly. The mermaids started to get frantic, but after Dong Fenghou explained to them, they calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Moomoo cow\u2019s body. It can hold a lot of water, enough for the mermaids to rest. We can rest in the higher level.\u201d Dong Fenghou pointed up. Everyone looked up to see a protruding layer of pink flesh, various ores inlaid. It was because of the ores that it was so bright inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoomoo cow loves to eat, but these things can\u2019t be digested, so they were lodged there,\u201d Dong Fenghou explained. Feng Yixuan moved them up there in the barrier, then dispelled it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe village next to the sea! Dong Fenghou, order the sea beast to create a tsunami that will submerge the village. It\u2019s not a true village, but the base of operations for people selling mermaids.\u201d Qi Aoshuang had not forgotten about the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Right away.\u201d Dong Fenghou closed his eyes. A red dot appeared in his forehead, flickering. Then Dong Fenghou stopped. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, in a moment, the village won\u2019t exist any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, tell me what happened to you guys. Did Summer and Shui Wenmo not accompany you guys?\u201d Qi Aoshuang sat down. She looked at Dong Fenghou mischievously. \u201cAnd Dong Fenghou, you seemed to have become smarter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWha, don\u2019t say that. I just just broke my spiritual restrictions. I was smart from the start.\u201d Dong Fenghou pouted. He touched the flesh wall and told Moomoo cow to swim into the depths of the ocean.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ran into a powerful beast and split up in the middle of running away. We don\u2019t know where they are now either. I heard what happened in Amparkland and immediately started to find you. I know that you didn\u2019t do what the rumors said. The vile Temple of Light framed you!\u201d Qiao Chuxin angrily brandished her fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what exactly happened?\u201d Dong Fenghou\u2019s expression was serious. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t believe in the rumors.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is now Qi Aoshuang,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Aoshuang?\u201d Qiao Chuxing and Dong Fenghou echoed at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, that was my original name.\u201d Next, Qi Aoshuang calmly explained everything. Everyone remained silent. Qiao Chuxin\u2019s teeth had sunk so deeply into her lip that it was bleeding, while the fire in Dong Fenghou\u2019s eyes reached the skies. Though Qi Aoshuang spoke calmly, the two could tell how devastating it must have been.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

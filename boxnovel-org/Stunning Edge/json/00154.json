She could hear Feng Yixuan had unsteady breath, meaning he was injured!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>There was a huge explosion. Claire ran over just in time to see an alluring woman brandishing her broadsword, attacking Feng Yixuan fiercely. Feng Yixuan backed away hurriedly. Fighting in close combat with a warrior was unwise. The slight trickle of red from the corner of Feng Yixuan\u2019s mouth indicated he had an internal injury. The alluring woman didn\u2019t see to be in a hurry to kill Feng Yixuan. Instead, she merely followed closely, forcing him back. Whenever Feng Yixuan cast a spell, the woman would slash it apart with a fierce burst of sword Qi, forcing him back continuously.</p><br/><p>The alluring woman was very strong and fast. Her timing was also impeccable, attacking fluidly, leaving no time for Feng Yixuan to cast a spell back. This was the skill of an experienced expert. Magic, even if it were cast wordlessly, required time to coalesce, but this woman left no time at all.</p><br/><p>The Azure Ripple blade materialized in Claire\u2019s hand. She dashed forward and blocked a strike.</p><br/><p>Clang\u2026</p><br/><p>The sound of blades crossing echoed.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Feng Yixuan was both surprised and pleased.</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent, her expression sharp. From just this one clash, she had determined the opponent\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>The woman was powerful and quick.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?!\u201d The woman hollared angrily. Just when she was about to finish, this brat appeared out of nowhere!</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent, only calm as she blocked the woman\u2019s next attack.</p><br/><p>She only needed to bear the strikes for a moment. Even just one second was enough for Feng Yixuan\u2019s spell to coalesce. As a magician, Feng Yixuan was not as strong or fast as Claire, but his magic was\u2026</p><br/><p>This woman was strong, but not strong enough!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stopped, his eyes furrowing as he concentrated. His finger traced a circle in the air as he said in a low, but firm voice, \u201cWind prison!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, the air started to flow, forming a barrier around the woman. Claire withdrew. The woman tried to give chase, but was thrown back by the wind barrier. The wind blew started to tighten, binding the woman inside.</p><br/><p>Claire raised a brow at the severe, swirling wind. Feng Yixuan had improved quickly in such a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>The woman started to slash away at the barrier.</p><br/><p>Claire put away her sword, then glanced at Feng Yixuan. Their gazes met. Without a word, they both understood.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the woman burst forth with Dou Qi and slashed open the wind barrier, but before she could react, she could only see flames! The woman\u2019s eyes flashed with alarm at the intense heat of the golden flames. She wanted to dodge, but found herself unable to retreat.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was using the wind prison again, trapping the woman along with the flames.</p><br/><p>She wailed and screamed, but Claire and Feng Yixuan did not do anything.</p><br/><p>Claire raised her hand and a spear of golden flames materialized.</p><br/><p>Claire took a step back, then threw with all her might.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the spear whistled towards the wind prison, a sliver in the wind blades appeared, just enough for the spear to shoot inside.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Claire had coordinated seamlessly. It had taken only two minutes starting from when Claire had blocked the woman\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Once again, there were screams, but those soon died down, leaving only a faint burning odor.</p><br/><p>Having finished off the woman, the two looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, why are you here?\u201d Feng Yixuan, although delighted, was slightly worried. The Land of Rebirth was extraordinarily dangerous. He hadn\u2019t been here for long, yet he had already crossed paths with such a powerful individual.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe same reason as you.\u201d Claire watched the wind prison and flames die out. \u201cWhat happened? The senior said he had just sent you over not long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of embarrassment showed Feng Yixuan\u2019s face. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to say the old woman wanted him to become her gigolo and attendant.</p><br/><p>Claire understood immediately. \u201cWe should first inspect our surroundings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Feng Yixuan was let out a sigh of relief that Claire did not continue to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, this is for you.\u201d Claire took out a ring from her interspatial ring.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes widened. He stared blankly at the ring in her hand, unable to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t want it? Then forget about it.\u201d Claire acted as if she were about to put it away.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan snatched it with one swipe, holding it dearly. \u201cI want it! How could I not?\u201d he said hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen form a blood contract.\u201d Claire looked at the blood trickling from Feng Yixuan\u2019s mouth. He didn\u2019t even need to prick his finger.</p><br/><p>After he formed the blood contract, Feng Yixuan started to sense the amount of space and was shocked. Such a large amount of space! Claire had actually given him something this valuable! Where had such a valuable item come from? Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart was moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, are you proposing to me?\u201d Feng Yixuan stroked the ring and smirked. He was back to his old self.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it back,\u201d Claire replied icily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already formed a blood contract.\u201d Feng Yixuan smirked. \u201cThere is no way I will give it up, unless you kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was clutching his eye, howling as he crouched on the ground. Claire\u2019s fist had punched him squarely in the eye. Disregarding Feng Yixuan\u2019s howls, Claire suddenly frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was low. She looked ahead vigilantly.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Feng Yixuan also sensed it. His expression sharpened as he stood up.</p><br/><p>Claire gave signaled to Feng Yixuan with her eyes and the two silently moved away. Hiding their aura was a technique Claire and Feng Yixuan were both experts at.</p><br/><p>The two did not go far, hiding behind a large tree as they watched.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiya sure is troublesome. What did she run off so fast for? The spider city lord selection is still far in the future. Besides, the city lord will choose her husband for her. Miya, that stubborn male chaser,\u201d a voice grumbled, filled with disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know. The city lord\u2019s daughter is going to choose a husband, but the city lord\u2019s son is a pretty boy. Miya ran off wanting to see that pretty boy,\u201d said another voice. It was rough and boorish.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, she doesn\u2019t intend to <i>only</i> see him. But does she think the city lord\u2019s son are like those ordinary people she chased after in the past?\u201d It was the first voice again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The boorish voice humphed. Suddenly, his tone was puzzled. \u201cWhere is that burning smell coming from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Three men came into view. They were all dressed similarly with blue clothes and broadswords strapped to their backs. Their facial features resembled that of the alluring woman. Were these three relatives of the dead woman? They were actually all purely warriors.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d The man walking at the front was the first to notice the corpse. It was already mangled beyond recognition.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Miya\u2019s sword!\u201d One of the other men with keener eyes hurriedly bent down to pick up the sword.</p><br/><p>The three men\u2019s expressions changed greatly. They all stared at the scorched black corpse on the ground, eyes filled with disbelief. That scorched pile of black was their younger sister??</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother! Is\u2026 is that Miya?!\u201d The voice of the man holding the sword shook.</p><br/><p>Claire and Feng Yixuan shared a glance. They slowly crept away quietly. Staying was an unwise decision.</p><br/><p>Just as Claire and Feng Yixuan were far in the distance, the first man raised his head and frowned. He looked towards his right. Was it just his imagination? It felt like there were people there. But this feeling only lasted for a moment as his younger brother\u2019s cry grabbed his attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, it really is Miya, it really is! Ahhhh! How could this have happened! Who was it?! Who killed Miya!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire and Feng Yixuan were still able to hear them, but they only increased their speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Feng Yixuan wiped the dried blood from his mouth. \u201cThose three men were even stronger than that woman. If you hadn\u2019t appeared right on time, I would have been trapped here. Damn old man, he didn\u2019t even tell me clearly what kind of place this is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Feng said that here is survival of the fittest.\u201d Claire frowned slightly, remembering the old man\u2019s words. But wasn\u2019t that true everywhere? However, the old man\u2019s words seem to have another meaning. Did that mean there was no law and order here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, these people are annoying.\u201d Feng Yixuan looked up towards the sky. He originally thought that once he broke his seal and broke through the ninth level of the Heavenly Astral Wind, he would be considered powerful. Who would have thought that he would be nearly defeated the moment he arrived!</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Feng said that if we wanted to return, we must reach the peak of the highest mountain. There, there is a teleportation formation.\u201d Claire gazed into the distance, squinting. Far into the distance, a tall mountain stood, disappearing into the clouds.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His entire body was drenched in sweat as he ran over. He ran until he was a few meters away from Qi Aushuang, then stopped and stood there in a daze. Xiao Ao Shuang and he stared at each other silently.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s expression was extremely complicated. There was happiness, joy, excitement, attachment \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face slowly revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood there, not daring to move forward. He was afraid that if he took another step forward, Qi Ao Shuang would disappear from his sight. He was afraid that the moment he touched her, he would disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God, my land!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang! This is what you really look like, right? \u201cBeautiful!\u201d Suddenly, a voice that Xiao Aushuang was familiar with started to howl. His tone was full of excitement.</p><br/><p>It was the sky!</p><br/><p>Right after he said those words, a small ferret jumped out from Feng Yixuan\u2019s body and was about to pounce onto Qi Ao Shuang, aiming for her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shameless bastard!\u201d Feng Yixuan was quick to react. He grabbed Zhangkong by the tail and pulled him back.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan, you damn pervert!\u201d \u201cYou dare to obstruct my relationship with my woman? Go die!\u201d The sky turned around and aimed its claws at Feng Yixuan\u2019s face with a vicious look. Feng Yixuan screamed incessantly. Then, he did not show any weakness. He grabbed onto Zhangkong\u2019s tail and swung it in a circle in the air. Then, he let go and the sky flew away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts!\u201d \u201cThis coloured element!\u201d Feng Yixuan covered his face as he wailed again and again.</p><br/><p>\u201cServes you right!\u201d I told you to piss me off. \u201cThis young master can fly, but you idiot have already forgotten about that!\u201d The voice of Zhangkong rang out in everyone\u2019s ears once more. With a satisfied expression, he landed on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou pervert!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t touch my mother!\u201d The golden lotus suddenly appeared in time. It grabbed onto the tail of the golden lotus and lifted it into the air, shaking it with all its might. The sky was shaking and he felt dizzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d It\u2019s you, kid! I remember you! \u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, when I recover my strength and take on a human form, I will \u2026\u201d The sky was filled with angry curses.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019ll show you my pride right now!\u201d The golden lotus flew to the side, carrying the vast sky with it.</p><br/><p>Only then did the others come back to their senses. What just happened was too dramatic, leaving everyone stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi, Yi Xuan, are you alright?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s scarred face and the corner of her mouth twitched. She was speechless. She didn\u2019t think that her meeting with Feng Yixuan would be so joyous.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d Feng Yixuan laughed idiotically. He looked at Qi Ao Shuang who was standing right in front of him. At this moment, he felt very satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2019re the one this kid has been crying for?\u201d At this moment, King Yue spoke, his voice returning to its previous calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d What are you talking about? \u201cYou are the one crying and begging me to acknowledge you as my teacher!\u201d When Feng Yixuan heard this roar, his face turned unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Qi Ao Shuang, Moon King, hello.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled as she nodded and greeted the Moon King.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, he\u2019s much more polite than this retarded kid.\u201d \u201cHehe, right, True King has a younger brother. He\u2019s a beautiful man, but he\u2019s also very valiant. How about \u2026\u201d King Yue said with a smile. Before he could finish, he was interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d</p><br/><p>These two voices sounded at the same time. One was Feng Yixuan, the other was Misius.</p><br/><p>Moon King turned his head and looked at Mishus with blinking eyes, then his gaze became more and more contemptuous. \u201cMishus, you can\u2019t be that shameless. You already have so many harem, and you\u2019re still snatching a woman from my disciple?\u201d Moon King had lived for so many years. Even though he was not close to a woman, it did not mean that he could not see the love between Feng Yixuan and Qi Ao Shuang. What he had said just now was only to tease Feng Yixuan. However, he didn\u2019t expect that even Feng Yixuan would only shout at the top of his lungs, seeking death. Was there anyone who was so eager to snatch a woman?</p><br/><p>Mishus stared at her and leaned close to her ear, whispering a few words in a low voice. Yue Wang\u2019s expression immediately changed. The next moment, he looked at Xiao Aushuang with a face full of smiles, \u201cUm, Miss Qi Aushuang, you must be tired from the journey, right?\u201d Go in and have a cup of tea. \u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had seen this old virgin\u2019s face change so quickly. What did that Mi Xiu King say to the Moon King? Of course, she didn\u2019t know that Mishus had only said something to the Moon King: She could be Camil\u2019s woman. If you want to die, then continue speaking such nonsense.</p><br/><p>Moon King and Mishus walked in front, their movements stiff as they led the way. Feng Yixuan and Qi Ao Shuang walked behind in silence. Feng Yi Xuan kept glancing at Qi Ao Shuang from the corner of his eye. He wanted to say something, but he couldn\u2019t utter a word.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Ao Shuang turned around and stared at Feng Yi Xuan. Feng Yi Xuan trembled in fear. He looked at Qi Ao Shuang, not daring to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a lot to ask you!\u201d After saying that, Xiao Ao Shuang continued walking forward.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi Xuan looked at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back and let out a long sigh before following.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the Moon King\u2019s castle, Qi Ao Shuang took a look at the castle. Very elegant, very quiet. The furniture was all made of white jade, and a huge chandelier was actually carved from a huge glowing ore. The wall lamps around the walls were also carved with various types of ores. The style was simple and elegant, and it was pleasing to the eyes. The floor was spotlessly clean, and the spiral staircases on either side of the hall were covered with a high layer of camel\u2019s hair. However, there was no one in the castle.</p><br/><p>King Yue personally brewed tea and served it to Qi Ao Shuang and Mi Xiu before saying, \u201cOnly I and Mi Xiu know of this place.\u201d \u201cThus, there is no one to serve you. Miss Ao Shuang, please make do with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call me Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang took the cup and nodded, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the situation.\u201d \u201cThis world has changed \u2026\u201d King Yue sat down helplessly and sighed. With a sorrowful expression, he said, \u201cI really don\u2019t understand why White King would betray us.\u201d \u201cHis relationship with the Heavenly King is the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd he devoured the power of the Heavenly King.\u201d Mezus\u2019s face grew cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis spirit and soul are actually stronger than the Heavenly King\u2019s!\u201d Why? How was this possible? The Devouring Power must absorb the soul and spirit of the Heavenly King into one. \u201cHowever, if the spirit and soul of the Heavenly King are stronger than his, then the person being devoured is the White King.\u201d Seeing the puzzled expressions on Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s faces, the Moon King immediately explained.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan looked at each other and saw confusion in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite King, when did he become stronger than the Heavenly King?\u201d We don\u2019t all know. \u201cThe fact that he can devour the power of the Heavenly King means that he also has the power to exterminate us.\u201d Mishus frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mies, you and I are the only ones who know my place.\u201d \u201cNo one can enter without the jade pendant I gave them.\u201d King Yue suddenly slowed down his voice and comforted Misius.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other kings?\u201d We still need to go out and find the other Kings. We need to open the seal to get rid of him before we can resolve this matter. \u201cDo we have to hide here forever?\u201d Matthews snorted coldly with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really hope that it can be like this \u2026\u201d King Yue\u2019s voice was barely audible. No one present heard his words, and no one could see the faint sadness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>After further discussion, the two of them finally decided to leave as soon as possible to find the other kings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no attendants here, find yourselves a room and take care of yourself.\u201d Moon King smiled apologetically. \u201cMishus and I will drink together tonight. Take care of yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, Feng Yixuan and I have something to do as well.\u201d Qi Ao Xuan smiled and nodded. He glanced at Feng Yi Xuan and pursed his lips. Feng Yi Xuan stood up and followed behind Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>King Yue looked at the backs of Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan and smiled maliciously. \u201cThis little girl, her aura is really strong.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid that Feng Yixuan won\u2019t be able to suppress it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe might be Camille\u2019s woman.\u201d Mishus\u2019 voice was cold as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the way!\u201d \u201cEven men can deal with a woman with such a strong aura.\u201d Moon King raised his eyebrows. \u201cLook at that brat Feng Yixuan. He is unstoppable and unstoppable all day long. In front of this little girl, he\u2019s actually like a mouse seeing a cat. This kind of obedient behavior is really rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLove must be single-minded!\u201d \u201cDo you understand?\u201d \u201cHow can she subdue Camil and Feng Yixuan?\u201d How can this be? \u201cI can only choose one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPah!\u201d What about you? Haven\u2019t you been with so many women, and you\u2019re all in one piece? What are you talking about? Or a few hundred? King Yue coldly snorted as he mocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, my is different.\u201d \u201cI am a man, and Qi Ao Shuang is a woman!\u201d Mezus frowned unnaturally.</p><br/><p>\u201cMen and women are the same!\u201d Yue Wang angrily turned around and walked into the dining hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Mishus was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink, will you come?\u201d King Yue didn\u2019t turn around, but his footsteps slowed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, it\u2019s here.\u201d Mishus smiled, hurriedly chasing after her and grabbing onto the Moon King\u2019s shoulders. The two of them walked into the dining room with their arms around each other.</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan arrived at the small garden outside the castle. The flowers here were finally real flowers, but there was only one type of flower, a small white flower with four petals. It was giving off a faint fragrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sat down beside the flowerbed, patted the seat beside her, and said a word.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan subconsciously swallowed his saliva and slowly sat down to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems it\u2019s time to tell me things I don\u2019t know.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said slowly, \u201cWhat kind of curse is it, why did things end up like that?\u201d \u201cWhat the hell happened to you in the Devil?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang \u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cI, I had once thought of giving you up and giving you to Leng Lingyun \u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s voice became softer and softer as he bit his lips.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything, listening quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d I regret it! How could I have such an idea! \u201cI will never give up!\u201d Feng Yi Xuan suddenly raised his head and looked at Qi Ao Shuang before firmly saying, \u201cAo Shuang, I definitely won\u2019t give up on you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

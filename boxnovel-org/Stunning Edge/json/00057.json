In a similar fashion, every level learned would unfold a petal. But the book had written that the mysterious Treasured Lotus Style way of cultivating only had ten levels. If each petal represents one level, why were there twelve petals on her back? What did it mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter, you didn\u2019t see wrong, there were twelve petals?\u201d Claire asked, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, let me see again, it\u2019s better if I confirm.\u201d Walter chuckled vulgarly. He still wanted to see the devilishly beautiful scene again.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo rest.\u201d Claire pulled out the spiritual stone and gave a pinch, making him faint. Before Walter could even cry out, he had passed out.</p><br/><p>Claire lifted up her clothes, wanting to turn around and see her own back. But how could anyone see their own back? So Claire was at a loss, wanting to look, but unable to. How on earth did the golden lotus look like?</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the tent flap was suddenly lifted open, the entrance showing Feng Yixuan\u2019s face as he was holding a roasted rabbit.</p><br/><p>Their eyes met and the two became petrified.</p><br/><p>Claire had lifted up her clothes, which only had underwear underneath\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan just faced the clothes-raised Claire\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The next moment,</p><br/><p>An extremely brutal thing happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s mournful cry resonated into the night sky, lasting for a while.</p><br/><p>When everybody faced Claire\u2019s tent, they only saw Feng Yixuan\u2019s face was completely bruised as Claire was stepping on him. Feng Yixuan\u2019s hand was still raising the well-roasted rabbit, not letting any dust stick to the roasted rabbit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I just have some personal business with Feng Yixuan, that\u2019s all. Sorry to bother everybody.\u201d Claire said to the everyone standing at the entrance in a nonchalant manner, smiling sweetly.</p><br/><p>Personal business? This personal business could make someone\u2019s entire face be bruised and then stepped on?</p><br/><p>Shui Wenmo emitted a flash of craftiness from his eyes. He extended his hand out, blocking everyone, saying while chuckling, \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. Since it\u2019s their personal matter, then we shouldn\u2019t bother them.\u201d The vague words made one\u2019s imagination soar.</p><br/><p>Everyone understood in a flash, turning to go back to their tents.</p><br/><p>Jean looked at Claire\u2019s expression, looking like he was thinking about something, but also turned and left. He had understood the look of repressed anger in Claire\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>When the surroundings quieted down, Claire used her foot that was stepping on Feng Yixuan to grind him a little, and said a bit hatefully, \u201cTalk, what did you see just then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour underwear is so sexy, it\u2019s actually purple.\u201d Feng Yixuan recklessly replied honestly.</p><br/><p>Greeting him was a foot that stepped on his back with much strength. Claire said angrily, \u201cLet me ask one more time, what did you just see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d This time, Feng Yixuan learned from experience, changing to this response. But the slight trace of perversion in his eyes gave him away.</p><br/><p>Just then when Claire had been lifting her clothes, she had been facing the tent entrance directly, so Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t see Claire\u2019s back. But he did see Claire\u2019s purple lace underwear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t knock when entering? You actually dare to open the tent flap without my permission?\u201d Claire said angrily, still a bit resentful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong, I won\u2019t do it next time.\u201d Feng Yixuan said with a sullen expression. \u201cIt\u2019s all because of that stupid knight\u2019s roasted rabbit, it tastes so bad. That\u2019s why I roasted another one and wanted to secretly give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Claire notice that the Feng Yixuan she was stepping on was clinging to a shiny roasted rabbit, raising it high, not letting any dirt from the ground stick to the rabbit.</p><br/><p>Claire retracted her foot. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Feng Yixuan crawl up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, you can only enter after getting my permission.\u201d Claire\u2019s expression lessened slightly, but still a little angry as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, ok. Of course I will.\u201d Feng Yixuan gave the rabbit to Claire, swearing solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you can go back.\u201d Claire accepted the rabbit, Feng Yixuan turning to leave. Claire looked at Feng Yixuan\u2019s figure and said quietly, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it\u2019s something I should do.\u201d When he heard this, Feng Yixuan became happy. He smugly touched all the bruises on his face as he left, thinking to himself that the beating was worth it. Besides seeing such a good scene, he also gotten Claire\u2019s touching thanks.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the rabbit that had been roasted brilliantly, the heat controlled perfectly. She really never expected that the Feng Yixuan who came from an exceptional household and environment had such a skill.</p><br/><p>But it had been really dangerous just then. Fortunately she hadn\u2019t faced her back towards the tent\u2019s entrance, otherwise Feng Yixuan would have seen the golden lotus, and who knows how the situation would have been like.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the glove on her right hand and sighed lightly. It was really too mysterious now, her hand had been marked by that abnormal god of Darkness and her back had grown a golden lotus. If the twelve petals all opened up, then would the golden lotus disappear? She hoped so. Claire bit the roasted rabbit gloomily, thinking angrily.</p><br/><p>In the early morning, the fallen knight and the girl were going to leave. The fallen knight\u2019s wounds were treated by Cliff\u2019s medicine and much better, and the girl\u2019s hair had been dyed a common brown, eyes dyed gray, average to the point she couldn\u2019t be more average.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot implicate our benefactors. Our goals are pretty small and we won\u2019t be too eye-catching. From this point on, we will take our leave.\u201d The fallen knight solemnly bowed deeply, the nearby girl also stooping to bow. Currently, the two had changed into the clothes that Claire had sent them. They had already cast away the armor and sword that could expose them, becoming an extremely common pair of travelers.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful on your way.\u201d Claire pulled out her wallet and took out a few golden banknotes and then poured out some golden coins, giving them to the fallen knight. \u201cHold onto these. Buy land in a remote village and settle there. Don\u2019t deline, you guys have no money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u2026\u201d The fallen knight hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, benefactor. We will forever remember your kindness in our hearts. If we have the chance to repay you, we will definitely try our hardest.\u201d The nearby girl stopped holding back, accepting it and giving thanks.</p><br/><p>After sending away the fallen knight and girl, everybody once again started waiting boredly for the black dragon, Ben, and the small thief, Summer, to return.</p><br/><p>Walter was pondering continuously. What on earth was Claire\u2019s personality like? He suddenly discovered he didn\u2019t understand. The vicious and mercilessness when Claire was dealing with the holy knights and the care Claire had given to the fallen knight and girl were completely different. Was Claire\u2019s heart good or bad? Why did he feel that Claire was a contradiction? Both wicked and kindhearted? Pah! What kind of messed up combination was this? Walter spit to himself.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Walter quivered for a moment, something flashing in his mind.</p><br/><p>Contradiction? Both wicked and kindhearted. This kind of soul was the most beautiful thing to the god of Darkness. Perhaps it was because of this that the god of Darkness had claimed Claire as an offering? And when he said the it was not time yet for the offering, was he waiting for Claire\u2019s soul to grow more?</p><br/><p>The most perfect combination wicked and kindhearted! This kind of beautiful soul would be hard to come by in several thousand years.</p><br/><p>Walter was frightening by his own conjecture. Was it like this or not? He could only calculate one step at a time. He would definitely understand the situation in the future.</p><br/><p>While Cliff was watching over her, Claire started meditate, sitting on the ground.</p><br/><p>When noon hadn\u2019t arrived yet, a fierce gale came from mid air, alerting everyone. The black dragon Ben had come back with the little thief Summer in his claws. After Ben descended, he transformed back into a human form with a puff. One hand was grabbing the already passed out Summer. Summer was foaming at the mouth, pale in complexion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the matter finish smoothly? What\u2019s with her?\u201d Claire looked at Ben, who was calm as water.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo dirty. This lowly human is actually afraid of heights, vomiting everywhere.\u201d Although Ben said such loathing words, he still didn\u2019t drop Summer onto the ground. When Summer was vomiting due to her fear of heights, the people who were actually unlucky were the people below, on the ground. Thinking of this, everyone shuddered. A bit too cruel\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it completed?\u201d Claire asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone, it\u2019s all done. At first, those old things kept on being noisy at her, saying that it wasn\u2019t possible that she had stolen teeth from from the dragon race\u2019s prince. I extended dragon pressure, pressuring them all to be obedient. I said, actually daring to steal my teeth, go die.\u201d Ben spit. \u201cThen those lowly old things finished evaluating her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it possible? Black dragon Ben had learned to be smart this quickly?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo only that happened? You didn\u2019t take revenge afterwards? It just ended unsettled?\u201d Claire kept on feeling that something was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, of course, I just made then bring out the little thief and then let them go. That\u2019s why I just brought back this lowly little thief.\u201d Ben laughed loudly, then lowered his head to look at Summer, who he was holding onto, pulled her up, and shook her, hard. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Summer made a few retching sounds, slowly opening her eyes. When she saw Claire, suddenly, an exceptionally warm and affectionate look appeared in her gaze. While sobbing, she said, \u201cClaire, tell him to let me go. This evil hearted guy, after he knew about my fear of heights, he flew around in circles, otherwise we would have arrived much earlier. I\u2019ve vomited out everything I ate last night, ugh\u2026\u2026.\u201d Now, Summer suddenly thought that the vicious Claire was currently so pleasant to the eye, so comforting.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at Ben. Ben guiltily looked up towards the sky, pretending he couldn\u2019t see Claire\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>She had never thought that this guy\u2019s personality was so nasty. Claire had a bit of headache looking at Summer, who was being shook by Ben, saying to Ben, \u201cAlright, let Summer go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben loosened his grip and Summer plopped onto the ground. She got up and ran to Claire\u2019s side before she rubbed her sore butt, hugging Claire and not letting go.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo change clothes first.\u201d Claire pinched her nose, resisting the wave of strange smell coming from Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Summer smelled herself and then spit and vomited.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

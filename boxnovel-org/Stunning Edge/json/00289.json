I also saw how much Leng Xiao and Feng Shao had done for you. \u201cBut Young Master, what about them?\u201d Jin Yan looked deeply at Qi Ao Shuang before slowly saying those words in a low voice. It was so low that only the two of them could hear it. Jonathan and Dittos followed far behind, not immediately following.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, these two people gave their all to the young mistress, and she was fond of one of them, right? Miss should respond to their wishes. However, Jin Yan didn\u2019t think about it at all, nor did he think about receiving Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s response. He had never wanted any reward from Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang stood where she was and raised her head to look at the sky. Suddenly, a faint smile appeared as she said softly, \u201cJin Yan, I actually have a choice long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Jin Yan was stunned. He stood on the spot and looked at the smiling Qi Ao Shuang. For a moment, he didn\u2019t know what to feel in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Jin Yan.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled faintly, but did not continue.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan recovered from his shock and followed silently. Young Miss\u2019s choice was his choice \u2026 Regardless of the young mistress\u2019s choice, he had no objections.</p><br/><p>The two of them walked forward, and Jonathan and Dittos slowly caught up with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, Xiao Aushuang, I didn\u2019t say that on purpose. I didn\u2019t mean it that way \u2026\u201d Jonathan caught up, embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind that. Let\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else you need today?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned her head to look at Jonathan, who looked a little perturbed, and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cBasically nothing.\u201d This was the end of the Four Cities Conference. \u201cAfter that, we can go back to school. It\u2019s very boring.\u201d Jonathan was bored.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it should be the Heavenly Treasure City championship as well.\u201d Dittens\u2019s emotionless voice floated over.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, if you participate in Heavenly Treasure City, can you get first place?\u201d Jonathan pursed his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d But Dittos spat this out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t understand you. How many times has your brother-in-law asked you to do this? You\u2019ve always refused. \u201cAt least she\u2019s your brother-in-law.\u201d Jonathan muttered, apparently not at all understanding what Dittos was thinking.</p><br/><p>Dittos looked cold and did not answer Jonathan.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Aushuang listened to these words, she understood clearly in her heart. Dittos was indeed a cold-hearted person, but he was also a dangerous person \u2026</p><br/><p>Upon returning back to their residence, someone hurriedly stepped forward to welcome them. More than one.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Dickens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two well-dressed men went to meet Jonathan and Dittos.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t this old man say that he wouldn\u2019t care about me recently?\u201d Jonathan frowned at the man in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, the lord came looking for you because of something, this is a letter from the lord.\u201d The man took out a letter and handed it to Jonathan respectfully.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked at the man in front of him suspiciously, and then looked at the letter in the man\u2019s hand. Finally, he took it and opened it quickly.</p><br/><p>And Dittos took the letter and read it. The messenger was sent by Dittas\u2019 sister.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded and headed inside with Jin Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t count on me.\u201d Suddenly, Qi Ao Shuang heard Jonathan\u2019s excited voice as if his tail had been stepped on.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back and tell my sister that I won\u2019t think about it.\u201d The next moment, Dittos\u2019 cold voice faintly rang out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang turned around and saw Jonathan\u2019s agitated and angry expression, as well as the cold expression on Dittos\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Bethany\u2019s engagement have to do with me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not interested. Go and tell the old man that I\u2019m not interested. Don\u2019t bother me with this sort of thing in the future.\u201d Jonathan waved impatiently at the people in front of him who were about to say something, then snorted and walked towards Qi Aushuang.</p><br/><p>Dittos silently followed behind, leaving behind two people who looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>Bethfennie\u2019s wedding? Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned. Suddenly, he remembered that Bethany was the daughter of the Jade City Lord. It was not surprising that the Four Seasons Garden\u2019s gathering had been held this time. It was normal that they would try to win over the other factions. Bethany, however, was Weiss\u2019s sweetheart. If Bethany had no interest in Wynes, then it would be fine, but the two of them loved each other, and just based on this, Qi Ao Shuang would not agree to let Bethany marry someone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will you be recruiting?\u201d \u201cWhere is it?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the angry Jonathan and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go, Bethany\u2019s character doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d Jonathan thought that Qi Ao Shuang was interested in Bethany, immediately persuaded, \u201cThat girl is very willful, you can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang?\u201d Dylan asked in a low voice as he walked over as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not interested in her. It\u2019s my roommate Wynes. \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang thought for a moment and then spoke the truth. Jonathan was a trustworthy man, and Dittos would not be bored enough to get involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jonathan touched his chin thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>When Dittos heard this, he said no more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Wynes? Is he the illegitimate child of the previous Nine Heavens City\u2019s mayor?\u201d Suddenly Jonathan asked in a hushed voice.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows in surprise and looked at Jonathan without saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I don\u2019t even know this much information about my family.\u201d Jonathan said with a wink.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slightly frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, come on, I\u2019m interested in this sort of thing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m free, too, if the match is successful.\u201d Jonathan smiled and waved at her. \u201cCome, let\u2019s talk in detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dittos glanced at Jonathan, but said nothing. He turned and went back to his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t even care if the sky collapses. I really don\u2019t know what he cares about.\u201d Jonathan looked at the back of Dittas and shrugged helplessly. \u201cMaybe he cares about himself?\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t he lonely?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid of loneliness.\u201d Suddenly, Jin Yan indifferently said those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jonathan stared at Jin Yan, but he remained calm, as if he hadn\u2019t said anything earlier. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s afraid of loneliness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan didn\u2019t say anything and just stood silently behind Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>The corner of Jonathan\u2019s mouth twitched as he looked at Jin Yan with slanted eyes. He didn\u2019t understand why Jin Yan would suddenly say such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, do you have a solution to Bethany\u2019s problem?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jonathan looked serious.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang twitched her lips and was about to say something, but Jonathan grinned and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way to think of something now.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go. I have long disliked the current Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of worry surfaced in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart. The current Nine Heavens City lord was the brother-in-law of Dittas in name. Would it be troublesome to deal with this matter?</p><br/><p>Jonathan grabbed hold of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder and dragged her to his room. Jin Yan\u2019s burning gaze naturally stopped on Jonathan\u2019s hands. A trace of doubt flashed in the corner of Jonathan\u2019s eyes when he saw Jin Yan\u2019s torch-like gaze. Why was the expression in the attendant\u2019s eyes like this?</p><br/><p>Jonathan walked into Jonathan\u2019s room and sat beside him. After the door closed, Jonathan popped out a barrier and grinned at Xiao Ao Shuang. \u201cQi Ao Shuang, why do you want to help Wynes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sat down and said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I your friend?\u201d Jonathan suddenly put away his smile and asked seriously.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded. Jonathan smiled at her. Everything went without saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll help you with this.\u201d It was actually very simple. He could just kill the current mayor of Nine Heavens City. The men of the Old City Lord would support Wynes. \u201cThen it\u2019ll be much easier to marry Bethany.\u201d Jonathan spoke very simply.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned, then she slightly frowned, \u201cHow is the strength of that Mayor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, I can cut him up like a watermelon. \u201cHe\u2019s just a piece of sh * t!\u201d Jonathan snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s good to kill him. Our family has a grudge against him for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang went silent as she thought of the nephew of Dittas, the son of the Nine Heavens City lord. Being so young and already so moral, his parents must have a great deal of responsibility. His mother was spoiling him, but what about his father? From the looks of it, that Mayor probably wasn\u2019t a person with a good character.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Dittos\u2019s brother-in-law \u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said with a faint voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let Dittos know.\u201d When he knows we\u2019ve killed the mayor, he won\u2019t care. This was because the person was already dead. No matter what, it was impossible for him to revive. He was a man who could calculate everything. In his heart, everything had a price. You and I are more in love with him than with a dead man. \u201d Jonathan, who had studied with Dittas for many years, knew his character well enough to say such a thing.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Aushuang understood Jonathan\u2019s words, her heart was cold. Dittas, Dittas, that\u2019s the way he is.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll help you get rid of that idiot city lord.\u201d \u201cHehe \u2026\u201d Jonathan casually said this, but his eyes flashed with a cold, bloodthirsty light.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned, still in a daze. Kill the Nine Heavens City\u2019s Mayor? Do you really want to do that?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat idiot city lord is actually very perverted. He has a way to secretly kill him.\u201d Jonathan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur family\u2019s intelligence is the fastest and most accurate in this world.\u201d Including the jade-green City Lord\u2019s underwear, we know all the colors. Not to mention the fact that the Nine Heavens City\u2019s mayor was a pervert. \u201cThe woman he loves the most just happens to be on good terms with my family.\u201d Jonathan shook his head.</p><br/><p>It was only then that Xiao Ao Shuang found out that Jonathan\u2019s family did this.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m only responsible for helping you kill him. You can take care of the rest yourself. \u201cThat includes helping your friend get a seat in the City Lord\u2019s seat or something.\u201d Jonathan frowned. \u201cI hate trouble.\u201d You see, if this man knew how powerful Wynes was, he\u2019d kill Wynes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make the first move?\u201d</p><br/><p>A preemptive strike was the best move? Qi Ao Shuang thought about it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

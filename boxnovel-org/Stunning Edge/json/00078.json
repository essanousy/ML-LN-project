Go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, let\u2019s, let\u2019s forget about it today.\u201d Alice said worriedly, looking at the strange scene in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t change my mind on what I have decided, go!\u201d The indifferent voice was clearly annoyed, taking the lead as he went in front.</p><br/><p>Alice looked at her cousin\u2019s figure, and a feeling of unease arose in her heart. It was only after she hesitated for a while that she followed him from behind.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Liuxue Qing, who was at the city gate, also frowned and looked with suspicion at the strange scene outside the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Sister Qing, what is that?\u201d Why hasn\u2019t Elder Brother come yet?\u201d Xuanxuan Leng pulled the corner of Liuxue Qing\u2019s clothes gently and asked.</p><br/><p>The two had came to the city gate very early because they were waiting for Lingyun Leng, who was about to come back. Lingyun Leng went and didn\u2019t find anything, so he could only come back. A sending squad would be too excessive. The Temple of Light wouldn\u2019t start anything unless the situation was urgent. Naturally, because they didn\u2019t find anything, Lingyun Leng rode a carriage back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be here soon, Xuanxuan, don\u2019t be impatient.\u201d Liuxue Qing consoled, but she was looking at the strange sight in the sky. What on earth was going on?</p><br/><p>A carriage was quickly nearing the capital. Naturally, the person sitting in the carriage was Lingyun Leng. Lingyun Leng also noticed the strange anomaly in the sky, incessantly puzzled in his heart.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Alice and her cousin were currently approaching Claire, who was preparing to receive the heavenly tribulation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Ma, two ants have come.\u201d Golden Lotus warned.</p><br/><p>After Claire heard that, she closed her eyes and extended her consciousness. After she extended it, a trace of a strange smile appeared from the corner of her mouth. It was really an inevitable clash; it was actually Alice, the woman who had lost the duel against her.</p><br/><p>The rumbling sound became louder, the pitch-black clouds boiling.</p><br/><p>With a huge rumble, a piercing, bright lightning streaked across the vast sky, immediately striking down.</p><br/><p>The lightning brimming with supreme power struck the golden lotus from above and disappeared in a flash, without a trace. Claire didn\u2019t move, because there was another lightning strike.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the fearsome-looking heavenly tribulation lightning strikes were also absorbed by the golden lotus easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m full now. Ma, the rest is up to you. Looking at those two ants feels really uncomfortable.\u201d And so, the giant golden lotus that was wrapped around Claire slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Claire stood up and looked up at the sky. The dark clouds in the sky were quickly dispersing. It was the same as last time.</p><br/><p>Claire walked to the wind leopard and White Emperor\u2019s side. She reached out and stroked the wind leopard, smiling secretly as she said, \u201cLittle Leopard is really obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>An indifferent voice without any warmth suddenly sounded from the distance. \u201cYou are Claire Hill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked up and saw a strangely clothed young man currently looking coldly at her. At his side was a cold-faced Alice. Claire raised her brow slightly. The feeling that this young man gave her was unfeeling and bloodthirsty. Only a person who had truly been immersed in life or death battles could have this kind of aura.</p><br/><p>This person was dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is Claire Hill.\u201d The nearby Alice hurriedly said. Cousin must quickly get rid of this slut. The strange scene in the sky just now was definitely going to be noticed by people. In a moment, more people would come and check. At that time, it would be difficult to act.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. Then go die.\u201d The blood thirsty man snorted. He waved his hand slightly, without any incantations. Instantly, numerous sharp and long spikes came out of the surroundings of Claire\u2019s rock, completely locking Claire inside. He was actually an earth-attributed magician, and also already able to insta-cast.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, come and enjoy.\u201d The bloodthirsty man started laughing. A sinister and brutal hint of a smile appeared from the depths of Alice\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, quickly, quickly get rid of this little slut. In a moment people will come. When the time comes, it will be annoying.\u201d Alice urged a little impatiently.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the blood thirsty man knew what Alice meant. The strange scene in the sky just now was bound to attract many people over. At that time, it would be hard to deal with with many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll just be lucky.\u201d The blood thirsty man sneered coldly, waving his hand to summon the earth element, preparing to order the earth spikes surrounding Claire to attack and viciously pierce through Claire\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>But what happened next wasn\u2019t the scene of blood flying and internal organs pierced bloodily as the bloodthirsty man imagined.</p><br/><p>Claire coldly humphed, emitting cyan Dou Qi from her body, directly shattering the earth spikes that were encircled around her, fragments flying everywhere. Dust flew, a terrifying sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand warrior?! How is that possible?\u201d Alice cried in alarm, not able to believe what she had just seen. That slut could actually emit cyan Dou Qi! How could it be possible? That was something only grand warriors could emit! It had only been a short time since the last time she saw that little slut, and now she had actually advanced to this level! Impossible, it was impossible! Alice was shocked. Her Dou Qi had already advanced like this, so what about magic? How on earth was that little slut\u2019s magic?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are a double classed magic warrior, but today, I won\u2019t let you cultivate any more.\u201d The bloodthirsty man laughed coldly, suddenly clapping his hands together. A huge force shot out of the gap between his hands, the giant and sharp earth spikes in front of him quickly shooting out, which then attacked Claire. Instantly, a wall of a line of sharp earth spikes arose, a spectacular yet terrifying sight.</p><br/><p>Claire flipped, dodging the incomparably sharp earth spikes. But just as she stabilized, the ground beneath her feet began to sink, because the earth below her feet suddenly became a whirlpool-like quicksand, making Claire\u2019s feet sink in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowl~~~\u201d Nearby, the wind leopard became worried. It rushed over, but was blocked by a wall of sharp earth spikes. The sharp earth spikes also attacked the wind leopard. The wind leopard dodged nimbly, but was now farther away from Claire, who was sinking into the quicksand. On the other hand, White Emperor had never moved the whole time. He only crouched on the big stone from before, calmly waiting.</p><br/><p>(TL: noooo don\u2019t attack the leopard, the leopard didn\u2019t do anything wrong!)</p><br/><p>\u201cJust let this place become your tomb.\u201d The bloodthirsty man said in a low voice, a cruel smile emerging on his face.</p><br/><p>A cruel and brutal smile also appeared from the depths of Alice\u2019s eyes. Burying this slut alive was not bad. Alice suppressed her urge to laugh wildly, sinisterly watching Claire, who was sinking deeper and deeper into the quicksand. What made Alice resentful was that although Claire was trapped in danger, her face was tranquil, not frantic or fearful at all.</p><br/><p>Alice ran up to the side of the quicksand, watching Claire, who was sinking inside, sinisterly. \u201cYou little slut!\u201d Alice cursed. \u201cDid you think at the time when you took my weapon weapon there would be a day like this? And is my weapon something you can take? You need to pay with your life. Burying you alive right now is still letting you off too easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly this kind of ability?\u201d Claire sneered, waving her hand slightly, just about to use magic, but suddenly Golden Lotus\u2019s voice sounded in her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa! Concentrate and sense the surrounding earth elements! Order them, remember, it\u2019s an order! Not request!\u201d Golden Lotus said irritably.</p><br/><p>Claire froze for a moment. Order? Not request? All use of magic was requesting magic elements to gather around the enchanter and then become a spell. Only then could they show their power. But Golden Lotus wanted her to sense the earth elements and order them? But wasn\u2019t she best at fire magic?</p><br/><p>Although Claire had some doubts in her heart, she immediately closed her eyes, concentrating to sense the surrounding earth element. Claire was shocked to discover that previously, she could only sense man red specks moving as if they were alive, but now, besides the red specks, there was actually many yellow specks moving about. This was the earth element?</p><br/><p>Right now, Claire\u2019s eyes were closed, but she could see those spikes and the concentrated earth element below her feet. These were all because of that bloodthirsty man\u2019s use of magic.</p><br/><p>Order the earth elements?</p><br/><p>Order, not request!</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, kill her quickly! Kill that little slut quickly!\u201d When Alice saw that Claire was about to make a move but stopped, a strong feeling of unease arose in her heart. She faced her cousin and called out frantically, \u201cCousin, quickly, quickly kill that little slut!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodthirsty man frowned deeply, coldly looking at Alice. With one look at that terrifying gaze, Alice stepped back in fear. Because that gaze was too terrifying, too terrifying. It gave one an indescribable pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, I, I wasn\u2019t ordering you. Really, I didn\u2019t mean to order you. How could I order you?\u201d Alice frantically and hurriedly explained. She couldn\u2019t know this cousin\u2019s personality any clearer. Savage, cruel, unfeeling\u2026 and hated when someone used a commanding tone to him the most. For this reason, he had injured two of the clan\u2019s elders, but didn\u2019t receive a harsh punishment, because he was truly very strong and showed high potential. Of course the clan wouldn\u2019t really do anything to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, I, I was only afraid this little slut would play some dirty tricks.\u201d Alice hurriedly explained. It was because she saw Claire closed her eyes and didn\u2019t move, continuously letting herself sink in. It was too abnormal; the little slut was definitely thinking of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! What harm can she do!\u201d The bloodthirsty man humphed coldly. With a slight flick of his finger, countless sharp earth spikes arose from the ground. Next, it was like they had eyes, madly striking towards Claire. It could be envisioned that if those spikes pierced Claire, Claire would be riddled with holes.</p><br/><p>The bloodthirsty man revealed an indifferent expression, about to turn and leave. To him, the situation was already dealt with.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!!!\u201d Suddenly, a clear and cold voice with surprise and fear angrily sounded.</p><br/><p>Alice was shocked, turned to look, and immediately, her complexion browned.</p><br/><p>Silver hair, violet irises.</p><br/><p>The Temple of Light\u2019s Holy Divine Prince!</p><br/><p>What happened in the next instant made Alice drop to the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

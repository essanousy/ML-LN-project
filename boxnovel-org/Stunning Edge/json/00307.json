Camil is definitely safe right now.\u201d The golden lotus quickly comforted him. \u201cHe can travel through space and time at will. He can escape from that person.\u201d On the other hand, mom, how did you get here? And you said someone else was with you. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun!\u201d \u201cJin Yan!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang stood up uneasily, looking around at the unfamiliar surroundings. \u201cThere\u2019s also Dittos, Jonathan, and Brill. They\u2019re all gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Lian tugged Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shirt. \u201cMom, it\u2019s useless if you\u2019re worried right now. Sit down first.\u201d Tell us what it is. They will not die in the currents of space and time. To be trapped in a crevice is to fall into a deep sleep, to be carried to a certain space in a current of uncertain time, and to no danger. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t solve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was slightly shocked. She lowered her head and looked at the childish face of Jin Lian. Her perfect face had a pair of eyes full of calmness and determination. Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly felt that the golden lotus had grown up and could take on the role of the Golden Lotus before she knew it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus, after you and Feng Yixuan disappeared together, I \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang began to tell the story of their separation in detail to Jin Lian and Liu Li, listening to the two of them with unfathomable expressions. One moment he was worried, the other moment he was nervous, the other moment he was embarrassed. When they heard what had happened between Jonathan and Qi Ao Shuang, they both held back their laughter until they were internally injured. Goldlotus was on the verge of tears. His mother had used Breezy\u2019s body to ruin the sincerity of many pure girls. Should this account be given to his mother or to Breezy? In the end, the one in white was Leng Lingyun, and when the purple earrings on her earlobes twisted the space around them, Jin Lian and Liu Li looked at each other, complicated emotions in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, the world we\u2019re in right now is the place Camille brought us to. The world is beautiful. It has a beautiful name at night. It\u2019s called the Starting Ground. \u201d Jin Lian frowned slightly and said with some doubt, \u201cBut later on, Liu Li and I found out that this world should be a very high level plane. But why that name? We also find it very strange. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, mother-in-law. All the people who came to this plane were experts. The name of this plane is really strange.\u201d \u201cHow could this be the first place?\u201d Liu Li was also puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the situation in this plane?\u201d What Qi Ao Shuang wanted to know was what this plane was like.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly King is the supreme ruler. Following that, there are seven local kings that divide this world into seven large areas and manage it separately.\u201d \u201cEach king\u2019s dominion is very large, but they all have to be loyal to that Heavenly King.\u201d The Heavenly King\u2019s castle was at the far end of the horizon, built on top of a huge lake. \u201cEvery year, the seven kings would gather there. Other than offering their tributes to the Heavenly King, they would also express their loyalty to the Heavenly King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Camille? What is his place in this world?\u201d This was what Xiao Aushuang was more concerned about.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamil\u2026\u201d Goldlotus sat down. \u201cActually, we don\u2019t know what this means.\u201d The place where he lived was very magical. The castle where the King of Heaven lives is built on that huge lake, and Camille lives in the castle\u2019s reflection. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReflect!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater on, we thought, that shouldn\u2019t be a reflection, but some kind of distortion of space, allowing an identical castle to come into contact with the Heavenly King\u2019s castle, where Camil lives.\u201d Liu Li replied seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Camille is\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang had a faint thought in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe thought Camille was the strongest person in the world, standing at the top of the world. However, Camille was very serious one day. He told us very carefully that that person had finally come to find us, so he must send us away. \u201d The golden lotus began to worry as she thought back to what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Camille sent us into a current of time and space, leaving us stuck in a gap. Restricted around us, trying not to fall asleep. He told us not to move and that he would come and pick us up. \u201cHowever, we didn\u2019t wait for him. Instead, the restriction became weaker and weaker, and we were about to fall asleep.\u201d \u201cIf we fall asleep and move your body, we won\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be taken to.\u201d \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t be able to meet you again.\u201d \u201c\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you met me and Zhangkong in the end, right?\u201d You and Zhangkong decided to take a chance and exchange bodies. \u201cOut of the current of time and space.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang gradually understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really risky. If we fail, not only will we disappear, mom, your and Breezy\u2019s souls and bodies will probably be separated forever, falling into an unknown space.\u201d The golden lotuses also had lingering fears. Now that they thought about it, they were truly afraid of the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille should be in the current of spacetime by this time. The others should be, too. But maybe Breezy is out, because in the end we\u2019re out, and he should be out, too. \u201d The golden lotus analyzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you find the others?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart was in a mess. Feng Yi Xuan didn\u2019t even have the chance to meet him before hastily parting like this. As for Leng Lingyun, although she saw him, she didn\u2019t recognize him. Ember and the others were nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t look so worried.\u201d There was a way to find them! We just have to take the risk of getting back into the current and find Camille and it\u2019ll be all right. \u201d Golden Lotus hurriedly comforted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pig. Right now, Camil is on the run. How are we supposed to find him?\u201d If one were to enter the space and time current accidentally, they would be transported to an unknown place in an unknown time! \u201cWhat should we do then?\u201d Liu Li pointed a finger at Golden Lotus\u2019s forehead and scolded angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Let\u2019s go to Camille\u2019s castle first.\u201d That place was originally the entrance to a space. And what might Camille have left behind? \u201d After saying that, the golden lotus suddenly retreated backwards and extended forward, biting onto Liu Li\u2019s finger. It scared Liu Li so much that she cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it that can force Camil to flee \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said softly, as if she was asking about the golden lotus, but then she seemed to be muttering to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, the only way to get there is to get to the entrance to Camille\u2019s castle. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who that person is, but for him to force the almighty Camille into such a state, he definitely isn\u2019t someone to be trifled with.\u201d Jin Lian shrugged her shoulders and stood up. \u201cThis seems to be the domain of King Mi Xiu. I\u2019ve seen this damned sissy before.\u201d Camille took us to the last party. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMi Xiu Emperor?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked up at the blue sky and said softly, \u201cWhat kind of person he is has nothing to do with us. Let\u2019s go, tell me the direction of that castle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of Jin Lian and Liu Li suddenly became complicated. They stood where they were and didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned around and looked at the two unmoving people with a puzzled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it, can you still fly?\u201d \u201cYou can feel the power in your body again.\u201d The golden lotus found it hard to bear.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang closed her eyes gently, feeling her surroundings, her expression changed. The power in his body was actually weaker than what he had felt in the Demon World by more than half! She had lost more than half of her strength. Not to mention flying, it would be difficult for her to even float.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was shocked. He was used to the power of Feng Yixuan\u2019s body, so he was somehow not used to it now that he was back to his own body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lost some of your strength in the gaps between time and space, and in the end, when you exchanged bodies, we absorbed most of the power in your mother\u2019s body. \u201cOtherwise, we won\u2019t be able to rely on our own strength.\u201d Goldlotus explained truthfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll just continue cultivating.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang sighed softly. Although she couldn\u2019t fly to that castle very quickly, but it wasn\u2019t as though there was no other way, right? Furthermore, what made Qi Ao Shuang most gratified was that no one was in danger. Camil had escaped into space and time. No matter who it was, they wouldn\u2019t be able to find the exact time and space he fled into, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, let\u2019s think of a way to get out of here safely.\u201d Suddenly, Golden Lotus\u2019s face fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang could tell that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Mi Xiu Emperor is a sissy. He\u2019s very perverted.\u201d This is his back garden. Camille used to show us around the world. \u201cThis guy \u2026\u201d Golden Lotus wanted to say something, but she hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy can\u2026\u201d \u201cI can \u2026 \u2026\u201d Liu Li\u2019s mouth twitched as well. \u201cShe can smell and recognize people.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s leave this place quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang frowned slightly. From the golden lotus, he knew roughly what sort of person this King Mi Xiu was. Now that he was in a different body, it would cause some trouble. It was better to leave this place as soon as possible, as more than half of her strength had been drained. If they were to encounter a conflict, it was indeed disadvantageous for him to use his current strength.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded, and they prepared to leave together. The place they were in was beautiful, peaceful. The little animals were not afraid of humans at all. Instead, they were curious to see the three of them appearing in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, are you thinking about us while you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about Young Master Feng and Young Master Leng, and Camil?\u201d The golden lotus suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who do you miss the most?\u201d Golden Lotus, however, looked solemn.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang paused for a second, looking at the serious face of the golden lotuses.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, who do you miss the most?\u201d The golden lotus continued to ask.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at the golden lotus, not saying anything for a while. After a long time, Qi Ao Shuang suddenly smiled, her smile was so dazzling. She then raised her head to look at the sky and softly said, \u201cActually, what I want the most is \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, beautiful lady, are you lost?\u201d Just as Xiao Ao Shuang was about to say what she wanted to say, she was interrupted by a man\u2019s voice. However, this voice didn\u2019t sound comfortable. It was clearly a man\u2019s voice, but it was a little coquettish.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

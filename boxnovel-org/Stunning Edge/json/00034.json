Lashia wasn\u2019t even that person\u2019s match, would Claire be able to defeat him? Or would Claire be able to come out unscathed?</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m afraid now we\u2019ll lose even more face, that idiotic Claire is totally incapable, how she became sir Cliff\u2019s disciple is still a total mystery. There must be something fishy about it.\u201d A low voice floated into Princess Maurice\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. This time we will lose huge face. That worthless idiotic actually went up to accept the fight, who does she think she is?\u201d Another low voice said.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the two both froze as they saw Princess Maurice\u2019s ice cold and hateful look in their direction. They had never seen that gentle, forgiving princess have such an expression! The two immediately shut up and shrank down.</p><br/><p> \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Claire can win or not, at least she has the courage to stand up and fight for our country.\u201d Prince Nancy\u2019s indifferent voice was heard by the all the surrounding people. Their expressions became complicated, and they all shut up. Of course they understood what the second prince meant. Claire fearlessly got up to accept the fight, but they were making cynical remarks behind her back, so they were even lower than the man-chasing Claire.</p><br/><p>As Claire slowly walked, Walter\u2019s noisy voice sounded in her head.</p><br/><p> \u201cClaire, you aren\u2019t really going right? Are you really going to fight?\u201d Walter was scratching his ears with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire insipidly replied. From the moment she decided to intervene, she had already mentally prepped herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is so strong, so strong he\u2019s a freak. You can beat him?\u201d When Walter heard Claire\u2019s indifferent response, he felt a sliver of hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire honestly replied.</p><br/><p> \u201cShit!!! And you\u2019re still so unperturbed!?\u201d Walter erupted like a volcano as he howled, feeling exasperated. Claire didn\u2019t speak and then Walter suddenly remembered. \u201cThen are you waiting for your Master, Cliff, to save you?\u201d The moment he said it, he shook off the idea. This little devil, she would definitely not let something like that happen. If you wanted a reason, then there might not be any particular reason. This was Walter\u2019s understanding of Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire smiled like a flower, slowly walked up the stage, and arrived in front of Yixuan Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Walter perspirated cold sweat. Right now he was just a spirit connected to a Spiritual Stone. The youth with terrifying strength could definitely kill Claire, and then as a stone, his future would be dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d Claire coldly humphed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t beat him.\u201d Walter shivered, his heart sinking.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng coldly looked at the blond haired girl in front of him. He didn\u2019t understand why that apart from excitement, he also felt a bit nervous. Although it was just a tiny bit, he truly felt nervous.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, just now I rashly broke the rules and intervened, but I can\u2019t watch you kill my little sister.\u201d Claire smiled while apologizing, but her words didn\u2019t feel apologetic at all.</p><br/><p> \u201cHumph.\u201d Yixuan Feng coldly humphed offhandedly, not caring at all that Claire saw through his plan. Yixuan Feng analyzed the girl in front of him. Although she resembled the previous girl, Lashia, they were two completely different people. Her gaze was frighteningly profound and she emitted a dangerous, murderous aura. There was no doubt, this girl was like him, a proficient assassin! If it was like that, he needed to be careful.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop wasting your breath. Let\u2019s start.\u201d Yixuan Feng coldly laughed, starting the battle. Even if the girl in front of him was a proficient assassin, so what? In this competition, assassins wouldn\u2019t have the slightest bit of advantage. Assassins could only assassinate in the dark unexpectedly to succeed, to be a threat. Right now, this magically weak girl had exposed herself in front of him. Spiritual attack, haha, would he fall for the same kind of attack again? But it was truly shocking that this girl actually knew how to Spiritually attack!</p><br/><p>Although he felt slightly nervous, Yixuan Feng thought he would win easily. Also, he would make her pay the price for sneakily attacking, paying with her life!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng chanted a primary spell creating a couple of icicles to test out Claire. Claire immediately released a fire shield.</p><br/><p> Both seemed to be superficial.</p><br/><p> But in a flash, both sides understood the other\u2019s strength more clearly.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng\u2019s mouth curved into a cold smile. As expected, her magic power wasn\u2019t much. He could directly kill her if he pulled their distance apart and then used advanced magic. Yixuan Feng coldly humphed and quickly retreated back, pulling their distance apart. Then he quickly started chanting.</p><br/><p>Everybody worriedly looked at the situation on stage. As they watched Yixuan Feng speedily chanting while Claire was still quietly standing there, everybody had different reactions.</p><br/><p>The Sunrise Institute students all gritted their teeth, their expressions complex. Their hearts were conflicted. They completely didn\u2019t understand why the youth, Yixuan Feng, pointed at Claire and called her out to compete. If Claire won, they could get their honor back, win back their pride. But, if Claire, that incapable man-chaser won\u2026 Then where did that put them? What kind of a position would they be in?</p><br/><p>The spectating nobles all stretched their necks forward with bated breath as they watched the scene on stage. Looking at this situation, many people put on the \u201cI told you so\u201d expression. Of course Claire went up there to lose face. How could she defeat the youth that had already defeated Lashia?!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng\u2019s started chanting faster and faster, because he felt an uneasy feeling welling up. This was an assassin\u2019s intuition. There was no doubt!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng clearly saw Claire\u2019s face slowly reveal the sliver of a smile, a very icy and extremely dangerous smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYixuan Feng, you\u2019re actually very handsome. I was almost enchanted by you.\u201d A brilliant smile blossomed on Claire\u2019s beautiful face as she gently and \u201caffectionately\u201d moved toward Yixuan Feng. At that moment, she looked extremely fascinating and charming, enchanting everyone.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng froze, not finishing the chant.</p><br/><p>The next moment, a green aura burst forth from Claire, a radiance that was blinding. Then she swiftly raced to Yixuan Feng, who hadn\u2019t come back to his senses yet.</p><br/><p>Dou Qi!!!</p><br/><p>It was actually Dou Qi!</p><br/><p>And it was an advanced warrior\u2019s green Dou Qi!</p><br/><p>A magic warrior?</p><br/><p>That idiotic male-chasing Claire was actually a magic warrior?</p><br/><p>Knowing both magic and Dou Qi?!!</p><br/><p>The whole field was boiling again like water, to the point that it was beyond comparison. Heavens, it was actually Dou Qi! Everyone knew what would happen if a magician let a warrior come close.</p><br/><p>Many people opened their mouths and forgot to close them. Other people continuously pinched their arms, not relenting even when it bruised. And there were still others that felt their vision darken and the sky about to collapse. Duke Gordan started stupidly at the shining green radiance on the stage and forgot to think. Princess Maurice was extremely excited, blood rushing to her cheeks. But the second prince, Nancy, turned his head slightly, meeting the gaze of Jean. Jean lifted the corner of his mouth into an almost imperceptible smile.</p><br/><p>On the special stand, the emperor\u2019s eyes widened slightly, but there was no other expression on his face. Cliff frowned in deep thought. The face of the ambassador paled, his hands gripping the armrests of his chair. The pope looked at the stage out of his half-closed eyes, also silent. Only the queen looked happy.</p><br/><p>But right now on the stage, Yixuan Feng was beginning to get worried. Never in his deepest thoughts did he think that this young girl was not only a magician and assassin, but also a warrior!!! He was agile enough to evade a warrior\u2019s attack for a while, but the stage was only so big, and he had just purposely retreated to increase the distance between them, so there was almost no room behind him. Even though he was a magician who had assassination skills, he still couldn\u2019t block the strong blows of a close combat warrior.</p><br/><p>Walter was screaming his head off in Claire\u2019s head. Shameless, so shameless! There\u2019s no one more shameless than this little devil, no one more evil than her! Shameless enough to say something so ambiguous at the critical end of someone\u2019s chant to sway their focus! What Yixuan Feng, you\u2019re actually very handsome. I was almost enchanted by you. Pah! Was that possible? That the little devil would like some arrogant boy she met the first time? Sure enough, sure enough, when this little devil pretended to be cute, the other person would be struck a deadly blow! This shameless, despicable, vile, dirty little devil! Using such an insidious and vicious tactic.</p><br/><p>Wenmo Shui understood Yixuan Feng\u2019s predicament perfectly. Hens flying and dogs jumping would totally describe the current situation. Yixuan Feng wanted to turn in circles to avoid the chase, but there was no more room for him to turn. Claire\u2019s attack was cunning and spiteful, each blow so strong and powerful that, even though she didn\u2019t have any weapons, her bare fists were making Yixuan Feng panicked. Wenmo Shui\u2019s squirming butt had left his seat while he stood up excitedly to watch the panicked Yixuan Feng, bursting with laughter inside. This was the first time he saw Yixuan Feng being chased around like a wet dog, and it was much too entertaining.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng suffered in silence bitterly. Every time Claire would accurately block off his retreating path and then deal a string of vicious attacks. Not only was there no time to chant a spell, even dodging with his nimble body was difficult. Every time he was hit, he grimaced. He had already lost his previously high spirits. This wretched woman, every hit was so accurate. Miscalculation, a huge miscalculation. This woman actually knew how to use Dou Qi.</p><br/><p> \u201cDon\u2019t go too far!\u201d Yixuan Feng panted as his sorry figure dodged Claire\u2019s Dou Qi attack.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression was completely icy. She didn\u2019t say anything, and instead blocked Yixuan Feng\u2019s retreating path again.</p><br/><p>A magician getting in a close combat with a warrior equated to certain death. Right now, the only reason Yixuan Feng was still fighting after such a long time was because he was proficient in assassination techniques. But his physical strength was quickly deteriorating, while Claire still looked the same, her hair still tidy.</p><br/><p>Walter was still excited like crazy watching such an arrogant person being oppressed like this by Claire, but he still sighed about Claire\u2019s arduous hard work. During that time, Claire was riddled with scars everyday because she was secretly learning Dou Qi with Jean. Those scars resulted from her commanded sparring rounds with Jean. Claire\u2019s usage of and growth in Dou Qi really shocked Jean and Walter over and over.</p><br/><p>The spectators\u2019 enthusiasm reached the skies. Nobody had imagined such a turn of events.</p><br/><p>What would the result be like?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They are stout and ugly, but their intellect could not be looked down upon. They lived underground in a myriad of confusing tunnels. Their underground palace was even more magnificent. If they wanted to obtain the deity weapon, it would be a little difficult. Even if they entered, the maze-like passageways would trap them.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom this forest onward is all goblin territory.\u201d Ben squinted as he peered into the tree. \u201cGoblins never interact with other races.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re unscrupulous businessmen, and ugly,\u201d Leng Lingyun said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you sure know a lot,\u201d Ben laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was recorded in the Temple of Light\u2019s library. Long ago, when the different species still intermingled, the beast and dwarf races made business deals with the goblins, but they would always suffer loses. Later, something happened that made all the races retreat back their own territories. Everyone now guards their own territory, never making contact with other races,\u201d Leng Lingyun said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Temple of Light\u2019s library recorded this?\u201d Ben was a little surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI secretly read it from the secret library,\u201d Leng Lingyun said a little embarrassedly.</p><br/><p>Ben gave him an admiring look.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Qi Aoshuang walked ahead. Just as she entered the forest, there was the sound of rustling all around them.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes changed. It seems that the forest had some goblins on guard.</p><br/><p>As expected, the sound grew louder and louder. One by one, green creatures appeared.</p><br/><p>A group of fully armed goblins riding wolves surrounded them with weapons pointed at them. The goblins had wrinkled faces, green skin, long, tapered ears, and round eyes. Currently, they were cautiously regarding Qi Aoshuang\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans, stop. We cannot permit you to advance any further,\u201d the leading goblins said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have business with your king,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said to him calmly.</p><br/><p>The goblin frowned. He sized up Qi Aoshuang, then inspected the other people. Ben timely released slight dragon aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon?!\u201d the goblins all paled with fright. The wolves all uniformly crouched down and shivered.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled ever so slightly. Having a dragon by her side sure was convenient.</p><br/><p>Before the goblins could respond, a ray of bright light shot down from the sky, trapping the goblins within. Before they could cry out, they all turned to dust, then dissipated. In an instant, all their lives had been taken away. It was a frightening scene.</p><br/><p>Enemy attack?!</p><br/><p>They all retreated back, alertly watching the mass of white light.</p><br/><p>The Temple of Light\u2019s power!</p><br/><p>Slowly, the white light dissipated. A few figures emerged from within.</p><br/><p>Angels! They were led by an angel with eight wings. Behind him stood four cold-faced angels with six wings. The five angels all had white clothes, white wings, and supple blonde hair and deep blue eyes. They all held a pure white blade</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s gaze darkened. Was the goddess of Light finally about to make her move? Indeed, she had already collected three parts of the God Feather Heaven Slayer. The goddess should have sensed it already. She could not descend in the human world for long, so she sent these angels to take her place instead.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression had also changed. Before them were true and blue angels. Normally, angels could not descend to the human world easily. Even if they forcibly descended, their strength would be greatly reduced, but these angels had terrifying strength. In other words, the goddess had found a way for them to descend without reducing their strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly fuck! Actual angels.\u201d Ben was gleefully about to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon King!\u201d Suddenly, before he could attack, the leading eight-winged angel pointed his sword at Ben and said coldly, \u201cDid you forget the agreement between the goddess and your dragon god?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, I\u2019m no dragon king,\u201d Ben lied without a trace of embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d However, the eight-winged angel smiled coldly. He faced the sky and gave a long whistle. The shrill sound was as loud as thunder, earsplitting.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and everyone else\u2019s expressions changed greatly. The angel\u2019s strength was definitely unordinary, completely different from the angels that had descended and possessed the pope and archbishops\u2019 bodies.</p><br/><p>After the long whistle, there was a rumbling sound coming from the horizon.</p><br/><p>Ben\u2019s expression turned incomparably ugly.</p><br/><p>Only he recognized what the pressure and rumbling sound signified.</p><br/><p>The dragon god was descending!</p><br/><p>The rumbling was deafening. A rainbow cloud appeared in the sky and approached. Ben\u2019s face was already beet red. Naturally, he knew what the dragon god would appear here for.</p><br/><p>Seeing the angels\u2019 delighted expressions and Ben\u2019s unsightly expression, Qi Aoshuang immediately understood what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon king, let\u2019s see if you\u2019ll still interfere! You violated the treaty between the goddess of Light and the dragon god, so the dragon god will punish you. Hmph!\u201d The eight winged angel smiled coldly, his sword pointed at Ben. His voice was filled with clear glee and faint malice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Ben\u2019s face darkened. He looked up at the rapidly approaching rainbow cloud, his heart sinking.</p><br/><p>Before Qi Aoshuang and everyone else could react, the multicolored cloud was already overhead. A rope descended. Ben\u2019s expression changed. He turned, wanting to run, but as if the rope had eyes, it chased after Ben. Ben could not even have the chance to resist as the rope wound around him. In a flash, he was wrapped up tightly. With his mouth covered, he gave muffled grunts.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s mouth was wide. It was not that Ben did not want to resist, but that he did not even have the chance to. In front of the dragon god, he was powerless.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang instantly shot a bolt of flame at the end of the string that bound Ben, but it had not effect. They could only watch on helplessly as Ben was taken into the sky. Ben struggled with all his might, looking like a wriggling caterpillar, but it was no use. Although it was amusing to see, their current situation was no joke. Qi Aoshuang was about to attack again, Ben shot her a warning look, telling her to stop. Their current situation was already critical. In order to face the five angels, she could not waste her strength. Furthermore, she was facing the profound dragon god! Qi Aoshuang knew better than anyone else how large the gap between humans and gods was. Seeing Ben\u2019s gaze, Qi Aoshuang understood and stopped everyone else from attacking.</p><br/><p>Soon, Ben was dragged away in the cloud. Vermillion shivered, hiding behind Jean. She was afraid the dragon god was going to capture her. Clearly, Ben had been taken away because he was about to interfere.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take away this lil bastard,\u201d a resonant voice said from the sky. The voice was filled with imposing aura, inconsistent with his choice of words. Lil bastard\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, the multicolored cloud floated away. The sound of Ben\u2019s muffled grunts gradually disappeared along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Lowly human, today you\u2019ll pay the price for uselessly provoking the venerable goddess\u2019s might!\u201d The leading eight winged angel coldly humphed. He raised his blade. In the light, it shimmered.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang snorted. With a flick of her wrist, the Azure Ripple blade was already in hand.</p><br/><p>With ringing sound, Jean pulled out his sword. Leng Lingyun\u2019s face darkened. He coldly regarded the arrogant angels.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Oscar had his arms crossed. He stood to the side quietly. As promised, he was a spectator. Qi Aoshuang had never expected for him to help anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cElf?\u201d The eight winged angel looked at Oscar in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the elf race going to interfere?\u201d one of the six winged angels said angrily.</p><br/><p>Oscar frowned with annoyance. Were they stupid? Couldn\u2019t they see that he had no intention of doing so?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to, then why don\u2019t I?\u201d Oscar smiled coldly, getting up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot!\u201d The eight winged angel swiveled back and berated. Did he not have eyes? Clearly he had no intentions of doing anything, but now, because of the six winged angel\u2019s words, the elf was going to join the fray! The elf definitely was powerful. However, elves, who were regarded as peaceful and elegant could be this irritable? Aside from anger, the eight winged angel was also a little confused.</p><br/><p>It was not just the eight winged angel who was confused. Qi Aoshuang was surprised as well.</p><br/><p>She frowned. Oscar sure behaved strangely. He attacked whenever he wanted to, and his reason to do so was simple too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of bringing trouble to your elf god?\u201d The eight winged angel\u2019s objective was to kill Qi Aoshuang and destroy her soul, not this elf.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the elf god and your god have an agreement?\u201d Oscar said heedlessly, smiling.</p><br/><p>The eight winged angel froze. Indeed, the elf god and goddess of Light did not have any agreement. Because the elves loved peace and hated humans, there had never been a need to make such an agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if there isn\u2019t, aren\u2019t you afraid of being punished by the elf god?\u201d the eight winged angel persisted.</p><br/><p>Oscar chuckled and didn\u2019t say anything. Evidently, he did not take the angel\u2019s word to heart.</p><br/><p>The eight winged angel\u2019s expression changed. What these arrogant angels hated the most wasn\u2019t people cursing at them, but completely disregarding them. Oscar\u2019s haughty actions were a resounding slap in the face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

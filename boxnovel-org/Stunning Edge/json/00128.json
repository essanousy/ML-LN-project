Fireworks burst splendidly, bugles blew, pigeons were set free, filling the air, and colorful flags flapped in the wind. With a gentle hubbub, all gazes were fixed on the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin!\u201d An official with a loud and clear voice relayed the emperor\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>The stadium clamoured with excitement. Only cheering and applause could be heard.</p><br/><p>It was time to draw lots. The mass elimination had begun.</p><br/><p>The first group did not include Claire, but Feng Yixuan walked up towards the stage.</p><br/><p>Shui Wenmo didn\u2019t get up, but was itching to do so. He waved his fist excitedly, shouting continuously. \u201cYixuan, go get \u2018em! Finish \u2018em! Finish it quickly!\u201d But then wind would blow. Shui Wenmo hastily arranged his hair. Then he would return to his bellowing. It was indescribably strange and hilarious. That hair freak!</p><br/><p>Claire watched the people on stage and counted. There were actually about forty people. The mass elimination was such a disarray?</p><br/><p>The crowd grew excited. Peddlers hollered to advertise drinks and snacks.</p><br/><p>With this command, the competition had formally begun.</p><br/><p>But before the crowd had spent their energy, they were thoroughly dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood at the center of stage. With an evil laugh, he closed his eyes and clasped his hands together, saying forcefully, \u201cWind Carnage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, with Feng Yixuan as the center, a violent cyclone formed and swept outwards.</p><br/><p>Instantly, with such wild winds, everybody was swaying, as if they were on the verge of being blown away. Shrieks rang out, hats flying. On the stands, the tablecloths of the nobles were sent flying with the hurricane. Everything turned to disarray. But then An Lisha snapped her fingers. A large barrier formed and the stands quieted down. But everybody was shocked. With just one move, Feng Yixuan had destroyed the stage\u2019s barrier!</p><br/><p>The wild wind had also blown Claire\u2019s golden hair into a mess. She stared dumbfoundedly at the indifferent Feng Yixuan. Was this Feng Yixuan\u2019s true strength?</p><br/><p>Previously, there had been many people on stage, but now, only Feng Yixuan was left! Feng Yixuan stood arrogantly at the center, wind blowing his long hair wildly, his clothes also whipping in the air.</p><br/><p>Of the contestants that had been on stage, the weak ones had been directly blown into the air and had landed in random places in the stadium. The more powerful ones had still been blown off, cutting sorry figures.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy\u2026 he\u2019s always so arrogant. Why can\u2019t he try to be a little more modest?\u201d Feng Yihan said helplessly seeing the messy result of his son\u2019s attack, feeling a bit of a headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my son, haha\u2026\u201d An Lisha laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhhhhh! Feng Yixun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>In that instant, screams rose and fell in succession across the stadium. It was the screams of many girls, whether they were commoners or nobility. The red haired, handsome youth stood so arrogantly on stage, so attractive. Shui Wenmo also stood up excitedly, shouting, \u201coh yeah~ oh yeah~\u201d, a strange sight. The rest of the contestants watched Feng Yixuan with shock, quite a few congratulating themselves for not having to face such a frightening person.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, my son is so popular.\u201d An Lisha swung her hips delightfully, completely not caring about her public image.</p><br/><p>But before Feng Yihan said anything, he was stopped by a savage, angry roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck are you shouting for! Shut the f*ck up!\u201d Feng Yixuan hollered at the shrieking girls, his expression dark. But this only made the girls even more excited. Such a wild, handsome, strong Feng Yixuan was so attractive. After cursing, Feng Yixuan glanced at Claire nervously.</p><br/><p>An Lisha and Feng Yihan saw everything.</p><br/><p>An Lisha\u2019s mouth trembled as she said dejectedly, \u201cFinished, my son is finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yihan smiled without a word and continued to watch the stage.</p><br/><p>The referee had returned onstage to announce Feng Yixuan\u2019s advancing to the next round. The palace magicians were reconstructing another barrier, this time stronger. Feng Yixuan humphed coldly, exhibiting an arrogant \u201cas it should be\u201d aura as he exited the stage.</p><br/><p>The referee then announced the list of contestants in the next group. Right after he said Claire Hill, he said Hua Yilin!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stopped in his tracks and he whipped his head around. He stared at the referee who was still reading the rest of the names.</p><br/><p>His greatest fear had come true! The two were going to face each other during the mass elimination!</p><br/><p>Right when Feng Yixuan was about to march towards the referee, Shui Wenmo dashed over and grabbed Feng Yixuan\u2019s arm. He said hurriedly, \u201cWhat are you worried about? His win is not absolute. Do you think it would make a difference even if you interfered? Don\u2019t put your Ma in a difficult position. Even if Hua Yilin, that bastard, wanted to kill her, your Ma wouldn\u2019t let him. Don\u2019t forget what you promised your Ma!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after hearing Shui Wenmo\u2019s words did Feng Yixuan leave the stage extremely reluctantly. He watched nervously as Claire slowly walked upstage.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire sure has guts, actually signing up with her real name. But the crown seemed to already know, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Shui Wenmo stroked his chin and mumbled, \u201cClaire\u2019s sworn sister has been the center of attention these past few days, a stunning beauty, even though I\u2019ve never seen her before. Tell Claire to introduce us after the tournament, heh heh.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t hear a single word, his gazed fixed on Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear anything I just said? F*ck!\u201d Shui Wenmo yelled at Feng Yixuan with frustration.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan pushed away Shui Wenmo\u2019s approaching face, still watching Claire intently. Shui Wenmo wanted to something but couldn\u2019t, a little depressed.</p><br/><p>Jean and the rest sat at the ordinary stands nearest the stage, their gazes all following Claire. At one of the higher stands, Li Yuewen\u2019s fists were already clenched tightly. Like Feng Yixuan, she had not expected Claire to face the insane Hua Yilin during a mass elimination round. Li Mingyu was also frowning, his eyes focused on the stage.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the stage, Hua Xiuning revealed a cruel smile. She had purposeful instructed her little brother to injure Claire heavily beforehand. Sworn sisters, was it? She would show what would be the result of being sworn sisters today. But even so, Hua Xiuning felt a bit vexed thinking of this brother\u2019s attitude. He held her in complete disregard. But when she said to give Claire a good beating if he faced her, Hua Yilin had actually said in a cold voice very heedlessly that he would destroy any Li clan member even without her wasting her breath. Hua Xiuning\u2019s eyes followed Hua Yilin as he slowly walked onstage, clenching a fist, frowning. Hua Yiling disregarded everyone. Not even Mother or Father could do anything about it. Really, where did that attitude of his come from?</p><br/><p>Then, Claire entered Hua Xiuning\u2019s vision. Hua Xiuning\u2019s smiled again. Humph! That Lan Ling actually was not here, otherwise she would be looking forward to seeing Lan Ling\u2019s expression as her sworn sister was destroyed. Hua Xiuning could not understand her brother\u2019s twisted personality any more clearly! Claire would either die or become a cripple!</p><br/><p>\u201cStart!\u201dthe referee announced before running offstage as if his life depended on it, because this round, there was Hua Yilin!</p><br/><p>Claire concentrated as she sensed the power of each individual then sighed in relief inwardly. There was only one strong individual.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsunami!\u201d</p><br/><p>A low voice said suddenly, ice cold without any emotion.</p><br/><p>Claire instantly shifted her focus. A giant, terrifying power surged towards her. Claire instantly erected a fire shield. Next came the the sizzling sound of water and fire colliding. Claire was forced back a few steps by the pressure on her fire shield, realizing with shock that this was Hua Yilin\u2019s ability, controlling water! If it weren\u2019t for the white flame shield, the results would be unimaginable. Soon, Caire understood what would happen if she her hit directly.</p><br/><p>The next moment, painful screams erupted. The water vapor disappeared, revealing the sorry state of the stage. Many people were whimpering miserably as they lay onstage while others who had been struck flying had hit the barrier and were now gradually sliding down. Some had stabbed through, left with bloody wounds, some with broken arms, feet\u2026 In just one moment, painful groans filled the stadium. There were only two people left standing, Hua Yilin and Claire.</p><br/><p>The stadium instantly fell deathly silent. The emperor was frowning, the crown prince\u2019s expression dark. Although Hua Yilin was strong, he was too cruel.</p><br/><p>Claire stood calmly, watching the youth before her cautiously. Blue hair, blood red eyes. His handsome features combined together into a sinister expression. He stared at Claire fixedly, his gaze like that of a hunter stalking its prey.</p><br/><p>When the audience came back to its senses, they immediately started yelling out angrily,</p><br/><p>\u201cMurderer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo cruel!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Yilin didn\u2019t give so much as a glance. He raised his right hand expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, water attacked the barrier explosively, a shocking sight. The barrier started shaking and the audience paled with fright. They instantly shut up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPause!\u201d A palace magician flew up into the air. \u201cThe injured contestants need to be treated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have five minutes.\u201d Hua Yilin did not care to glance at the palace magician either as he spoke. He was still eyeing Claire coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, he is a dangerous opponent,\u201d Leng Lingyun said softly from amongst the crowd.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

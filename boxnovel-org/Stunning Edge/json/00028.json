The viewpoint of this body\u2019s previous owner\u2026 She really couldn\u2019t agree or appreciate it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy looks like he deserves a whipping.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice noisily sounded. Suddenly he asked suspiciously, \u201cHow could you fall for that arrogant wimpy brat? What does he mean by those words?\u201d Even if Walter was beaten to death, he would never believe this little devil would take a liking to that youth.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak. She couldn\u2019t tell Walter she really wasn\u2019t the Claire from before.</p><br/><p>The handsome youth saw Claire not speaking and got more and more impatient. He felt envy and hatred. This man-chaser actually became the disciple of Sir Cliff. And although she still hasn\u2019t become a true magician, doesn\u2019t have any achievements, she was actually bestowed the title of Baron. Although Baron is the lowest title, it still is a title! Looking at the silent Claire, the handsome youth became more agitated and disdainful. So she was a starry eyed infatuation man-chaser! Asking her to dance and she was so moved she couldn\u2019t say anything!</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know how to dance. Please find someone else.\u201d Claire answered coldly.</p><br/><p>The handsome youth was stunned. Doesn\u2019t know how to dance? These words coming from the man-chaser Claire was a total joke. Everyone knew that incompetent man-chaser Claire also had a skill, which was dancing! But right now she actually said she couldn\u2019t dance?! What did she mean by that? Was this some kind of ploy? The handsome youth frowned. He understood his father\u2019s words. Knowing that Claire had chased him before, he wanted him to gain her favor and accompany her in order to create a good relationship with the Hill family. Lashia, who was so brilliant and talented, was a little hard to go after. But as for aiming for this man-chaser, there was a chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you declining in order to reel me in?\u201d The handsome youth laughed coldly, then he added before Claire could respond, \u201cThen congratulations, you\u2019ve succeeded. Come dance with me.\u201d The handsome youth extended his hand.</p><br/><p>Claire felt a little helpless, not because of the youth\u2019s behavior, but because of the actions of the previous Claire. If a person like that suddenly changed her attitude, it was hard for anyone to accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201c I think you misunderstood. Claire was waiting for me.\u201d a calm voice came from behind the youth.</p><br/><p>The handsome youth turned around, stunned to see the second prince smiling at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness.\u201d The handsome youth quickly bowed but still felt an indescribable feeling. Did Claire turning over a new leaf even change the attitude of the second prince who she had been chasing before?</p><br/><p>Nancy lightly nodded at the handsome youth, smiling graciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be taking my leave, your highness.\u201d The handsome youth slightly bowed and withdrew from the balcony.</p><br/><p>Claire was still silent and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not going to thank me saving you from an awkward situation\u201d Nancy laughed softly while making fun of Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who should thank you is him.\u201d Claire quietly laughed, her voice with an unmatched coldness.</p><br/><p>Of course Nancy knew what Claire meant. But Nancy didn\u2019t mind Claire\u2019s tone and only indifferently laughed. \u201cMay I have the honor of dancing with you?\u201d After he said this, Nancy elegantly extended his hand towards Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t give any face and coldly refused without even batting an eye.</p><br/><p>Nancy wasn\u2019t angered and instead laughed. He gently withdrew his hand, not offended the slightest by Claire\u2019s blunt refusal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat night, it was I who stopped Jean. I wasn\u2019t saying it for him, I was telling the truth. It was just that that night I wanted to figure out who you were.\u201d Nancy approached Claire\u2019s ear and murmured laughingly. To an outsider it looked like a pair of lovers whispering secrets. But the truth was completely different.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. So what?\u201d Claire smiled while rocking the glass of wine in her hand. The coldness she emitted could make people shiver.</p><br/><p>Nancy went mute. So what? That one, cold sentence completely stopped what he was going to say. So what if he stopped Jean or not? Then what was relevant? The most important thing was that this young girl in front of him was no longer a normal person, no longer a man-chaser, but sir Cliff\u2019s disciple!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your Highness doesn\u2019t have any more to say, I would like to be alone for a while.\u201d Claire said lazily, leaning on the balcony railing. Her gaze floated towards the quiet garden.</p><br/><p>Nancy paused for a moment before nodding his head. \u201cIf that\u2019s so, I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire nodded with not so much as a glance towards Nancy.</p><br/><p>Finally the balcony was quiet again. Claire quietly sighed and drank from the glass of wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is definitely not ordinary.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice sounded in Claire\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now?\u201d Claire half-heartedly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis gaze was a king\u2019s gaze.\u201d Walter said, certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, when did you start sounding like those hypocrites?\u201d Claire mocked. But really, she knew the situation very clearly. The contest for the throne had already started, but she had no intention of joining their battle. It was always like that in the royal family. From the moment you were born into it, the words familial affection were basically already a huge joke. As long as it didn\u2019t affect who she cared about, she didn\u2019t care about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t! I understand a little bit of star reading.\u201d Walter refuted stoutly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh really? Then, O, great star reader, why couldn\u2019t you read that you would meet the overpowered Holy Divine Son that day? Why couldn\u2019t you read that you weren\u2019t his match?\u201d Claire\u2019s venomous tongue retorted even more unyielding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, well\u2026 I said I only understand a bit.\u201d Walter withered.</p><br/><p>The corner of Claire\u2019s mouth lifted into an imperceptible smile. For some reason, it was interesting poking fun at Walter.</p><br/><p>But Claire understood Walter actually knew a bit of star reading. The second prince Nancy had a big chance of becoming the next emperor because he had the hidden support of Duke Gordon. As for Duke Gordon, he must have his own reasons for supporting the prince secretly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what are you thinking? When can we leave? This place seems annoying.\u201d Walter voice sounded in Claire\u2019s head, \u201cAlso, your first Master says he was going to help me, so how is it going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m debating on how to give you a bath, either frying or boiling.\u201d Claire said coldly after hearing Walter\u2019s last sentence. \u201cIf you want to receive anything, first ask yourself what you have given. Around here, before you demand, you must first contribute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter shivered. This little devil!!! Just now they were joking around, and he became careless and thought it would easier to talk to her. But in truth, her beautiful clothes couldn\u2019t cover this little devil\u2019s inherent maliciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, but right now I don\u2019t have any power, how can I help you?\u201d Walter pouted, like he was hugely wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we get back, tell me all about dark magic. Tell me every spell you know, so I can go home and study it.\u201d This request was too greedy, too much. But, that is if Claire was of the Dark nature. Walter curled his lip. Who cared if he told. Did Claire think it was a big deal? In any case, Claire can\u2019t learn Dark magic because of her attribute and position, and based on Claire\u2019s devil personality, she would not teach anyone any magic. In short, telling Claire about Dark magic was basically no loss to Walter.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay okay, no problem, no problem at all.\u201d Walter promised in a rush, then added, \u201cWhen can we leave this stupid place? The Light essence on that old man and Holy Divine Prince makes me nauseated.\u201d Even though Walter didn\u2019t have a body anymore, that dense and pure Light essence still made him very disgusted and uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the banquet ends.\u201d Claire answered casually. Walter was just about to sigh out loud, disappointed, when Claire slyly added, \u201cBut, I can take you to the garden for a walk, then leave when the banquet ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYay, Claire you are such a nice person.\u201d Walter couldn\u2019t help but exclaiming. Then he came back to his senses and convulsed. Devil! Big, big devil! Set a trap for him so he would call her nice. If she was a nice person, then there would be no nice people on the world.</p><br/><p>In the garden, a cool breeze blew. Claire sat quietly on the bench, gazing at the starry night. Right above her, the brightest star was twinkling.</p><br/><p>\u201cA legendary person has been born, most likely in this country.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice suddenly floated into Claire\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d Claire was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cStar reading. Although I don\u2019t have any devices or power, I can still look at the stars.\u201d Walter stated confidently, \u201cLook at that brightest star above your head, it wasn\u2019t there a few months ago. It appeared suddenly. Those bitches at the Temple of Light must be working their butts off now.\u201d Walter cursed scornfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain it.\u201d Claire frowned. A strange feeling flashed in her heart, but was only there for an instant, and she didn\u2019t catch it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

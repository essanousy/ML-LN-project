What precious items!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The devil found them for me.\u201d Claire handed over the one ring to each person. \u201cMaster,\u201d she said to Cliff. \u201cDoes your storage ring have as much space as this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe devil gave them to you?\u201d Cliff\u2019s mouth was wide open. He could not believe it, it was inconceivable.</p><br/><p>When Cliff sensed the amount of space inside the ring, he practically blushed with shame. \u201cSuch a large amount of space! It\u2019s twenty times larger than my ring\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s switch. Give me your old one.\u201d Claire started to calculate what to do with the other storage rings.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, why did the devil treat you so well?\u201d Jean muttered, staring at the storage ring in his palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was just bored. And these are just trash in her eyes. She was merely giving them to me as a way of throwing them away,\u201d Claire shrugged. She materialized the corroded sword, but as soon as it fully materialized, it clattered to the ground, too heavy.</p><br/><p>Trash? Interspatial storage rings were trash?! Such priceless, nearly nonexistent treasure was trash to the devil?!</p><br/><p>Just when Cliff was moving items from his old storage ring to the new one, he noticed the corroded sword on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sword was also given to me by the devil. But besides being exceptionally heavy, I have not discovered anything else special about it.\u201d Claire stared at the sword, befuddled. \u201cBut she specially told me to take this sword, so it must be special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff crouched down and examined the sword carefully. Gradually, his expression turned astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this sword is the legendary Sword of Death?!\u201d Cliff\u2019s voice started trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Sword of Death?\u201d Claire frowned. She had never heard of any treasured sword with that name.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sword of Death is a magic sword. Legends say the continent was once one entire empire instead of five such as now and the founding emperor used the Sword of Death to carve out the path of the empire,\u201d Jean said, solemn. \u201cThe Sword of Death does not have any specific elemental attribute, but has a much more terrifying effect. Anybody attacked by this sword will hallucinate, be paralyzed, and completely lose their ability to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes widened, recalling the underground palace the young master had brought her to. Was the ruins of the once magnificent palace that of the founding emperor\u2019s? But why would the palace be there? And what about the white bones?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, you\u2019ve found a treasure.\u201d Cliff eyed the sword, a grin forming. \u201cI never expected this! What a strange situation, a devil helping a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Claire\u2019s temper flared and she glared. \u201cYou ran into Devil Field so rashly. If something happened to you, what would I do? Even if you made a breakthrough, there\u2019s no guarantee you would have been able to exit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, don\u2019t be like that\u2026 Isn\u2019t everybody just fine? I just <i>knew</i> my darling disciple was no ordinary person, even devils help you. Haha, I\u2019m a sorcerer now, hahaha\u2026\u201d Claire laughed heartily towards the sky, delighted.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s mouth twitched. The old man before her with such immature behavior had actually become a sorcerer, but\u2026 Acting like this, he didn\u2019t seem powerful at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Jean\u2019s voice came quietly, full of conflicting emotion.</p><br/><p>Claire turned to look at Jean. \u201cThis sword is for you,\u201d she said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 too valuable*.\u201d Jean stared at the sword, his expression complex. It was the legendary Sword of Death! Every warrior\u2019s dream!</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s too heavy*, I can\u2019t even lift it. You take it. If you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m throwing it back into Devil Field,\u201d Claire shrugged and said heedlessly.</p><br/><p>*Pun because valuable also means heavy</p><br/><p>Jean was speechless. He slowly picked up the Sword of Death.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you need to disguise the sword. If someone recognizes it, there will be trouble. And can you do something about this rust?\u201d Claire asked Cliff, who was in the middle of moving his belongings to the new ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhmm, no problem, leave it to me. Ahaha, the storage ring space is so big\u2026\u201d Cliff was laughing heartily, not sparing so much as a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, thank you\u2026\u201d Jean felt a surge of warmth.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t think much of it. She turned to watch Cliff move his belongings. She was trying to see if there was anything valuable she could exploit.</p><br/><p>Jean stared at the sword in his hand, his emotions surging for a while. Sword of Death, I will use you to guard my lady until the end of time, Jean swore in his heart, swearing on his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, Claire, let\u2019s go back to the capital, hurry. I need to find Lawrence, that old fox, and flaunt. I\u2019m going to chase him through the streets until he\u2019s sorry!\u201d Cliff had his hands on his hips, laughing wildly. He had already forgotten the danger of almost failing his breakthrough.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Jean.\u201d Claire strutted ahead, acting as if she didn\u2019t know Cliff.</p><br/><p>Jean smiled and followed from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, come on. Let me disguise your sword, haha\u2026\u201d Cliff was still laughing as he followed them, so gleeful he was.</p><br/><p>Things seemed perfect, but\u2026 Little did Claire know the cruel ordeal awaiting her.</p><br/><p>The pope was waiting for Claire\u2019s return.</p><br/><p>Having exited Devil Field safely, Claire\u2019s heart had finally settled. The three journeyed back to Amparkland leisurely.</p><br/><p>Once Cliff tested Claire\u2019s magic power, he was shocked. Claire was already at the level of a grand wizard!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Claire, you\u2019re only fourteen, but you\u2019re already a grand wizard!\u201d Cliff shouted to the sky. \u201cMy goodness, you will be the youngest sorcerer in history, haha, worthy of being my disciple.\u201d He shook his rump delightfully. \u201cNow I can teach you high level incantations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what about forbidden incantations? I want to learn forbidden incantations!\u201d Of course Claire wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with only high level incantations.</p><br/><p>\u201cLearn with your head! You can\u2019t use forbidden incantations yet. They will deplete too much of your energy, endangering your life, understand?\u201d Cliff rejected her immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to learn. It\u2019s not like I said I will use them yet,\u201d Claire persisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. Only high level incantations.\u201d Cliff shook his head, not willing to give in.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me back the ring!\u201d Claire humphed, arms crossed, nose raised. She pulled out a few ninth grade magic cores and sighed in a regretful tone. \u201cI was going to give these to you, Master, but\u2026 Forget about it. And these\u2026\u201d Claire took out the precious ores from the underground palace and waved them before Cliff\u2019s eyes, then put them all back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! So many ninth grade magic cores! And Reedle ore and Cyndler ores! Claire, where did you get so much precious stuff, ahhhhhh, lemme see\u2026\u201d Cliff howled ecstatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cGimme forbidden incantations then.\u201d Claire walked forward, ignoring Cliff\u2019s howl.</p><br/><p>Cliff caught up to Claire hurriedly and fawned, \u201cOk, ok, I give. What kinds of incantations do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jean watched the two, a smile forming on his lips. He also sped up.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the capital, people of the Temple of Light were already there at the gates to cut them off before they could return to Hill manor.</p><br/><p>\u201cReverend,\u201d a believer of the Temple addressed Claire respectfully. \u201cHis holiness has already been waiting for some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know I was returning today?\u201d Claire frowned, somewhat annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been waiting here on his holiness\u2019s orders ever since you left.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had waited here the entire time?!</p><br/><p>\u201cReverend, please return to the Temple. His holiness is awaiting you,\u201d he said, indicating towards a pure white carriage not far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, you return first,\u201d Clare instructed. \u201cTell Grandfather I have returned. I will be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d But before Jean could finish, Cliff interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, you should go. I will accompany Claire. I was going to go find Lawrence anyways.\u201d Cliff grinned at Jean. His words were clear: he was going to protect Claire. Naturally, Cliff understood what Jean was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jean nodded, finally relenting to return to Hill manor.</p><br/><p>Claire and Cliff got on the carriage together and went directly to the Temple of Light.</p><br/><p>As they passed through the main entrance, believers bowed to Claire along the way. A priest was second only to the Diving Prince and Divine Princess, so naturally, she was respected.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoho, disciple, from now on, Master shall rely on you.\u201d Cliff smiled vulgarly, his eyes slits.</p><br/><p>Claire rolled her eyes. \u201cGo and find sir Lawrence. Don\u2019t act like you know me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff snickered and followed a servant girl, turning past a corner, to find Lawrence.</p><br/><p>Claire continued forward towards the main temple.</p><br/><p>A servant girl led Claire through the main temple and past a side corridor, all the way in.</p><br/><p>\u201cReverend, his holiness is just inside. Your servant shall take her leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire knocked on the door lightly. A low voice came from within. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly pushing the door open, Claire saw the pope standing at the windowsill, his hands behind his back.</p><br/><p>Slowly, the pope turned around. He broke into a smile. \u201cOur Reverend is finally willing to return?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent, watching the seemingly benevolent old man. The pope was, as usual, dressed in white with his air of authority.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

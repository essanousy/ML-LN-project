Xi Shaoqi\u2019s face was full of bitterness, but he didn\u2019t dare to speak. Waldo has a higher position than them, and he was also stronger. Every time Camille bullies him, he would vent his anger on the two brothers. He was the type of person who would bully the weak but fear the strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang, I\u2019m telling you \u2026\u201d Waldo became eloquent. He began to boast about his travels and how his strengths improved. He talked about the branch halls he had sneak-attacked. However, he didn\u2019t mention how he was chased after and trapped by many experts.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled and didn\u2019t interrupt, waiting for Waldo to chatter on. Finally, Waldo was tired, and Qi Aoshuang introduced the others. When she introduced that Judy who was dressed in red was actually a dragon, Camille\u2019s eyes flashed a unnoticeable light. What caused everyone to be shocked was the existence of Aosta who was actually the prince of the elvish clan. After introductions, Waldo bounced to the side of Dong Fenghou and asked him aside to inquire why he had changed.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaosi told Qi Aoshuang about the things after they had returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cUzas\u2019 reputation in Uusari is high. Of course, it\u2019s not for his former identity, but his current identity. People called him a Swashbuckler. They don\u2019t even know his identity. And now, the emperor had sent soldiers to encircle and annihilate them more than once\u201d. Shi Shaosi reported seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, the emperor also realizes that there is a threat. \u201cXi Shaoqi hummed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, good. Now all we have to do is to take back everything Uzas deserves. \u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled. With Uzas\u2019 support, the first thing needed to do was to eliminate all the forces of Light in Uusari!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means to go to the capital city of Uusari.\u201dXi Shaoqi felt happily as he had something interesting to do finally.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a branch hall of the Light Temple in the capital of Uusari.\u201d Camille tapped the table gently, his voice was soft, \u201cthe Temple will intervene in a coup like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang nodded gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Fenghou, Waldo and the Xi brothers, you guys bring people to take apart the palace. I will go with Leng Lingyun to the palace. \u201d Camille took out a map and spread it out on the table. He was clearly prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the layout of the shrine is like this. There are only two cardinal in the temple. The archbishop had died in the confrontation with Aoshuang last time. The new archbishop had not been voted yet. \u201cCamille\u2019s long white fingers moved on the map.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to look at the layout. Now these trees or bullshit bishops aren\u2019t even my opponent now.\u201d Waldo\u2019s nostrils flared with cold air as he said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cPig heads.\u201d Camille gracefully smiled. He said the words in a clear and gentle voice.</p><br/><p>Waldo\u2019s face turned red because of anger, but before he could speak, he heard Qi Aoshuang snorted coldly. Valdo\u2019s arrogance subsided and went aside and became silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, please continue, honorable Captain.\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled at Camille. Camille fiddled with his bangs on his forehead and posed a graceful and perfect pose and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to destroy the temple, but after we destroy it, there will be a lot of people willing to fund it. Even they will be bankrupt, those people are willing. \u201d Camille continued blandly. The Temple had penetrated deep into the hearts of those people as the personification of tolerance, purity, greatness and justice. So, what we need to do is to break this illusion. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two Cardinal don\u2019t like each other because they both want to be the archbishop,\u201d Camille had apparently found out all these out, and \u201cthere is a secret compartment behind the bookshelves in their study, where books are kept. The records on these account books cannot be seen by the public.\u201d After saying that, Camille looked meaningfully at the stunned Waldo. \u201cDo you understand what you need to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know it clearly? Could it be that you went missing a short while ago \u2026 \u201d Waldo looked at Camille in surprise. Camille was the king of assassins. No one could stop him where he wanted to go.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was also shocked. Camille did such a dangerous thing for her. Did he know that if he chose to stand on her side, he was to be the enemy of many people? Camille looked at Qi Aoshuang who was stunned. He smiled. The expression in his eyes was obvious. This was his choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMemory crystals could be of great help. \u201cCamille squinted, his eyes flashing with cold light.\u201d When the time comes, we\u2019ll have to record it in detail, and the account book, send it to everyone later\u201d. Camille\u2019s voice was soft, but it sounded eerie in the ears of the crowd. This technique was ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and Leng Lingyun go to the palace, can you make it?\u201d Waldo finally caught the chance to satirize. Leng Lingyun was no longer the noble son of the Holy Light Temple. How could he safely enter the palace and carry out their plans? Was it that easy to start a coup?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not only us. There is also Jin Yan. \u201cCamille smiled and looked at Jin Yan, then raised his eyebrows slightly. \u201d Jin Yan, are you now a knight of the Kingdom of Ampagland, or a knight of Aoshuang\u2019s? \u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was slightly surprised. Even Qi Aoshuang was stunned. They didn\u2019t understand what Camille meant by that.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Yan did not hesitate. He indifferently said, \u201cnaturally, I am a knight for Miss.\u201d His voice was soft, but his tone was very firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s good.\u201d Camille smiled like a spring breeze and gracefully picked up a teacup and softly said, \u201cdo you have a dragon knight in Uusari?\u201d After said this, Camille sipped. Tea, no more words.</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately understood what Camille intended to say. There was no dragon knight in poor Uusari. If the Dragon Knight, Jin Yan, appeared in the imperial capital and the emperor, no matter how debauched this emperor was, he would know the importance of Dragon Knight. Then the emperor will try to win him over. Then it was not that Camille\u2019s group can not enter the palace, but the emperor would come to ask them if they would like to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what.\u201d Waldo spoke the words and stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, when the time comes?\u201d Camille smiled, \u201cgathering the ministers, finally let the emperor and the queen told the story back then. With Judy, all resistance is nil. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can the emperor and queen tell the things happened before obediently?\u201d Waldo grunted, his mouth twitching.</p><br/><p>\u201d I have a way.\u201d Camille smiled. \u201cwithout spiritual control, I can make them tell the truth all back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it so magical?\u201d Waldo mumbled, his eyes tilted, but he didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s something more miraculous. I can make you sleep forever after you go asleep tonight.\u201d Camille squinted, smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>Waldo shuddered and said nothing. He realized again how unwise it would be to retort Camille.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned slightly as she listened to Camille\u2019s arrangement. She felt that something was not right. But what was wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, where is Aoshuang?\u201d Waldo suddenly recalled something.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang finally understood what was wrong with the plan. She was not in Camille\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the key point,\u201d. Camille stopped smiling and looked at Qi Aoshuang and said, \u201cAoshuang, what will you do if Lagka and the Ampagland begin to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>What! Everyone in the hall looked at Camille in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Light Temple is now greatly injured. The remaining forces have been put on you. Ampagland is looking for excuses. Things had already grown even more intense as they had been suppressing the Chamber of Commerce of the Feng Family. The Chamber of Commerce of the Feng Family has been a mainstay of the Lagka\u2019s economy. The emperor of Lagka was greedy, this time it only hastened the outbreak of conflict between the two countries\u201d. Camille looked at Qi Aoshuang with a burning gaze. He spoke clearly: \u201cthe Temple and Ampagland jointly suppressed the Chamber of Commerce of the Feng Family. Feng Yixun\u2019s appearance has temporarily changed the situation. But this is only for the time being. A war between the two countries is a matter of time. \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang quietly looked at Camille\u2019s serious face. After a long silence, she finally said, \u201chow is the Li family of the four families of Lagka now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are actively preparing for battle.\u201d Camille said blandly, \u201cthere\u2019s a reason for it, taking revenge for your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang froze for a moment as she stared at Camille, something flickering in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe target there is very large. \u201cCamille said gently,\u201d give me half a year. No, three months, I will make Uusari support you and wipe out all the forces of Light in Uusari. You can do what you want to do during this period of time. Of course, these fellows must stay to help me. \u201d Camille squinted at the crowd in the hall.</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately understood Camille. Xi Shaoqi and Xi Shaosi clenched their fists in excitement. This kind of thing was very exciting to hear. Qi Aoshuang was clear what the large target Camille mentioned meant. They were afraid that the Temple would send angles to interfere in the two countries\u2019 war. She was not sure how many angels will descend this time. At present, it seemed like there were two eight-winged angels. If these angels attacked the Li family or the Feng family, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you need to do is to improve your strength. All schemes are useless in front of absolute power.\u201d Camille lifted his cup and peeped at Xi Shaosi. Xi Shaosi felt a chill on his back looking at Camille\u2019s gentle gaze. He went to pour tea for Camille. Camille\u2019s eyes glanced at the cup in front of Qi Aoshuang. Xi Shaosi immediately understood and quickly poured tea for Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Qi Aoshuang looked deeply at Camille, unable to say a word. This man was always so profound and unpredictable. What kind of person he was? Why did he do so much for her? Qi Aoshuang knew clearly in her heart that what Camille had just said was definitely not bragging. He had the strength to do such things.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think about it? If you have any objections, you can withdraw right now. This time, it\u2019s not just against Ampagland, but also the Light Temple. \u201d Camille asked, smiling with squinting eyes. However, there wasn\u2019t the slightest temperature or bit of ripples in his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

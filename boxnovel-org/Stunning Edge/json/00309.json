However, she did not wait for news of the others\u2019 whereabouts. Instead, she waited for a piece of news that surprised her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that the White King of the Seven Kings rebelled and killed the Heavenly King?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the sullen King Mi Xiu and confirmed the information he had just received from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, the King of White rebelled and went to the Heavenly King Palace without summoning anyone. After killing the Heavenly King, we don\u2019t know how he absorbed all of the Heavenly King\u2019s power.\u201d Now he\u2019s going to rule the world. \u201d The king said in a low voice, his face turning uglier by the minute.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you choose to submit or to resist now?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cKill him.\u201d With a bitter smile, he continued, \u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019ll wait for us to submit.\u201d The White King had become the new Heavenly King, and he wanted to place his own power in the new place. Not only that, since the White King had become the Heavenly King, the new King White would also appear. \u201cOnce the remaining six Kings meet up with the new White King, they can activate the Seal of Asura and exterminate the new Heavenly King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you all can\u2019t rebel in the past. In the past, you seven kings gathered together to exterminate the Heavenly King back then.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but we won\u2019t.\u201d A faint smile appeared on Mi Xiu\u2019s face as he spoke softly. \u201cHeavenly King is a very good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything, because she could tell that the relationship between the two was indeed very good. It was because the light in the eyes of the Mi Xiu King flickered and slowly turned into anger. \u201cI never would have thought that the White King would actually kill the Heavenly King!\u201d His relationship with the Heavenly King was clearly that good. Every year at the banquet, the two of them would drink to their heart\u2019s content. Sometimes, they would even hug each other and laugh. Why would the White King do such a thing?! \u201cWhy, why?!\u201d At the end of his speech, the Mi Xiu emperor was so angry that he couldn\u2019t help himself. His hand pounded violently on the table, shaking it until everything on it jumped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if you asked him this question yourself?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask him myself, and I\u2019m going to kill him myself.\u201d The king\u2019s face grew cold as he stood up. \u201cMiss Ao Shuang, I\u2019m leaving to reunite with the other emperors.\u201d \u201cWe need to find a new White King, activate the Asura Seal, and kill the current Heavenly King.\u201d A flash of pain flickered in the eyes of the Mi Xiu emperor as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang thought for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo all the people in this place will be dismissed. I don\u2019t think the Heavenly King would have done anything to these unrelated ordinary people. Do you want to go with me or do you want to? \u201d Mi Xiu asked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I went with you. Do you think that the current Heavenly King will kindly invite me in? \u201d \u201cNo matter what, you will protect me by your side. Why wouldn\u2019t I follow you if I had a bodyguard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mixiu was speechless. She nodded. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s get ready to set off.\u201d \u201cAlso, we have to hide our whereabouts, the Heavenly King is currently sending people to chase us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded. Her current status was basically a drag on the bucket. What other conditions could she have in mind?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get ready.\u201d Mi Xiu said tiredly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep my things in the ring.\u201d Xiao Aushuang replied, then asked curiously, \u201cWhat about your subordinates?\u201d \u201cHow did you put it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can we do? I\u2019m just warning them, if the Heavenly King\u2019s men come, it would be best to negotiate.\u201d \u201cObey them.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want them to suffer any harm.\u201d As for them, they are in charge of the various small territories under me. If they sign a contract and swear loyalty to us, the Heavenly King should not make things difficult for them. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to kill us all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good leader.\u201d Looking at Mi Xiu\u2019s sad face, Qi Ao Shuang said from the bottom of her heart. Although this person spoke with a womanly tone and looked very perverted, this person\u2019s heart was very soft and kind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, our Heavenly King is actually an even better person \u2026\u201d After saying this, he didn\u2019t say anything else. Instead, he turned and waved his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you at the entrance tonight. I still have matters to attend to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, don\u2019t think too much. One day, everything will return to normal.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said comfortingly to the back of King Mi Xiu.</p><br/><p>The king simply waved his hand and said nothing more.</p><br/><p>Soon, the palace became noisy. There were crying sounds, noises, and hurried footsteps. Xiao Ao Shuang leaned against the pillar, watching the palace change, feeling emotional in her heart. He could tell how everyone felt at this moment. Indeed, one could see the truth of the situation when faced with a difficult situation. There were women who cried bitterly and refused to leave King Mi Xiu, but there were also those who took the money and ran away in a hurry. \u2018Human nature, \u2018Qi Ao Shuang sighed as she shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, this King Mi Xiu is actually quite a nice person.\u201d The golden lotus appeared beside Qi Ao Shuang and sighed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I hated him at first. I thought he was disgusting.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to be such a loyal person.\u201d Liu Li also came out. She laid on the back of the golden lotus, holding the golden lotus, stretching her neck and neck as she watched the cold and warm scene in the palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very curious as to what sort of person the original Heavenly King is.\u201d However, Qi Ao Shuang said this. To be able to make such a person as this Emperor Mi Xiu revere him, he must be an extremely gentle and kind person.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s better to make the best use of your time to recover your strength.\u201d It\u2019s always so insecure for me. \u201d Golden Lotus pouted in protest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a man, you actually dare to say such things.\u201d Liu Li reached out her hand to grab onto the golden lotus\u2019s mouth, causing it to grimace.</p><br/><p>\u201cSunk in letting the boredom squeeze in to make the man. (I\u2019ll show you now if I\u2019m a man.) \u201c)\u201d After saying that, Golden Lotus disappeared together with Liu Li. Qi Ao Shuang shook her head in amusement.</p><br/><p>Night gradually descended, and the palace gradually became empty. The last line was deathly silent, and only the whistling of the wind echoed in the palace. Qi Ao Shuang stood beside the pillar and looked at the dispirited King Mi Xiu, sighing softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMi Xiu emperor, everything is over.\u201d What is yours is yours, and will come back. If you insist on staying, you will eventually leave as well. \u201cNow that this opportunity has presented itself, it might not be a bad thing to separate what is yours.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang comforted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is mine will ultimately be mine, not mine will ultimately leave \u2026\u201d Mi Xiu muttered to himself, his eyes filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were blinded by what you had before. Don\u2019t you see a lot of things clearly now?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>Mi Xiu\u2019s eyes gradually became clear. He understood what Xiao Aushuang was trying to say. He slowly raised his head and looked at her. \u201cI understand. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to thank me. Let\u2019s go. I still want you to help me find someone else. Protect me along the way and then find the entrance to spacetime.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled, \u201cIf you keep getting distracted, the one who will be in danger will be me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Mi Xiu King smiled. \u201cQi Aoshuang, no matter what, thank you.\u201d \u201cMy name is not King Mishu, my name is Mishus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, Mezus, let\u2019s go.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled at him and the two of them walked out of the hall.</p><br/><p>Standing outside the main hall, Mishen turned and stared at the hall. Qi Ao Shuang thought that Misheng was remembering the things that had passed, so she stood still and waited. However, his eyes slowly widened. He watched as Mishus chanted some incantations and made two strange gestures. A transparent barrier slowly extended from the two sides of the palace, then closed towards the center, enveloping the palace inside. Following a rumbling sound, the palace began to sink, slowly vanishing into the ground.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was dumbfounded. She waited until Mishus turned around before she smiled and said, \u201cThis is how my palace is designed. It can become an underground palace.\u201d \u201cEven though the speed changes slower, the Wan Wang\u2019s palace can still move in the air.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEach of your king\u2019s palaces has its own uniqueness?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Mishus nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I have always forgotten to tell you that the appearance of a young man in the Moon King is very similar to the character of one of the people you told me about. He has red hair and is good at wind magic. King Yue felt that his future is limitless, so he wanted to take him under his banner. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Feng Yixuan!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems to be that name.\u201d Moon King wanted to subdue him, but he kept saying that he had something important to do. \u201cWhen King Yue got angry, he threw him into his cultivation space.\u201d Seeing the nervous expression on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face, Mezus quickly comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d That space was not dangerous at all. Rather, it was a good place for cultivation. We\u2019re going to find the Moon King and meet him first. Our territory is the furthest from the palace. \u201cRelatively speaking, it is the safest.\u201d After saying this, Mezus sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Yue is still in his palace?\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t that mean the target is obvious?\u201d Xiao Aushuang asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, King Yue received the news before me. He should have already settled everything.\u201d Matthews shook his head slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how do we meet?\u201d What about Feng Yixuan? \u201cWhat will happen to Feng Yixuan?\u201d This was what Xiao Aushuang was most concerned about. This was because Feng Yixuan should be the same as her. His strength had been drained by the torrent of time and space.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d The cultivation space of the Moon King could be carried around with him. No, the entrance can take it with you. It\u2019s a bracelet, so you don\u2019t have to worry about your friend. Matthews explained. When Xiao Aushuang heard this, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, we have to be fast.\u201d Find the Moon King and quickly gather with the other kings. The worst thing is, White King, when and where the new White King will be born, we have no clue at all! \u201cThis is the worst!\u201d When he thought of the most important question, he felt his head begin to spin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the conditions to become the White King?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhy would it suddenly appear like this \u2026\u201d he thought to himself in a strange way. Mishus\u2019 face turned even uglier when he said this. \u201cIt\u2019s said that everything is predestined.\u201d F * * k! What do you mean by predestined? How do we know? \u201cWhere are we going to find a new King of White?!\u201d The more Matthews spoke, the angrier he became.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Ao Shuang was puzzled. Destined? Everything was destined? What does that mean?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

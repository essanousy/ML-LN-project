She thought about the scene where Duke Roman got up, tottering, then Alice\u2019s hostile gaze, and then Duke Gordan\u2019s smiling face, ignoring the many passerby\u2019s gazes. A golden haired blue eyed beautiful girl riding a powerful leopard naturally attracted many eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp\u2026\u201d White Emperor rolled down Claire\u2019s head softly and crouched at her shoulder, licking her neck lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Emperor\u2026\u201d Claire scooped him off and looked at him. \u201cAre you trying to make me feel better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Golden Lotus\u2019s unhappy voice suddenly sounded. \u201cMa, this little meatball is very unstable. He has terrifying power, but can\u2019t use his power smoothly whenever he wants to. Usually, he\u2019s a useless little pet, and his intelligence level is the same. He\u2019s actually your master though. Surpass him quickly, then beat him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp!\u201d White Emperor waved his little claws angrily, evidently unsatisfied with Golden Lotus\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Claire smiled faintly. At least her mood had gone up a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Little Leopard. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d Claire patted the wind leopard\u2019s neck softly, indicating for the wind leopard to start running.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I said sorry.\u201d Suddenly, Claire heard a pitiful voice.</p><br/><p>Claire turned to look and saw a delicate and pretty girl at the side of the road being surrounded by two burly men, one in front, one behind. The burly man in front said fiercely, \u201cWhatever, you bumped into me, I can\u2019t work today now. Pay money!\u201d It turns out, they were local thugs blackmailing a girl. Seeing this situation, Claire didn\u2019t feel like doing anything. But once Claire saw the pretty girl clearly, she made Little Leopard stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay money? Then, then how much?\u201d The delicate girl asked fearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cTen gold coins!\u201d The burly man said. Ten gold coins was how much the average commoner family used up in a month.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? That much?\u2026\u201d The pretty girl had a sullen expression. \u201cI, I don\u2019t have that much money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much do you have?\u201d The burly man asked fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have this much\u2026\u201d The pretty girl cautiously fished out a plain and simple wallet.</p><br/><p>The burly man grabbed it, then poured out all the money inside. There were only three gold coins and some copper coins.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re lucky. This much is enough.\u201d The burly man sneered and was about to put the money away. The pretty girl watched fearfully. \u201cBut, but that\u2019s all my money, if I give it to you, I can\u2019t eat any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares\u2026\u201d The burly threw the empty bag, about to leave. The other burly man also laughed loudly and followed from behind.</p><br/><p>But when they turned, they faced a huge, fierce leopard. The burly men stepped back fearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cPick up the wallet and give her her money back.\u201d The girl sitting on the leopard said coldly, her tone devoid of warmth.</p><br/><p>The two burly men gulped, fearfully. Naturally, they knew that the icy cold girl in front of them wasn\u2019t ordinary. How could an ordinary person ride such a fearsome magic beast?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you deaf? Do you want me to cut off your ears?\u201d Claire eyes became slits, a dangerous glint in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, sorry, sorry.\u201d One of the burly men abruptly came back to his senses and quickly crouched down to pick up the wallet, then cautiously put back all the blackmailed money and handed it to Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire grabbed it and said coldly, \u201cNow get lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two ran like rabbits and were gone without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour wallet.\u201d Claire got off the wind leopard and gave the money back to the pretty girl, who was in a trance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank, thank you\u2026 thank you very much. This is one of the only things my mother left behind.\u201d The pretty girl put away the wallet carefully .</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very poor?\u201d Claire sized up her simple clothes and honest gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, my family\u2019s very poor. It had been just me and Mother living deep in the mountains. When Mother passed away, I went out, wanting to see the outside world. I finally came here with great difficulty\u2026\u201d When the pretty girl said she was poor, she didn\u2019t show any embarrassment.</p><br/><p>An imperceptible smile appeared on Claire\u2019s lips. She said straightforwardly, \u201cWork for me and I\u2019ll give you a hundred golden coins a year, including food, shelter, and clothes. You\u2019ll live well, eat well, and wear new clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The pretty girl exclaimed. \u201cIs that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally. Just sign a five year contract first. If you feel the pay is good, we\u2019ll sign another contract. If you do well, I\u2019ll give you more money.\u201d Claire smiled like a flower, as friendly as could be.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, great, big sis, you\u2019re a really good person!\u201d The pretty girl was so happy, she almost started jumping up and down.</p><br/><p>Claire watched without a word. Her gaze landed on the bow on the girl\u2019s back. The ordinary looking bow was extremely sleek and glossy at the pulling point, caused by being shot many, many times. Ordinary bows would have fractured long ago, so the bow was definitely not as simple as it appeared. And the delicate and pretty girl\u2019s hands was also inconsistent with her appearance, both of them full of callouses. There was only one explanation: the girl was a very good archer and could shoot with both hands ambidextrously!</p><br/><p>A hundred gold coins, today she had made a profit!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Claire patted behind herself, indicating for the young girl to get on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Qiao Chuxin.\u201d The young girl hopped nimbly onto the wind leopard, not even the slightest bit scared of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m Claire. From now on, I will be your boss, your leader. Listen to me from now on, understand?\u201d Now Claire started to brainwash shamelessly. But she froze for a moment internally. Another ancient last name. What relationship did this continent have with the Orient?</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, then what should I call you?\u201d Qiao Chuxin agreed straightforwardly. In her eyes, this pretty big sister was the best person in the world besides her mom.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall me Claire. But you must listen to my orders seriously. Of course I won\u2019t let you do anything that crosses your bottom line.\u201d Claire added.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, no problem.\u201d Qiao Chuxin agreed happily.</p><br/><p>Claire patted the wind leopard, directing it to run quickly towards Camille\u2019s house. Truthfully, she was a bit tired. One night without sleep and she had worked for so long. It was time to go back and rest.</p><br/><p>After they arrived back at Claire\u2019s home, Claire dragged Qiao Chuxin to Camille\u2019s study, making her sign a five year contract of hard labor. Only after she put the contract away, satisfied, did she yawn and think about sleeping.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on to these golden banknotes for now, I\u2019ll first pay for one year. If there\u2019s not enough, just ask. When I get home tomorrow, I\u2019ll prepare a nice place for you to live.\u201d Claire said between yawns, completely ignoring the group of confused people at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Summer, come over here.\u201d Claire beckoned towards Summer, who peeping through the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Summer walked over, confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Qiao Chunxin. From now on, she\u2019s one of us. First bring her to the streets and buy some clothes, then buy her things that she likes but is reluctant to buy. Introduce her to them. I\u2019m going to rest; I\u2019m too tired. Many things happened today. Tomorrow, we\u2019re going to the auction house.\u201d Claire ordered quickly while yawning.</p><br/><p>Summer\u2019s mouth twitched. What? She just pushed it all onto her? It was clearly Claire who brought her back, not her!</p><br/><p>\u201cChuxin, accompany Summer. I\u2019m going to rest, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d Claire yawned, about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me money to buy things then.\u201d Summer hurriedly called.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have so much money, can\u2019t you just give your new comrade money?\u201d Claire reprimanded, annoyed, then walked past everybody to her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cStingy miser, humph!\u201d Summer cursed, but in her heart, she felt strangely warm. Comrade, that\u2019s right, she who had always been alone now had a comrade. It was all due to Claire that she could feel warm.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s not stingy, she even said she\u2019ll give be a hundred golden coins a year along with food, shelter, and clothing.\u201d Chuxin, who hadn\u2019t suffered Claire\u2019s cruelty yet, quickly defended Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d When everybody heard, they all became interested, all asking what what going on.</p><br/><p>Once Qiao Chuxin told everything in detail about how she met Claire and their contract, everybody looked at each other in dismay, cursing Claire\u2019s shamelessness internally. She definitely wasn\u2019t kind enough to help someone for no reason. Instead, Claire actually gave a salary that didn\u2019t count as much. Although this salary was considered very high for commoners, it was nothing to Claire! Just what was this treacherous person planning?</p><br/><p>Although everybody was thinking this, they didn\u2019t dare to show it. Each and every person couldn\u2019t know Claire\u2019s methods any clearer: grab somebody\u2019s weakness and hold on stubbornly, not letting go unless they gave up.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll introduce for you. From now on, you are one of us.\u201d Summer smiled and started to introduce everyone. But really, internally she added another sentence: from now on, you are just like us, one of Claire\u2019s slaves\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As she reached the entrance, Claire sneezed loudly, then wiped her nose. She couldn\u2019t have caught a cold with this weather, could she?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

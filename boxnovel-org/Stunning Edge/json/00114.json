His enemy had been hunting him down and left after killing him.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t plan on letting everybody know about the situation with the god of Darkness after all.</p><br/><p>Was that really what happened? Everybody looked at Claire suspiciously. But if it weren\u2019t, then how could his death be explained? Claire couldn\u2019t have killed him whereas there was no way with his vile attitude that he would leave himself. Was it really his enemy who had killed him?</p><br/><p>Claire frowned, then looked at Ben who had turned back to his human form, her tone slightly displeased. \u201cWhy did you all come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop worrying,\u201d a few voices said at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Sigh*, really now.\u201d Although Claire sounded displeased, in her heart, she felt warmth. She turned towards Ben and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t complete my order so it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben\u2019s mouth twitched. Claire still had the energy to think of that at this moment.</p><br/><p>Claire looked up at the bright moon in the sky, her heart filled with sighs. In this world there were as many experts as the clouds, each a whole mountain higher than the other. She was still far from powerful.</p><br/><p>Nobody noticed the unresigned feelings in Jean and Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes. They had been so weak facing such a formidable enemy. Jean\u2019s hand was on his sword hilt. It was the first time he had so desperately desired strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s leave this place quickly,\u201d Camille said quietly. He gave another of his standard charming smiles.</p><br/><p>Everybody nodded. It was true they shouldn\u2019t stay for long here.</p><br/><p>But just as she took a step forward, a black blur flashed before her eyes. Before anybody could sense what had happened, the black ball had already flown to Claire\u2019s shoulder lightning fast and taken a bit out of Claire\u2019s fair neck! This time, so fast even White Emperor didn\u2019t stop him in time!</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp!\u201d White Emperor chirped furiously, jumping onto Claire\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>But it was too late. A familiar overbearing force surged once again in Claire\u2019s body. It was the power of another forced contract.</p><br/><p>Claire swayed. She was on the verge of being unable to stand. Jean, who was closest, supported her immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Everybody cried in alarm. It truly was, as the saying goes, a new problem arising before the old is resolved.</p><br/><p>A cocky voice invaded Claire\u2019s mind forcefully. \u201cMy name is Black Feather.\u201d Claire understood immediately that it was the black ball\u2019s name. It turns out his name was Black Feather!</p><br/><p>A wave of dizziness hit Claire. The overbearing power was surging within her body aggressively. Also, he was trying to break her and White Emperor\u2019s contract and replace White Emperor.</p><br/><p>Two overbearing and powerful forces started clashing within Claire, both unwilling to give in. But it was Claire who suffered! The two similarly powerful forces wreaked havoc, each trying to drive the other into submission. Meanwhile, Claire\u2019s expression turned more and more pained. She fet like her body was about to explode, it was so painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression changed. He immediately used healing magic, but it seemed to be no help. Instead, Claire\u2019s expression turned more and more painful. Large beads of sweat rolled down Claire\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s expression also changed. He had been supporting Claire\u2019s back with his hand and could feel that it was now drenched in cold sweat!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly did you do?\u201d Li Yuewen bellowed in rage, reaching out towards the black ball.</p><br/><p>But the black ball flew up and peeped twice, watching Claire with a tilted head.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp!\u201d White Emperor lept onto Li Yuewen\u2019s shoulder, chirping anxiously as if he didn\u2019t want Li Yuewen to do anything to the black ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems to be trying to prevent you from harming the black ball,\u201d Camille stroked his chin, pondering. \u201cWhat exactly is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps\u2026 it\u2019s forming a contract?\u201d Jean realized. When White Emperor had first appeared, this had happened too.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Li Yuewen became more frantic. \u201cWhat? Forming a contract? A person can only contract on beast!\u201d At this point in time, she was already well aware that White Emperor was Claire\u2019s contracted beast.</p><br/><p>Summer was also frantic. \u201cWhat do we do now? Will Claire die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, of course now!\u201d Qiao Chuxin immediately retorted. \u201cClaire will definitely be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t touch the black ball right now because we don\u2019t know what will happen to Claire if we harm him. Even White Emperor is trying to stop you from attacking. He should understand the situation better. Don\u2019t do anything for now. We\u2019ll talk more after leaving first,\u201d Jean said in a low voice. After he finished speaking, he scooped up the pained and nearly unconscious Claire.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen came back to her senses and said hurriedly, \u201cRight. First return to the inn to get Claire some rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy go back to the inn when we can go to our next destination? In any case, all of our belongings are in Claire\u2019s interspatial ring.\u201d Ben turned back to his original form and turned to say unwillingly, \u201cI\u2019ll make another exception to let you humans ride on my back, but never again. Come on quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Summer thanked Ben with relief, seeing Claire turn more and more pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best if I hold you so you don\u2019t throw up on my back.\u201d Ben swiped Summer with one claw.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh! You damned uncultured dragon!\u201d Summer yelled in fear, but was unable to break out of his clutches.</p><br/><p>Once everybody was seated on Ben\u2019s black and Black Feather also flew and landed on Jean\u2019s shoulder, Ben started flapping his wings, soaring through the sky. Accompanied with Summer\u2019s screams, the group left. Summer screamed the entire time and ended up vomiting continuously. Although it had been very urgent when they had escaped on Ben\u2019s back, Summer didn\u2019t vomit at all, but now, she vomited uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Ben flew very quickly. Under Li Yuewen\u2019s directions, in order to avoid starting a panic, they ended up landing outside Lagark\u2019s capital. The city gates were shut tightly, but once Li Yuewen and Li Mingyu revealed their identities, the small captain guarding ended up opening the gates. Although the Li clan had declined quite a bit, they were still one of the four major clans. Small figures such as he could not afford to offend such powerful people.</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s expression became more and more dark because now, Claire had completely passed out! Her tightly knit brows indicated that currently, she was suffering an unimaginable amount of pain.</p><br/><p>The group hurried through the streets. The east was already started to lighten. The sky was about to turn bright.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen and Li Mingyu led the group to an ancient and wide residence.</p><br/><p>Two young men were guarding at the door. When they saw the two siblings, their eyes lit up with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, Second Miss, you have returned! Those old fools keep on trying to make things difficult for us every day,\u201d One of the young men said happily to Li Mingyu.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Let\u2019s talk later. I will deal with them. Right now, my friend needs rest.\u201d Li Yuewen waved gestured impatiently.</p><br/><p>Two two\u2019s gazes landed on Claire who was in Jean\u2019s embrace with a little bit of shock. Friend? It was the first time they had ever heard Second Miss say this word! The cold, arrogant Second Miss actually had friends? Were all these people her friends? She actually brought back so many people at once?</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen didn\u2019t waste any time on words, leading everybody away. Everybody followed closely.</p><br/><p>The two young men stood in place, watching the group disappear. They glanced at each other, both seeing surprise and joy, and also hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear that? Second Miss actually said she had a friend?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did! I even thought I heard wrong, but the Second Miss truly did say that. Also, Second Miss seemed very worried for that young lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you notice that there were quite a few experts among them? Is it to help Master and Second Miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope so. Ah! I forget to ask Master and Second Miss how their journey went.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey must have been successful. Those old fools are always thinking of ways to force Master off his position of Patriarch. Humph! A group of ignorant old fools.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Claire was settled on a large, warm bed, caring expressions surrounding her. Leng Lingyun sat at the side of the bed, examining Claire. Everybody\u2019s worried and hopeful gazes watched Leng Lingyun, hoping Leng Lingyun would say something to ease their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two powerful forces battling within Claire\u2019s body, which is what is causing Claire pain.\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Everybody cried out in alarm. They understood that the two powers were the two magic beasts fighting over the contract. A person could only contract one beast! Claire\u2019s body was now a battlefield?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do now? Kill that black ball bastard? What exactly is this black ball anyways?\u201d Walter asked a bit anxiously. He stared venomously at the black ball crouched next to Claire\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, otherwise Claire will be in danger.\u201d Leng Lingyun shook his head, his expression severe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do? Is there nothing we can do now?\u201d Walter asked angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can only wait.\u201d Leng Lingyun looked at Claire\u2019s pale face and said helplessly, \u201cThe only thing we can do now is wait. Wait for one of the two magic beast\u2019s power to overpower the other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t Claire in great danger?!\u201d Li Yuewen asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait. I believe in Claire. She will be fine,\u201d Camille said softly.</p><br/><p>Qiao Chuxin was crouching next to the bed. She grasped Claire\u2019s hand tightly, her voice resolute. \u201cRight, Claire will be fine. She will definitely be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t die. If die, nobody give food.\u201d Dong Fenghou\u2019s unclear voice came. After he said this, everybody looked at him coldly. He stared back blankly, not understanding what he had done wrong.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

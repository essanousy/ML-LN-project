It was simply too uncomfortable to sleep in the carriage. Strangely, she felt even more tired. She longed for a hot shower.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tell them we\u2019ll go together tomorrow,\u201d Camille said quietly.</p><br/><p>Even after Claire\u2019s group went upstairs, Jackson was still staring at Claire\u2019s figure from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerverted wolf, come back already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ruffian, what are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eyes are about to fall out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ruckus in the corner were Jackson\u2019s underlings.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you group of animals, I still haven\u2019t gotten back at you guys yet.\u201d Jackson shouted as he ran over and then grabbed one of their necks tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander, why does that golden haired green eyed girl look so familiar? I feel like we\u2019ve seen her before. She was a bit far, I didn\u2019t see clearly,\u201d one of the young magicians asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was the beautiful miss we met at Gale Gorge.\u201d Jack smiled. \u201cI never expected to bump into them here. They even became a mercenary group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich mercenary group?\u201d someone nearby asked casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Bao Mercenary Corps.\u201d Jackson smiled as he spoke, but then his smile froze. Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps?! They were actually the Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps? The newly created, powerful mercenary group?</p><br/><p>A few people at the table were also frozen, all staring at their commander with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan.. Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps?\u201d Jackson\u2019s mouth twitched, squeezing out these words. It would be considered normal for a commoner in a distant areas to not recognize this name, but it had already spread within the mercenary world. Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps, a strangely named small mercenary group that had never taken on a mission before suddenly exploded within one night in the mercenary world. With the strength of a few people, they drove away sea beasts, averting the crisis of Placid Waters being flooded. And then right after that, they eradicated the notorious Red Skull pirates with one attack. The problem the imperial army was powerless again, the headache for mercenaries, the Red Skull pirates, was actually eradicated. Although later on it was said that the captain escaped successfully, there was absolutely no way he could revive to such a level ever again. What Jackson never expected was, the Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps was Claire\u2019s group?</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, I think you shouldn\u2019t even think about it. Careful that they might pierce you through with holes like a honeycomb. Also, with this bear-like body of yours and your old age, tsk tsk\u2026 she\u2019s a petite little girl, after all,\u201d a nearby group member said, eliciting nods of agreement. Seeing this, Jackson became angry. The lounge became louder than before.</p><br/><p>At night, Claire held her breath as she drank the blood-enriching medicinal drug Li Yuewen had been pestering her to drink recently, about to go to sleep.</p><br/><p>Only after Li Yuewen left Claire\u2019s room and her room was fully shut off did Claire calmly look down towards her right hand. She was still wearing the glove that Feng Yixuan had given her. Claire slowly stroked the glove, envisioning the resolute expression Feng Yixuan had before leaving. He wanted to become strong, but what about her? She slowly took off the glove and stared at the Dark mark. She stiffened. The mark had darkened significantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeep peep!\u201d the round ball crouching on Claire\u2019s left should cried out seeing the mark and then started flying. He landed on the back of Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp!\u201d White Emperor jumped down, kicking away the black ball.</p><br/><p>Another battle ensued\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ma, Old ma\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Golden Lotus\u2019s voice appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus?\u201d Claire was confused. Golden Lotus hadn\u2019t appeared in a while, so why was Golden Lotus speaking up today?</p><br/><p>\u201cI just work up from my long slumber. What exactly is that black ball? It feels really similar to White Emperor with potent hidden power but unable to release it at will. It also feels like this isn\u2019t his true appearance. It\u2019s intellect could also be classified as immature.\u201d Golden Lotus yawned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleeping? You had been sleeping this whole time?\u201d Claire watched the two little guys tumble around as they battled with interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to cultivate too. I needed to digest the heavenly lightning that I swallowed to convert it into power,\u201d Golden Lotus replied self-righteously.</p><br/><p>Only then did Claire suddenly realize it. No wonder Golden Lotus didn\u2019t appear when Li Yuewen was trying to kill her; he was asleep.</p><br/><p>Claire slipped the glove on and brought out the Treasured Lotus Style grimoire*. She thought back to Li Mingyu\u2019s words: the monstrous group of five were actually considered low level members of an organization! How strong was the Black Lightning organization? How vast was this continent? And how many of the strong cared to make their existences known? Claire squinted at the Treasured Lotus Style grimoire. She understood deeply that she had to become powerful as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>**TL: using the word grimoire now, it sounds so much better than book, can\u2019t believe I never thought of it before</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus,\u201d Claire called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Golden Lotus said questioningly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I sense the Earth element like last time nor order them?\u201d Claire finally asked this question that had been constantly in the back of her mind. She had never been able to sense the earth element ever since she battled Alice\u2019s elder cousin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time I was helping you. Old Ma, don\u2019t fret. The first nine levels of the Treasured Lotus Style can only increase the might of your flames. You haven\u2019t seen anything yet. You will understand the vastness of the Treasured Lotus Style after you comprehend the last levels,\u201d Golden Lotus said mysteriously.</p><br/><p>Claire did not question anything, understanding that she wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything out of Golden Lotus if he was purposefully baiting her like this. What an arrogant child. Claire couldn\u2019t understand how she was the one who \u201cgave birth\u201d to him. How was she similar to her? Claire opened the grimoire and infused Lotus power into the pages, starting to practice the fourth level of the Treasured Lotus Style. Claire truly wanted to learn to the seventh level in one go, however, there was heavenly lightning. The Lotus power traveled through her body energetically. She smoothly arrived to the highest point of the third level, stopping just from reaching the fourth because of heavenly lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ma, let\u2019s go out of the city. Might as well cultivate to the seventh level all at once. Fortunately, I\u2019ve already absorbed all of the heavenly lightning from last time,\u201d Golden Lotus chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just focus on breaking through. Leave the rest to me. I won\u2019t let you get hurt at all. The amount of magic and Dou Qi you have right now is more than enough to help you learn to the seventh level. Then you\u2019ll understand how profound the Treasured Lotus Style is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire thought about it. \u201cYes.\u201d Even though she was feeling a little tired and unwell, there weren\u2019t any major obstructions. Becoming strong as fast as possible was her greatest desire. Claire rose. The meat ball and round ball who had been wrestling with each other immediately stopped and lept onto Claire\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>Claire went to Jean\u2019s room and knocked on the door. Jean opened it with surprise, not understanding what Claire came to see him for.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out of the city. Do you remember how when we battled with the golden dragon and after I ascended in power there was lightning? I\u2019m going to break through again. Guard me,\u201d Claire said plainly.</p><br/><p>Jean was frozen, but internally, he was filled with indescribable joy.</p><br/><p>Claire came to ask him to protect her!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d Jean said concisely, and nodded. He immediately prepared to leave with Claire.</p><br/><p>Cold wind blew outside the city. Claire and Jean both rode the wind leopard, bounding out of the city. The wind lifted Claire\u2019s long hair, and a sweet scent drifted into Jean\u2019s nose. Jean rigidly watched Claire before him, falling into a daze.</p><br/><p>The wind leopard casted Wind magic on its feet, dashing out quickly. A bright, full moon hung in the sky, occasional bird calls sounding in the distance.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at a desolate area, Claire glanced around. Right ahead was a precipice and the area was empty. Claire looked up towards the bright moon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place will do.\u201d Claire dismounted. She was very satisfied with the surrounding terrain. The precipice was surrounded by an endless abyss, deathly dark. Nobody would be able to come up from there, so Jean wouldn\u2019t need to cover as much ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll guard over there. I won\u2019t let anyone close,\u201d Jean said quietly. Promptly, he turned back towards the area leading to the precipice. His low voice was filled with resolution and determination. The wind leopard lapped its tongue, preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two should also go.\u201d Claire tossed the two little guys on her shoulder towards the wind leopard. The two landed on the wind leopard\u2019s back stably. Then the wind leopard left with Jean.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ma, now it\u2019s up to you. You just need to break through. Give me a feast, haha,\u201d Golden Lotus urged impatiently.</p><br/><p>In truth, Claire longed to break through even farther than that. How mysterious was the Treasured Lotus Style? What kind of surprise would it give her?</p><br/><p>Claire stood serenely on the high precipice. A cold wind blew, lifting up her golden hair, her sleeves rippling in the breeze. She looked ahead calmly. Slowly, she sat down in the lotus position and started to use Lotus power. She broke through into the fourth level immediately!</p><br/><p>The cloudless, refreshing night sky instantly changed. Dark clouds surged from all directions, lightning flashing from within as they speedily amassed overhead more and more. The moon was immediately covered by dark clouds, the surrounds now all dusky. Meanwhile, the moon shone still everywhere else.</p><br/><p>Seeing the strange scene from far away, Jean\u2019s expression was somewhat complex. What was Claire training in? Why would it instigate such a strange scene?</p><br/><p>At this moment, lying on a bed far away, Leng Lingyun suddenly opened his eyes. He swiftly made his way to the window and saw the black clouds assembling in a direction outside of the city. There was even lightning flashing within them. This strange scene compared to what he had seen when he had just arrived back at the capital was exactly the same! Then\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun immediately went to knock on Claire\u2019s door. But there was no response.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire? Claire?!\u201d Leng Lingyun called out in a low voice as he knocked the door. But again, there was no response.</p><br/><p>As expected! The strange scene in the sky was caused by Claire. Claire wasn\u2019t inside. Leng Lingyun frowned. He thought about it for a while and then turned around, preparing to leave, but was faced by Li Yuewen, Li Mingyu, and Camille, all with their doors open and looking towards him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

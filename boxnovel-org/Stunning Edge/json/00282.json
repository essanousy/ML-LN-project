His sexual orientation was very normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Dittos, you\u2019re a bad guy.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like women, and I don\u2019t want Qi Ao Shuang to find women.\u201d Jonathan heard the two men shouting.</p><br/><p>Dittos ignored Jonathan\u2019s blabbering and said to Qi Aushuang, \u201cLet\u2019s go, the dean is looking for us.\u201d \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang, I\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t listen to Dittos.\u201d This guy isn\u2019t interested in women, so don\u2019t force yourself. \u201cThat Parina is not bad. At least she\u2019s a school beauty.\u201d \u201cBut this Parina seems to be very good at playing tricks on you. You don\u2019t have to think about the other two beauties.\u201d One was Bethany, and the other was Eber. \u201cEven this doesn\u2019t suit your tastes, there are many pretty girls in the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so noisy.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d Dittos expressionlessly said this word. A knowing smile appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d \u201cYou two boring fellows!\u201d Jonathan was so angry that he snorted when he saw that the two of them were surprisingly on the same footing. Of course, he did not think that what Xiao Ao Shuang said about not liking women was completely different from what they understood.</p><br/><p>The three of them arrived at the principal\u2019s office. This was the first time that Qi Ao Shuang had met the principal of Star Academy. The principal was not the decrepit person in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s imagination, nor was he an expert with a full beard and white hair. Instead, he was a young man with an extraordinary bearing. Qi Ao Shuang was shocked at first, but then she came to a realization. This was the way of the world. The age of many people could no longer be seen by their outer appearances. This young principal was probably not young anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come.\u201d The young man smiled as the three stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincipal.\u201d All three of them did.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be restrained, your results this time are quite good. Especially you, Qi Ao Shuang, you are the second person to achieve such good results in the first trial. \u201cYou and Dittos are the last ones who might pass the last trial. Hopefully, you won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d The headmaster looked at Xiao Aushuang and said with a smile, his eyes flashed with praise.</p><br/><p>When the principal mentioned that Xiao Aushuang was the second person to achieve such good results in the first trial, a trace of darkness flashed in Ditantz\u2019s eyes, but it was gone in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said in a neither humble nor arrogant manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it\u2019s a good thing that young people are modest.\u201d Alright, let\u2019s get down to business. I called you here because I have a mission for you and your rewards. \u201cDittos and Jonathan know the reward, but this is your first time, Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d The Principal smiled at Xiao Aushuang, giving his purpose of calling them over, \u201cYour mission is to hold a grand meeting of the four cities. The three of you will represent our academy in some matters, and the judges will be held by the other Elders and the reputable people of the various cities.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll give you the prizes as well. If you don\u2019t know anything, just ask Dickens and Jonathan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The principal talked for a while before finally stopping to pick up three cards from the desk and handing them to the three of them. Finally, he instructed, \u201cAlright, you guys can go now.\u201d If you are ready, then set out. This time, the gathering will be held in White Cloud Town, which belongs to the academy. Be careful. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d The principal nodded with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The three of them received the cards and agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d The headmaster waved them off.</p><br/><p>After leaving the office, Qi Ao Shuang looked at the card in her hand. The card in her hand was a light blue colour and emitted a cold aura. Who knew what material it was made of?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a pass. The top three rankers would be able to enter and leave the Heavenly Star Pagoda to cultivate at any time, and the highest level of the library would also be opened. There was also the chance to learn from all the elders, and perhaps even learn from them through sparring. The Elders could not refuse. \u201cAs for the materials in the academy\u2019s treasury, we can use them as we wish. There\u2019s no limit.\u201d Dittos explained in a deep voice to Xiao Aoshuang. It was also the first time Dittas had said so much.</p><br/><p>Good stuff! This thought immediately surfaced in Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s mind when he heard Dittancz\u2019s words. Who would have thought that the prizes for the top three would be so generous. The school was actually so generous! However, with such a generous reward, what method did Lenny have to make the other students give up on her? No one was interested in such a generous reward.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the top three know of this reward, the others don\u2019t. It was a secret. \u201cIn other words, only the top three can receive these rewards.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s next words dispelled any doubts in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind. So that was how it was. These rewards had to be kept secret. With such a generous reward, it would be weird if Lannis told anyone. Forget Lenny, I\u2019m afraid no one else would tell anyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare to go to White Cloud Town.\u201d Dittos frowned slightly, obviously not pleased with the job.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there any subordinate towns in the academy?\u201d Just a moment ago, Xiao Ao Shuang wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a town, but it\u2019s not inferior to any other city.\u201d It was independent and did not belong to any city. In truth, the balance of power between the four cities was limited by the balance of power between the four cities. \u201cBut it\u2019s not supposed to be on par with the four cities, so it\u2019s the town.\u201d Jonathan explained. \u201cCome on, there are lots of delicious things in White Cloud Town, lots of beautiful women.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do you have but these two?\u201d Dittos snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, you think I\u2019m as boring as you two!\u201d \u201cLife is supposed to be enjoyable, eating, drinking, and having fun. That is the true meaning of life.\u201d Jonathan shook his head with narrowed eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your attitude, you won\u2019t be able to step into the Space Shattering Realm.\u201d Dittos said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought about stepping into the Space Shattering Realm. I almost lost my life the last time I went to the 9th level.\u201d \u201cLife is still beautiful. I don\u2019t want to die like this.\u201d Jonathan pursed his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrog at the bottom of the well.\u201d Dittos coldly snorted.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang remained silent. The pursuit of power by Dentance was indeed obvious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe academy will take a break during the Four Seasons Garden\u2019s Assembly, and all students will return to their respective powers. Many students will also participate in this Assembly.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s prepare a little. We\u2019ll head to White Cloud City in two days.\u201d Dittos said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Qi Ao Shuang, what about you? Which power are you standing behind?\u201d Jonathan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lord of Heavenly Treasure City is my friend.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied plainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d Jonathan was surprised. \u201cYou have friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dittos lowered his head. There was a dark look in his eyes. He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying, I\u2019m a human, so why can\u2019t I have friends? Can it be that you guys aren\u2019t my friends?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang snappily said, \u201cThe Heavenly Treasure City\u2019s City Lord Heaven Breaker has helped me a lot. This time, I also want to see how I can help him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, this, haha, you can say that I said the wrong thing.\u201d \u201cYes, we are friends, friends.\u201d Jonathan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDepart in two days.\u201d At this moment, Dittens coldly interjected and left first.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, that\u2019s how Ditantas is, it\u2019s boring.\u201d The face is often expressionless. \u201d Jonathan shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go back and prepare.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang did not say anything further, turning around and leaving as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow speechless!\u201d Why are these two people acting like this!? \u201d Jonathan pursed his lips as he watched the two men leave, one behind the other. These two truly had imaginative temperaments. But there seemed to be a difference. How was it different? It was impossible to tell. Jonathan frowned and thought but could think of nothing.</p><br/><p>Forget it, I don\u2019t want to. It was better to hurry back and make preparations, and ask Hurricane City if there was anything that he could help with. Small things are fine, but big things are not to be talked about. Jonathan thought of this and left, humming.</p><br/><p>When he returned to the dorm, Qi Ao Shuang saw Wynes, who was frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Wynes?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang called out as she opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d What? \u201cQi Ao Shuang, when did you come in?\u201d Wynes almost jumped up in shock. He turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking about Bethany?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no\u2026\u201d Wynes\u2019 face turned red, and he couldn\u2019t utter a word for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWynes, what is your true identity?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly asked with a stern face, \u201cBethany is the daughter of the Jade City Lord. The two of you are from a young age. Who is your true identity?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang guessed that although Wynes was an illegitimate child, he was still able to come into contact with someone as powerful as Bethany. Therefore, Wynes\u2019 father was not a simple person either.</p><br/><p>Wynes was silent for a long time, his face complicated. He lowered his head and did not say anything for a while. After a while, he slowly raised his head and said softly, \u201cQi Aoshuang, I will tell you then, since I consider you my only true friend.\u201d \u201cMy father is the previous City Lord of Nine Heavens City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was shocked as she thought of the place where she had gone with Dylan not long ago. \u201cIn other words, the current Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord is your half-brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cBrother?!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a brother like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Wynes\u2019 expression, Xiao Ao Shuang knew that the inside story was very complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe forced my mother to death. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that my father\u2019s trusted confidant risked his life to bring me out to join my sect, I would have been dead by now. I don\u2019t even care about the position of mayor. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t want to let us go.\u201d Wynes\u2019 face turned extremely ugly, and his tone was full of resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou met Bethany when you were a kid?\u201d So, does Bethany know what happened to you? \u201cDoes the Nine Heavens City\u2019s City Lord know of your current situation?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked a few questions in a row.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, we knew her when she was young when she came to Nine Heavens City. Bethany only knew that I wasn\u2019t dead, but she didn\u2019t know where I was, and she didn\u2019t recognize me. As for the Nine Heavens City\u2019s castellan, he naturally knew that I was not dead, but my power was low, so in his eyes, I could not pose a threat. At first, he sent people to keep an eye on me. Later, he thought that I was a trash, and he took advantage of the interference of his father\u2019s trusted confidants, so he stopped making things difficult for me. \u201d Wynes said while grinding his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, I really thank you.\u201d If it weren\u2019t for you, I\u2019d still be a piece of trash. But not now. I will always work hard, I will do my best to achieve my dream. I want to be strong, strong enough to protect Bethany. He was strong enough to stand in front of the crowd and stick out his chest. At that time, I will confess to Bethany, and I will never escape again. \u201d Wynes\u2019 eyes burned with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust this?\u201d However, Qi Ao Shuang smiled and said these words softly.</p><br/><p>Wynes was stunned, looking at the calm face of Qi Ao Shuang, he did not understand what Qi Ao Shuang meant. Originally, he thought that if he made up his mind to say such words, Ao Shuang would praise him and support him, but Qi Ao Shuang actually said such words. What does that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take back what you should have?\u201d You don\u2019t want to take back what the man owes you? \u201cWithout status and status, I\u2019m afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to marry Bethany?\u201d A trace of an evil smile appeared on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s handsome face, causing Wynes to be completely stunned.</p><br/><p>That night, the two of them talked about something in the dorm that no one knew about. It was just that the fusion that occurred afterwards was extremely amazing, not knowing that it was all the doing of a red-haired youth.</p><br/><p>Two days later, Dickens, Jonathan, and Qi Ao Shuang, wearing snow-white uniforms with eight small golden stars that symbolized their strength and status, appeared at the school\u2019s entrance in a magnificent manner.</p><br/><p>The three of them just stood there with calm faces, but it attracted countless gazes, as well as the discussions of the people around them. Many students had been rushing to White Cloud Town for the past few days, so the school gates had always been bustling with noise and excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang \u2026\u201d A sweet voice called out urgently from afar. It was Parina\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Dittos said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang nodded and prepared to get on the carriage. The reason why she didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to him was not because of Dotans\u2019 words, but because of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s own intentions. It wasn\u2019t good to get too close to a woman, and it would be even worse if he misunderstood her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, you! Wait for me! Wait for me!\u201d When Parina caught up, the carriage was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d \u201cYou bastard!\u201d Parina stomped her feet on the spot, looking unhappily at the carriage far away, muttering to herself, \u201cYou hateful fellow, just you wait.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to come with me, I can go to White Cloud Town by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance, a complicated look could be seen on her face as she watched this scene. Eunia frowned and muttered something.</p><br/><p>In the carriage, Qi Ao Shuang was resting with her eyes closed, but in her heart, she thought of Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao. Very soon, Po and Heaven Breaker would arrive. They had not seen each other for a long time, and they truly missed each other and were filled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>And what sort of grand occasion would the Four Seasons Tower\u2019s grand assembly be?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qi Aoshuang looked at the flustered woman in red, then at the Fortune Cat in her arms. Was she afraid of Ah Bao or that man behind Ah Bao?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it have to do with you?\u201d Qi Aoshuang rubbed the little head of the Fortune Cat and coldly spat out a sentence at the woman in red. She understood that she was no match for her. Moreover, White Emperor and Black Feather didn\u2019t seem to have woken up yet. So, it wasn\u2019t wise to fight against her. Naturally, the best way was to make the opponent confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe, he\u2019s here too?\u201d The woman in red looked around in panic, but all she saw was White Emperor and Black Feather. She did not dare to act rashly. Based on that person\u2019s strength, as long as he didn\u2019t want others to see him, others wouldn\u2019t be able to detect it.</p><br/><p>Now Qi Aoshuang understood who the woman in red was referring to. It must be Heaven Breaker. Who would have thought that Heaven Breaker would have such influence? Just what kind of status did he have in this world?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does he have to do with you?!\u201d Qi Aoshuang gave a cold humph.</p><br/><p>The woman in red bit her lips and looked at the faint color of the crystal cliff face and the completely faded red valley. Her face was unsettled, as if she was thinking of something.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang did not move, still maintaining her composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! You\u2019re lucky!\u201d The woman in red narrowed her eyes at Qi Aoshuang before flying into the air and leaving quickly.</p><br/><p>Finally, she left. Qi Aoshuang breathed a sigh of relief. The woman in red\u2019s strength was extraordinary, yet she was so afraid of Heaven Breaker. This world was truly unfathomable.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang patiently waited for White Emperor and Black Feather to release their seals. As soon as they were released, she would immediately chant the spell, letting Camil bring them out safely.</p><br/><p>After a long time, the fog surrounding White Emperor and Black Feather slowly disappeared. When the two of them opened their eyes, they were both sharp and threatening. Qi Aoshuang could sense that they had undergone a tremendous change.</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather both walked towards Qi Aoshuang. They spoke at the same time, \u201cThe seal has been lifted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow can you tell me your true identities?\u201d Qi Aoshuang tilted her head and looked at the two who had recovered their strength. She knew they had changed but she couldn\u2019t tell what exactly it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like Heaven Breaker said, we came from the Demon Sector.\u201d White Emperor said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, we are not a high-level demon clan. \u201cBlack Feather spat disdainfully.\u201d \u201cWe are generals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Qi Aoshuang was at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon World is also divided into levels,\u201d White Emperor explained, \u201cThe demon clan, high-level demon clan, demon general, demon lord, demon king, and great demon king.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are the left and right arms of the Great Demon King, the two generals by his side.\u201d Black Feather snorted. \u201cForget it, what\u2019s the use of saying such trivial things in the past?\u201d Black Feather stopped here. It seemed like what happened afterwards wasn\u2019t a good memory.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Aoshuang understood a lot from these words. It turned out that their identities were actually so noble. They were two generals just because they didn\u2019t want to be the Great Demon King?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back. This time, nothing is suspenseful.\u201d White Emperor said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo shit. The Radiant Temple has nothing left.\u201d A bloodthirsty light flashed in Black Feather\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have Camille pick us up.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded, and was about to chant an incantation. However, a sharp piercing sound came from the sky.</p><br/><p>Du, du, du!</p><br/><p>Three fiery arrows were nailed to the ground beside Qi Aoshuang\u2019s feet. The nearest leg was a centimeter away from her feet.</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather\u2019s faces darkened as they looked towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned as she looked up, only to see the lady returning. She was holding a huge bow and arrow that was emitting flames, and it was actually a flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the Treasure Cat here or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d The woman in red sneered as she arrogantly shouted. It turned out she hadn\u2019t gone too far away. She\u2019d been observing to see if Heaven Breaker was nearby. He didn\u2019t show up. This was too unusual. Heaven Breaker was extremely fond of his Treasure Cat, but he wasn\u2019t here. There must be a reason. No matter what, she could snatch away the Treasure Cat first, then use it to find some treasures. She didn\u2019t know these people\u2019s relationship with Heaven Breaker, so she should try her best not to hurt them. If Heaven Breaker showed up, she could just give the cat back to him, explaining that she took the cat from those people out of kindness. He would spare her for her master\u2019s sake. But the Treasure Car was truly in the girl\u2019s arms, not theirs. Thinking over and over, the woman in red finally decided to give priority to threats.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Bao hates you.\u201d Qi Aoshuang laughed coldly and spat out these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d The woman in red was infuriated, and her eyes couldn\u2019t help but land on the back of her hands scratched by the Treasure Cat\u2019s claws. The wound had already disappeared, but the burning pain was still vivid in her mind.</p><br/><p>She still didn\u2019t make a move. The relationship between Heaven Breaker and the girl who could make the Treasure Cat stay so quiet in her arms should not be shallow. Killing people for treasures, this could only be done to those who had no power or influence. However, this black-haired girl in front of her was impossible to see through, so she didn\u2019t dare to rashly attack.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aoshuang didn\u2019t want to stay in this world any longer. She started chanting the spell that Camil told her.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, a faint light appeared in front of Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Space Gate!\u201d The woman in red\u2019s complexion changed. Now she was even more certain that these people weren\u2019t from the Chaos World! They want to take away the Treasure Cat?! The woman in red couldn\u2019t care about anything else. She only had one thought in her mind. A rare divine animal like the Treasure Cat absolutely couldn\u2019t be taken away!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cQi Aoshuang took the lead and walked into the circle of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to leave!\u201d The woman in red shouted angrily, and the bow in her hands was already released with full force.</p><br/><p>With a flick of his finger, White Emperor appeared behind them, easily blocking the incoming fiery arrow. He disappeared into the circle of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Black Feather laughed sinisterly. Although the people in this world were very powerful, it didn\u2019t mean that everyone was stronger than them. The woman in red in front of him should be one of the lowest of the bunch. Black Feather\u2019s eyes turned cold, and he turned to face the floating woman in red. He wasn\u2019t as easy to deal with as White Emperor. A huge pitch-black sickle appeared in his hand. If Qi Aoshuang saw this, she would definitely be shocked. Why did Black Feather\u2019s weapon look so much like the scythe of the legendary Grim Reaper! The massive sickle in Black Feather\u2019s hand exuded a cold aura of death. As the woman in red stood there stunned, Black Feather raised his massive black sickle and lightly waved it. An invisible force cut through the air, directly attacking the woman in red. Black Feather let out a cold laugh and no longer looked at the woman in red. He lowered his head and disappeared into the light. The light also slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>In midair, the woman in red hurriedly raised the bow in her hands to block this terrifying power.</p><br/><p>With a cracking sound, the arrow in the woman in red\u2019s hand was split in half. In the next moment, she was cut into two halves. The fresh blood that filled the sky was drained away. The woman in red\u2019s body fell down.</p><br/><p>That body didn\u2019t fall to the ground, but was firmly held by a distant light.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster \u2026!\u201d The woman in red did not immediately die. She weakly called out two words. However, her heart was at ease. It seemed that she had been saved. Her last thought before she lost consciousness was revenge! After deeply engraving the faces of Qi Aoshuang and the rest into her mind, she fainted.</p><br/><p>By this time, Qi Aoshuang and the rest had already left the Space Gate, and the moment they came out, they saw the smiling Camil.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this?\u201d Xiao Aoshuang looked around curiously. They were in an unusually luxurious big bedroom. The curtains were drawn tightly. The carved four-poster bed, the floor covered with a fine carpet, and the ceiling hung with expensive crystal lamps.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the palace of Uzzari.\u201d Camil replied with a smile. He looked at White Emperor and Black Feather behind Qi Aoshuang without the slightest bit of surprise. With a gentle smile, he said, \u201cWhite Emperor, Black Feather, congratulations on unlocking your seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can tell that we were sealed before? Who the hell are you?\u201d White Emperor slightly frowned and asked in a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I can tell. You don\u2019t have to know who I am, and now is not the time to tell you. In short, you only need to know that I will not harm my Little Aoshuang. \u201d Camille reached out a hand, smiling, and rubbed the side of Aoshuang\u2019s head. \u201cHair\u2019s so long, it\u2019s already dragging on the floor. It should be a side effect of fusing with the Core of Fire. Come, let me help you cultivate.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

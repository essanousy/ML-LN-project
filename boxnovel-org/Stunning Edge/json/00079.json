The sound of air being struck forcefully made one terrified.</p><br/><p>All of the earth spikes were going in one direction: to the bloodthirsty male.</p><br/><p>The bloodthirsty man froze; he was completely shocked by the scene. These were all summoned and used by him, but now they turned to attack him!</p><br/><p>Something like this could happen? Even if it was an enchanter of the same element, they could only call out the same kind of magic element and attack back in the same manner. How could the magic element he already called out be influenced?! It was like those earth spikes were called out by that golden haired girl.</p><br/><p>The bloodthirst man\u2019s gaze was completely incredulous, because he was shocked to discover that all of the surrounding earth element rejected his request, rejected his call, and instead, madly gathered towards that blonde girl!</p><br/><p>How could something like this happen? In a magic fight, it was all their own magic element gathered, summoning magic elements to request that they could successfully use magic. How much they could summon depended on the magician\u2019s own abilities. Each would summon, but weren\u2019t able to make magic elements only listen to them or reject someone.</p><br/><p>Only a sorcerer could do this kind of thing, could order magic elements to obey their words, rejecting other\u2019s requests. But currently, there was only one sorcerer in the entire continent and they were already missing for a long time. And of course this blonde girl definitely couldn\u2019t be a sorcerer!</p><br/><p>But the girl in front of him ordered the magic elements to reject his summoning and request! The reflection of earth spikes in the bloodthirsty man\u2019s eyes became bigger and bigger.</p><br/><p>The bloodthirsty man finally came back to his senses, immediately rolling over, dodging barely.</p><br/><p>There was the \u201cswoosh, swoosh, swoosh\u201d sound of air, and then the terrifying sound of objects piercing into the ground.</p><br/><p>The place where the bloodthirsty man was standing at was punctured, filled with countless sharp spikes. The man was so scared, there was a layer of cold sweat on his back.</p><br/><p>Alice watched the scene dumbstruck, not able to come back to her senses for a long time.</p><br/><p>A hallucination?</p><br/><p>No, not a hallucination.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026?!\u201d Lingyun Leng swiftly ran over. Seeing Claire still sunk in, he instantly extended his hand without thinking, preparing to pull Claire out.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the pair of pale and slender hands that suddenly appeared and froze for a second.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Lingyun Leng asked in a low voice instead of withdrawing his hands. The faint worry in his voice wasn\u2019t noticed by Claire; even Lingyun Leng himself didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Claire hesitated for a moment, but still reached out.</p><br/><p>Lingyun Leng grabbed Claire\u2019s hands and pulled her up.</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Liuxue Qing and Xuanxuan Leng arrived and saw that scene.</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing\u2019s gaze stopped on the two tightly held pair of hands. A haze flashed through her eyes, but immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>Lingyun Leng pulled Claire up, but he still didn\u2019t let go.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Prince, thank you. I, I\u2019m fine now.\u201d Claire quietly said and drew back her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lingyun Leng suddenly understood a bit looking at Claire and pulled back his hands. Lingyun Leng clenched his fists quietly. He didn\u2019t know why, but when Claire pulled back her hands, he actually felt a slight sense of loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d Just when Lingyun Leng opened his mouth to say some words, Liuxue Qing\u2019s angry shouts suddenly sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d Liuxue Qing angrily shouted, attracting Claire and Lingyun Leng\u2019s gazes.</p><br/><p>Alice\u2019s face ashened and paled and the nearby man\u2019s expression became a bit complex. Alice had pulled the nearby man, just about to leave sneakily, but was stopped by Liuxue Qing\u2019s shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlice Roman?\u201d Lingyun Leng had very good memory; he remembered every single noble\u2019s name whom he had met before. Currently, Lingyun Leng\u2019s voice held a faint trace of anger. What he had just seen was these two just about to kill Claire.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Alice\u2019s complexion completely paled.</p><br/><p>She knew that this time, the situation wouldn\u2019t be resolved easily.</p><br/><p>Alice covered her head in shame, silent, but from beginning to end, the nearby man\u2019s expression was complex. Once Claire and Lingyun Leng walked closer, that man turned and looked at Claire. It was such a direct stare, not moving one inch.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlice Roman, I and the Divine Princess saw this incident very clearly. It was you who meant ill will to Claire. I think we can only ask the emperor to decide what to do about this incident!\u201d Lingyun Leng\u2019s voice was ice-cold, without any trace of warmth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, your highness.\u201d Alice looked up fearfully, her expression completely panicked, her gaze filled with dread. She knew that this time, she had messed up big time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to say more. We\u2019ll go see the emperor right now.\u201d Lingyun Leng\u2019s expression was completely ice-cold, not giving any leeway.</p><br/><p>A faint shadow appeared in Liuxue Qing\u2019s eyes. It was the first time she had seen Leng Lingyun so concerned about someone else\u2019s business. In Liuxue Qing\u2019s mind, Leng Lingyun never spared a glance at someone else, not to mention deal with other people\u2019s business. But now he took on the trouble of a tiny, insignificant castellan, concerned to the point that he wanted to meet the emperor. Was it only because Xuanxuan liked that golden haired girl? Was it only because of this?</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a figure floated down. It was a sleepy Cliff. Cliff had been wakened by the sound of lightning and thunder, and then suddenly recalled that he had seen it before. He had doubted that it was related to Claire, but still hurriedly rushed over. Behind Cliff, there was a red robed cardinal from the Temple of Light \u2014 Lawrence. There were also people coming from the city entrance, all attracted by the previous thunder and lightning.</p><br/><p>As the crowd grew bigger, Alice\u2019s face paled. She knew this time, she was really finished.</p><br/><p>Cliff landed, staring at Lawrence, who had landed behind him, and said without courtesy, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame reason as you.\u201d Lawrence shrugged. Seeing Leng Lingyun and Claire standing there, he smiled widely and approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, Claire, why are you here?\u201d Lawrence asked, exceptionally intimate as he approached and directly stroked Claire\u2019s head. Seeing it, Cliff started seething with anger. This stinky old man, was he still stubbornly trying to recruit Claire as his disciple?</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Lawrence, greetings. I came out to walk my magic beast and saw the strange scene in the sky, so I wanted to go over and see. Unexpectedly, I didn\u2019t expect Alice to launch a sneak attack. Fortunately, his highness passed by and saved me.\u201d Claire replied, frowning, her tone sounded like she felt wronged and was innocent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lawrence frowned and started shouting angrily, \u201cLingyun, was it like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master. Just as I rushed over, I saw them attacking.\u201d Leng Lingyun calmly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys actually dared to attack my disciple, die!\u201d A piercing roar came from behind Lawrence. Everybody turned and saw Cliff\u2019s ferocious expression, about to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re old, not young, but still like this.\u201d Lawrence\u2019s expression became very ugly. This old fellow was still so protective, still not paying attention to who or what kind of situation he was in before attacking. There was already a group of people over their approaching. If two people were killed here, then wasn\u2019t that finding trouble for oneself? Only Leng Lingyun had seen the two treat Claire unfairly, while Claire was still standing there fine. But if Cliff made a move, then the group of people currently heading over would all see. Then when they faced the emperor, it would be hard to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to shield those two?\u201d Cliff\u2019s expression was even more ugly than Lawrences as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are both relatives of the minister, it\u2019s best to let the emperor handle it. The emperor will definitely not be biased. Lingyun and Liuxue Qing know to tell the truth of the matter to the emperor.\u201d Afterall, Lawrence had lasted many years between the Temple of Light and royal family\u2019s strained relationship and was an exceptional old fox.</p><br/><p>Cliff stared at Lawrence while frowning, not making a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, sir Lawrence\u2019s words make a lot of sense. I believe the emperor will give me a fair ruling.\u201d Claire consoled Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Cliff agreed begrudgingly, then glanced at Alice hatefully once more, scaring Alice so much that she immediately lowered her head.</p><br/><p>Many people had gathered at the city gate. Some people saw Claire, Lawrence and the Divine Prince and Princess, exclaiming in surprise. If these people were there, then the anomaly that had happened before wasn\u2019t strange any more. It was definitely because of them. Claire saw the look in their eyes and became relieved. It was fine if these people misunderstood this way.</p><br/><p>Amidst the crowd, one man and one woman glanced over. Both had golden hair and blue eyes. Currently, their exceptional looks weren\u2019t noticed because everybody\u2019s gazes were on Cliff and Lawrence, as well as the Divine Prince and Princess. These influential people\u2019s presence naturally attracted everybody\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The golden haired blue eyed man asked the nearly golden haired blue eyed woman in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something off whenever I look that girl, I keep feeling like the strange situation from before is related to her.\u201d The golden haired blue eyed woman replied in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would rather believe that you just feel off seeing that girl, but I know your intuition is scarily accurate.\u201d The golden haired blue eyed man said, teasing a little.</p><br/><p>The golden haired blue eyed woman fell silent. She squinted, seeing Claire, and didn\u2019t speak any more.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get attracted by other things, we\u2019ll leave once we find that thing.\u201d The golden haired blue eyed man said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cProblem is there\u2019s no traces. Somebody made a move before us. I actually still don\u2019t know in whose hands that thing is in.\u201d The golden haired blue eyed woman said a little resentfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too anxious, we\u2019re already carrying that thing on us. As long as the other thing gets close to use, there will be a response.\u201d The golden haired blue eyed man consoled quietly, then added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s definitely in this city.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I hope so.\u201d The golden haired blue eyed woman\u2019s voice was a bit depressed. Once they found that they, they would revitalize their clan! For this goal, they definitely needed to find it!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The golden haired blue eyed man turned, squeezed into the crowd, and disappeared. The woman followed closely behind and also disappeared into the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, we should see the emperor now.\u201d Cliff glared at Alice and the man next to her coldly.</p><br/><p>Claire had called for the wind leopard and scooped up white emperor. At this moment, Liuxue Qing\u2019s gaze landed on the fur ball in Claire\u2019s embrace, a flash of confusion in her eyes. Why did she feel that little furball looked a bit familiar? Claire didn\u2019t notice Liuxue Qing\u2019s confused look that floated over to White Emperor from time to time.</p><br/><p>The morning was bound to be stormy.</p><br/><p>The Roman clan\u2019s younger generation was unfair to Claire Hill, who had recently gained fame. Soon, the matter was spread throughout the capital and everybody paid close attention to the developments of the case.</p><br/><p>Currently, the emperor was sitting on the throne, feeling a bit of a headache seeing the two old men standing before him. One was glittering with vitality, one was sagging a bit. And nearby was the ashen faced Cliff, then the tranquil Lawrence. Also, the Divine Prince and Princess, Leng Lingyun and Liuxue Qing was present. Finally, silently standing at the very back was Claire, Alice, and Alice\u2019s cousin.</p><br/><p>Of course, the energetic one was Duke Hill, while the sagging one was Duke Roman. Duke Roman\u2019s heart was howling with grief, while also hating that his granddaughter failed to meet his expectations and didn\u2019t listen. He had already warned her to not provoke people from the Hill clan. And now, wow. Not only did she provoke them, it had been seen by many influential people who could serve as proof. Now even if she didn\u2019t acknowledge it, there would be trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis incident makes my heart break. We are all supports of the country and the two of them is our country\u2019s future supporting pillars. But now, this has happened\u2026.\u201d The emperor stated. He knew that this matter had to be addressed. It wasn\u2019t two people dueling fairly, and also wasn\u2019t two children fighting, but murder!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

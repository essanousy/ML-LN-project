All the houses of wealthy families of the capital had their homes brightly lit. At night, only the commoners who couldn\u2019t afford candles lived in darkness.</p><br/><p>In her bedroom, Claire lay on the bed. She played around with a fireball on her fingertips. Claire thought back to when Gordan warned her in the study. You must conceal this outrageous talent and not display your power in front of others unless it\u2019s truly an emergency. Especially the Temple of Light, you must definitely not let them know. When you test for the Institute, bear in mind you need to hold back. When Claire suggested couldn\u2019t she not go to the Institute and just learn from Emery, Gordan refused intensely. It was very obvious he didn\u2019t believe Emery was good enough to be Claire\u2019s teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only person who can be your teacher is that person. But in order to find him, you must go to the Institute. Once you become his disciple, then you don\u2019t need to worry about the Temple of Light any more.\u201d After saying these mysterious words, Gordan stopped talking. He didn\u2019t even mention who the person was. But, it was evident that once Claire became that person\u2019s disciple, then the Temple of Light would have no chance at taking her away.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, there was always conflict between the Royal and Divine powers. Claire extinguished the small fireball in her hand. She remembered the spell that Emery taught her the night before \u2013 fire shield. Evidently, the spell wasn\u2019t widely known. It must be Emery\u2019s own magic, his cherished asset, but he had taught it to Claire selflessly. By making the fire elements cluster around the body, one would form a shield to protect from attacks. The only problem was that Claire didn\u2019t seem to be able to form a shield yet. Claire remembered very clearly that Emery said you could not be too impatient. After trying a few more times, Claire gave up temporarily. The difference between magicians and regular people were that regular people were unable to stay awake for too long without feeling fatigued, while magicians could recover both their magic power and body strength through meditating. Claire crossed her legs and sat up and started to meditate. She began to capture and store the element into her body unceasingly. Three hours later, Claire opened her eyes feeling very refreshed. It was much better than sleeping for three hours.</p><br/><p>Three days later, Claire passed the Institute\u2019s test while holding back some of her power. She could now study at the Sunrise Institute. And Jean, being her guardian knight, had to be beside her at all times in order to protect her. But Jean was already a grand warrior and couldn\u2019t enter the institute as a student, so he could only follow secretly.</p><br/><p>The letters Sunrise Institute stood out on the grand door. The arrogant looking letters lit up whenever it got dark or at night time. Obviously, there was some kind of spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I will protect you in secret,\u201d Jean said quietly when Claire entered the gate. Then he disappeared.</p><br/><p>Once Claire picked up her student card, she followed a teacher to the Fire classroom. As soon as she walked in, she felt odd gazes from everyone, and at the very back she saw a curious and puzzled stare. It was the second prince Nancy. He was also part of the Fire class?</p><br/><p>\u201cToday we have a new classmate, Claire Hill. So today let\u2019s review the basics again.\u201d Standing on the dais was the teacher, Emily, a gentle middle aged woman who was the Fire class instructor. In order to help Claire catch up, the instructor reviewed the basics.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you can sit wherever you want.\u201d Emily of course knew the girl\u2019s identity and was very polite.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you teacher.\u201d Claire lightly nodded and after expressing her thanks, walked to the empty seats in the back.</p><br/><p>Although Claire felt their strange gazes, she ignored them and walked straight to the back and listened to Emily\u2019s teachings. It was pretty close to what the book wrote. Nancy, sitting nearby, occasionally sent probing looks.</p><br/><p>In only the time span of one class, the whole Institute knew about Claire\u2019s arrival. The Hill family\u2019s idiotic girl who chased after men actually passed the Sunrise Institute\u2019s examination and was accepted into the Institute! And she was in the same class with the second prince who she had been chasing to death a few days ago!!</p><br/><p>Many people assumed that Claire had used her family\u2019s influence to enter the school and was doing this only to chase after Nancy. Claire became even more infamous.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the Lightning class.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? She entered the school?\u201d Lashia immediately became furious. The person who brought this news cowered a little. Lashia\u2019s beautiful, innocent face had distorted completely. Her hate had reached the skies. That moron! To go as far as to shame the family in school! Why did Grandfather let the idiot come to school to lose face? Did he think that the Hill family\u2019s name had not been shamed enough? Humph! Claire, you man-crazy nitwit, I\u2019ll make you get the hell out of school by yourself! Lashia finalized this decision in her heart, clenching a fist in her sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Lashia?\u201d a girl nearby asked, feeling unease. \u201cNo matter what, she\u2019s your older sister. You shouldn\u2019t be too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Lashia thundered, her face full of anger. \u201cI don\u2019t have this kind of older sister!\u201d Shameful! That this kind of person was her, genius Lashia, older sister! How extremely shameful!</p><br/><p>People around Lashia shut up as they saw her furious look and dared not to say anything. Everyone knew that Lashia was not only the granddaughter of the powerful Duke Hill, but was also the prized disciple of the principle. Who would dare to offend her?</p><br/><p>The Sunrise Institute was a full time school. It had teaching buildings, social quarters, and dorms. As the only institute for Dou Qi and magic in Amparkland, it was huge. Nobles and commoners alike could join so long as they had the talent. You could live there or just stay during the day.</p><br/><p>After class, Claire walked out of the classroom and felt how unwelcomed the previous owner of the body was. Girls would glare disgustedly and avoid her as if she was a snake or scorpion. And the boys who thought they possessed any attractive features would stay far away. Claire didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh. She was speechless.</p><br/><p>At noon, Claire sat in a corner of the cafeteria and ate her lunch in peace. At the same time she recalled Gordan\u2019s words. She could only meet the person in the Institute? Was it a school teacher? It couldn\u2019t be the principal, or Gordan would have just said so. This meant this person was more powerful and important than the principal. So who could it be?</p><br/><p>The cafeteria was lively everywhere except for the area around Claire. The quiet and emptiness around her was very eye catching.</p><br/><p>The entrance suddenly became noisy. Claire raised her head and saw Lashia strutting in like an arrogant peacock, surrounded by a horde of young nobles. Wherever the brilliant Lashia went, she was the center of attention.</p><br/><p>Lashia suddenly looked towards Claire, but Claire continued to eat indifferently. A fierce look flashed in the depths of Lashia\u2019s eyes and she abruptly turned away, not glancing at Claire again.</p><br/><p>A spoiled brat who got anything she wanted, Claire sighed to herself. But right now she herself was no match for her. The baleful look in her eyes shouldn\u2019t belong to a twelve-year-old. Living in an environment where she was used to being pampered and praised by everyone had let her forget about proper behavior. If Lashia really attacked her, she wouldn\u2019t be able to defend.</p><br/><p>If she really faced this spoiled Lashia\u2019s attack, what would she do? Claire became a little worried.</p><br/><p>In a remote area.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, you received such a nice assignment.\u201d A person with chestnut colored hair teased Jean, who was leaning against a tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Your Highness, stop enjoying my misfortune.\u201d Jean sighed quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha~~ I can\u2019t help it.\u201d The person who spoke was the second prince, Nancy. \u201cBut really, who would have thought the Duke would actually send her to school. Can she become a magician?\u201d In his words, there was a hidden scorn.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say.\u201d Jean slightly frowned and suddenly said seriously, \u201cDid you know? She entered the institute by truly passing the exam, not by the Duke\u2019s \u2018care\u2019\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d This time it was Nancy\u2019s turn to be shocked. The moronic girl had actually passed the examination herself?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t doubt me, it\u2019s true.\u201d Jean\u2019s face was completely serious. \u201cSuddenly, I found myself unable to see through her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a little strange. The Claire right now compared to the Claire from before seem like two different people.\u201d Nancy frowned while thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt first, I thought she was letting you go on purpose to catch you unaware later, but now it seems that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Jean said in a thoughtful manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you think?\u201d Nancy asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, let\u2019s just observe.\u201d Jean\u2019s handsome face smiled knowingly. \u201cThere\u2019s someone who\u2019s itching to take action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nancy, confused for a only a moment, suddenly understood. \u201cAre you talking about Lashia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Jean nodded, revealing a cold smile. \u201cWhatever my idiotic master who chases after men plans to do, I think someone will quickly help us to probe it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your job to protect her?\u201d Nancy curled up his lip coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLetting her suffer a bit is fine, I\u2019ll just be a bit late. As for protecting her, of course I won\u2019t let her die. It\u2019s only two sisters playing around, right?\u201d Jean shrugged as he said jokingly, A glint of jest appeared in his eyes as he prepared to watch a good show.</p><br/><p>Nancy nodded laughing but somehow had a strange feeling in his heart, a faint feeling of unease.</p><br/><p>Was it really possible to probe out what was going on?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

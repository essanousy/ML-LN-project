There were still much more she had not told Claire because it was more interesting if Claire discovered it herself. She had a feeling that in the near future, it was going to be entertaining. Haha, just thinking about it made her excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty girl, let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll bring you to your master and send you all out.\u201d The young master seemed very excited, saying this as she stood up.</p><br/><p>Claire watched the merry young master, not understanding the source of her excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sword behind your chair should be useful for you too. Take anything you can find!\u201d the young master instructed, her eyes slits. Right now, she was exceedingly excited, longing after the future entertainment. If she wanted to see it, she would have to give a push and help the girl become stronger.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Claire didn\u2019t object. The sword behind the chair was already rusty. As she grabbed it, she was astonished. The old looking sword was unexpectedly heavy! Claire had to secretly use Dou Qi and only after exerting all her strength was she barely able to store the blade into the storage ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sword is a magic blade. Once you give it to your knight, you\u2019ll understand how special the sword is.\u201d The young master crossed her arms and leaned on a pillar lazily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Although Claire did not understand why the girl was helping her, she was still helping her, so naturally, Claire thanked her politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d the young master suddenly remembered. She fished out something from her bag. \u201cHave this, pretty girl. You can block a fatal attack, but only once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you helping me like this?\u201d Claire asked, although she accepted it readily. How could she not accept such a good thing for free?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you die too early, then it\u2019s not as fun.\u201d The young master\u2019s reply was completely earnest, leaving Claire completely wordless.</p><br/><p>She rolled her eyes. Just when she was about to store the item the young master had just handed her into her storage ring, the young master stopped her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWear it around your neck. Remember, it will only save you once,\u201d the young master reminded her again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Claire wore the ordinary looking ruby necklace, a thin string with a tiny ruby dangling, simple without any other decorations.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, pretty girl. I\u2019ll bring you to you master and also your stupid knight, then send you all out.\u201d The young master was in an unusually good mood. She was looking forward to the fun and couldn\u2019t wait to send Claire out, wanting to watch the entertainment as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is my master?\u201d Claire understood that her master was most likely not in danger, or else the young master\u2019s tone would not be like so.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust follow me.\u201d The young master grabbed Claire by the hand forcefully, pulling her out the passageway. When they exited the underground passage, the young master looked up at the sky, as it to determine their position. Then, in the next instant, Claire felt dizzy. She couldn\u2019t help but close her eyes.</p><br/><p>Once she opened her eyes again, the scenery had changed.</p><br/><p>Instant teleportation again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho, we\u2019re just in time. Your master seems to be about to break through,\u201d the young master said with bemusement. Catching the disdainful tone, Claire looked up, only to be greeted by a shocking scene.</p><br/><p>In the clearing before them, Cliff was covered in wounds, blood dying nearly dying the entirety of his clothes red. But his eyes were shut, his expression exceedingly peaceful. He simply sat, the carcasses of several ninth grade magic beasts surrounding him. Gradually, his body glowed with numerous colors.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how interesting. Even if he did make a breakthrough, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it out of the barrier. Why do so many stupid humans come here to cultivate and break through?\u201d The young master stroked her chin as she mocked. \u201cEven though it is easier to break through when cultivating here, what is the use when you can\u2019t exit? You\u2019ll just stay here forever, dying of either old age or being attacked by magic beasts en masse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire turned to look at the young master, who then saw the questioning in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me that way. Actually, I there\u2019s a special reason why I can\u2019t leave this barrier too. Perhaps like a rule. But I can send you all out.\u201d The young master\u2019s eyes were slits, her voice soft.</p><br/><p>Master was about to make his breakthrough! Claire stared fixedly at Cliff, who was sitting cross legged. Her heart surged with a multitude of emotions. Of course she knew why Cliff risked entering Devil Field to break through. It was all for her, because of her Dark mark!</p><br/><p>\u201cOho? He\u2019s about to fail?\u201d the young master\u2019s voice suddenly interrupted Claire\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>Claire refocused her attention. The colorful glow was becoming unstable, brightening and dimming erratically.</p><br/><p>Now, Cliff was frowning, contrary from his peaceful expression from before. Evidently, he was at a critical point of his breakthrough.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s heart was tense as she watched Cliff anxiously. What could she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if he will die from failing.\u201d The young master smirked, eyes slits.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression changed. On record, there was only one person who had successfully broken through to become a sorcerer, but that individual had long since vanished, detached from worldly affairs. Claire did not know if Cliff would die if the breakthrough failed, but Cliff would at least be heavily injured!</p><br/><p>But what could she do? At such a critical conjuncture, Claire did not dare to make any rash moves. Sometimes, meddling was worse than not intervening at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201d Claire turned to face the young master, visible pleading in her eyes.</p><br/><p>The young master did not say anything. With a light flick of her finger, a soft beam of white light shot into Cliff\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Cliff\u2019s body exploded with colorful light and his furrowed eyebrows relaxed. The glow surrounding him gradually glowed brighter and brighter, enveloping him completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, thank\u2026\u201d Claire started when she was cut off by the young master.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. I\u2019m waiting for you to provide me with good entertainment. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d The young master waved offhandedly. \u201cWait here. I need to return to prepare for the next Divine War.\u201d</p><br/><p>Divine War? Claire was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty girl, I hope to see you at the next Divine War, haha,\u201d the young master laughed. \u201cI wonder who you\u2019ll be then.\u201d Claire was perplexed at the young master\u2019s baffling words.</p><br/><p>Soon, the glow around Cliff disappeared. Claire was shocked to discover Cliff\u2019s numerous wounds had healed, and he seemed energetic. Cliff\u2019s every move gave off a different aura from before, a strong aura.</p><br/><p>Claire finally relaxed. \u201cMaster!\u201d she called out joyously.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty girl, I hope we meet again, haha. Go, kill the ones who want to kill you.\u201d The young master\u2019s voice sounded at Claire\u2019s ear. Just when Claire was about to turn and look at the young master, her vision blackened. When she opened her eyes again, Claire discovered she had returned to where she had first entered Devil Field outside the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both voices were filled with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019ve made a breakthrough. I\u2019m glad you are fine. Congratulations, Master, for your breakthrough.\u201d Claire understood instantly that the young master had sent them out. Her last words were ingrained deeply in her mind. Kill those who want to kill you. Claire\u2019s gaze sharpened, turning icy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Cliff frowned, completely puzzled. \u201cI remember I was just about to break through, about to fail, when strangely, some kind of outside force helped me succeed. The next thing I know, I hear your voice and now I\u2019m here.\u201d Cliff was utterly baffled. While he was on the verge of his breakthrough, he had sensed two people in the surrounding area. One was Claire. Who was the other one?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, who was that person? Are you alright?\u201d Jean\u2019s eyes were filled with confusion and concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe* is a devil,\u201d Claire explained to Cliff and Jean calmly. \u201cShe was the one who helped Master break through and sent us out.\u201d</p><br/><p>*In written form, the chinese character for he and she are differently, but they sound the same when spoken.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Jean was astonished. How could a devil help a human? Devils were a terrifying existence, powerful, ruthless, cold blooded, savage. Rumors said there were creatures from the devil world in Devil Field, but he never expected it to be true. Jean then remembered the youth had blood red eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, are you saying the devil helped me break through?\u201d Although this was a question, Cliff\u2019s tone was certain. Only he understood how dangerous the situation was and that Claire could not have helped him. The person accompanying Claire was a devil? It seemed it truly was a devil.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did he help me? And he even sent us out.\u201d Cliff was stunned. A devil who helped humans?! It almost sounded like a joke. Cliff stroked his chin, glancing around suspiciously. Not only did the devil help him break through, he also sent them out safely. It was too strange!</p><br/><p>\u201cShe just suddenly felt like it,\u201d Claire explained, sighing.</p><br/><p>Jean and Cliff were shocked, but seeing Claire\u2019s solemn expression, they understood that Claire was definitely telling the truth. Most likely, the devil did it because he was bored!</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected there to be an actual devil in Devil Field.\u201d Cliff still hadn\u2019t recovered from his shock. Everything that had just happened was simply too strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Cliff, Jean, here.\u201d Two rings materialized from Claire\u2019s storage ring. \u201cDrip your blood on it to form a blood contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Cliff initially had his suspicions, but after seeing Claire\u2019s eyes, his suspicions were confirmed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

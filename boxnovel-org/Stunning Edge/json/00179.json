I will always be with you.\u201d Feng Yixuan started to laugh, puckering his lips. He started inching closer and closer. \u201cCome, give me a kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam\u2026</p><br/><p>The next moment, Feng Yixuan was groaning as he crouched on the ground, clutching his eye.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang angrily turned away, flying away, descending from the roof.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan watched as she disappeared, then stood up. He was smiling, relieved. She finally returned to her lively self, her true self\u2026</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan rubbed his eyes, then humphed. \u201cCome out, how long are you going to wait?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surroundings were silent. After a while, Leng Lingyun appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now, I\u2019ve not leaving you any chances.\u201d Feng Yixuan stared at Leng Lingyun. However, with panda eyes, he didn\u2019t appear threatening at all.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Feng Yixuan rubbed his eyes. Ignoring Leng Lingyun, he climbed down from the ladder.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun stood on the roof alone, silently watching the moon.</p><br/><p>Silence.</p><br/><p>Two days later, a party of five left Clearspring Village. This time, the Xi brothers were coming along.</p><br/><p>Their destination was one of the two places marked in red.</p><br/><p>And so, the five advanced in the desert. The endless desert only sunk their spirits. The scenery never changed: yellow sand, a giant cactus here and there, half concealed skeletal remains.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! An oasis!\u201d Xi Shaoqi suddenly cried out. After roasting under the sun for so long, it was natural that he would be excited by an oasis. Xi Shaoqi immediately longed for a drink, then a satisfying shower.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Ring Village.\u201d Xi Shaoqi explained, \u201cIn the middle is a small lake. The lake\u2019s water source is an an underground spring. This two was born around the lake, forming a circular shape, thus its name, Ring Village.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, we should rest now. My butt is already sore from all this riding.\u201d Xi Shaoqi shifted his weight uncomfortably. Riding camelback for so long was indeed unbearable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, go and rest. We shall set out again tomorrow morning.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded. Everyone entered.</p><br/><p>Like all other villages, the small village was surrounded by a high wall of stone. The village had the words \u201cRing Village\u201d inscribed on a large stone next to the entrance.</p><br/><p>There were few people out on the streets, no one paying attention to them. Many travelers passed by to rest, a common occurrence.</p><br/><p>\u201cShaosi, Shaoqi, go find us an inn. We will first take a look around.\u201d Qi Aoshuang handed her reins to Xi Shaoqi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d In the temple of Darkness, the brothers had always ordered others around, but ever since Qi Aoshuang appeared, they had been always ordered around by her. Their divine princess was simply too sinister. Ever since <i>that</i> incident, he never dared to tease her again. He had lost a bet, and the loser was supposed to satisfy one request of the winner. Xi Shaoqi thought it was nothing. It was just one request, right? But after hearing her request, he wanted to kill himself. He was supposed to tell people in the manor he was a pig, a real pig, a giant, stupid pig. Each time, he was supposed to move onto someone else and say the same phrase. Phillips even thought he was being mind controlled. From then on, Xi Shaoqi followed Qi Aoshuang obediently, not daring to ever complain.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang, Feng Yixuan, and Leng Lingyun slowly strolled around, observing the passersby. Suddenly, Qi Aoshuang frowned. Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun also noticed something was off.</p><br/><p>Although these people were walking, they seemed to be mindlessly walking. After reaching the end of the street, they would turn around and walk back, then reach the other end of the street and walk back again! Qi Aoshuang focused on the closest person to her, her heart clenching. Their gaze was unfocused, expressionless. He simply walked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, may I ask\u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan grabbed someone passing by, but something strange happened. They continued forward as if they had not heard him. However, after taking a step, they fell down. He had stopped moving, stopped breathing!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan looked at his hand, then looked at the person lying on the ground, his lip twitching. What was going on? Did he kill someone with a slight grab?</p><br/><p>Even more strangely, everyone else continued walking as if nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d Leng Lingyun said quietly, frowning.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan also frowned, then looked up. Suddenly, he cried out, \u201cNo! We\u2019re in a trap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s flashed with realization, but something strange was already overhead!</p><br/><p>A bright light flashed overhead. The sky darkened slightly. A translucent barrier appeared! Sunlight could come in, but they could see their reflections in the barrier! It was like a mirror. They could see the outside faintly, but the village underneath could be seen more distinctly. The entire village was covered by the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people have been dead for a while already!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s expression was serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow magnanimous, killing all the people in the village just to trap us.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression also darkened. Although he wasn\u2019t nice enough to care for the world, he was still angered seeing so many innocents killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of barrier is that?\u201d Qi Aoshuang coldly eyed the barrier overhead. It was the first time she had seen such a barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady! What\u2019s going onnnnnnnn?\u201d Xi Shaoqi dashed over. \u201cWhy is this village like a ghost town? What kind of barrier is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Shaosi also made his way over, his expression grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, everyone is dead.\u201d Xi Shaosi said in a low voice. \u201cBut they seem as if they\u2019re continuing what they did before they died, doing the same action over and over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCreepy, too creepy!\u201d Xi Shaoqi shuddered. He had never seen something so strange. At most, he had seen people mind controlled, but that was someone alive. He had never seen dead people controlled.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a strange voice spoke. \u201cCute little lambs, have a nice rest in here.\u201d Their tone of voice was quite pleased.</p><br/><p>Who?!</p><br/><p>Everyone looked up, then saw a strangely dressed person flapping his arms atop the barrier, his hair a mess. His clothes seemed to be patched from many different ones, colorful. He had one large spike of hair in the middle of the top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Xi Shaosi asked coldly.</p><br/><p>The strange person raised both of his hands, making a ring with arms in front of his chest, then raising them towards the sky. Everyone felt a wave of disgust. The strange person finally replied, \u201cPeople about to die don\u2019t need to know my name. All you need to know is that your lives are worth a lot of money, especially the girl, she\u2019s worth an entire city, hehe~\u201d</p><br/><p>Before anyone could say anything, the strange person cried out weirdly. With a tap of his feet, he left up and flew away, disappearing out of their gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Temple of Light?\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned as he watched the strange person disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Leng Lingyun shook his head. \u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean to say\u2026\u201d Xi Shaosi frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe could have been hired by the Temple.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave first.\u201d Feng Yixuan looked around their surroundings. \u201cThe entire village seems to be surrounded by this barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see if I can read its resonance.\u201d Qi Aoshuang approached the barrier, gently reaching out to touch it. However, before she could touch it, the barrier suddenly responded faintly, brushing Qi Aoshuang\u2019s hand away.</p><br/><p>Hmm? Qi Aoshuang tried to reach out again, but the barrier was the same. A soft force pushed her hand away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Feng Yixuan came close, also inspecting the strange barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get close.\u201d Qi Aoshuang frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust break it open.\u201d Xi Shaoqi humphed. He brought out his scepter, already starting to chant.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang silently mused, the barrier\u2019s force just now was a bit strange. But what was it?</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi already finished changing. With a wave of his sceptor, a bolt of black light attacked the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Qi Aoshuang shouted. She finally realized what the repulsion force was similar to.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Xi Shaoqi blinked, not understanding why she would suddenly tell him to wait.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Xi Shaoqi understood why. Just when the bolt of black light was about to touch the barrier, it suddenly went backwards the same path it had traveled! Xi Shaoqi hastily erected barrier to block the arrack. The black bolt of light slammed heavily against his barrier, causing the barrier to shudder. His heart also shuddered. He almost killed himself!</p><br/><p>\u201cW-why didn\u2019t you say that ealier?\u201d Xi Shaoqi patted his chest, trying to calm down his heart.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expression sharpened as they finally understood how the barrier worked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Before, Marquis Roger really didn\u2019t care for Miss Claire enough. To be honest, he never cared before. Miss Claire\u2019s words right now seemed to be talking about that point.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you \u2014 !\u201d Marquis Roger felt somewhat dizzy. The person in front of him with sharp words was really his daughter? She actually reprimanded him in front of this many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the venerable Marquis doesn\u2019t have any business with me, I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d Claire sneered, pulled Summer over, and then turned to Ben and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben shifted over in a suspicious manner. \u201cWant me to get rid of him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Mother would be sad.\u201d Claire said indifferently.</p><br/><p>Marquis Roger heard everything the two said. He was about to explode with anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, where are you going?\u201d Marquis Roger angrily shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it have to do with you? Respectable Marquis, I think you are busy with many things. Also, if you want to risk blocking me, I don\u2019t think anybody here could stop my friends here!\u201d Claire coldly said and then brought Summer and Ben away.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean! Stay behind. What is going on?\u201d Marquis Roger called Jean furiously.</p><br/><p>Jean lowered his head slightly. \u201cSir, I am Miss\u2019s guardian knight so I cannot stay behind. Wait for the Duke to come back and you shall understand what is going on.\u201d Jean said, neither servile nor overbearing, and then followed Claire from behind and also left.</p><br/><p>The people in the main hall who were still there looked at each other in dismay. Emery was also silent. Although Marquis Roger was accosted so rudely, for some reason, a trace of pride actually appeared. Actually, everybody knew Marquis Roger\u2019s capabilities. He wasn\u2019t a genius but not an idiot either. It could only be said that he was average. Also, his biggest weak point was that he was too rude and didn\u2019t know the correct way to respond to certain situations. That\u2019s why the Duke would send him to work at the border. Emery sighed lightly. How would the Duke deal with this matter?</p><br/><p>\u201cOpposite, everything is actually the complete opposite of what\u2019s supposed to happen!\u201d Marquis Roger was so mad he was about to explode. He could just let it go that Claire offended him, but a small knight actually dared to go against him.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s group of people left the Duke\u2019s castle. Summer tilted her head and said, \u201cClaire, what do we do now? It seems like I made you leave home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good place where we can go to.\u201d Claire raised a brow, laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat place?\u201d Summer said with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes slitted as she brought the three behind her to a street.</p><br/><p>Claire led the group of people through the streets and then stopped in front of a big, white house.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this place is very pretty.\u201d Summer looked at the white fence with green vines sprawled all over it with wide eyes, throwing the unpleasant situation from just then into the back of her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you like it, that\u2019s good.\u201d Claire raised a brow and smiled with some ill intent.</p><br/><p>Soon after they rang the doorbell, footsteps sounded from within.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Camille, who was smiling like the spring wind, appeared before their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello Teacher, I brought friends pay you a visit.\u201d Claire said. Before Camille could speak, she pulled Summer in first.</p><br/><p>Camille smiled gently as he followed from behind and said quietly, \u201cClaire, how did you have the time to come today? And you brought so many friends, shouldn\u2019t you give me an introduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Summer, this is Ben, and this is my knight Jean who doesn\u2019t need to be introduced.\u201d Claire pulled Summer to sit onto a sofa. She smiled while looking at Camille and said to everyone, \u201cEverybody sit, no need to be polite. This is my elegant, graceful, multi-talented, well-known teacher from the capital, Camille, a scholar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s heart floated, still smiling like the spring wind. He said gently, \u201cEverybody, no need to be polite. Sit, I\u2019ll go make tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire stood up and followed Camille from behind. \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll go and help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two went to pour tea. Summer looked at the room filled with decorations and her eyes formed into heart shapes. The feeling it gave people was very comfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, one that when met by people, they fall in love, when met by flowers, they bloom.\u201d Claire stood at Camille\u2019s side and said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Camille asked, gracefully making tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to live with you here for the time being. No problem, right?\u201d Claire had a harmless and pure smile.</p><br/><p>The teapot in Camille\u2019s hand almost fell as his hand trembled. He finally knew the purpose of why she was praising him just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little wench, what on earth do you want to do?\u201d Camille squeezed out of his teeth, his mouth not moving while he smiled.</p><br/><p>Claire also smiled. From the gaps of her teeth, she squeezed out, \u201cI just quarreled with that disgraceful father and don\u2019t have a place to stay at any more. I don\u2019t have money, but you are a host who does have money, that\u2019s why I came for your shelter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo earn money yourself. The door to the Mercenary Guild is very wide.\u201d Camille was still speaking with gritted teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we\u2019ve made money, we\u2019ll be staying here.\u201d Claire smiled brightly. \u201cI think teacher\u2019s brilliance also needs to be preserved right, Assassin King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my revenge sooner or later, you little wench.\u201d Camille smiled as gently as the wind as he brought the tea set over. \u201cHere, Summer, Ben, Jean. Why don\u2019t you drink some tea? You all are more than welcome living here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? We can live here? It won\u2019t bother you?\u201d Summer happily called out in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt definitely won\u2019t.\u201d Camille said, exceptionally serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen thank you very much. Teacher is really a good person.\u201d Summer said emotionally.</p><br/><p>Camille turned to look at Claire, revealing a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>A dagger hidden in a smile, Claire suddenly thought this expression.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile at the Hill Castle, in the study, Duke Gordan\u2019s face was dark as he sat in front of the study desk, Marquis Roger standing to the side with his head lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger, what can I say about you? When can you change your rude behavior?\u201d Gordan sighed. A bit grieved and lamenting, he said, \u201cHow can I be at ease with entrusting the Hill clan into your hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I\u2026\u201d Roger wanted to speak, then stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter. Really, it\u2019s hard to blame you acting this way. The child who was formerly the most disappointing became the most hard-working and dazzling one, nobody can accept this within a short amount of time.\u201d Duke Gordan sighed lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, it\u2019s all true?\u201d Marquis Roger asked in astonishment, \u201cWinning the tough competition against a student from the country Lagark, becoming sir Cliff\u2019s disciple, resolving Niya City\u2019s epidemic? I thought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou thought it was all me pulling strings from behind the scenes?\u201d Duke Gordan sighed lightly, then stood up. \u201cWith my personality, who do you think I would choose to push forward?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLashia.\u201d Roger replied without thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. From when she was little, the halo around her head has never stopped. I want to push Lashia to the very highest position, not the Claire who has always had a bad reputation.\u201d Duke Gordan said solemnly, \u201cBut, let me tell you, I haven\u2019t pushed Claire\u2019s matters even the slightest bit, they were all done by Claire herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Roger\u2019s expression was completely incredulous, completely surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the two people she brought back, I don\u2019t know what makes the girl special, but the man definitely isn\u2019t ordinary. I also want him to become the Hill clan\u2019s helping hand. Your behavior today has disappointed me gravely.\u201d Duke Gordan\u2019s tone was somewhat heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I\u2019m sorry, I never thought it was like this.\u201d Roger apologized, a little terrified.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t blame you completely. Wanting you to accept this outrageous matter is a bit difficult. Right now, Claire seems to have brought her friends into another teacher\u2019s house, into the scholar Camille\u2019s house. Let them first live there.\u201d Duke Gordan said profoundly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Father, didn\u2019t you say you wanted that black clothed young man to become of assistance of the Hill clan? I\u2019ll go fix things with him first, then ask them to come back.\u201d Roger said somewhat anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. The intense clash you had with Claire just now isn\u2019t something that can be resolved in a short amount of time. The black clothed man and the little girl both treat Claire as their leader. If you try to fix it now, the opposite effect will happen. What\u2019s crucial is slowly easing the tensions with Claire later.\u201d Duke Gordan said meaningfully, then sighed lightly. \u201cRoger, you need to see the heart of the matter, see people\u2019s nature clearly, and be steady, not easily angered, not rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll remember Father\u2019s instructions.\u201d Roger said, somewhat ashamed, his head low.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go. You\u2019ve just arrived and need to rest.\u201d Duke Gordan raised his hand, indicating for Roger to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, I want to first go to the imperial palace and see Katherine.\u201d When Roger said this, a gentleness appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d A smile also appeared on Duke Gordan\u2019s face. Roger\u2019s talent was a bit mediocre, and he was also a bit rude, but he was completely sincere to Katherine, very gentle and considerate. It was to the point that Katherine was willing to sever her relationship with her family to go back with Roger and lose her original last name, changing it to Hill.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, father. I\u2019ll be first taking my leave.\u201d Roger withdrew.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan let out a long sight, then called, \u201cEmery.\u201d</p><br/><p>Emery opened the door softly and inquired, \u201cSir, you called for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to Camille\u2019s home and tell Claire to come back home once their anger disappears. If she needs something, she doesn\u2019t need to hesitate to ask, I will sent people over.\u201d Duke Gordan said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll go right now.\u201d Emery\u2019s mind relaxed. Looks like Duke Gordan\u2019s doting already surpassed his expectations.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

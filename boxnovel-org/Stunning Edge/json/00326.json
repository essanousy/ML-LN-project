The air current in her palm was gently swaying, curving and circling like a viper. It was extremely strange.</p><br/><p>Just as Blue Flower was about to launch a sneak attack, Moon King suddenly exclaimed, \u201cLook, someone\u2019s coming in front!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone stood up and saw a group of people quickly approaching from the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he from the Heavenly King?\u201d Mezus frowned ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos, Jonathan.\u201d As for Qi Ao Shuang, she stared at the approaching crowd in a daze, uttering these two names in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey \u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned slightly, and there was doubt in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Heavenly King\u2019s army.\u201d Mishus said affirmatively.</p><br/><p>In the lead of the crowd were Dittos and Jonathan, and behind them were the guards in uniform. Everyone sat on a kind of bird, and the reins on the bird were the same colour. The group of people flew to a spot a few meters away from Qi Ao Shuang and stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos, Jonathan.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said with a puzzled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d Jonathan looked at Xiao Ao Shuang with a complicated expression and said with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cPick me up?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was even more confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly King is waiting for you.\u201d \u201cCome on.\u201d After he said that, he changed his direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Heavenly King won\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d He\u2019s waiting for you. \u201d Jonathan\u2019s expression was strange. He looked at Qi Ao Shuang as if he wanted to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Yue Wang\u2019s eyes darkened as he resolutely and decisively said. It was finally time to face it.</p><br/><p>Methews nodded and urged his mount to follow Dittos and Jonathan. The rest of the guards ordered the birds to fly behind them. A large group of people flew towards the Heavenly King\u2019s castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, why are you here?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked. For she had noticed the difference between Dittos\u2019s and Jonathan\u2019s clothes. Both of them were dressed in luxurious clothes, with light armor on their wrists and shoulders and a gorgeous sword on their waists.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am King Yong.\u201d \u201cDittens has become the White King.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s low voice made Qi Aushuang realize what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, you are all here to help the Heavenly King?\u201d When King Yue heard this, he frowned and asked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of help? We\u2019re just the Heavenly King\u2019s Foreign Dignitary.\u201d Jonathan rolled his eyes at King Yue and snappily said, \u201cI\u2019m in charge of sending the message now.\u201d The Heavenly King is waiting for you.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Of course, Xiao Ao Shuang knew that things would not be so simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you get there.\u201d Jonathan turned his face away and said nothing more.</p><br/><p>Dittos remained in the lead, silent. Jonathan flew up, side by side with Dittos.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking, Dittos?\u201d Jonathan asked in a low voice that only the two could hear as he approached Dittas.</p><br/><p>Dittos did not look at Jonathan, nor did he speak. He drew the reins in his hands, and the bird beneath him sped forward.</p><br/><p>Dittos and Jonathan brought Qi Aoshuang and the others all the way to the front of the Heavenly King\u2019s palace. From far away, Qi Ao Shuang saw a magnificent palace floating on top of a huge lake. The water of the lake was dark green, and the palace was built with white stones. The white palace and the dark green lake reflected each other beautifully. Xiao Ao Shuang looked over with rapt attention. The palace was floating in the water, and the reflection of the palace was very clear. That\u2019s where Camille lives?</p><br/><p>Everyone landed in front of the palace. Immediately, two rows of guards ran out of the palace. They lined up in formation and saluted before taking the reins and bringing their mounts to the other side. Jonathan and Ditto followed closely behind Qi Ao Shuang and the others into the palace.</p><br/><p>As he entered the palace, the sound of singing and music drifted into his ears. Moon King and Mishus exchanged a glance, both seeing the astonishment in the other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>As he walked deeper into the palace, the sounds of singing and music became louder and louder. Laughter and laughter could also be heard. Although the decorations of the palace were very luxurious, it was a little strange. There were mirrors on the walls, and even on the ceiling there were large ones. The opposite wall was full of mirrors. As a result, when they turned the corner, everyone was shocked by their own images.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there so many mirrors?\u201d Did he have to go this far? \u201cProbably not.\u201d King Yue frowned slightly. He seemed to be muttering to himself but also seemed to be talking to the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean, this palace wasn\u2019t like this before?\u201d Lily opened her eyes wide, curiously looking around and asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in his head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see him.\u201d \u201cSince he sent someone to pick us up, I\u2019m afraid he already thought of a countermeasure, or perhaps he already had his own ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mezus twitched the corners of his mouth, but said nothing.</p><br/><p>The group arrived at the main hall. They seemed to be singing and dancing to the same tune. The singers on both sides of the hall were playing their music and singing their songs. In the great hall, a handsome man with white hair was lazily leaning against a chair, wearing a simple set of clothes. He was wearing a simple set of black clothes without any decorations. His hair that was as white as snow was not tied up. Instead, he casually draped it over his back and dragged it on the ground. Under his long eyebrows were a pair of brown eyes, and the corner of his mouth held a slight trace of a smile. When he saw Xiao Ao Shuang and the rest, his expression did not change.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at the person above. This man, was the former White King, the current Heavenly King? He originally thought that his entire body would be filled with a tyrannical aura, but why did he give off such a weak feeling? There was even an unresolvable sadness between his brows.</p><br/><p>As for Lillie, she looked at the Heavenly King sitting there with a face full of hatred, and her eyes seemed to burn with desire. It was this person\u2019s relationship that led to her clan\u2019s extermination. Hateful, damnable! Lily clenched her fists, her whole body was trembling slightly. At this moment, a warm hand gently rested on her shoulder. Lily turned her head and met Jin Yan\u2019s gaze. Jin Yan shook his head gently and squeezed Lili\u2019s shoulder. Lily\u2019s tears almost fell. She understood what Jin Yan meant. Right now, she was no match for the Heavenly King, so she had to wait and see.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, came.\u201d The Heavenly King inclined his head slightly, not even glancing at the others, only looking at Qi Ao Shuang with a smile as he spoke those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou knew I\u2019d come?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes darkened, as she could tell that there was a hidden meaning behind the Heavenly King\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d \u201cIn return for helping me fulfill my wish, I have been waiting for you, waiting for something for you.\u201d There was a sad smile on the Heavenly King\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWest Tower!\u201d \u201cYou killed the Heavenly King, the heavens cannot tolerate you!\u201d Seeing that the Heavenly King had ignored them, the Moon King finally let out an angry bellow, calling out the Heavenly King\u2019s original name.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cHmph!\u201d The King of Heaven snorted coldly and gently waved his hand. Like a cannonball, the King of Moon flew backwards, smashing into the walls of the palace and shattering them into pieces. Like a broken doll, King Yue slowly collapsed from the wall, unable to move. Clearly, his injuries were not light.</p><br/><p>When the singers saw this, they all screamed and trembled, but they did not dare to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yue Ya!\u201d His heart sank. His expression changed as he rushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d When the Heavenly King, who was about to attack again, saw this, he slightly raised his eyebrows. His eyes moved and he stopped his actions.</p><br/><p>Lily\u2019s face was pale. She finally understood how small she was in front of the Heavenly King. If the Heavenly King was willing, he could instantly kill her. In her eyes, this kind of power was far inferior to her own master.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly King!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes turned cold, \u201cYou didn\u2019t wait for me to come here because you wanted to do this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d The Heavenly King smiled faintly, lowering his hands, turning to look at Qi Ao Shuang, \u201cI am waiting for you to fulfill that person\u2019s final wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s face sank. What did he mean by that last wish?</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I do, I want to ask you a question.\u201d The Heavenly King did not bother with Feng Yixuan\u2019s question. Instead, he slowly sat back down. He looked at Qi Ao Shuang and asked this question with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d What did his last wish mean? \u201cHim?\u201d Seeing the Heavenly King\u2019s expression, a bad feeling arose in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart. Did he mean Camille?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think love is?\u201d What do you do when you love someone? \u201d The Heavenly King did not answer the question that followed. Instead, he asked the question with a deep voice. Suddenly, he slowly reached out his hand to gently stroke his face. His expression grew more and more contented, more and more satisfied. This scene was extremely strange.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang was stunned, she did not expect the Heavenly King to ask such a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cLove, love is \u2026\u201d Xiao Aushuang was speechless, she suddenly realised that she was unable to answer this question accurately. Love is giving? Love is two people who stay together forever? Love is a lifelong follower? Love is.</p><br/><p>\u201cLove is a person who moves with another person, willing to do anything for the person who loves. \u201cI hope the two of you will always be together.\u201d Jonathan finally interrupted. This was his understanding of love. Many of the people present also agreed with his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong!\u201d Then, his right hand gently stroked the back of his left hand as he said with a face full of happiness and satisfaction, \u201cLove, love to the point where you belong to me. Love to the point where you can eat that person bit by bit until your stomach is full.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the hall was shocked, and their hearts trembled with fear. As the Heavenly King\u2019s actions were extremely strange, the Heavenly King slowly walked to the side, looking at the screen made of a mirror, he reached out his hand to touch the surface of the mirror and said softly, \u201cI love him, so I ate him, and he is inside my body \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone understood what he said, and their minds went into an uproar. Lily covered her mouth with her hand. Her face was full of disbelief and her eyes were filled with deep fear. The hall was eerily quiet without a sound. Everyone heard their own heartbeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the pinnacle of love, understand?\u201d The Heavenly King slowly turned his head and looked at Xiao Aushuang, then smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re here. I want to repay him for fulfilling my wish. So, you can go \u2026\u201d</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

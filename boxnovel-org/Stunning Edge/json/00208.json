She knew very well how Master felt towards Lawrence. Lawrence was Master\u2019s only friend, the only person he treated genuinely as a friend, but because of her her, this had happened\u2026</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun closed his eyes, not saying a word. However, his grief was evident.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps Amparkland regrets becoming enemies with you now,\u201d Ben said disdainfully, \u201cnow that they\u2019ve witnessed you heavily wound the Temple of Light and lost both Master Cliff and the Dragon Knight Jean, yet they haven\u2019t even caught of glimpse of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. What are you guys doing?\u201d Ben was annoyed. \u201cYou masters didn\u2019t die or anything, Aoshuang, you\u2019re not dead either. Once your master finds you, you can just destroy the root of the problem and everything will be resolved, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang sighed quietly. \u201cYes. I don\u2019t want Master to lose his only friend because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we just have to work faster.\u201d Ben raised his fist eagerly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard anything about Walter?\u201d Qi Aoshuang suddenly remembered the person who was so cowardly and fearful of death, yet refused to abandon her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter\u2026\u201d Jean shook his head. \u201cI did not hear anything. As a Dark magician, he won\u2019t expose his whereabouts so easily. But he definitely knows what happened to you. Perhaps he is even looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang took a moment to think, but did not say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rest here tonight. We have a long journey ahead of us tomorrow morning.\u201d Jean looked at Vermillion, who sat not far away. Gently, he said, \u201cVermillion is also tired.</p><br/><p>Everyone agreed and started setting up camp.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang, you seem to be much stronger than before. When can we spar?\u201d Ben laughed.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang ignored Ben\u2019s mischievous smile, preparing the firewood with Jean instead. Ben continued to chatter despite her disregard. Meanwhile, Oscar sat silently to the side.</p><br/><p>Jean stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go catch some hares.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, go. Get some fat ones.\u201d Ben laughed.</p><br/><p>Jean walked over to Vermillion and said quietly, \u201cVermillion, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Vermillion was a little surprised that Jean would approach her.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo catch some hares.\u201d Jean did not say another word.</p><br/><p>Vermillion didn\u2019t say anything either, following Jean silently. And so, the human and dragon walked into the forest, not silent the entire way.</p><br/><p>Once they were a distance away, Jean said quietly, \u201cVermillion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? Master?\u201d Vermillion blinked.</p><br/><p>Jean turned around and stared at Vermillion. \u201cVermillion, you\u2026 don\u2019t like Miss,\u201d he said calmly.</p><br/><p>Vermillion\u2019s expression shifted. She stared back at Jean blankly. Never had she imagined Jean could be so direct. She was even more surprised by the fact that Jean would able to see through her.</p><br/><p>Vermillion lowered her head, biting her lip, silent.</p><br/><p>Jean did not speak either, only waiting quietly.</p><br/><p>After a while, Vermillion finally exploded. \u201cYes! I hate her!\u201d She raised her head, facing Jean directly. \u201cI do hate her. Why? Why does Master treat her so well? But she doesn\u2019t care about you at all. Master, has she ever repaid your kindness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVermillion, she is very important to me.\u201d Jean was unexpectedly calm. \u201cNo one can replace her in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermillion felt as if she had been stabbed in the heart. Tears started to roll down uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, no one can replace you in my heart either, Vermillion,\u201d Jean consoled her gently. \u201cVermillion is unique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, but! Master, you treat her so well, but she\u2026\u201d Vermillion started to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also treat me very well. Have you ever wished I would repay your kindness?\u201d Jean asked quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Vermillion shook head violently, so fast that her tears flew, sparkling and pure. She said hastily, \u201cI am always delighted to help you. Master\u2019s wishes are my wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never wished for Miss to repay me either. I only wish to stay by her side forever. To watch her live happily is good enough for me,\u201d Jean said gently. He reached out and patted Vermillions head, smiling. \u201cDo you understand? And have you ever thought what I would do if you harmed the Miss? Do you think I would just ignore her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermillion\u2019s mouth opened wide. She looked at Jean\u2019s handsome face, considering his words. Suddenly, she was filled with fear. If she really did something to her, then Master definitely would not just leave her alone, but punish her severely. Maybe, he would even abandon her! The more she thought, the more afraid she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaah\u2026\u201d Vermillion finally started to cry. She dove into Jean\u2019s bosom. \u201cMaster, I understand. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2026 I was just jealous of her. She can receive your care and protection. I\u2026 I wish Master would look after me more, care for me.\u201d Tears streamed down her face.</p><br/><p>Jean smiled gently. He patted Vermillion\u2019s head. \u201cIt was I who was at fault. I hurt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermilion started to cry even harder. Jean didn\u2019t move, letting her continue to weep. Actually, Jean was aware of Vermillion\u2019s negative feelings long ago, but he didn\u2019t expect her to care more and more. If he let it go, perhaps something might transpire. Vermillion was still immature, technically speaking a young dragon. If her innocent self became twisted from jealousy and she ended up harming Qi Aoshuang, Jean definitely would not forgive himself or Vermillion. So, before this girl could do anything, he pulled her aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to stay by Master\u2019s side too. I know that Master and I cannot ever have a romantic relationship. But.. but I can\u2019t help being envious of her. I wish I could drop her from my back while I\u2019m flying.\u201d Vermillion sobbed even harder after confessing. At the same time, she felt much lighter. Indeed, she had this thought before, childishly wanting to drop her from the air. Now, she was really happy that she had only thought of it, never doing it for real. Otherwise, Master would be furious. He might even do something to her!</p><br/><p>Jean was a little shocked. This foolish girl, she really thought she could hurt the Miss this way?</p><br/><p>\u201cWaah, Master, I\u2019m sorry. Aren\u2019t I a terrible person?\u201d Vermillion sobbed. Seeing Jean\u2019s blank expression, she felt even more uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cVermillion did you\u2026 forget that the Miss can fly?\u201d Jean was amused. Fortunately, she realized her wrongs and had not actually done anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Vermillion stopped crying, looking at Jean blankly. \u201cI really forgot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have such thoughts in the future.\u201d Jean rubbed her head, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201d Vermillion nodded obediently.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hunt game now. I appreciate your hard work for the past few days, flying so many people.\u201d Jean cared for Vermillion genuinely. Afterall, she had always stayed at his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not hard at all.\u201d Vermillion had already stopped crying and was smiling. Once she had thought things through, her heart had become much more light. Jean started to smile. Vermillion was a dragon indeed, seeing things in black and white. Even if she hated someone, she wouldn\u2019t be like scheme like humans. This was the difference between humans and dragons\u2026</p><br/><p>Once Jean and Vermillion returned, bringing back all sorts of wildlife, Qi Aoshuang was a little shocked by Vermillion\u2019s change in attitude. She was visibly more intimate, clinging to her, chatting constantly. Qi Aoshuang sent Jean a suspicious glance, but Jean only smiled without a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, pretty good. You got it done so easily,\u201d Ben murmured to Jean in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want Vermillion to be killed by you, charred until not even ashes remain.\u201d Jean humphed, curling his lip.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood thing you knew.\u201d Ben took a bite of fruit. How could Ben not tell that foolish dragon harbored intentions towards Qi Aoshuang? She just hadn\u2019t done anything. The moment she did anything foolish to Qi Aoshuang, Ben would immediately kill her. He had learned how to be sinister from Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so tough on Vermillion in the future,\u201d Jean said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch.\u201d Jean had seen through Ben perfectly. Although Vermillion had not dishonored the dragons, Ben was dissatisfied with her. He was dissatisfied with any dragons that had accepted humans as masters. He had originally planned to give her a tough time during the journey ahead, but not that Jean had exposed him, it would be too embarrassing to continue to doing so.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Instead, they lost another cardinal. Claire chopped off the head of that cardinal with one slash.</p><br/><p>Seeing Claire fight with such skill, the pope\u2019s expression darkened. He stopped shooting with his bow, his gaze slowly shifting to Katherine\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A cold, please glint flashed through the pope\u2019s eyes. He slowly raised his bow, pulling back the bowstring wider and wider. The arrow would not only destroy one\u2019s physical body, but their soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe un-pure must be cleansed.\u201d The pope watched Claire as he spoke these words slowly and coldly.</p><br/><p>After killing off another pope, Claire\u2019s gaze followed the direction of the pope\u2019s arrow and was shocked. The arrow was not towards Claire, but Katherine\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Claire\u2019s rage reached the skies, her eyes already red with anger, filled with deep killing intent.</p><br/><p>She swiftly rushed to Katherine, then flew towards the pope, gripping her sword tightly as she shot straight towards him.</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s lips curved into a cold smile. The arrow pointed towards Claire\u2019s chest, then released!</p><br/><p>Outside the city, Leng Lingyun had a gloomy expression, his eyes filled with worry. He finally knew that tonight, the Temple would kill Claire. But was it too late? How was Claire currently?</p><br/><p>He flew, about to go where L\u2019Or\u00e9al told him. Then, a familiar voice spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun, where are you going this late?\u201d Liu Xueqing appeared from the shadow of the city wall. Only then did Leng Lingyun realize that because he was so preoccupied, he did not notice someone was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Lneg Lingyun said coldly, preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to save Claire?\u201d Liu Xueqing said immediately, seeing he was about to leave.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun paused, but continued without replying.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really going to betray the Temple for her? Is she worth it? Are you going to destroy what you worked hard for all these past years?\u201d Liu Xueqing\u2019s volume continued to to grow in volume, filled with anger and jealousy.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun continued to ignore her. He only knew that he did not want that girl to be hurt, to lose her live.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Xuanxuan?\u201d Leng Lingyun once again heard Liu Xueqing\u2019s cold voice.</p><br/><p>He finally stopped.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing felt a burst of happiness. As expected, Xuanxuan was forever her trump card, forever the magic weapon she could use to control Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>But when Leng Lingyun turned around, Liu Xueqing was given a shock. Leng Lingyun\u2019s violet eyes were piercingly cold, without any warmth, as if they could see right through her soul. Frightened, Liu Xueqing backed away a few steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use Xuanxuan to threaten me. My patience has its limits.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s voice was as cold as a thousand nights. Anyone who heard it would shiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d Liu Xueqing waved hastily. \u201cIt was Xuanxuan who told me to bring her to find you. She\u2019s over there.\u201d Liu Xueqing\u2019s fear grew.</p><br/><p>Shocked, Leng Lingyun\u2019s gaze followed where Liu Xueqing pointed. Indeed, there was an ordinary looking carriage quietly stopped there.</p><br/><p>Xuanxuan was here? How could it be? Before he left, the maids had clearly told him she was already asleep.</p><br/><p>Seeing Leng Lingyun\u2019s incredulous expression, she hastily added, \u201cIt really was Xuanxuan who told me to bring her here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun slowly descended, watching the carriage somewhat suspiciously. Before he even walked over, the curtain of the carriage was opened, revealing Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s adorable face.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuanxuan! Why are you here?\u201d Leng Lingyun was shocked. Xuanxuan had indeed appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, I came to send something.\u201d Leng Xuanxuan pulled out a small crystal. It was a memory crystal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Leng Lingyun walked briskly towards Xuanxuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is what I want to say to you. Brother, I have wronged you all these years.\u201d Suddenly, Leng Xuanxuan smiled brilliantly.</p><br/><p>NO!</p><br/><p>The word flashed through Leng Lingyun and Liu Xueqing\u2019s minds. Leng Xuanxuan was smiling resolutely!</p><br/><p>The next moment, black liquid dribbled from the corner of her mouth, glaringly dark! Still smiling, Leng Xuanxuan slowly collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoo\u2013\u201d Leng Lingyun cried painfully, dashing towards the carriage, catching the weak little body in his embrace.</p><br/><p>Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s face was deathly pale, completely colorless. Her little mouth were entirely black. She used all her strength to lift the small crystal, already gasping for breath, yet she had a satisfied smile. Seeing Leng Lingyun\u2019s pained expression, she tried her best to say a sentence, just one sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, please fly\u2026freely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her pure, violet eyes gradually dimmed as her eyelids slowly closed.</p><br/><p>Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s small hand slowly drooped. The small crystal fell from her grasp onto the ground, then rolled away.</p><br/><p>Her weak, little body slowly turned colder and colder\u2026</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing froze where she stood, many emotions in her heart. Leng Xuanxuan actually chose to swallow poison! Where did it come from? How was this so coincidental? Why did she kill herself at such a pivotal moment? Everything was over, over! The thought echoed.</p><br/><p>She knew that Leng Lingyun would never look back. He had no reason left to stay at the Temple, no reason to ever talk to her again, no reason to give her so much as a glance!</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing thought Leng Lingyun would explode, would angrily attack her, but Leng Lingyun was very quiet.</p><br/><p>He only hugged Xuanxuan\u2019s already lifeless little body tighter, not moving from where he stood.</p><br/><p>Terrifyingly quiet.</p><br/><p>After a while, Leng Lingyun finally moved.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing backed away fearfully.</p><br/><p>But Leng Lingyun did not even look at her. Hugging Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s body, he crouched down to pick up the memory crystal that had fallen, then left. Step by step, he disappeared into the night.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing reached out, wanting to call out to Leng Lingyun, but it was as if her voice was blocked. Not a sound came out. She wanted to chase after him, but it was as if her feet grew roots. Not able to move an inch.</p><br/><p>Just like that, she watched Leng Lingyun disappear, disappear from her gaze, disappear from her world.</p><br/><p>She knew that in this lifetime, that person was unrelated to her. Never again\u2026</p><br/><p>The pope smiled coldly. Claire would definitely not be survive this arrow!</p><br/><p>This arrow was called the Soul Destroyer arrow.</p><br/><p>It would not only kill the physical body, but also the soul!</p><br/><p>The terrifying bright white arrow shot towards Claire\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Humans are foolish. Clearly there was no way to survive this arrow, yet she would attempt to block it just for a lifeless corpse.</p><br/><p>The pope set down his bow, closing his eyes. He smiled coldly, sensing the terrifying power the arrow would bring.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>There was a huge explosion. Dust and smoke filled the sky.</p><br/><p>This time, Claire would be dead. Even her soul would be extinguished. The goddess\u2019s order was now completed. He would simply have to find replacements for the ones killed.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to return, the dust cleared. The pope\u2019s expression froze.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s beautiful face was appeared right before him! She slashed with all his strength, aiming for the pope\u2019s neck!</p><br/><p>The pope hastily raised his bow to block!</p><br/><p>Could archers win in close combat against warriors?</p><br/><p>Of course not!</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s gaze was filled with ice. She swung with all her might, cutting through the pope\u2019s bow, about to slash the pope\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Then, a white light flashed overhead!</p><br/><p>Clare\u2019s movements were stopped! The Azure Ripple blade stopped right at the pope\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s face revealed glee!</p><br/><p>He recognized this pressure! It was the descent of the goddess!</p><br/><p>After seeing the pope\u2019s mad delight, feeling the pressure, she understood.</p><br/><p>It was the descent of the goddess of Light. Just like the god of Darkness, her true body was unable to appear. What would appear would be an image of her. It had less than half of her true strength, but it was enough to stop Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Claire humphed coldly. She withdrew the blade, darting back nimbly. She was not like before, unable to move under the pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur holy goddess!\u201d The pope looked up towards the sky delightedly. The white light overhead grew brighter and brighter, also becoming closer and closer.</p><br/><p>A dazzling ball of pure white light gradually descended. Amidst the light, the faint outline of a beautiful figure could be seen. It gradually became more distinct, revealing the beautiful appearance of the goddess of Light.</p><br/><p>Claire grasped the Azure Ripple blade tightly. The hand with the dark mark started to ache dully, the pain gradually becoming stronger. It was a burning hot pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cUn-pure spirit, only being destroyed will allow you to be reborn.\u201d The goddess\u2019s pretty voice was filled with pressure.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the back of her right hand. The black mark slowly appeared, gradually becoming more distinct. She ignored the contradictory words. The goddess of Light herself had descended to kill her. Claire knew that everything was because of the mark.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shameless bastard, are you just going to watch?\u201d Claire said simply as she watched the goddess\u2019s movements carefully. Claire was certain the god of Darkness must have seen everything, but never lent any help. Afraid of the goddess of Light? Claire could not think of any other reason.</p><br/><p>Silence, only silence.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

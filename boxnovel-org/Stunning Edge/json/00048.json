That black smoke flew all to the bottom of the city wall, into a well there. Claire held her breath and quietly followed. Before her eyes it was completely dark. This was a dried up well. At the mouth of the well, there was a wooden ladder. Claire crouched down, looked up at the night sky, estimating that the magic puppet should be guiding her Master over there by now. After thinking about it, Claire hid her aura and slowly climbed down the ladder.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, Claire, wait first. Wait until your Master arrives and then go down together. I keep on feeling an ominous wind blowing.\u201d Walter shuddered a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just a feeling, there really is wind!\u201d Claire frowned and looked down the dried well. From below, a slight, cold wind blew. Where did it lead to?</p><br/><p>Claire slowly climbed down, all the way to the bottom of the well.</p><br/><p>The black smoke was already gone.</p><br/><p>The four walls of the bottom of the well were completely intact.</p><br/><p>Where did that black smoke disappear to?</p><br/><p>Claire sized up the four walls, closed her eyes, and gently put her hand on the well wall. Walter was amazed as he felt Claire pass through.</p><br/><p>Once Claire opened her eyes again, there was a deep tunnel right before her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn illusion technique?\u201d Walter said in amazement. That well wall couldn\u2019t have looked any more ordinary, who would have thought it was just an illusion created by somebody. This well wall was originally empty, with a deep tunnel behind it.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak anymore, and only followed the route of the tunnel forward. White Emperor grabbed Claire\u2019s hair tightly and also stared forward.</p><br/><p>The further in they walked, the more extreme the cold wind got.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation up front?\u201d Claire asked Walter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dark aura is just up ahead. It\u2019s much less dense than before, and probably went a bit far.\u201d Walter replied.</p><br/><p>Once Claire came out of the tunnel, she was shocked. Right now she was already completely outside the city! It was the small forest outside of the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cBone pagoda!\u201d Walter suddenly cried out in a low voice, completely surprised. A bone pagoda was extremely evil building, completely made of bones. Resentment and corpse\u2019s Qi were very favorable for a necromancer\u2019s cultivation.</p><br/><p>Claire looked up. As expected, she saw the faint outline of a white spire in the forest, about five to six meters, ghastly white and made out of bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely made out of bones. Strange, why didn\u2019t we discover it when we were entering the city? Even if we didn\u2019t discover it, the magicians from inside the city should also be able to discover this conspicuous building.\u201d Walter was completely puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it can move!\u201d Claire snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Walter\u2019s response was full of shock and fear. There was only one person out of all the Dark magicians and necromancers with a mobile pagoda! It was that terrifying, inhuman freak!</p><br/><p>\u201cClare, are you sure the pagoda can move?!\u201d Walter\u2019s voice was already shaking a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I just saw that pagoda move. That explains why nobody discovered the bone pagoda is here.\u201d Claire solemnly said, certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, go quick, let\u2019s go quick! Quickly!\u201d Walter\u2019s voice was completely fearful and impatient.</p><br/><p>Claire understood that if Walter reacted like this, he definitely had his reasons. Without an explanation, Claire immediately got out the invisibility cloak that Cliff gave her and hid her body, preparing to return the way she came.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that Dark grand magician\u2019s, Benimo\u2019s bone pagoda! Only he could have a mobile bone pagoda! No wonder! No wonder they could infect a whole city\u2019s people with Dark aura!\u201d Walter\u2019s voice shuddered a bit. Grand magician! A level right below wizard sage. If a Dark grand magician fought against a normal grand magician, the person to lose would definitely be the normal grand magician. Because this Benimo\u2019s heart was very evil, the magic he used was even more terrifying and malicious. His death magic could engulf the average person in the blink of an eye and turn them into a pile of bones.</p><br/><p>Claire was shocked. She had heard of Benimo before. On the Magician Council\u2019s kill list, he was ranked number two. Every time he safely escaped and seriously damaged people of the Magician Council. He was an extremely dangerous and cruel kind of character. She never thought he would actually appear here.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s an adorable rabbit here.\u201d Just as Claire was preparing to stealthily retreat, an ice cold voice with a trace of ridicule sounded out of nowhere. The surroundings were completely vacant, but Claire clearly heard that voice.</p><br/><p>Her invisible body was also discovered? Claire was amazed. Just how strong was the other person?!</p><br/><p>Claire alertly sensed the surrounding\u2019s air flow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou blockhead, what were you doing, not even knowing you had been followed!\u201d That indifferent voice had a sliver of oppressiveness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, sorry. I didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201d A voice came far away. Next, that black spoke quickly floated over. After a puff sound, that black smoke turned into a bony, thin young man. Those pair of deep-set eyes emotionlessly looked forward. The skin on his neck looked like it were about to collapse. Below his tall nose were pale lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow annoying, not only did people from the Temple of Light come, you were also followed by this person. Quickly dispose of her and then we\u2019ll switch places.\u201d The indifferent voice urged.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master. But\u2026\u201d That thin and terrifying man stammered looking at the blank space in front of him with a bit of embarrassment. With his cultivation, naturally he wasn\u2019t able to see the invisible Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really trash, not progressing at all.\u201d That indifferent voice snorted. The next moment, a stifling aura enveloped Claire. Suddenly, she felt like she was being choked by someone, unable to breath, her body feeling extremely heavy, not able to move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, ahhhhh, Claire, withstand it, your master should arrive soon.\u201d Walter\u2019s fearful and worried voice carried a sob in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Claire wasn\u2019t able to make a sound, feeling like her throat was being gripped very tightly. Gradually, Claire\u2019s body appeared in front of the young necromancer.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly deal with it so we can leave.\u201d The cold voice voice sounded from far away, the white bone pagoda gradually starting to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, master, I\u2019ll immediately follow.\u201d The young necromancer replied and then turned to look at Claire, who had appeared in front of him. His face twitched, and he started laughing terrifyingly. Those deep set and vacant eyes sized up Claire. Slowly, he walked to up Claire and bent down slightly to look at Claire\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour looks are not bad. This skin looks very smooth and tender, if I peel it off, afterwards I can make a pillow and sleep on it everyday, it will definitely feel good. And also your golden hair,\u201d he clicked his tongue \u201cI\u2019ll cut it off and make it into a brush\u2026\u201d The young necromancer said to himself, giving a sly smile.</p><br/><p>Claire coldly looked at the abnormal young man, still continuously trying to break free from that necromancer\u2019s restraints. But no matter how much Claire tried, those restraints didn\u2019t have the slightest sign of loosening.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, ahhhhh, what do we do. How come Cliff, that old man, still hasn\u2019t come?\u201d Walter yelped like an ant being roasted.</p><br/><p>Claire wasn\u2019t able to make a sound, nor a move.</p><br/><p>The young necromancer gave a strange smile, reached out his bone-thin hand, slowly towards Claire\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that half of the moon appeared from behind the clouds.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the young necromancer in front of her. The next moment, she became shocked.</p><br/><p>The necromancer\u2019s hand stopped midway, stopping two centimeters away from Claire\u2019s face. An eerie smile hung on his face, but he was frozen in place.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, blood splurted out of the necromancer\u2019s neck mid air into a gorgeous arc.</p><br/><p>The necromancer was still in the same posture as before, his hand reached out, a vile smile hung on his face, as he slowly tilted over.</p><br/><p>Under the moonlight, a fiery red haired handsome young man faced Claire with a devilish smile.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng?</p><br/><p>How did he appear here?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

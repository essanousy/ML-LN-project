He sipped some scented tea, then said, \u201cIn reality, the other side also didn\u2019t want me to know who they were. I was curious for a moment, then went to investigate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the chameleon in from her, and suddenly understood deeply that the guy in front of her definitely had poor character. This assassin actually dared to find out the identity of his employer. Normally, an assassin was just supposed to kill and get money, not allowed to ask anything else. But this guy actually went around looking to find out who his employer was.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not the crown prince?\u201d Claire looked at the smiling Camille and said, probing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe average person would think that. With two princes, if one was attacked by the assassin, then it must have been done by the other prince.\u201d Camille had on that courteous and gentle smile again, looking very elegant, very enchanting.</p><br/><p>But Claire didn\u2019t think that way. This was a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s not the crown prince.\u201d Claire said, certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not the crown prince.\u201d Camille looked at Claire with slitted eyes and said gently, \u201cYou damned brat, first tell me how you discovered me. Only then will I tell you my employer. You definitely won\u2019t lose out with this information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s mouth twitched and she protested, \u201cCan you please not speak so gently and elegantly while spitting out such poisonous words?\u201d The feeling this guy gave was too weird, she couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, damned brat. If it wasn\u2019t for you going to the imperial palace for no reason, my legendary reputation as the number one assassin in the world wouldn\u2019t have been destroyed, you stinking brat.\u201d Camille\u2019s face was still so charming with that tender smile, completely different from the words spit out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Walter was about to collapse mentally. This person was really too outrageous, too outrageous. He conceded defeat! He could use the most gentle tone possible to say the world\u2019s most malicious words. This kind of person, was he not outrageous? Who could fight against him? Who could withstand him?</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the gently smiling Camille. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll tell you. Among assassins, you are truly outstanding and can count as an assassin king. You had completely hidden your aura, because you understood airflow very well, and could control your body to completely follow the airflow. This is basic knowledge to assassins, but to this day, you are the first person I have seen who has done it so perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thanks for the praise. Praise me more, I like hearing it.\u201d Camille used his hand to prop up the side of his face, leaning on the sofa\u2019s armrest with a content expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, a crazy narcissist! Claire, just now, how did you figure out he loved himself?\u201d Walter asked, in both disgust and admiration.</p><br/><p>Claire: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, damned brat, who on earth are you?\u201d Camille seemed to have thought of something, frowning as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Now it was Claire\u2019s turn to pretend to be stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop giving I, your father, an act like you\u2019re young and naive~~ Thinking back to that time, before I elegantly walked into the study to teach you, I had already mentally prepared for you to be vulgar and rude, but who would have thought you wouldn\u2019t even look directly at me. Do you think I\u2019ll believe you were that male-chaser from that time?\u201d Camille laughed cynically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk about that question later.\u201d Claire changed the topic. \u201cYour good looks are unrivaled in the world. Now let\u2019s talk about why you were discovered by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, listening to those words feels so good.\u201d Camille switched back to looking refined.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use airflow to determine your existence. I was sensing all the objects around me. Suddenly, some kind of object appeared and moving slowly. How could I not discover you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that mysterious? Why can you sense all the objects around you? Don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s some kind of magic. Magicians are the most idiotic, if I approach them without any sound or presence, I can slit their throat and just kill them before they even chant a spell. A warrior could maybe reach for their weapon at the last moment.\u201d Camille said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain. I also comprehend the art of assassination, and then I have fused together magic and Dou Qi into awareness.\u201d Claire said a half truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that?\u201d Camille was suspicious and not sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I already told you everything. Tell me who your employer is.\u201d Claire urged.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy employer was the emperor.\u201d Camille said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Claire and Walter cried at the same time. The emperor? Why would the emperor hire an assassin for the second prince right now?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would the emperor hire you to assassinate the second prince?\u201d Claire frowned, then guessed, \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because there only needs to be one prince, so he first decided to root out one he wasn\u2019t satisfied with, leaving the one he was satisfied with?\u201d As expected, the royal family was extremely ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cA normal person would also think that.\u201d Camille added unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>Perhaps?! Claire\u2019s expression changed slightly. If she guessed correctly, then the emperor was too terrifying, too ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur emperor definitely isn\u2019t as harmless as he looks.\u201d Camille stood up. \u201cThe water has cooled, I\u2019m going to replace it with hot water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe emperor is waiting for a fierce match between tigers and then will choose the strongest to become his successor.\u201d Suddenly, Claire\u2019s heart became cold. This kind of method! Was this an emperor\u2019s method?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not stupid. The emperor is trying to start the two princes\u2019 battle as soon as possible. He wants to select an heir now.\u201d Camille smiled, then spit out in a bad mood, \u201cThe employer and I had an agreement that if I didn\u2019t succeed after two times, I didn\u2019t need to execute the plan anymore and the money would still be paid, but my legendary reputation as the number one assassin in the world has been destroyed by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression became ugly.</p><br/><p>If it was like this, then what about Mother? Would she get involved?</p><br/><p>Princess Maurice and second prince Nancy were born from the current empress, so naturally, the two\u2019s relationship was very good. Also, right now Mother was Princess Maurice\u2019s head maid. Would she be involved?</p><br/><p>In other words! Claire abruptly stood up, her face a bit pale. In other words, the second prince and princess Maurice had long before prepared to battle with the crown prince and use Mother as a way to involve and seize the Hill clan bargaining chip?!</p><br/><p>Was it like this? Was it like this?</p><br/><p>Claire became worried. She definitely couldn\u2019t let the gentle and kindhearted women, the first person to be warm to her after she transmigrated, receive any harm.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll be going first. I have matters to attend to.\u201d Once Claire thought to this point, she couldn\u2019t sit still, immediately wanting to go out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you want to go? You\u2019re not going to stay here any more?\u201d Camille politely asked after putting down the teapot.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. In the future, I\u2019ll find you and give you business and I\u2019ll also introduce you to business along the way.\u201d Claire said urgently, about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to pay twice the price other people pay, you damned brat, harming my brilliant reputation.\u201d Camille\u2019s gentle yet strange voice floated over.</p><br/><p>Claire turned and said in a low tone, \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell anyone, how can anyone tell that it was you who tried to assassinate? And who would know that you\u2019ve failed twice? You won\u2019t talk, I won\u2019t talk, and the emperor won\u2019t talk even more so. Who else would know? I\u2019ll keep it a secret, you give me a discount of eighty percent.\u201d Then she left, not waiting for Camille\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I won\u2019t talk, the damn brat won\u2019t talk, and the emperor won\u2019t talk even more so. Who else knows? Haha, not bad, not bad. This damn brat does have little cute side.\u201d A gentle business smile appeared on Camille\u2019s face, complacent as he prepared to wash and go to sleep.</p><br/><p>Claire went on the carriage with a heavy heart, closed her eyes, and leaned on the carriage, telling Jean to tell the coachman to return to the mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are you worried about something?\u201d Jean asked quietly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

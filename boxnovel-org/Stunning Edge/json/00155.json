He said that as long as I could find the tallest mountain peak, I just needed to pass the nine levels to reach the top and return,\u201d Feng Yixuan roared. \u201cIf he told me there was a teleportation formation, then I wouldn\u2019t need to fight. I could just sneak up there while concealing my aura, find the teleportation formation, and then return.\u201d Sneaking up there without fighting <i>did</i> seem like a pretty good idea.</p><br/><p>However, Claire knew. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Since the senior had sent them here to train, there was no way they could reach the peak so easily.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s conjecture was completely correct. The mountain, called the Mountain of Rebirth, was split in nine levels, each with a city. Each city had a powerful ruler and only those who reached a certain level of strength could proceed to the next level. If one was strong enough, one could challenge the city lord for their position. Like a pyramid, each level was higher than the other and the higher one went, the stronger people one would meet. Here, no one was held accountable for murder. There was no notion of laws. This was the land of the free, also the land of violence and bloodshed.</p><br/><p>These lands were a sort of training ground, coined by people of the other world Claire and Feng Yixuan had come from as the Land of Rebirth. There was another name for this place, however: the Bloody Cesspool.</p><br/><p>At this moment in time, Astral Feng was still hammering away. He muttered to himself, \u201cIf that girl and damn brat manage to pass the nine cities, they\u2019ll come back reborn. Aiya~ya, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It would be a bloody baptism!</p><br/><p>Claire and Feng Yixuan continued to fight on their way up the Mountain of Rebirth. Just because they weren\u2019t looking for trouble didn\u2019t mean trouble wouldn\u2019t look for them.</p><br/><p>The reasons why they fought continued to grow even more ridiculous. Some took a liking to the ornament on Feng Yixuan\u2019s waist, others took a liking to Claire\u2019s clothes. People fought them with all kinds of excuses. The road to the peak was an arduous and long one. The two\u2019s coordination was still seamless as they continued to kill powerful foes, but these foes were only relatively powerful. The true experts were congregated at the peak. Naturally, at times they would run into people they couldn\u2019t beat. For instance, the two were currently being chased around frantically.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you go first!\u201d Feng Yixuan instantly released countless wind blades to defend.</p><br/><p>This time, their opponent was a terrifying old magician. The old man had eagle eyes that glittered with malice. The reason why he had attacked Claire and Feng Yixuan was beyond reasonable: because they weren\u2019t pleasing to the eye. Just because of this, he was trying to kill them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d the old man clicked his tongue disdainfully. With a wave of his sleeve, the wind blades were scattered, leaving behind only a slight breeze. Feng Yixuan\u2019s expression changed. Without any hesitation, he threw himself before Claire. The old man laughed, approaching them slowly step by step with a relaxed expression.</p><br/><p>Claire was silent. With a flight of her fingers, countless small golden lotuses appeared.</p><br/><p>Before Claire could cast Thousand Terrors, the old man\u2019s expression changed immediately. He hurriedly backed away and eyed Claire cautiously, then asked in a loud voice, \u201cWhat is your relation to Si Konglin?\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice actually carried a trace of fear!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan froze and Claire was taken aback. Claire hadn\u2019t even said a word, yet the old man was continuously backing away.</p><br/><p>His voice low, he muttered, \u201cKnowing Si Konglin\u2019s Treasured Lotus Style\u2026.\u201d The fear in his voice continued to become more audible. The terrifying old man actually turned around and flew away speedily, as if escaping.</p><br/><p>Claire watched as the old man disappeared, silent. Who exactly was Si Konglin? Such a terrifying and powerful old man was so afraid of him!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems he thought you were Si Konglin\u2019s disciple.\u201d Feng Yixuan stroked his chin thoughtfully, looking off into the distance. \u201cJust how strong is Si Konlin? Supposedly, he\u2019s stronger than gramps, but I\u2019ve never seen gramps lose to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a flick of her finger, the countless lotuses disappeared. Claire too felt puzzled. Who exactly was Si Konglin?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, let\u2019s go.\u201d Feng Yixuan suddenly turned around. HIs face was only an inch away from Claire, who was deep in thought. He was so close, he could feel Claire\u2019s breathing on his face.</p><br/><p>Suddenly feeling Feng Yixuan\u2019s warm breath, Claire\u2019s heart clenched and she struck without thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t even dodge, so the fist hit him squarely in the face. Once again, he had a black eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you come close again, I\u2019ll fill your face with bruises.\u201d Claire turned around, humphing coldly, and started to walk away. She let out a breath, trying to settle her tense heart. That damn Feng Yixuan! Suddenly getting so close and startling her, he was looking for a beating!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me.\u201d Feng Yixuan clutched his eye, hastily giving chase. However, he was smiling faintly.</p><br/><p>Three months passed. No one knew who they had faced or what Feng Yixuan and Claire had experienced.</p><br/><p>On Feng island, Senior Feng was crouching on the ground, fumbling with a vegetable basket. He lived in solitary and completely relied on himself for sustenance. Afterall, he was still human, needing to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, when will they return?\u201d The old man took out a small crystal and examined it, but nothing was different. He had marked Feng Yixuan when he left so that if Feng Yixuan was back in this world, the crystal would react.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already spring.\u201d The old man yawned, then put the crystal away. He and Si Konglin had only managed to return after three years. Who knew when the brat and girl would come back.</p><br/><p>While Feng Yixuan and Claire were in the Land of Rebirth, the situation in Amparkland had changed drastically.</p><br/><p>Amparkland, the palace: Princess Maurice\u2019s bedroom</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, the crown prince unexpectedly agreed to the Temple\u2019s conditions!\u201d Princess Maurice\u2019s expression was heavy. Nancy paced in the room. They never expected the first prince to actually agree to the Temple\u2019s demands! Agreeing to the demands mean that the Temple would have more powerful than the Crown! How could he let that happen!</p><br/><p>\u201cI too did not expect him to do such a foolish thing for the thrown. For years, divine right and royal authority have been on equal ground, but he is going to break the balance! Those old lazy conmen want to rule royalty? In their dreams! I would never agree to such conditions!\u201d Nancy\u2019s eyes were filled with fury, his knuckles white. Such conditions were simply too insulting!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what can we do now?\u201d Princess Maurice frowned in thought. Duke Gordan had sent Jean to assist elder brother, but even though his grandson Eric publically supported the crown prince, Duke Gordan had never interfered. Perhaps he wanted to\u2026 double dip*?!</p><br/><p>*me: what is a more formal way to say double dip</p><br/><p>*Friend: Doublus Dippus</p><br/><p>\u201cDuke Gordan, that old fox!\u201d Nancy gnashed his teeth. He sat down, watching Princess Maurice. \u201cThat old fox, he secretly sent Jean to assist me so that if I ascend the throne, he will become a minister of outstanding service. No one knows, not even the crown prince. His grandson, however, supports to the first prince, and he doesn\u2019t interfere. On the surface, it looks like it\u2019s Eric\u2019s lone decision, but in reality, it isn\u2019t so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. He is going to sit back and watch relaxedly. To him, it is a win-win situation!\u201d Princess Maurice\u2019s heart hardened. What a sly old fox! But would his wish come true?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if he is helping the crown prince secretly just as the crown prince is unaware Duke Gordan is secretly helping us.\u201d Nancy\u2019s voice was fierce, but carried a trace of helplessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we still have Katherine as a trump card.\u201d Princess Maurice sighed. If possible, she didn\u2019t want to use this trump card. She didn\u2019t want to hurt Claire and knew how important Katherine was to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about using Katherine. Even though she is a prominent figure of the Hill clan, I have already promised Claire Katherine\u2019s safety.\u201d Nancy frowned, staring into Princess Maurice\u2019s somber eyes. He knew his sister better than anyone. Maurice only showed her true self before him. She was not as innocent as she seemed. Her cunning was far above his intellect. If Maurice were a man, who knew who would be the emperor!</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Maurice nodded, her expression dark. \u201cBut elder brother, sometimes in order to achieve great things, there needs to be sacrifices.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaurice, I know you are doing this for my behalf, but\u2026\u201d Nancy\u2019s expression became complex.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you have developed feelings for Claire, so you do not want to do anything that will hurt her.\u201d Maurice\u2019s expression sharpened, becoming ice cold.</p><br/><p>Nancy was speechless. Maurice\u2019s words had hit the nail on the head. He simply stared, unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, you know the reason why I have never been interested in any men for all these years.\u201d Her expression was still icy.</p><br/><p>Nancy\u2019s eyes flashed with helplessness and pain. Although his sister had the appearance of a woman, she thought of herself has a man! That was why for so many years, Princess Maurice had never fallen for any men. Only he knew this secret!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

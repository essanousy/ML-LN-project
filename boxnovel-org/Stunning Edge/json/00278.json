You still can\u2019t enter the ninth floor.\u201d However, the voice did not answer Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s question. Instead, it continued to persuade Qi Ao Shuang to leave.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang frowned and walked towards the entrance. However, an invisible force gently pushed her away, causing her to be unable to take even half a step forward.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang tried several times but the result was the same. He finally gave up on the idea of moving forward. Although the owner of this voice stopped him from moving forward, one thing was certain, this person didn\u2019t have any malice towards him. At this point, Xiao Ao Shuang understood and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Before he left, Xiao Ao Shuang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will naturally know in the future. You can go now.\u201d That clear voice rang out once more, but he still did not appear.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded, took out the scroll and tore it open. A white light flashed, and Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Ao Shuang left, a man dressed in white appeared on the spot. He stood there silently, his supple hair flying gently in the air, his delicate face carrying a hint of sadness. His eyes were closed, and he let out an almost inaudible sigh before disappearing immediately.</p><br/><p>By the time Qi Aushuang reached the outside of the Heavenly Pagoda, there was already a mentor waiting there to assist her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEight stars.\u201d The instructor reported Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s result in shock, and after saying that, he looked at her speechless for a long time. Freshman, this student is a Freshman. To think that he would be able to reach 8-star on his first attempt at participating in the Trial!</p><br/><p>After registering his information and receiving his Star Emblem, Xiao Ao Shuang turned around and left. She had been wondering in her heart who was the last person to hear this voice. Who exactly was that man?</p><br/><p>When Xiao Ao Shuang returned to her dorm room, she found that there was no one there. Clearly, Wynes was not back yet. This trial lasted for a full month, and after it was completed, he still had to participate in the competition. That was two months after the end of the exam. The reason for this arrangement was because some students would inevitably be injured during the exam. These two months were to allow the students ample time to prepare.</p><br/><p>During these three months of training and preparation time, there was no need to attend class. Naturally, the students who came out earlier would be more relaxed. Qi Ao Shuang spent the whole day in the library or cultivating alone in her dorm. Until he met Jonathan in the cafeteria at dinner one day.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang was alone in a corner eating a meal quietly, a tray placed in front of her. Qi Ao Shuang raised her head and saw the smiling Jonathan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d Jonathan sat opposite Qi Ao Shuang with a big grin on his face.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang remained silent, only taking a sip of the soup.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019m very curious. You seem to be fine after going to the ninth floor?\u201d Jonathan ate his food and stared at Qi Ao Shuang with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d No wonder. No wonder. It\u2019s not a place we can go now. \u201cLast time, I almost died standing at the entrance.\u201d Jonathan still had lingering fears on his face when he spoke, \u201cThe ninth and eighth level are two completely different things.\u201d \u201cEven though there is only a single level of difference, the difference is like the distance between heaven and earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was silent, listening to Jonathan\u2019s words with a complicated feeling in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, aren\u2019t you going to eat this?\u201d \u201cI like it, just give it to me!\u201d Jonathan\u2019s words flashed in front of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes. When she looked down, she saw that the ham on her plate was gone.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan speechlessly. Jonathan did not feel embarrassed at all. Instead, he was enjoying his meal.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are thick-skinned.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said exasperatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is called having good mental fortitude.\u201d Suddenly, he raised his head and looked towards the door, and a strange expression appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang turned around and looked at the direction Jonathan was looking. She was also stunned when she saw the person at the door. They all knew the person at the door. It was Lenny, but his face was covered by a veil. A person went to carry a meal in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso?\u201d Why is the hen wearing a veil today? Pretending to be mysterious? It\u2019s been hard for her not to bother Dittos since she came out of the Tower. \u201d Jonathan narrowed his eyes and frowned as he looked at Lenny, who was carrying food to a corner to eat, and said in a schadenfreude manner.</p><br/><p>Of course, she knew why Lenny wanted to cover his face. It seemed that the things that had entered her body that day were beginning to take effect. Lenny\u2019s face should be beginning to darken a little.</p><br/><p>Jonathan meant Cao Cao, Cao Cao Cao. Just as he finished speaking, Dotans appeared at the entrance of the cafeteria.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Dittos, this way.\u201d Jonathan waved at Dittos.</p><br/><p>Dittos glanced at them quietly, then walked straight towards them with the meal in his hands. Lenny, who was standing in the corner, looked at him with resentment. When he saw Jonathan\u2019s gloating sneer, he immediately lowered his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos, this way.\u201d \u201cHam, do you have any?\u201d Jonathan craned his neck to look at Dittos\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>Dittos sat down, set the plate down, and Jonathan\u2019s fork poked through it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Dotans and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Dittos, and he began to eat his meal in silence.</p><br/><p>Jonathan chewed his ham, blinked at the silent Dittos, then looked at the calm Xiao Aoshuang, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d Jonathan blinked, not understanding. He had never seen these two speak, nor had he seen them befriend each other. Why did it feel a little strange between the two of them?</p><br/><p>Jonathan asked, and neither of them answered. They ate in silence, and drank the soup.</p><br/><p>After dinner, Qi Ao Shuang was about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang, there\u2019s still two months until the competition. We don\u2019t have any classes these two months, how about we go out for a walk?\u201d Jonathan suddenly asked for a stay.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang replied faintly and was about to leave again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go together. I\u2019m going back to Nine Heavens City. All of you can come at once.\u201d At this time, Dittos gently put down his spoon and looked at Xiao Ao Shuang as he said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang only said one word.</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s eyes widened. He looked at Qi Ao Shuang, then he looked at Dittos. There was still no expression on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee you at the school gates tomorrow morning.\u201d Dittos said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d After replying to her words, Qi Ao Shuang left.</p><br/><p>Jonathan was still in shock as he watched Xiao Ao Shuang walk away. Then he looked at Dittos who stood up silently. The doubt in his heart was growing bigger and bigger.</p><br/><p>Dittos stood up and slowly walked towards the door. Jonathan hurriedly followed behind him like a noisy crow. He whined, \u201cHey, when did you two know each other?\u201d Since when did their friendship become so good? How could this be? Obviously, he and I are on better terms. Why did I invite him not to agree to my request, so you only need to say a word and he will agree to it? \u201cWhy is this so? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dittos ignored Jonathan, who was following him, and continued to walk in silence without any expression on his face. Dittos understood that it was due to his reminder that Qi Ao Shuang had passed the eighth level of the trial and was grateful to him that she agreed.</p><br/><p>The next morning, when Qi Ao Shuang arrived at the school gate, she found Dittos and Jonathan already waiting for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we were too early.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Dittos replied lightly.</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s jaw was almost dislocated. Blinking his eyes with all his might, he stared at the Dittas in front of him. Was he seeing things wrong? Did he hear wrong? How could Dittas be so polite to a man?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Dittos led the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded, following behind. Jonathan followed, full of questions.</p><br/><p>The three beauties continued to walk forward until they arrived in front of the gigantic lake. Then, they landed on the floating boulder. All three of them looked outstanding on the outside, and Dittos and Jonathan were well-known figures on campus. This made them even more eye-catching.</p><br/><p>When the three of them walked together, the turnaround rate was ridiculously high. Everyone was trying to guess who was the red-haired youth who was walking with Dickens and Jonathan. Why wasn\u2019t Lenny with them, but this strange red-haired handsome boy?</p><br/><p>The three of them walked down the long flight of stone steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos, this time I want to eat the one I ate last time, and \u2026\u201d Jonathan began to chatter.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Dittos remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Xiao Aushuang, let me tell you, the Dittens are very rich.\u201d \u201cHis sister is the wife of the Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord. Tsk, tsk, we\u2019re hugging our thighs, and we\u2019ll be in for a spicy meal following Dotans.\u201d Jonathan recounted Dittos\u2019s background.</p><br/><p>Oh, Dittos is the younger brother of the Nine Heavens City\u2019s Mayor\u2019s wife?</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Dittos spat out two words in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Jonathan stuck out his tongue. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cIs this because of the Four Seasons Garden\u2019s Tripod Assembly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another boring Tripod Gathering. It\u2019s just the time for every city to show off their skills.\u201d Jonathan shrugged helplessly. \u201cBut it\u2019s not surprising. If we don\u2019t, the balance between the four cities will be unthinkable once the situation breaks out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor balance?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang frowned and repeated Jonathan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s always like this in every big meeting. Talent competitions, treasure auctions, you can always show off your talents.\u201d Jonathan shrugged boringly.</p><br/><p>If all four cities participated, then Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao would also be here?</p><br/><p>\u201cWill it be held soon?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, three months later. When we finished the game. \u201cI\u2019m going back to prepare some things.\u201d At this moment, Dittos spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d After a grunt of agreement, Qi Ao Shuang went silent, thinking about how she could go to Heavenly Treasure City in three months to see if she could help Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao. Having not seen Ah\u2019Bao for so long, he missed her a lot.</p><br/><p>The three of them hired a carriage and drove to Nine Heavens City. Along the way, what Qi Ao Shuang saw was almost the same as the original world, except that there were many races in this world. Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Demons, and Monsters were all gathered together and were on good terms with each other. It was completely different from what the world had seen before. Moreover, everyone here was stronger than in the previous world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet Lenny the hen will come after us.\u201d Jonathan ate in the carriage and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you die if you don\u2019t speak?\u201d Dittos spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d If you don\u2019t let me talk, you\u2019re going to take my life! \u201d Jonathan swallowed the food in his mouth and spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>Dittos was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cLenny that hen is so strange. Why do I keep seeing her in the veils at school?\u201d Pretending to be mysterious? Not really. Everyone in the academy already knows what she looks like. \u201d Jonathan couldn\u2019t figure it out. He rubbed his chin and muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang closed her eyes and did not speak, she was clear what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that something happened to her face that she was so proud of, so she had to temporarily cover it up?\u201d Jonathan frowned, guessing.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you not be so gossipy?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang shook her head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d Did you forget what I said? \u2019 Jonathan chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang rolled her eyes and did not say anything. This gossipy old man was truly speechless.</p><br/><p>He walked very slowly because Jonathan was busy, so he either bought this or ate that.</p><br/><p>When the three of them finally arrived at the Nine Heavens City, it was already seven days later.</p><br/><p>The City Lord\u2019s Mansion of the Nine Heavens City was magnificent. Her sister Eliza, a gentle and beautiful woman, received the three of them in the small hall. When she saw Dittos, she was extremely happy and was very familiar with Jonathan. However, he was a little shocked when he saw Xiao Ao Shuang. Because Jonathan\u2019s words were Dittens\u2019s invitation for Qi Ao Shuang to come back.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang.\u201d \u201cMy sister, Eliza.\u201d Dittas gave a bland introduction to both sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang nodded politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, hello.\u201d Eliza seemed lost in thought. To her knowledge, Dittos was a cold child. Other than for her, she did not seem to have seen him take the initiative to know anyone and come into contact with them. However, the calm and composed youngster in front of him was actually an invitation from Dittens to come back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, by the way, Dittas, Lenny\u2019s back first. She lives next door to me. Eliza smiled at Dittos.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dittos gave a straightforward answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You didn\u2019t treat her before. Elisa was surprised and confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe favor is over.\u201d Ditto\u2019s tone was light.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Elisa was stunned: \u201cShe is sick. You should check it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d \u201cWhat disease?\u201d Jonathan took it, trying to suppress the schadenfreude in his brow, and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say. Something\u2019s wrong with her skin. As a girl, what she feared the most was her appearance problems. She was in a very low mood. Go and see her, maybe she\u2019ll feel better. I\u2019ve got a lot of doctors and priests working on her, but she\u2019s not getting any better. \u201d Elisa slightly frowned. It was obvious that she still cared about Lenny. After all, Lenny had risked his life to block the assassin\u2019s attack for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go, there\u2019s something else we need to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan stood up, said goodbye to Elisa and left with Dittos.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, this child is really something. I just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with Lenny.\u201d I\u2019ve always been so cold to her. \u201d Eliza shook her head and sighed.</p><br/><p>In the long corridor, the pillars made of white jade stood in a straight line, and the courtyard was filled with countless beautiful flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, the hen is sick, there really is a problem.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s still her skin. Let\u2019s see how she sees people now.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s eyes narrowed into a line. \u201cThis is great. She\u2019s down to seven stars, and she can\u2019t keep her looks anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Still Dittos was silent.</p><br/><p>Jonathan shook his head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang understood what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d Dittos spat out a sentence indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, you!\u201d \u201cYou really want to see her!\u201d Jonathan was hopping down the corridor like a monkey with its tail stepped on.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlways fooling around in front of my sister. \u201cSuch a woman \u2026\u201d Dittos did not finish his words, but his calm expression darkened.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Jonathan stopped talking and silently followed after Dittos. He knew that the tone of his voice meant that he was angry. If Lenny wasn\u2019t really sick, the consequences would be tragic.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked up to the sky and blinked her eyes. This time, Dittas had truly wronged Lenny. Indeed, Lenny was in trouble, and he was the one who did it. What would Dittos say if he saw anything?</p><br/><p>\u201cLenny didn\u2019t play tricks on me this time.\u201d Suddenly, Xiao Ao Shuang said something in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d Jonathan looked at Qi Ao Shuang in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>Dotans also stopped and turned to look at Xiao Ao Shuang. His face was calm as he asked indifferently, \u201cDid you do it?\u201d Although it was an inquiry, the tone was already certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cKa?\u201d Jonathan opened his mouth wide and looked at Qi Ao Shuang in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded, \u201cWhen we were at the swamp, she wanted to kill me with that Simi.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang did not panic or change her expression when she saw the frank and honest manner in which Dylan asked him. She only indifferently admitted that he did it himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what about Simi?\u201d \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d Jonathan was a curious baby.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him.\u201d I just got something in Lenny\u2019s body. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang told him honestly. In front of these two people, Qi Ao Shuang felt that she didn\u2019t need to worry about what she did to Lenny. These two people would never care about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, I like it.\u201d Jonathan laughed.</p><br/><p>Dittos immediately turned around and walked in the other direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to get Qi Ao Shuang caught, are you?\u201d Jonathan frowned.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

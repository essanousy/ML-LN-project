He forced himself up and got off the bed barefooted. However, he realized that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>Something felt wrong with his body \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stretched out her hand and looked down. Her hand seemed to have grown bigger. The moment he lowered his head, a strand of fiery red hair gently fell down. Qi Ao Shuang slowly picked up the strand of hair, her heart alarmed.</p><br/><p>This color was not the black he was familiar with!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly walked towards the only mirror in the room.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aushuang looked at the person in the mirror, she was shocked, and she quickly reached out her hand. The person in the mirror also extended his hand out.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang froze and slowly retracted her hand. The person in the mirror also retracted her hand with a face of astonishment.</p><br/><p>The person in the mirror had a head full of fiery red hair, but his hair was so smooth that it flowed straight down to his heels, falling down to the ground. It was extremely beautiful. There were two purple crystal earrings on the right ear! The peerless appearance of the person in the mirror, the pale complexion and the eyes as black as the night, all felt so familiar to Xiao Ao Shuang, making her heart ache.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan \u2026</p><br/><p>Why was the person in the mirror Feng Yixuan?!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly lowered her head and stretched out her hand, looking at it. He then looked down slowly \u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face was filled with shock as she confirmed that her body was the appearance of Feng Yi Xuan!</p><br/><p>Why did his body belong to Feng Yixuan?</p><br/><p>How could this be? Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind was in chaos.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang froze, standing in front of the mirror in a daze, looking at the familiar face that did not belong to her. His mind was filled with countless thoughts, and he was even more puzzled. What was going on?</p><br/><p>At this time, there was a slight sound from the door and it was gently pushed open. He revealed a face that Xiao Ao Shuang had seen before.</p><br/><p>Heaven Breaker! This unfathomable person whom they had first met in the chaosworld was Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s master.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow!\u201d A round, furry head poked out of Heaven Breaker\u2019s head, waving its claws at Ao Shuang as if in greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2019Bao \u2026\u201d Heaven Breaker \u2026. As soon as Qi Ao Shuang opened her mouth, she was stunned. This was because this voice belonged to Feng Yi Xuan. Qi Ao Shuang reached out her hand and gently touched her throat with a strange expression on her face. No one could immediately accept and adapt to such a mutation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d Heaven Breaker smiled and walked over. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow!\u201d The Chasing Precious Cat let out a cry and leapt from Heaven Breaker\u2019s head to Xiao Aoshuang\u2019s shoulder, squatting down and then rubbing itself against Qi Aoshuang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, but \u2026\u201d Xiao Aushuang frowned, still not used to it, \u201cThis, what is going on?\u201d Why am I here? Where were Yi Xuan and Ling Yun? Camille? \u201cHow are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, why aren\u2019t you worried about yourself?\u201d Heaven Breaker replied with a faint smile, sitting down on the sofa. Of course he knew what Xiao Ao Shuang was talking about. However, he didn\u2019t immediately answer. Instead, he asked with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. Then he frowned at the red hair hanging down over his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should be fine by now.\u201d \u201cYou can rest assured that they won\u2019t be in any danger.\u201d Heaven Breaker didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush either, because the Maneki-Neko perched on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder waved its paws at him, threatening him. If he didn\u2019t hurry up and explain to her, he would just wait on her.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for the stunned Qi Ao Shuang to speak, Heaven Breaker quickly brought everything together. \u201cAt that time, the original owner of your body was about to die. Ah\u2019Bao activated the secret technique in her body to get me to help you.\u201d But even I don\u2019t have the power to get a dying person to respond. The man in white can save him, but he will only save you. So I reached a consensus with the silver-haired man, who volunteered to be the medium for the exchange of souls between you two. He forced the man in white to make a move. \u201cIt\u2019s not a method, but it seems to be very useful in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Heaven Breaker finished his words, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face turned deathly pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what about Lingyun?\u201d Where\u2019s Lingyun? Could it be that he \u2026 Qi Ao Shuang was extremely shocked, and her heart was flustered. According to Heaven Breaker\u2019s deduction, Camil would definitely save him. But what about Leng Lingyun, who had volunteered to become the medium?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous, I said, they\u2019re fine.\u201d This naturally includes the Ling Yun that you spoke of. \u201d Heaven Breaker comforted her with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face relaxed a little, \u201cThen, then what about them \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the question you\u2019re facing now.\u201d Heaven Breaker sighed softly. \u201cIf you want to find them, you\u2019ll have to put in an unimaginable effort.\u201d Your current body can no longer use the magic that you were most familiar with, right? Even his dou qi is gone, right? \u201d A strange light flashed across Heaven Breaker\u2019s eyes. Most importantly, this body was that of a man. Qi Ao Shuang was a woman. The situation now looked strange. A woman\u2019s soul was in a man\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. She flicked her finger, but a small fireball did not appear between her fingers like before. His body felt empty, and he could not feel the existence of the fire element at all. His dou qi seemed to have vanished as well!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face slightly changed, she became silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must first familiarize yourself with this body, and then familiarize yourself with the properties of this body. Within your body, the soul of that person has been taken away by that man in white. And the silver-haired man, by becoming the medium of your soul\u2019s exchange, is in a space that has ceased to exist. \u201cWhen you find your own body and ask for it back, the silver-haired man will awaken from that place.\u201d Heaven Breaker solemnly explained.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was silent. Her face was calm, and people couldn\u2019t tell what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did my body go to?\u201d After a while, Xiao Ao Shuang slowly asked. In her mind, Leng Lingyun\u2019s last words echoed. Then, Ao Shuang, we will wait for you. Feng Yi Xuan and I will wait for you. Now he finally understood the meaning of this sentence.</p><br/><p>So it was like this?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly clenched her fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour body, the man in white said before he left that he would bring your body to shatter the void. I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the very edge of there. \u201d Heaven Breaker\u2019s expression changed when he heard the words \u201cSpace Break\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak through the void?\u201d \u201cWhat is that place?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang had never heard of this name before, she frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a chaosworld.\u201d And the Space Shattering was a plane above this plane. \u201cDangerous, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to go into details.\u201d There was a hint of worry in Heaven Breaker\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for saving me, thank you and Ah\u2019Bao for doing this for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me.\u201d You are not in good shape today. There is only one way to shatter the void, and that is to pass the Star Tower\u2019s Star Trial. Heaven Breaker sighed softly as he recounted everything that had happened to Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>There were many sects in the chaosworld as well, and many disciples. And the Heavenly Star Pagoda would open the Stellar Trial once every ten years. Those who passed this trial would be allowed to enter the Stellar Heavenly Pagoda to cultivate. The Sky Tower had a total of nine floors. One could not see the end with a single glance, and just passing the top floor would allow one to enter the Space Shattering Realm. However, the Star Heavenly Pagoda\u2019s survival training was only open to the students of the Star Academy. The requirements for the Star Academy to accept students were even more stringent.</p><br/><p>In other words, in order to enter the Star Academy and participate in the Star Trial, one must first join a sect. Of course, joining a sect was far from enough. He had to become one of the best in the school, and only then would he be eligible to participate in the school\u2019s survival training.</p><br/><p>After listening to all this, Xiao Ao Shuang went silent and slowly walked to the bed and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to enter a sect. You don\u2019t have to worry about that. I will let Altis recruit you into his sect, and he will also recommend you to participate in the school\u2019s assessment. \u201cBut now, you \u2026\u201d Heaven Breaker\u2019s face darkened. He didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang suddenly understood what Heaven Breaker meant. Right now, she could no longer use Fire Magic, nor could she use the Lotus Mirror. How would he participate in the school\u2019s assessment?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that.\u201d \u201cThank you for all you\u2019ve done for me. Thank you so much.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang thanked Heaven Breaker sincerely. Heaven Breaker didn\u2019t have any relationship with her, yet he spared no effort in helping her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, hur hur. Speaking of which, the one who should be thanking is me.\u201d Heaven Breaker actually said something like that that, which caused Qi Ao Shuang to be at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow, meow!\u201d The Maneki-Neko hopped onto Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head and used its paws to scratch Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hair. After that, she tried hard to use her claws to gesture, mewing while saying words that Xiao Ao Shuang did not understand. However, the gratitude in her voice was clear to her.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang was even more puzzled, why did Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao have to thank her?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause Ah\u2019Bao is by your side, and as expected, he managed to resolve the evil Qi in her body.\u201d Heaven Breaker stood up with a smile and walked over to pick up Po from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head. \u201cAlright, Ah\u2019Bao, stop messing around with other people\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaleful aura?\u201d Suddenly, she remembered the time when Ah\u2019Bao suddenly transformed and how Camil explained it to her. He suddenly came to a realization. Could it be that during the time Ah\u2019Bao stayed in her body, she unwittingly helped Ah\u2019Bao to resolve the baleful aura?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s life was very pitiful, very miserable. Those things caused her to accumulate killing intent. It had always been an unstable factor, and could even cause death. Later on, when I met you and was with you, the infernal energy was indeed completely dispelled by you. \u201cAh\u2019Bao won\u2019t be in any danger.\u201d Heaven Breaker stroked Po\u2019s head, his eyes filled with doting affection. \u201cSuch a favor, I don\u2019t know how to thank you for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow, meow ~ ~\u201d Ah\u2019Bao squinted his eyes as he rubbed his hand against Heaven Breaker\u2019s, appearing very satisfied.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. She saw a familiar look in Heaven Breaker\u2019s eyes. Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun only looked at her with those eyes.</p><br/><p>In that case, Heaven Breaker versus Ah\u2019Bao \u2026</p><br/><p>Ah\u2019Bao was everything that broke the heavens. So that\u2019s how it was \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you can\u2019t use your previous magic right now, you can slowly familiarize yourself with this body. I can\u2019t figure out the potential of this body. Wind magic should be relatively easy to master, and your spiritual force is extraordinary. This shouldn\u2019t be a problem. \u201cAs for the power hidden in this body, I can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d Heaven Breaker lifted his head and spoke solemnly to Qi Ao Shuang. \u201cThe identity of this body should be that of a demon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Qi Ao Shuang understood what the hidden power of the Heaven Breaking Finger was. This was the power possessed by the demons of Feng Yixuan\u2019s true identity. However, Blackplume had once said that there were all sorts of races in this chaosworld. Her current status as a demon was nothing surprising.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Heaven Breaker gave her a general overview of the situation in this world and prepared a lot of necessities for her. He then urged her to hurry up and cultivate in seclusion. Qi Ao Shuang readily agreed, she had the same intention.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one month left before Star Academy\u2019s assessment. You only have one month to adapt to this body and use magic to pass the Star Academy\u2019s assessment. I\u2019ll have Artis do everything for you. \u201cYou can go into closed door cultivation for this month.\u201d Heaven Breaker brought Qi Ao Shuang to the secret chamber and spoke these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled, then with a calm expression, she stepped into the secret room.</p><br/><p>A month?</p><br/><p>Only a month.</p><br/><p>Although that body was not his, Elder Tiangang\u2019s teachings from back then were still vivid in his mind.</p><br/><p>Star Trial\u2026</p><br/><p>Broken Space \u2026</p><br/><p>Yi Xuan, Ling Yun, wait for me.</p><br/><p>I will come!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes flashed with determination.</p><br/><p>But he was confident!</p><br/><p>\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p><br/><p>A month passed with a flick of a finger. After a month of closed door cultivation, no one knew what the results would be. Heaven Breaker introduced himself to Artis for Qi Aoshuang, and without any hesitation, Artis agreed without any hesitation. The friendship between the two was admirable.</p><br/><p>And in the blink of an eye, it was already the entrance examination for Star Academy.</p><br/><p>All of the major sects of the chaosworld had selected their best disciples to participate.</p><br/><p>Artis\u2019 Tian Dao Sect had a total of thirteen people elected. Originally, twelve people had been elected by Grand Elder Artis, so there was one more. To put it bluntly, he had forcefully arranged for a person to intervene. And this person was the disciple that he had just accepted.</p><br/><p>Following the other disciples of the Tian Dao Sect, Qi Ao Shuang was sent to the foot of the mountain of the Star Academy. This academy was not located in a bustling city, but rather in a quiet mountain range.</p><br/><p>The top of the mountain was always surrounded by a white mist, and it would not disperse even after a long time. At the top of the mountain, the Heavenly Star Tower could not even see its head at all.</p><br/><p>The Great Elder, Artis, was nowhere in sight all day long. He had no business to attend to, but he held quite a high position in the sect. This time, they forcefully accepted a disciple of unknown origin and immediately and vigorously chose to participate in the exam. Naturally, this caused some people to be dissatisfied. Including the other disciples who had come to participate. Although no one dared to have any objections, this was all in secret \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

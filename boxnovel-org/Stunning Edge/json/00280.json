So happy, so happy.</p><br/><p>Lani\u2019s breathing became hurried. The excitement and joy in his heart could no longer be described with words.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lenny remembered the condition of his body and started to worry again. If Dittos knew that his skin was beginning to turn black and that his beauty was gone, would he just ignore him?</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered the restaurant, a waiter came up and led them upstairs. The waiter was warm and respectful to Dittos. Clearly, he knew Dittas, and Dittas\u2019s position was not low either.</p><br/><p>Many of the young ladies in the restaurant looked at the three outstanding youths, but none of them dared to approach them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTut, can you two put a softer expression on your faces?\u201d \u201cWho would dare talk to you beauties like this?\u201d Jonathan bared his teeth and smiled brightly at the girls. Some of the girls immediately blushed, their hearts beating fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not even bother to repeat herself, instead, she just spat out a single word.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, not interesting, two pieces of wood, two pieces of ice.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see which woman will like you two in the future. Serves you right. You won\u2019t have a wife in the future.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s mouth twitched in speechlessness. Suddenly, he understood the reason behind the subtle relationship between these two people. In some ways, the two men were remarkably alike.</p><br/><p>After eating together, the three of them went back to the Mayor\u2019s mansion. Dittos arranged for two people to live in his own yard, next door.</p><br/><p>The sun and moon moved, and the night quietly approached.</p><br/><p>Jonathan yawned and knocked on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s door, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened, and Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan, who was still yawning, and frowned. \u201cWhere is the Dittos?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to take care of first. I want us to go wait for him at the Gargle Cliff in the half of the forest.\u201d Jonathan yawned impatiently. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s up to, mysterious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang remained silent, a serious look appearing in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go. I don\u2019t know the way, so bring me there.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, let\u2019s go. That guy told us to secretly leave. Come with me.\u201d Jonathan seemed to be very familiar with the layout of Nine Heavens City\u2019s mansions. He quietly left the city with Qi Ao Shuang and headed towards the city wall. He secretly passed through the city wall and left the city.</p><br/><p>After leaving the city, Jonathan brought Qi Ao Shuang to the south.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf of the forest is relatively desolate. Because there are some dangerous magical beasts and plants, ordinary people wouldn\u2019t go there. I don\u2019t know what Dittos is up to. \u201d Although Jonathan complained, he still listened to Dittas\u2019 instructions and quickly ran in the direction that Qi Ao Shuang pointed out.</p><br/><p>The two of them moved quickly, and before long, they had arrived at the place that Dittas had mentioned. As soon as he entered the forest, he was greeted by a wave of cold air. Occasionally, there would be strange bird cries. When he got to the edge of the cliff, Jonathan stood on the edge and looked down, shivering. Under the hazy moonlight, the bottom of the cliff could not be seen. Waves of cold wind blew over, making people feel very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Dickens thinking?\u201d Tell us to come to such a gloomy place in the middle of the night. \u201d Jonathan turned around, found a big rock, sat behind the rock, and called to Qi Ao Shuang. \u201cCome here, sit here.\u201d Blocking the wind. Just wait for him here. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked around but did not say anything. She sat beside Jonathan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think Dickens called us here for?\u201d Jonathan blinked his eyes and looked at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang shook her head lightly, but in her heart, there was a strange and indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>After a while, a voice came from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d Jonathan was about to get up and see if Dittos had arrived when he heard a voice that made him sick.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you call me here for, Dittos?\u201d This voice was Lenny!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan looked at each other and saw the doubt in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Dittens\u2019s deep voice rang out, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be alone with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how could I not?!\u201d Lenny\u2019s voice rang urgently.</p><br/><p>Jonathan rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang had an ominous feeling in her heart. Though he had not been with Dittas very long, he had some knowledge of his character. Dittos would not have said such a thing, for he had never put Lenny in his eyes.</p><br/><p>But what did he mean by that now?</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve always liked me.\u201d There was no ripple in Dittos\u2019s voice, as if he were stating something that had nothing to do with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittas, you, you, you finally understand my heart?\u201d Lenny\u2019s voice was filled with excitement that could not be hidden.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I always did.\u201d \u201cIf you like me, I\u2019ll call it that. It doesn\u2019t matter if you use some tricks on my sister, but you should never play any tricks on Keira.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDi, Dittas, you, what did you say?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Lenny\u2019s voice was a little frantic.</p><br/><p>Jonathan narrowed his eyes, grinning silently. He did not even need to look to know that Lenny\u2019s expression was wonderful. It would definitely be ugly to death, how wonderful.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang furrowed her brows, the strange feeling in her heart getting stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeira\u2019s character really still has to be tempered. But if he continues to be misled by you, he will never grow up right. He wouldn\u2019t be able to become a qualified mayor in the future. But it doesn\u2019t matter to me what happens to him. \u201d Dittos\u2019 voice was like an old, silent well, calm and cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittas, Dittas, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d Lenny\u2019s voice became more and more frantic, the black face under the veil faintly revealing traces of red. The fear and panic in her were growing stronger. Originally, he thought that Dotans had asked him to come here with him to spy on him, and thought that Dotans had already understood his intentions, so he thought that he would have a response tonight. But that does not seem to be the case now. Could it be that she had called him here to criticize him?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what happens to him. I don\u2019t care whether he lives or dies.\u201d However, if anything happens to him, my sister will be very sad. So, I don\u2019t want to see my sister upset. \u201d Dittos turned and looked at Lenny coldly.</p><br/><p>Lenny was somewhat flabbergasted. Did he care about Keira\u2019s life or death? The boy was his nephew! Did Dittos only care about his sister? Why, because Dittas was raised by his sister? But why did it feel so strange and a little panicked? Why did Dittens speak of Keira as if he had nothing to do with it?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even incite Keira to embarrass Qi Ao Shuang today, right?\u201d It seemed like he was asking something, but he was already sure of it.</p><br/><p>Lenny was dumbstruck, wanting to argue for himself, he moved his lips, but he could not say anything. She knew Dittas\u2019s character, and if he had decided something, it would be useless to argue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026\u201d Dittos slowly approached Lenny, his face calm.</p><br/><p>Lenny stared at Dittas in a daze, but he was a little afraid. Unconsciously, he retreated backwards as Dittos closed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d A hint of a smile suddenly appeared on Dylan\u2019s face. This smile was enough to shock a person\u2019s soul. Lani was completely stunned, and he lost his mind at this moment.</p><br/><p>Lenny, as if possessed, stood obediently where he was and did not move again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLenny, do you really like me that much?\u201d \u201cIs it the most sincere to my heart?\u201d A devilish smile appeared on Dittas\u2019s calm face. There was a bitter coldness in his smile that Lenny could not feel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Dittos, you finally understand my sincerity to you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been bitterly following by your side all this time, paying so much for you because I want you to look back at me, to have me in your eyes, and to have me in your heart.\u201d Lani was excited, but also happy. Was it possible that he had finally figured it out and was finally going to face it? So happy, so happy. Lani\u2019s breathing became hurried. The excitement and joy in his heart could no longer be described with words. Suddenly, Lenny remembered the condition of his body and started to worry again. If Dittos knew that his skin was beginning to turn black and that his beauty was gone, would he just ignore him?</p><br/><p>Dittos slowly approached Lenny and stood in front of her, smiling without saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Dittos, I, I was really happy today. I feel really happy. \u201d Lani clutched at his chest, a blissful smile on his face. He made up his mind in his heart to find a name to cure his illness as soon as possible. If not, everything would have vanished into thin air when Dittas saw his true face.</p><br/><p>Jonathan clenched his fist behind the rock and thrust it into his mouth. His eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at Qi Ao Shuang. Was there a mistake?! Dittos called them over just to see them kiss me? To see him accept Lenny\u2019s dead hen? Now the dead hen was dead, and the wish of many years had finally come true.</p><br/><p>How infuriating! How infuriating! Jonathan put down his fist, opened his mouth and repeated the word silently. Xiao Aushuang naturally knew what he was talking about from the way he mouthed it.</p><br/><p>Had Dittas really only asked them to come here so that they could see how he accepted Lenny\u2019s intentions?</p><br/><p>The strange feeling that had been haunting Qi Ao Shuang was becoming more and more obvious.</p><br/><p>What do you want, Dittas? He was not here to make love to Lenny, as Jonathan had guessed. What did he want?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see your sincerity.\u201d The corner of his mouth curled up as he said those words with a smile. Lani was so happy that he was about to faint. After all these years of hard work, he finally had a reward. The Dittos who had been deeply in love finally accepted him! \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 Lenny was about to reach out and hug Ditto, but.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Lani, who was immersed in happiness, was stunned, and her chest turned cold. He lowered his head to look at the item in his hand. It was red and seemed to be still pulsing \u2026</p><br/><p>Then, what was it?</p><br/><p>Heart! That was his heart!</p><br/><p>Lenny\u2019s eyes widened, and his pupils contracted in a split-second.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve forgotten to tell you.\u201d \u201cLove, I don\u2019t need such a boring thing.\u201d He threw the heart in his hand to the back of his body. With a little bit of blood on his heart, he drew a devilish arc in the air and fell into the bottomless abyss, disappearing without a trace.</p><br/><p>Lenny\u2019s face was full of terror, incredulous. His eyes were wide open as he stared at Dittas, as if he wanted to see this man clearly at the end of his life. The man he had always loved. He had actually killed her without any forewarning at all \u2026</p><br/><p>With a \u201cBang!\u201d, Lenny\u2019s body fell heavily on the ground, stirring up waves of dust.</p><br/><p>Dittos looked at the corpse on the ground indifferently, without any expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Dittos, haha, you really did it. \u201cYou really killed this woman?\u201d Jonathan jumped out from behind the rocks, excited. You don\u2019t know, she\u2019s done too much dirty work behind your back. She had always been acting haughty, but now she was secretly looking for those men to coerce and coerce her. \u201cVicious woman, you\u2019re dead today. Retribution.\u201d The more Jonathan spoke, the more disdainful he became. He looked at Lenny\u2019s corpse on the floor and almost vomited water. It was no wonder that he had such an attitude. On the surface, the two of them had been at loggerheads the entire time. Lenny didn\u2019t want Jonathan\u2019s life for a day or two.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang also slowly stood up from behind the rock. She looked at Lenny, who was lying on the ground, and did not say anything. Although Lenny wanted to kill him, he didn\u2019t plan on letting Lenny go either. However, Xiao Ao Shuang did not expect that the one who had ended Lenny\u2019s life would be Dittas.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill her before because I didn\u2019t repay my debt. It\u2019s all over now. \u201d \u201cSo there\u2019s no need to put up with her now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang raised her head and looked at the calm Duttens, looking at his cold eyes. Qi Ao Shuang felt an indescribable chill in her heart.</p><br/><p>If Lenny had died in his own hands, or in Jonathan\u2019s, it would not have felt that way. However, she had died at the hands of the man she had always loved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThrow it down.\u201d Dittos said coldly to Jonathan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Jonathan knelt down and pulled Lenny\u2019s corpse which had turned cold. Then, he threw Lenny\u2019s corpse off the cliff. In mid-air, the wind blew past, revealing Lenny\u2019s face, which had already turned slightly black.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang stood at the side without saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d Dittos spat out a sentence indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Jonathan squinted his eyes with a smile and jumped ahead first. \u201cI\u2019ll go back first. I\u2019m so excited that I can\u2019t fall asleep tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jonathan hopped away, Dittos and Qi Ao Shuang trailing behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why I called you here?\u201d With a calm expression on his face, Dittos asked this question.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang remained silent and did not reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall Jonathan because he has a grudge against Laney. \u201cI called you here for another purpose, do you understand?\u201d Dittos asked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything. Dittos did not say anything either, silently waiting for Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to tell me that the path to the strong cannot be tied down by love.\u201d After a long while, Qi Ao Shuang finally said those words in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, in this world, you are the only one who knows my heart.\u201d Dittos turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang and smiled.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at the smile on his face, and an indescribable coldness arose in her heart.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he remembered what Vast Sky had said. This man was very dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that you can step into the Void Shattering Realm with me.\u201d Looking at Xiao Ao Shuang, Ditty said seriously, \u201cYou are the only one who can do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked at the handsome but indifferent face of Dittas and was speechless for a long time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

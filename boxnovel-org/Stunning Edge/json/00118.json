Sitting across from her, Walter was completely drenched. Next to him, Summer and Qiao Chuxin were also sprayed a little. Walter turned gloomy but didn\u2019t dare to retort.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn brat, what\u2019s with that attitude?\u201d Seeing what Claire had done, Li Yuewen turned crazy, about to attack Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, my bad, my bad alright? Great beauty cousin Yuewen\u2026.\u201d Claire begged for mercy while laughing. \u201cThen, great beauty cousin Yuewen, are you going that day too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Li Yuewen humphed coldly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have money to donate, in any case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Nowadays, out of the three great beauties, Shui Xinmei has already been married into the Feng clan whereas your cousin, Yuewen, rarely appears in public, so currently, Hua Xiuning is taking the spotlight,\u201d Li Mingyu said with a low voice, his gaze complex.</p><br/><p>Claire understood Li Mingyu\u2019s feelings. The Li clan was declining every day, its glory gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHua Xiuning has the spotlight?\u201d Claire stroked her chin, deep in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Think about it. That day, that woman will take the spotlight again, meaning the Hua clan will also take the spotlight.\u201d Li Yuewen humphed coldly. The Hua clan and Li clan had always been rivals. Just thinking about it made Li Yuewen unpleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin Yuewen, don\u2019t be so angry.\u201d Claire laughed, her eyes turning to slits.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn brat, what you thinking? How am I angry?\u201d Li Yuewen grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of\u2026\u201d A strange smile appeared at her lips. \u201cTaking the spotlight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake the spotlight? How?\u201d Li Yuewen looked at Claire, baffled.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin Yuewen, you will attend the convention this time and not only that, you will bring someone with you! We also need to bring outstanding treasure,\u201d Claire said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring someone? And since when did we have any treasure?\u201d Li Yuewen looked at Claire with confusion, not understanding what exactly Claire was planning.</p><br/><p>A sly smile appeared at her lips. Claire turned to the currently eating happily Dong Fenghou and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think Dong Fenghou is pretty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody\u2019s gazes were drawn toe Dong Fenghou. Dong Fenghou currently had no class at all, currently stuffing his mouth with food, his mouth wide open. Dong Fenghou was enchantingly beautiful, but currently, he had no connection with beauty. Crumbs at the corners of his mouth, oil all over his hands! Dong Fenghou suddenly sensed that something was off, looking up to see that everybody\u2019s gaze was directed at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dong Fenghou mumbled. Although he was slow, he was still able to sense that there was something unusual with Claire\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s too stupid and his words are unclear. Even if he was disguised as a beauty, he wouldn\u2019t be able to act as one.\u201d Camille saw through Claire\u2019s plan and refuted it.</p><br/><p>Ah?! Everybody suddenly understood what exactly Claire was planning on doing. If Dong Fenghou was dressed as a girl then he would be devastatingly beautiful! Saying that thousands would fall for him wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration. If he appeared in the convention like that, then he would definitely attract everybody\u2019s gaze. But Dong Fenghou only knew how to eat. What else could he do? Everything would be ruined the moment he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Claire stroked her chin, nodding a bit unwillingly. She almost forgot that the charming, devastatingly beautiful youth was like a pig. There was no way he could attend!</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s gaze shifted to Summer and Qiao Chuxin, but rejected the idea. These two little girls, their appearances were both delicate and innocent, not capable of seducing anyone. Walter? Leng Lingyun? Jean? Claire automatically rejected them all. These people would prefer dying before crossdressing.*TL: nuuuu</p><br/><p>Then what should they do? Claire was conflicted. The best candidate, Dong Fenghou, wouldn\u2019t work. Then who else would work?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to find someone even more beautiful than Huo Xiuning? That won\u2019t be easy. Huo Xiuning is truly beautiful.\u201d Li Yuewen walked through the loopholes of Claire\u2019s plan. \u201cHua Xiuning has a very high goal. She has always been aiming for the crown prince in order to become the crown princess and in the future, the empress, so she\u2019s always been searching for chances to meet the crown prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she hasn\u2019t succeeded?\u201d Claire smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Li Yuewen asked, a bit surprised. \u201cThe crown prince has never declared anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she succeeded, then you wouldn\u2019t have such a tone,\u201d Claire teased, raising a brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn brat, you dare to mess around with me?\u201d Li Yuewen was finally able to sense the hidden meaning of Claire\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, there is a suitable candidate.\u201d Camille stared at Claire, smiling.</p><br/><p>Everybody else\u2019s gaze shifted to Claire. Claire frowned, a bit displeased. \u201cReally now, do you really think my petite frame can beat those seductive and mature women?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeauty potion,\u201d Leng Lingyun suddenly said, then continued on eating breakfast with his head down low. Everybody looked at him. His facial expression didn\u2019t change, completely calm and tranquil as he drank juice, as if the person who just spoke wasn\u2019t him.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, beauty potion. Heh heh, Claire, even with your petite frame, you can become a curvy beauty\u2026 ahhh!\u201d Before Walter finished his words, he had already fallen out of his chair, crying out miserably. Claire threw a piece of bread at him, but it wasn\u2019t as simple as that; she even used a bit of Dou Qi. How could a weak Dark magician contend with such strength? And so he tumbled brilliantly onto the ground with this blow.</p><br/><p>Claire sent a murderous gaze, as if saying \u2018serves you right. But when she turned, she saw everybody eyeing her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, don\u2019t even think about it. I won\u2019t agree.\u201d Claire stood up, about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on Claire~~ Are you just going to cold-heartedly watch are Li clan fall? Are you going to just watch on as your mother\u2019s relatives are in dire straits?\u201d Li Yuewen pulled Claire by the arm, her tone almost sickeningly gentle. She gazed profoundly at Claire, eyes glittering.</p><br/><p>Claire felt goosebumps rise. She pulled back her arm, her lips trembling in disgust. \u201cElder cousin Yuewen, has anyone ever told you that that tone and gaze does not suit you at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for a beating!\u201d Li Yuewen immediately turned to back true self, becoming angry.</p><br/><p>Claire sat down and continued \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about this for now. First, let\u2019s settle the matter of treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would we have treasure?\u201d Li Yuewen frowned. The only things they had of worth were the magic beast cores that Claire had given, but she had been planning on selling them to repair the main hall Claire had wrecked and save the rest for later.</p><br/><p>\u201cBen.\u201d Suddenly, Claire called out Ben\u2019s name, who had had been sitting quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben asked blankly, looking up at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t all dragons love treasure?\u201d Claire asked Ben. Although she was asking, her tone was not so much as questioning as resolute.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ben denied immediately, but the flicker in his eyes gave him away.</p><br/><p>This kid! Claire bit her lip. It seems he had learned quite a bit from her, but not enough. When he lied, his gaze flickered. She had heard long ago that dragons had such a hobby, collecting treasures, all rare and valuable. It seems it was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t? As the venerable prince of dragons, you don\u2019t even have a decent treasure trove?\u201d Claire sighed, her tone pitiful. \u201cYour life sure has been tragic. You must be the poorest of all dragons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else kept quiet. Li Yuewen stared rigidly at Claire. Would anyone fall for such simple goading? Impossible?!</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! My treasures are the most valuable of all!\u201d Ben yelled, standing up emotionally.</p><br/><p>After he said this, the dining room fell silent. They all stared at Ben. Li Yuewen\u2019s jaw dropped to the ground, staring incredulously at Ben. It couldn\u2019t be? Someone would actually fall for such simple goading?! This stupid dragon!</p><br/><p>Summer shrugged, as if this was to be expected. This uncultured dragon, not only was he rude, he was stupid to the point of insanity. So this was completely expected.</p><br/><p>Ben noticed the crafty glint in Claire\u2019s eyes and suddenly felt an urge to cry. Claire, that fellow, truly was the craftiest. Like Walter said, how could she be human? She was a little devil? His treasure, all of his treasure! He couldn\u2019t let them all land in her hands!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that getting a few is enough.\u201d Claire\u2019s next words shattered Ben\u2019s hope. \u201cWhat do you need treasure more? You can\u2019t eat it and it can\u2019t bring you joy, status, increase your strength or fulfill your wishes. Ben, just listen to me, they\u2019re worth as much as clouds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben turned glum. He knew all that, but gathering treasure was a dragon\u2019s second nature, yet she wanted to rob him of all the treasure he had spent his life on gathering with just one sentence! But in his heart, Ben made a decision. Yes, just as Claire said, the treasure couldn\u2019t benefit him. But when the days he had spent with Claire, he had experienced everything. The feeling he had with Claire and everybody was very good, very warm. And when he was protecting someone else, he also felt a sense of satisfaction. He had never known the helping someone would bring such happiness. When Claire was blocking before him, he discovered that the feeling of being cared by others was so warm, so moving. He had never experienced these before. He hoped such feelings would continue forever. Plus, he had a strange feeling towards the skimpy little thief girl. Every time he saw her, he wanted to tease her. What was this feeling?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s settled. We\u2019ll wait for you to come back with all your treasure,\u201d Claire smiled widely, sealing the deal. How could she know Ben\u2019s feelings right now? She was focused on extortion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

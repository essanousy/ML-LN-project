Jin Yan slowly raised his head to look at the starry sky before letting out a long sigh. I hope everything will be all right. If Camille is here, he\u2019ll have a way.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a melodious voice drifted over from the distance. \u201cThe sea breeze blows, the sea breeze blows. Who are you missing \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh!\u201d \u201cElder Brother Jin Yan, they\u2019re from the Sea race. Why are they singing at this time?\u201d As soon as Lily heard the melodious song, her spirits lifted, she turned to look at the sea, wanting to see where the singers were, but seeing only the vast sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song \u2026\u201d Jin Yan frowned slightly as he thought about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song is free of joy or sorrow. Seafolk usually don\u2019t appear.\u201d And they don\u2019t sing easily. \u201cTheir songs can temporarily make people forget all their worries and joy, making people, how should they put it, feel like they can return to their most primitive state.\u201d Lili pricked up her ears and listened, her eyes gradually becoming misty. She muttered softly, \u201cElder brother Jin Yan, I seem to have seen my mother \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLily!\u201d To Jin Yan\u2019s surprise, he discovered that his mind was in a trance as he hurriedly cried out in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no, no!\u201d Lily shook her head vigorously, then patted her chest with lingering fear, \u201cThose with a deep past cannot listen.\u201d \u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Lily finished speaking, Jin Yan\u2019s expression changed as he dashed into the castle. He suddenly had a bad feeling about this. When Lily saw him, she hurriedly followed him and worriedly called out from behind, \u201cBrother Jin Yan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan didn\u2019t have the time to reply to her. Instead, he quickened his pace towards the bedroom where Qi Aushuang was resting.</p><br/><p>Just as he stepped into the corridor, a terrifying wave of cold air hit him, causing him to shiver uncontrollably. The source of the cold energy was from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s bedroom. Jin Yan sprinted forward. The door was open, but when he stood at the entrance and looked inside, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>The room was frozen everywhere, the room shimmered with cold, the floor was thick with ice, and the ceiling was a jagged icicle. The temperature in the room was terrifyingly cold. Feng Yixuan\u2019s face turned green from the cold, but he stubbornly stood beside the bed. On the bed, Qi Ao Shuang laid there quietly. However, the skin on his face and body was so white that it was almost transparent. She was surrounded by a thick layer of ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jin Yan stepped into the room as a heart wrenching chill entered from the bottom of his foot, chilling his heart. This was absolutely the kind of pain and suffering an ordinary person could endure. Jin Yan\u2019s expression instantly changed to the side. He turned his head and shouted to Lily who was just about to follow him in, \u201cDon\u2019t come in, just stand there!\u201d Stunned, Lily stopped and stood obediently by the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Feng, what \u2026 what is going on?\u201d Even Jin Yan felt that his tongue was a little disobedient. The clothes on his body actually began to make a slight crashing sound as the clothes slowly started to freeze!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Even Feng Yixuan\u2019s neck was stiff from the cold. He couldn\u2019t even move his head when he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2019s physique is of the fire attribute, how can this be?\u201d Jin Yan asked with a frown. His heart, however, was filled with incomparable worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d \u201cAchoo!\u201d A small, immature voice suddenly sounded in the room, and then Liu-Li appeared. With one hand, she tugged at the foot of the unconscious Golden Lotus. Without another word, he dragged Red Lotus out of the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu-Li!\u201d Feng Yixuan and Jin Yan exclaimed at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo, Achoo ~\u201d Liu Li constantly sneezed. She didn\u2019t immediately pay attention to the two and dragged Golden Lotus out of the room. Only then did she turn her head and say to Feng Yi Xuan and Jin Yan, \u201cGranny\u2019s body suddenly feels very cold. It\u2019s completely different from before.\u201d \u201cThe golden lotuses can\u2019t take it anymore. They\u2019re about to die from the cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan and Feng Yi Xuan looked at each other and saw astonishment in each other\u2019s eyes. Why did Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s physique change to such a state in an instant?</p><br/><p>The Seafolk gradually stopped singing. On the bed, Qi Ao Shuang slowly opened her eyes and slowly sat up. Her eyes slightly shifted as she looked in his direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them spoke hesitantly, but Qi Ao Shuang only glanced at them coldly, not saying a word. He immediately turned his head to look outside the window, and his eyes turned cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned, his heart filled with endless worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to take it back \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slowly stood up and stood on the ground barefooted. She looked at Jin Yan and Feng Yi Xuan and smiled faintly. \u201cYou\u2019ve all worked hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Jin Yan were even more doubtful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike fire, haven\u2019t you thought of it yet?\u201d A cold smile appeared on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s beautiful face. She reached out a finger to hook onto Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s chin. \u201cFlame-like, this is your real name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan was stunned. Lily and Liu Li, who were standing at the entrance, were also stunned.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan frowned, his eyes filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and get back my power and finish this. \u201cThose who owe me, I will definitely get back at you!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes instantly turned ice-cold, without a shred of warmth in her eyes. A vicious glint gradually appeared in his eyes, expanding.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone had the same illusion. It was like the arrival of death and the return of the devil!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang walked barefooted on the ice, passing by Jin Yan and Feng Yi Xuan who hadn\u2019t recovered their wits. She directly left the room and headed towards the Winged King\u2019s bedroom. Inside the Winged King\u2019s bedroom, the white-clad and Moon King, Misius, were taking care of the heavily injured Winged King. The three of them had different expressions, and it was unknown what they were thinking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike ice \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang appeared silently at the door, spitting out two words.</p><br/><p>Her voice was very soft, yet it violently smashed into the heart of the man in white.</p><br/><p>The man in white lifted his head to look at the door, and Xiao Ao Shuang stood there silently.</p><br/><p>She wore a snow-white dress, and her long, supple black hair was trailing on the ground. Her snow-white skin and jet-black hair formed a powerful visual impact. She was like a painting, but at the same time, she was also like a sculpture. Her beauty was indescribable with words.</p><br/><p>\u201cRu Bing, have you forgotten about the past as well?\u201d There was a hint of loneliness in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang?\u201d Bai Yixue was taken aback as he asked hesitantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour real name is like ice.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slowly stepped forward and gently caressed the face of the man in white. Her eyes were misty as she murmured, \u201cYou and Ru Huo are my favorite, you two are my everything \u2026\u201d \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cAo Shuang, what are you talking about?\u201d The white-robed man felt even more puzzled and uneasy.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood at the door, his heart sinking. What exactly this feeling was, he couldn\u2019t tell.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the depths of the sea,\u201d he murmured. \u201cGo to the deepest parts of the sea, and retrieve my power \u2026.\u201d Everything will end. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes became more and more lax. After she said this sentence, she gradually lowered her head, and her voice also became softer and softer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang?\u201d The man in white extended his hand to gently hold the soft hand that was touching his face. It was cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite clothes.\u201d In the next moment, Qi Ao Shuang raised her head abruptly, her eyes clear and bright.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, you \u2026\u201d The man in white frowned, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was not confused this time. She lowered her gaze and turned around to look at Feng Yi Xuan and Jin Yan. She softly said, \u201cI have been able to see it ever since I injured the Wings King, but I was unable to stop it.\u201d \u201cI know all about it\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice trembled, her expression was lonely and sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d Feng Yixuan suddenly began to panic. Why did he suddenly feel as if the Ao Shuang in front of him was about to disappear? In the blink of an eye, he would lose Qi Ao Shuang, and he would never be able to see her again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike fire\u2026\u201d As cold as ice \u2026. Qi Ao Shuang laughed softly, but her smile was so heartbroken, so weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d When Feng Yixuan saw Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s smile, his heart ached. He didn\u2019t say anything else and abruptly stepped forward to hug Qi Ao Shuang, hugging her tightly in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d King Yue frowned with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you a story, and you\u2019ll understand.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice was faint, carrying a hint of sadness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a distant place, there is a goddess. She is so strong and bloodthirsty that all the gods in that place are no match for her.\u201d No one dares to provoke her. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang gently broke away from Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s embrace and murmured, \u201cShe calls the wind and calls the rain, and comes and goes as she will.\u201d She can control the hottest flame in the world, and she can also control the coldest ice and snow in the world. \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice was soft, but everyone clearly heard it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lotus flower that she doted on the most was the parallel lotus. One was red and the other was white. The red lotus flower was named fire and the white lotus flower was named ice. This juxtaposed Tirian was all she had, and she doted on it to an unprecedented degree. She had only one tear in her life, and that tear had been watered to this and to Tirian. But one day Tirian would not disappear. She was gone. She was angry, burned to death, burned to death. Thus, he had finally violated the might of the heavens and was demoted to the mortal realm. She ended her life ahead of time, and the god she used to work with managed to send her to another world. \u201cThat world is the Ceylon Continent \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes gradually became hazy, but a few tears flashed in her eyes.</p><br/><p>The room was terrifyingly quiet. No one spoke, only the uneven sound of breathing.</p><br/><p>Everything was obvious \u2026</p><br/><p>Jin Yan\u2019s expression was complicated. His white clothes and Feng Yi Xuan were stunned and absent-minded. Moon King, Mishus and Lily were both confused and surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that she\u2019s awoken, I\u2019m going to disappear \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang revealed a sad smile, \u201cEverything is her.\u201d All her. I\u2019m just a born will. \u201d Power, body, and even love were all that person\u2019s \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d After hearing what Qi Ao Shuang said, Feng Yi Xuan let out a violent shout and once again pulled Qi Ao Shuang into his embrace. He lost control and cried out in pain, \u201cNo!\u201d Ao Shuang, you are you! You are unique, no one can make you disappear, I forbid it! I won\u2019t allow it! I like you, it\u2019s you! \u201cNo one else!\u201d</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

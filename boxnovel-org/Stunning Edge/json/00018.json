You are loathed and disgusted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe darkness in your heart is darker than the darkest of nights.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Malicious voices like this surrounded her, unceasingly attacking Claire, cursing Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou miscreant. You should have been hacked into pieces and killed long before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire knitted her brows more tightly.</p><br/><p>Evil? Should go die?</p><br/><p>Darkness surrounded her, and Claire looked bewildered at the sea of darkness around her.</p><br/><p>Was dying really the best way to end all this?</p><br/><p>Yes! Only if you die, can everything be redeemed. Everyone will be glad to witness your death, including the people you care most about. Quickly free yourself and atone for them.</p><br/><p>The malicious voice slowly became more gentle, like it was guiding Claire.</p><br/><p>Child, come. Come back to the gods\u2019 embrace.</p><br/><p>But as the last sentence ended, Claire abruptly opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>The white light around her instantly disappeared without a trace. In her mind, the malicious cursing voice also disappeared, replaced by a mysterious thing \u2013 it must have been the arcanum that Emery\u2019s friend passed on.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, are you okay? What just happened?\u201d Jean asked nervously. Claire had seemed really terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Claire coldly humphed and flicked her finger at a cold wet corner. A tiny flame shot out and a piercing cry sounded out.</p><br/><p>Jean looked in amazement at the place Claire attacked, and found that there was a smooth, black stone. At this moment, a figure was rising up slowly from the stone. The image was small like a child, but very faint, as if it would disappear the next second. It also looked as if it were in pain, obviously because Claire hit it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis?\u201d Jean looked at the figure and suddenly called out in a low voice, \u201ca ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, being able to hide your essence and follow us.\u201d Claire walked up and picked up a small stone, playing around with it.</p><br/><p>The faint figure instantly looked terrified.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be the person who fought against the Holy Divine Prince and almost died? You then attached yourself to this stone, waiting for a suitable body to take over,\u201d Claire said unhurriedly and then squished the stone with force.</p><br/><p>The figure immediately cried out in terror, \u201cDon\u2019t, I\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t crush the stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you decide on my body?\u201d Claire coldly laughed and played around with the stone in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 Because you\u2019re a person with an interesting past. People with stories always have dark shadows in the depths of their hearts. Also you\u2019re a magician, very suitable,\u201d The figure hesitantly said, its voice dropping off feebly. It was afraid that Claire would be unhappy and crush the stone.</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s expression changed and looked at the figure with suspicion. What did that ghost say? Claire has a hidden past? He and Nancy could testify one point, and that was that the Claire in front of him was a totally different person than before. But, who was she? Presently, Jean felt incredibly compelled to grab the black stone and ask it personally.</p><br/><p>Claire caught the look of suspicion in Jean\u2019s eyes. She coldly humphed and ruthlessly pinched the stone, hard. The figure started howling, \u201cPlease don\u2019t, I\u2019ll tell you everything. Please don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. I don\u2019t need you to tell me anything.\u201d Claire coldly humphed again. \u201cGet in there.\u201d She did have many questions for this unidentified guy who wanted to attack her, but here was not the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, okay.\u201d The figure bitterly answered. He had already lost his body, and his power was basically gone, how could he negotiate?</p><br/><p>In a flash of black smoke, the figure disappeared before their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026 ?\u201d Claire could see the confusion in Jean\u2019s eyes clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just that that guy was defeated and lost his body, and attached his spirit to this mysterious stone. When I was inheriting the arcanum he interfered and distracted me, wanting to take over my body.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t want to say too much and downplayed the situation. If it was not for the confusion deep down in heart, how could she be distracted?</p><br/><p>Although Claire said all this easily, Jean knew that Claire had just been in a very dangerous predicament. Curious on how Claire realized all this, Jean asked, \u201cThen~ Then at the end, how did you discover the existence of that ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the last sentence he said.\u201d Claire coldly laughed and recited its exact words, \u201cChild, come. Come back to the gods\u2019 embrace. \u201c After she finished saying these words, Claire raised her head and looked at the stone door. She gave a light push and opened it.</p><br/><p>Claire walked in the front and Jean followed behind. But Jean was thinking about something else. He had heard the contempt clearly in Claire\u2019s voice when she spoke that last sentence.</p><br/><p>Behind the stone door was a stone ladder that went all the way down, so the two followed the path and came to a simple room that had only a stone bed, a stone stool, and some other stone furniture. There was nothing else other than these. It seems that that person used an extraordinary method to store the arcanum in the stone door, and it was necessary to place the stone tile on in order to inherit. There was no written record for this arcanum. This way, it would be safer.</p><br/><p>The secret room was completely empty. The two retraced their steps and like before, Jean brought Claire out of the waterfall.</p><br/><p>The two light and dark essences faded as they returned back, and the magic beasts acted normal again. Along the way, they killed some third grade and fourth grade magic beasts while Claire looked for heartbreak grass. She didn\u2019t notice that Jean looked at her with a sliver of confusion when she acted. Jean was confused about nothing other than Claire\u2019s mettle and efficient moves. This didn\u2019t seem like a novice coming to train, but a massacre of everything in Claire\u2019s way!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis beast core would make a great ring for Mother.\u201d Claire used a dagger to dig up the beast core from the head of a fourth grade beast. This core was different from the others. The dark blue core\u2019s center was the bluest, surrounded by different shades of blue.</p><br/><p>Jean felt confused about this young girl in front of him. Who was she? He couldn\u2019t see through her. The dainty dagger came alive dancing in her hands as she cut open the head of beasts easily and dug up their cores. Nobody would believe that she was the man-crazy Miss like before if they saw this. Only after a few battles, she could now use magic like she owned it! On many occasions, she didn\u2019t even need his help before slaughtering the magical beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Claire stood up and collected all the beast cores. She stuck the dagger back in her boot expertly.</p><br/><p>They only found only two heartbreak grass on their way out, but it was enough to complete the task.</p><br/><p>Exiting Gale Gorge, the two decided to rest a night in the nearest town and leave the next day.</p><br/><p>Night came.</p><br/><p>After eating, Claire went into her room and locked the door. Then, she tore a scroll and magic rippled out across the room, forming a magic hood, blocking all magic so no one could hear her conversation.</p><br/><p>Only after doing these did Claire pull the little black stone out from her bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out.\u201d Claire commanded, staring at the black stone on the table coldly.</p><br/><p>Nothing happened The stone was still. All was quiet.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t say anything else, but instead reached down, pulling out the dagger from her boot, and stabbed towards the black stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t~\u201d a voice instantly cried out in fear.</p><br/><p>Claire watched as a human figure began to form, and put the dagger back where it came from. Just when the figure thought it had escaped this disaster, Claire extended her finger to flick the stone hard. The figure immediately curled up in pain, trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stone, it seems to be very closely related to your spirit, and it can actually make you, a spirit, feel pain.\u201d Claire interestedly observed this black stone in front of her, which glowed faintly.</p><br/><p>The figure shivered internally. This seemingly beautiful and innocent young girl is definitely not the angel depicted by her appearances, but instead a little devil!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, tell me. Who are you? How did you get into a fight with the Holy Divine Prince? And what is this stone?\u201d Claire asked, playing with the little stone.</p><br/><p>The figure kept silent and didn\u2019t speak, when really it was trying to make up some speech to fool Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill thinking about how to trick me, huh?\u2026\u201d Claire\u2019s voice floated through the room. The next moment, a sharp pain struck the figure.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s fingernail was deeply embedded in the little stone, her indifference making the figure shiver greatly.</p><br/><p>Why would this young girl give him a feeling similar to that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, you are a Dark Magician, right? What were you going to do in Gale Gorge? Don\u2019t tell me you were on a date with the Holy Divine Prince.\u201d The coldness in Claire\u2019s voice flatly pointed out this figure\u2019s job. But, the cold joke after that terrified the figure.</p><br/><p>He now understood that he had met his match today. A person he definitely could not fool.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The black dragon cursed. Actually, he had that plan at the start: if these people saved him, he would immediately dismember these lowly humans into a thousand pieces, but just then, he had already changed his mind. Humans had always been the most despicable, shameless, and cunning creatures. Following and learning from her these things and going back to deal with his elder brother was a pretty good idea.</p><br/><p>Claire squinted. Cliff\u2019s thinking and hers matched up. But, now that she looked at it, this black dragon definitely wouldn\u2019t kill them now.</p><br/><p>Cliff casted a spell on the crystal and then handed it to Claire. He pulled out his wand and raised it fiercely, starting to chant many incantations. The wand emitted a light beam at the black dragon\u2019s head and then turned into four light beams that rained down, directly attacking the four balls of light that binded the dragon.</p><br/><p>Slowly, the four balls of light started trembling then vibrated more and more intensely. Small beads of sweat appeared on Cliff\u2019s forehead, but Cliff didn\u2019t stop what he had been chanting, and instead, started chanting faster.</p><br/><p>The black dragon let out a long roar and then, using his two front claws, directly grabbed the light beams and pulled fiercely.</p><br/><p>The loud crackling continued on as the harsh, white light enshrouded the black dragon. The black dragon\u2019s wings slapped, raising a wave of qi, blowing so much that everybody were almost unable to open their eyes.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the four pillars were already destroyed by the black dragon. As the white light dissipated, the black dragon stretched his body, obtaining freedom!</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar~~~~~!\u201d The black dragon hissed at the sky for a while, venting his innermost resentment and the feeling of ease after obtaining freedom.</p><br/><p>Cliff opened his eyes slowly and wiped the concentrated beads of sweat on his forehead. Claire hurriedly supported Cliff for him to sit down.</p><br/><p>The black dragon looked at the other sound profoundly. With a poof, a white light flashed over. The black dragon had turned into a human figure. Black hair, black eyes, clothes completely black. His handsome face held a trace of wildness with more savageness from the depths of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, teeth, teeth.\u201d Summer reminded Claire quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you get the teeth now, then won\u2019t you go back and complete your test? Then won\u2019t I be losing out? You\u2019ll just disappear.\u201d Claire turned and said to Summer. This crafty girl, Claire knew her nature very clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, don\u2019t speak so ruthlessly. After I go back and turn in the tooth and finish my exam, I\u2019ll come back immediately. I\u2019ll accompany you all the way to the Sprite Forest. I still haven\u2019t repaid you yet.\u201d Summer immediately pledged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, your highness, I\u2019ve thought of my third request.\u201d Claire ignored Summer and turned towards the black dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Ben Berna Alexa Betlabu Etfeid\u2026\u2026*\u201d The black haired black eyed black dragon started saying his name as if he were chanting a prayer. He spoke for a long time without any indications of stopping. Dragons\u2019 names were all this long?\u201d</p><br/><p>*a bunch of english sounding stuff</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just call you Ben.\u201d Claire blocked Ben\u2019s words. \u201cGive this girl the tooth you promised and then send her back to the Ai Luo clan household and then after she completes the exam, bring her back and meet up with us. We will camp here and wait for you guys. One day and night should be enough. If this girl doesn\u2019t come back, then trample on their clan\u2019s household until even dregs aren\u2019t left.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Summer\u2019s expression changed greatly. In reality, she did have this idea of returning and not coming back ever again. Claire, this guy, was really too dangerous. Her woman\u2019s sixth sense made Summer feel like as long as she stayed with Claire, danger would come knocking on the door. In the far, far future, Summer would confirm over and over that her woman\u2019s sixth sense was abnormally accurate!</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d A look of disdain appeared on Ben\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll let a lowly human sit on my back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Summer started smiling, but then when she heard Claire\u2019s next words, her smile froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say to let her ride you. You can suspend her on your tail or grab her with your claws.\u201d Claire interrupted Ben impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s fine.\u201d This time, Ben nodded cooperatively.</p><br/><p>\u201cCl\u2026\u2026 Claire\u2026\u2026 Please don\u2019t\u2026\u2026 \u201d Summer looked at Ben, who had suddenly assumed his true appearance, her voice trembling as she asked. Grabbed by those ghastly claws and then flying high up in mid air? No!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Of course Ben wouldn\u2019t care about those. He extended his claws and grabbed Summer\u2019s small body and beat his wings to soar high up. While Summer cried out fearfully, Ben\u2019s figure slowly disappeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>Everybody looked up to gaze into the distance. It was only until the figure disappeared from their sight that they retracted their gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, do you think he\u2019ll come back? I keep feeling like that black dragon isn\u2019t that trustworthy.\u201d Feng Yixuan asked a bit worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill he treat that thief unfairly? What if he flies to some body of water or mountain range and throw the thief to their death or drown them?\u201d Shui Wenmo asked, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Claire replied quietly, yet certain. It seemed like Ben knew his own temperament very clearly, too impulsive and fiery and without any shrewdness, which was how he had been trapped. Now he had finally learned to be a little smart when he had obtained his freedom, so naturally, he wouldn\u2019t let this opportunity go.</p><br/><p>Yes, he actually wanting to learn from her how to be despicable, shameless, and crafty. It was something that would make one speechless. Claire stroked her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be camping here today. Boy, go and find some tree branches. Boy with the sword, find some wild game. The poker faced one, yes, that\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking about you, stop looking. Erect the tent.\u201d Cliff sat down leisurely and instructed everybody, then patted the spot next to him. \u201cCome, darling disciple, let\u2019s sit here and rest for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan went to get tree branches, Shui Wenmo went to go hunting with his sword, and Jean started to build the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, have you gone to the Sprite Forest before?\u201d Claire asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have. I sent a sprite home. That sprite was very curious on how the human world was like and wanted to meet humans.\u201d Cliff looked up ahead. Suddenly, his gaze started to become a little listless, like he had seen something from the far, far past.</p><br/><p>Claire quieted down, waiting for Cliff\u2019s next words, because she saw a faint trace of grief from the depths of Cliff\u2019s eyes. The sprite that Cliff had saved was definitely a woman! Definitely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sprite was very beautiful, very gentle. As pure as a sheet of white paper. She was curious about how the outside world was like so she secretly slipped away from the Sprite Forest, passed through the Dragon Valley and then arrived at the bustling world of humans.\u201d Cliff said softly, as if he was afraid of alarming the person in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master and that sprite definitely committed adultery.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice sounded vulgarly in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Out of Walter\u2019s expectations, Claire actually made a sound of approval, agreeing with Walter\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut mankind\u2019s greed and ugly craving was far from what she could imagine, so she was captured by humans and locked away. They were planning on offering her to a very perverted and muddleheaded emperor\u2026 \u201d Cliff\u2019s expression started to become a bit furious.</p><br/><p>But after he had spoken to this point, Cliff didn\u2019t speak any more, becoming silent. A faint trace of grief appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to speak. Your master was definitely a hero saving a damsel in distress and then fell in love at first sight. But it\u2019s impossible for humans and sprites to intermarry. Sprites have lifespans many times longer than humans. Furthermore, the sprites race will definitely not permit a human to dirty their pure and noble blood, so this is only a tragic tale\u2026\u201d Walter interrupted and said excitedly, to the point that his spit practically flew.</p><br/><p>Claire also had surmised this.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a miserable shriek came from the depths of the forest. Next, there was the sound of Shui Wenmo\u2019s angry yell.</p><br/><p>Something had happened!!!</p><br/><p>Claire stood up abruptly, heading to the direction where the sounds had come from.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit, who\u2019s calling so mournfully? Perhaps Shui Wenmo bumped into a beauty, wanted to xxoo them, they didn\u2019t consent and committed suicide, and then\u2026 \u201d Walter elaborated on his imagination, talking annoyingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Claire shut Walter up moodily, hurriedly rushing over to where the sounds had come from.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! F*ck!! F*ck!!!\u201d Walter suddenly shouted tensely. \u201cClaire, it\u2019s Light aura. Dammit, it\u2019s dogs from the Temple of Light. There\u2019s so many, at least five people! No, there\u2019s still one more.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? People from the Temple of Light? How could they appear here?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Just at this moment, Feng Yixuan\u2019s voice came from behind. Feng Yixuan had also hurriedly headed over. Soon, Jean also came from another direction, quickly meeting up with the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s people from the Temple of Light.\u201d Claire said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do know?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the people in front of us all have white armor and the insignia of the Temple of Light.\u201d Claire said moodily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Feng Yixuan looked up. Sure enough, he saw five holy knights clad in white armor attacking Shui Wenmo with their swords and Shui Wenmo was resisting them with a bit of difficulty, not allowing the holy knights to pass him. Claire looked past Shui Wenmo and was astonished to see another holy knight. But his white armor was already extremely dirty, covered in mud and bloodstains. In his embrace was girl who was completely pale faced and completely covered in blood! The girl was hugging the knight tightly, her face filled with concern, because the knight was on the brink of fainting. Evidently, they had already gone through a harsh battle.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>Why were Shui Wenmo and the Temple of Light going against each other?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Five against one! Scum!\u201d Feng Yixuan howled angrily. Of course he wouldn\u2019t care about some Temple of Light; In his eyes, there were only five scum using numbers to go unfairly against his brother. Feng Yixuan\u2019s movements were the very definition of nimble and cruel. Immediately, he called out for several frightening icicles to fly over. Before the holy knights reacted, another wave of icicles flew over.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean. Is your loyalty to me greater than your belief in the Temple of Light religion?\u201d Claire suddenly asked Jean profoundly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, you are my religion.\u201d Jean smiled faintly, answering quietly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

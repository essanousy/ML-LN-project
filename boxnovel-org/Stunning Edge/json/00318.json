The young girl looked to be only 13 or 14 years old, and her face was still young. However, Feng Yixuan could feel that her cultivation was not low at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you are?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, my name is Lili, I\u2019m the left general of big brother Jin Yan!\u201d Lily giggled as she walked over. She wore a set of dark green clothes and a unique belt on her waist.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s face changed slightly. \u201cDo you know about this rebellion?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked with some doubt in his heart. Moon King and Mishus knew that this rebellion was no small matter. They had already dispersed the people around them, including the generals by their side. Did the True King not dismiss the generals by his side?</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s precisely because of this that I want to follow by elder brother Jin Yan\u2019s side. Those cowards, scram as far as you can.\u201d Lily grunted coldly, her face full of disdain.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan looked at Lily, stunned. He directly asked, \u201cYou like Jin Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lily\u2019s face immediately turned red. She lowered her head to touch her belt before raising her head to look at Feng Yi Xuan and confessed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I like big brother Jin Yan.\u201d I fell in love with him the first time I saw him. I swore then that I would follow him all my life, whether he liked me or not. \u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was stunned by this girl\u2019s straightforward reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is the young lady mentioned by elder brother Jin Yan, right?\u201d Lily walked forward and crossed her waist as she looked at the sleeping Qi Ao Shuang. She said in a carefree manner, \u201cShe is indeed beautiful. As expected of the woman that elder brother Jin Yan likes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi Xuan was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou definitely know that elder brother Jin Yan likes her, but she doesn\u2019t seem to like elder brother Jin Yan.\u201d She likes you? \u201cOr is that one called Young Master Leng?\u201d Lily giggled.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was even more astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that big brother Jin Yan likes her, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Even so, I will still stay by elder brother Jin Yan\u2019s side. It doesn\u2019t matter if elder brother Jin Yan doesn\u2019t like me for the rest of his life. I just need to follow by his side. \u201d Lily giggled and spoke her thoughts even more directly.</p><br/><p>However, Feng Yixuan suddenly fell silent, and his face darkened. Looking at Lily, he opened his mouth a little but didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything. I hate being called stupid. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d Lily smiled mischievously, sitting on the bed, looking at the sleeping face of Qi Ao Shuang, sighing with emotion, \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cWhat about her?\u201d Lily turned to look at Feng Yixuan and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yi Xuan, she is Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang \u2026\u201d Lily repeated these few words in a low voice, then nodded and stood up, \u201cShe is someone that big brother Jin Yan will protect even with his life, so she is also the person I will protect with all my might.\u201d \u201cI will help big brother Jin Yan protect her in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you \u2026\u201d Feng Yi Xuan said somewhat sourly. Could a person\u2019s love really be so selfless and achieve such a level \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d \u201cHehe, I hope she wakes up soon.\u201d Lili giggled and stood up. Walking to the window, she stuck out her tongue, \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Please don\u2019t tell elder brother Jin Yan that I\u2019ve secretly come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan nodded, and Lily gracefully climbed out of the window.</p><br/><p>The room quieted down once again. Feng Yixuan looked dazedly at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s sleeping face. Waves of gentleness arose in his heart.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aushuang slowly opened her eyes, what entered her eyes was the magnificent bed curtain. She gently turned her head and saw Feng Yixuan lying on the bed, sound asleep.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly reached out her hand to touch Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s head. As soon as she touched him, she immediately woke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, you\u2019re awake. Are you hungry?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan revealed a smile and gently heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan, I had a dream \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice was faint, but it also carried a hint of sadness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d What do you dream? \u2019 Feng Yixuan asked worriedly when he saw the strange expression on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI dreamed of flames and charred creatures. Monstrous hatred and anger. It was all my doing. I was looking for something. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang slowly sat up. Feng Yi Xuan quickly extended his hand to support her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking for what?\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t think about it for now. I\u2019ll go get someone to bring water for you to wash your face and prepare some food for you.\u201d Feng Yixuan reached out a hand to gently stroke Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head to comfort her.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded lightly, and did not say anything else.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the hall was seated and discussing. Everyone was there, including Lily. Qi Ao Shuang was a little absent-minded, the scene in her dream was still vivid in her mind, striking fear into her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, right now, we need to find other kings and open the Shura\u2019s seal before we can exterminate the Heavenly King and reach Camil\u2019s castle?\u201d Feng Yixuan concluded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it means.\u201d Even if we don\u2019t exterminate the Heavenly King, the Heavenly King will take the initiative to look for us. \u201cNo, or is he actually waiting for us to go?\u201d King Yue suddenly frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t move, doesn\u2019t that mean he\u2019s waiting for death? \u201cWait until we gather and open the seal?\u201d Mishus didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if some of them have already betrayed him?\u201d Yue Wang\u2019s words caused everyone\u2019s expressions to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he has swallowed the Heavenly King, who will side with him!\u201d Mishus flatly refused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s the new king?\u201d Feng Yixuan said softly. Mezus\u2019s face changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, now that King Yong and King Bai cannot be sure, we should go find the Winged King.\u201d Moon King\u2019s face sank.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill the Wings King be in danger?\u201d Feng Yixuan interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the Wings King\u2019s movements are erratic. Her castle is a city in the sky, always moving through the clouds. No one can pinpoint the location. \u201d Moon King explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, it\u2019s not easy to find.\u201d Feng Yixuan asked with a worried frown.</p><br/><p>Matthews shrugged and fell silent.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was discussing, Jin Yan frowned and suddenly said, \u201cThere\u2019s someone outside the palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Everyone asked in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmissary of the Wings King \u2026\u201d Jin Yan said this with a puzzled expression. When everyone heard this, their faces were filled with doubt. This was too strange. Just a moment ago, he was still talking about the Wings King.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan didn\u2019t say anything else. His hand gently drew a mark in the air and a mirror-like object appeared. Ripples began to appear in the water, but it gradually became clear and reflected the people inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wings King himself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it her?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the mirror was a woman wearing a black cloak. Although her body was covered by the cloak and her face was covered by a hat, the Moon King and Mishus could tell who she was just from her figure and the exposed part of her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWings King, is it a woman?\u201d Feng Yixuan was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid anyone tell you she was a man?\u201d King Yue curled his lips.</p><br/><p>Feng Yi Xuan smirked and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really the Wings King?\u201d Indeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her. It can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d Moon King and Mishus both nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let her in.\u201d Jin Yan nodded to Lily before heading out to welcome the Winged King. Jin Yan\u2019s hands formed a seal in front of his chest as he opened the stone door.</p><br/><p>Not long after, Lily led the Wings King in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWings King, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, Wing King.\u201d You know how critical the situation is. \u201cSo you came to find us first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Moon King and Mishus stepped forward to greet him, greeting him warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d The Wings King lowered his head from beginning to end, and did not take off her cloak, replying in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! All that\u2019s left now is to look for the new King of White and King Yong.\u201d Moon King let out a sigh of relief, then turned around and walked back, \u201cWings King, did you also dismiss your subordinates and send them here alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Mishus only frowned slightly. He had a nagging feeling that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to find a new Eternal King and White King.\u201d \u201cBecause they are all with the Heavenly King \u2026\u201d Wings King\u2019s low voice suddenly changed its pitch. In the next moment, everyone only felt a blur in front of their eyes. In front of the Wings King, the Moon King was stabbed in the chest by a sharp treasured sword, and blood flowed down from the tip of the sword. The other end of the sword was in the Winged King\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>This sudden change shocked everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yue Ya!\u201d Mishus\u2019 expression changed drastically as he cried out in pain.</p><br/><p>The Winged King succeeded in his attack. He quickly pulled out his sword tip, sneering coldly as he retreated.</p><br/><p>Surprised, Jin Yan and Lily rushed forward to protect Moon King and Mishus behind them.</p><br/><p>The Winged King held his blood-stained treasure sword and laughed, \u201cYou actually want to rebel against him, you are truly looking for your own death!\u201d \u201cThe Heavenly King\u2019s seat should be his to begin with!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Ao Shuang was also stunned by the sudden change. She and Feng Yi Xuan both frowned as they looked at the Wings King. Everything that had happened was too sudden. No one could stop the attack just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWing King!\u201d \u201cYou also joined that beast!\u201d Mishus supported the bloodied Moon King, the fury in his heart billowing to the heavens.</p><br/><p>The Winged King sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe, is not the Wings King \u2026\u201d Yue Wang struggled to say these words intermittently. At this moment, the wound on his chest slowly changed, gradually stopping the blood. However, King Yue was getting weaker and weaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the Wings King!\u201d \u201cWho are you?\u201d Mishap was shocked. He turned his head to look at the ferocious Winged King and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, hehe, did you forget about the twin sister of the Wings King who is a hundred times better than her?\u201d The Wings King held his sword and laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Moon King won\u2019t die, but he won\u2019t live after being poisoned by my poison.\u201d \u201cHaha, you can forget about opening the Shura Seal in your entire lives!\u201d Winged King laughed wildly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d \u201cGo to hell!\u201d Seeing the Moon King getting weaker and weaker, Mishap was about to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d The Wings King threw the sword in his hand down, and flames began to slowly rise from his body, slowly enveloping her entire body. The scorching flames made one wish for death, but a smile of happiness unexpectedly appeared on her face. She muttered, \u201cMy King, you can always rest at ease in that position. No one can cure my poison \u2026\u201d \u201cMy king, my king \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mezus tried to charge forward to extinguish the fire on the Winged King, but Jin Yan stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s useless. Soul Ignition.\u201d \u201cYou are invincible.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, the Wings King was burnt out, leaving only a small pile of ashes on the ground. The beautiful figure from earlier was no longer there.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yue Ya!\u201d Mishus felt the Moon King\u2019s aura weakening in his arms, and he could not help but feel anxious.</p><br/><p>No one noticed that Qi Ao Shuang did not move at this point, and she stood there in a daze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

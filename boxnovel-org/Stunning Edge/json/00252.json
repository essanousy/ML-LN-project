This young girl, she was not such a simple person \u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, I am willing to \u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s low voice was firm and unshakable. After speaking, he slowly walked forward.</p><br/><p>The man in gray stood rooted to the spot, thousands of words transforming into a long sigh as he followed behind.</p><hr/><br/><p>After chatting with Charlotte, Qi Ao Shuang went to the backyard in a very good mood. Within the room that was laid down by the spirit formation, a few gods were simply spitting out saliva without any posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattle, you old bastard, you\u2019ve killed my cards.\u201d The angry voice was Austin the Elf.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll piss you to death. I don\u2019t want ten thousand words, so of course I\u2019ll throw them away.\u201d The Dragon God Bart\u2019s saliva almost sprayed onto the Elf God\u2019s face. \u201cYou bastard, you even touched my barrel to death, and you still have the face to shout?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d Sistar beamed and prepared to raise his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu! I\u2019ll be leaving first. You guys continue.\u201d Camille smiled gently and took the card.</p><br/><p>West Starr coughed up blood and was on the verge of roaring towards the sky.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang stood at the door and let out a smile as she watched the people who were busy fighting.</p><br/><p>In fact, Marilyn\u2019s promise now seems to be nothing more than a trick of the child. After this ambitious woman has tasted the taste of power, she will definitely gather her strength and start a Holy War after completely subverting the Elders Guild. Her eyes were burning, concealing her lack of understanding.</p><br/><p>An end to jihad does not necessarily end with Marilyn in power alone. There is a way to end it once and for all.</p><br/><p>If Marilyn were in power, she would promise to stop the Holy War. But after he left, a thousand years later, two thousand years later? She will cover the sky with one hand, and everything will be up to her. Who could stop the Holy War?</p><br/><p>However, there was still a way to keep the Radiant Templeand the Presbyterian\u2019s Light Presbyterian Chamber fighting on forever. There was no peace, no peace. How could a God Realm still have the energy to start a Holy War?</p><br/><p>The old guys from the Elders Guild were probably hopping in anger. Originally, he thought that Marilyn was just a small fry to send people to capture her and bring her back, but now, Marilyn\u2019s influence was growing at its peak.</p><br/><p>Even so, the Elders Guild\u2019s strength over the years was still there. If the other side had gathered a large amount of troops, Marilyn\u2019s current strength would not be a match for them.</p><br/><p>Marilyn had to settle down first, then take the blow. Keep them in balance.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes landed on the beaming West Starr. A faint smile appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>He no longer needed this scale.</p><br/><p>Now, what is needed is a triangle.</p><br/><p>Marilyn, Presbyterian, God of Darkness.</p><br/><p>If the balance was not careful, it would lose its balance. A triangle was the most stable shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d West Starr sneezed violently, causing everyone on the table to glare at each other.</p><br/><p>Sistar rubbed his nose in confusion. How could he sneeze in such fine weather?</p><br/><p>Camil lifted his head to look at Xiao Aohan who was standing by the door, revealing a gentle smile. He stood up and said to everyone, \u201cFight first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do. How can I do without one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree is one, you can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho will we fight if you leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three gods shouted without any image.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get the young master.\u201d Camil smiles faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll call someone over anyway.\u201d When the three gamblers heard this, they decided to let Camille go.</p><br/><p>Camil walked to the door and looked at Xiao Ao Shuang, saying softly, \u201cWhat, are you worried about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang shook her head, \u201cNo.\u201d When the situation with Marilyn and the Council of Elders stabilizes, then there will be no problems on the God\u2019s side. \u201d</p><br/><p>Camil looked at Qi Ao Shuang who frowned slightly as if he was thinking of something. He then continued, \u201cYou are worried that the Divine Realm\u2019s problem has been solved, but the Devil Realm\u2019s problem is not easy to deal with, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t recognize me.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s frown deepened as she said in a low voice, \u201cBut I still feel that it has something to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tell you when it\u2019s time to tell you. Come on, I\u2019ll make you a cup of rose tea to wake you up.\u201d Camil reaches out his hand to rub Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head affectionately.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang revealed a smile. Camille\u2019s hands were warm now. Camille\u2019s smile was warm. Unconsciously, he had already treated Camil by his side as a habit. It was as warm as a family member. But what Camil had said, Feng Yixuan would tell him when the time came. She understood this logic as well.</p><br/><p>However, he was afraid that it would be too late by then.</p><br/><p>A sense of unease rose in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow?\u201d When the Maneki-Neko heard that there was flowery tea, it naturally thought of dessert.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you have something to eat.\u201d Camille squeezes his big ears and laughs.</p><br/><p>When he found the young master, he heard that he was playing mahjong and immediately ran towards him. She had been wanting to play with that strange, funny thing for a long time.</p><br/><p>In the quiet living room, Qi Ao Shuang was drinking Camil\u2019s scented tea, making the Treasure Cat eat delicious pastries contentedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, what do you plan to do next?\u201d Camille sat down and asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst help Marilyn stand on her feet, and then\u2026\u201d After that, it was time to go to the demon realm. Feng Yixuan \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the God Realm is settled, it will be the Devil Realm, right?\u201d Camil took a sip of tea and said slowly, \u201cThe Celestial Realm has been dealt with. Coincidentally, they are having an internal conflict.\u201d But the Devil was different. The demons were a blood-thirsty race. Brutal, powerful. As kings, it\u2019s not easy for them to give up on the Holy War. \u201d Camil leisurely helped to analyze the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang put down her teacup and sighed. However, if Feng Yixuan and the Young Lord were doing their best to end the Holy War, then what about the Devil King? Even if they wanted to terminate it, if the Infernal King was unwilling, everything would be for naught.</p><br/><p>While Xiao Ao Shuang was thinking with a frown on her face, there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ao Shuang, Her Highness the Goddess has invited you over to discuss some important matters.\u201d The maid at the door said respectfully. Even their goddess was extremely courteous to this mysterious black-haired girl. Of course, there was no need to mention them.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Camil looked at each other, and Qi Ao Shuang revealed a mocking smile. It seemed that the Elders Guild\u2019s movements were faster than expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. I\u2019ll be there right away.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded slightly, indicating for her maid to leave first.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that a war is about to break out in the Divine Realm.\u201d Camille smiled gracefully and gently. There was a hint of schadenfreude in his smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, the Council of Elders can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang stood up, a mocking smile on her face, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d What will Marilyn do this time? \u201d</p><br/><p>Camille stands up, nods cheerfully, and walks with Qi Ao Shuang to Marilyn\u2019s study.</p><br/><p>Upon entering the study, Qi Ao Shuang saw that both Feng Yi Xuan and Leng Lingyun were there. And since the Young Lord wasn\u2019t here, he should still be fighting a few Divine Generals.</p><br/><p>Upon entering, Leng Lingyun smiled and nodded at Qi Aushuang. Xiao Ao Shuang replied with a smile. His eyes shifted to Feng Yi Xuan, but he lowered his head and didn\u2019t look at her. After Xiao Ao Shuang cast her gaze towards Marilyn, she felt that familiar fiery gaze on her again.</p><br/><p>Why? Qi Ao Shuang wanted to grab onto Feng Yi Xuan and ask. Why are you always like this? What was the unspeakable difficulty? Why don\u2019t you come out and solve it together?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ao Shuang, this time, please help me out with your friends.\u201d Marilyn looked terrified, pleading anxiously and sincerely.</p><br/><p>However, there was no trace of fear and worry in her eyes, only indifference and pride.</p><br/><p>Oh, Marilyn, you simple woman. Can\u2019t you get a little deeper?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has happened to make our noble and graceful goddess so flustered?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sat down in anger, but there was a trace of mockery in her voice.</p><br/><p>A flash of pain flashed in Charlotte\u2019s eyes as she stood beside the desk. In the blink of an eye, it happened so quickly that it was almost unnoticeable.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ao Shuang, the Elders Guild has gathered a large amount of troops. They want to officially declare a war on me!\u201d They no longer care about face. \u201d Marilyn was still a little panicked as she said, \u201cGod Realm, God Realm is about to start a war.\u201d I don\u2019t want to see that happen. But if I don\u2019t fight, I\u2019ll be executed by the Presbyterians. The promises I have made are simply impossible to make. The Holy War was still on schedule. \u201cTherefore, please ask Miss Ao Shuang and your friend to help me win this war.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows. Oh, Marilyn has made progress. You know how to threaten yourself in this way. Qi Ao Shuang didn\u2019t immediately respond to Marilyn\u2019s words. Instead, she slightly raised her eyebrows at Charlotte, who was standing behind Marilyn.</p><br/><p>Charlotte\u2019s expression immediately turned extremely unsightly. Her handsome face paled, devoid of the slightest trace of blood. Then he closed his eyes and lowered his head in pain. He knew, knew in his heart, that the Marilyn standing before him was no longer the pure and flawless maiden she had been before. She was now a goddess of light! A woman who craved power!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we will help you.\u201d After all \u2026 Qi Ao Shuang looked at Marilyn and said slowly, \u201cAfter all, our goal is the same. It is to end the Holy War, right?\u201d \u201cYour Highness the Goddess of Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss Ao Shuang. It\u2019s great that you understand this.\u201d Marilyn hurriedly nodded her head, her face showing an expression of joy.</p><br/><p>Of course I understand, Miss Marilyn.</p><br/><p>There will be a surprise waiting for you, won\u2019t there? Charlotte.</p><br/><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Qi Ao Shuang glanced at Charlotte, who was looking at her, and smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, your highness the Goddess, the two people I asked you to find for me, have they found their whereabouts?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked lightly. He had asked Marilyn to look for White Emperor and Black Feather. After such a long time, the two of them should have found their whereabouts.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Marilyn nods. \u201cI was about to tell you about it.\u201d They found them two days ago. They\u2019re coming this way now. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Lady Goddess, for your help. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t know how to find them.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled as she thanked him. Letting the Goddess of Light step forward to look for others was indeed a good thing. The first one could be searched in broad daylight, unlike the God of Darkness, West Starr, who was definitely not that convenient. Second, natural efficiency. In the Divine Realm, if the Goddess of Light issued an order looking for someone, wouldn\u2019t the subjects give them absolute cooperation?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Marilyn smiled gracefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, it will be much easier to fight against the Elders Guild. With their help, it will be much easier.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d That\u2019s wonderful. Thank you very much, Miss Oshuang. So you came to them to help me? \u201d Marilyn nodded gratefully. However, there was a trace of pride and a sneer in his eyes. This human girl was really useful. He was actually trying so hard to help Ye Xiao.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, Marilyn, an even bigger surprise awaits you.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lady Goddess, my friends and I will help you.\u201d After Xiao Aushuang said this, Marilyn was still a little worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Miss Ao Shuang, the strength of the Elders Guild cannot be underestimated.\u201d \u201cNot to mention their Million Angel Army, the members of the Council of Elders are all powerful experts.\u201d Marilyn frowned and said worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t we still have the Dragon God and the others?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Marilyn with a smile that was not a smile. Since this woman wanted him to say such a thing, she would satisfy her. In any case, they were just exchanging a few pleasantries, and there was no way they would lose a piece of flesh.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, after Qi Ao Shuang said this, Marilyn seemed to relax, but her eyes flashed with a faint light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m relieved.\u201d \u201cThank you very much, Miss Ao Shuang.\u201d Marilyn thanked him excitedly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang just smiled and did not reply.</p><br/><p>In the evening, the White Emperor and Black Feather arrived at the Holy Hall to meet Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your hard work, please sit down and have a cup of tea.\u201d Camille beamed and poured them both a cup of tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is that a war is about to break out between the Goddess of Light and the Radiant Temple. What we need to do is to balance these two forces, as well as the dark forces of the God of Darkness.\u201d \u201cThe three forces will balance each other and fight on forever, and the mission will be completed.\u201d After shooting out his barrier, Qi Ao Shuang quickly relayed the situation to the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that simple?\u201d Hei Yu sat down and drank the tea Camil offered him in one gulp without forgetting to thank Camil.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The White Emperor, on the other hand, sat down with a calm expression and accepted Camil\u2019s tea. He thanked her first before taking a sip.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s that simple.\u201d Originally, he wanted to get rid of the Elders Guild so that the current Goddess of Light, Marilyn, could establish a new Radiant Temple, but this woman\u2019s ambition was inflated, and even if she were in power, she would still start another war. \u201cHow about we continue to weaken the power of the Divine Realm and no longer have the power to start a Holy War?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang explained in a deep voice, \u201cAnd there is the God of Darkness as well. These three forces are very powerful, and with the situation stable, there will be no more worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be so easy for the Devil world.\u201d The White Emperor calmly revealed the crux of the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d \u201cBut first we have to deal with this side.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sighed in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are we going to do?\u201d \u201cIn the war between the Presbyterians and this Marilyn?\u201d Hei Yu wasn\u2019t stupid and immediately asked this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp Marilyn win the war, but let the Presbyterians go and retain their basic strength to fight Marilyn.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said in a deep voice, \u201cOne sentence, it is flat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d Hei Yu didn\u2019t waste any more time talking and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the members of the Elders Guild shouldn\u2019t be so simple.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang thought for a while and said slowly. The Elders Guild had always been the supreme ruler of the Divine Realm, so how could they not be insignificant individuals without any strength?</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d So what! \u201cWatch me strangle them!\u201d Suddenly, a voice filled with disdain interrupted his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked up and saw the young master standing at the door. Just like that, the young master silently entered the barrier she laid down. And the person standing behind her was Feng Yixuan. Beside Feng Yixuan was Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s here.\u201d Camil smiled and said, \u201cCome in and have a seat.\u201d \u201cJust in time for a discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sort of discussion is this? Isn\u2019t it to beat them until their faces are blooming, but to keep a breath of air that they can struggle against?\u201d The young lord\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cLadya!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s voice carried a faint trace of anger. With just a low grunt, he managed to shut the Young Chieftain up.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. Just do whatever you say.\u201d The young lord said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will your temper change?\u201d One day you will learn a lesson. \u201d Feng Yixuan said with a deep voice, suppressing the anger in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d The young lord\u2019s voice became softer and softer as he glanced at Camil, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was lacking in manners earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s smile was still gentle, and he nodded slightly to show that he didn\u2019t mind.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang said with a complicated look on her face. Young master had probably never met an opponent before, which was why he was so unrestrained. She was proud, she was arrogant. However, as Feng Yixuan had said, with Young Master\u2019s personality, if he encountered a setback one day, she would be able to learn a profound lesson from him. He didn\u2019t know if he was going to collapse or if he was going to fight back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will cooperate with you.\u201d Feng Yixuan said in a low voice before turning around to leave.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang opened her lips slightly, wanting to stop Feng Yi Xuan. The Young Lord glared at Qi Ao Shuang, using his body to block her gaze. Then, he turned around and left angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang \u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression was complicated, how could he not see the worry and hesitation in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes? She wanted to chase after him, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang finally let out a soft sigh and said slowly: \u201cLet\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d Anyway, the Elders Guild\u2019s foundation should not be damaged. \u201cEveryone, be careful on the battlefield.\u201d After Xiao Ao Shuang said this, she stood up and quietly left with a tired face.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun stared at the back of Qi Ao Shuang, but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><hr/><br/><p>War, break out.</p><br/><p>When the 1 million Angel Army assembled by the Council of Elders pulled out of the central city and declared war on Marilyn\u2019s Divine Radiant Force, the entire God Realm was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>What is this? Everyone was confused. In the past, the Radiant Temple fought in the current Radiant Temple?</p><br/><p>Marilyn wasn\u2019t stupid. She was prepared. After all, she was the real Radiant Goddess, so she quickly gathered eight hundred thousand of the Angel Army. Although her strength couldn\u2019t be compared to the army gathered by the Elders Guild, their numbers were almost the same. It was not easy to gather so many troops in such a short period of time. He could tell that this Marilyn was very skillful.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that the Elders Guild had decided to eradicate Marilyn completely this time around. All of the members of the Elders Guild had mobilized, including the next Goddess of Light, Flora. As for the Twelve-Winged Angels, they were all moving at full force, and their formation was absolutely astonishing.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Marilyn will go to the battlefield herself to boost the morale of the soldiers.</p><br/><p>This day had finally arrived.</p><br/><p>The battlefield unfolded in a plain.</p><br/><p>White wings filled the sky, flapping their wings incessantly.</p><br/><p>The trumpets sounded, and the Archangel Warriors on both sides fought for their honor.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang and the rest of the group stared coldly at the battle on the stage. In truth, to be more selfish, it was to hope that the more desperate the fight, the better. This was because this would greatly reduce the strength of the Divine Realm and prevent them from starting a Holy War.</p><br/><p>Blood rained down from the sky, and white feathers fluttered in the sky. More and more white feathers were dyed red. Angel shrieked as they fell, and some of their limbs even fell off.</p><br/><p>Is this war?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she looked at the scene in front of her.</p><br/><p>If this was the case with the God Realm starting a war, then what about the Three Realms\u2019 Holy War?</p><br/><p>It would only be a hundred times more brutal than the war in front of them, a thousand times more brutal, right?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly closed her eyes before opening them again. The sky seemed to have been dyed red, and the ground was truly dyed red.</p><br/><p>The pungent smell of blood made people frown.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang raised her head and looked into the distance. She was attracted by a few bright white lights.</p><br/><p>Over there, there were countless Angels who rushed forward and were then chopped into two halves before falling down.</p><br/><p>It was not the Ten Winged Angels that flew there, nor was it the Twelve Winged Angels.</p><br/><p>It was an angel with sixteen wings!</p><br/><p>One, two, three\u2026</p><br/><p>There were a total of nine sixteen-winged Angels.</p><br/><p>Is he a member of the Elders Guild?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang narrowed her eyes, a pair of bright fiery wings unfurling on her back as she flew up into the sky, facing the Sixteen Winged Angels.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan, Leng Lingyun, and the others followed closely behind Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Camil stood still, watching the battle with a calm expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes revealed sixteen pairs of conspicuous pairs of white wings. They were getting closer and closer \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

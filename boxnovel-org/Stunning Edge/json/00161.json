Of course his shrewdness was endless!</p><br/><p>How ruthless, how cunning!</p><br/><p>No wonder he let such a second rate plot occur!</p><br/><p>Choosing the successor was a must, but he could not afford to let divine right usurp royal authority. He was also uneasy with the Hill clan\u2019s growing power. By just watching on the sidelines, he would weaken the Hill clan through the crown prince and Temple of Light! When both sides were weakened, he would appear and make the decision.</p><br/><p>But Katherine was able to see through it all; she was more wise and farsighted than the emperor!</p><br/><p>Claire was in awe of the gently smiling woman before her, as if seeing her for the first time. This was a member of the powerful Li clan! If it weren\u2019t for that \u201cfather\u201d of hers, who knew how successful this woman would have been in Lagark? Claire didn\u2019t dare to imagine it.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, sometimes, life just happens. You know the truth, but can\u2019t do anything but to continue down on the path given.\u201d Katherine patted Claire\u2019s head, a frown on her beautiful face. \u201cRight now, I am most worried about you. Your status will definitely leave you entangled. The Temple won\u2019t let you go. Your second brother\u2026\u201d Katherine\u2019s eyes dimmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about my second brother?\u201d Claire sensed something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour second brother chose to support the crown prince against the Hill clan.\u201d Katherine sighed quietly, her eyes full of worry. \u201cI don\u2019t wish for this to also happen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shocked by her second brother\u2019s action, Claire immediately said without hesitation, \u201cI won\u2019t go against the Hill clan like second brother.\u201d She would never become enemies with the Hill clan or, more specifically, never become enemies with Mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Claire, you misunderstand.\u201d Katherine laughed quietly seeing Claire\u2019s confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to become enemies with the Temple.\u201d Katherine sighed. \u201cThe Temple is stronger than you think. Their strength is unfathomable.\u201d Katherine appeared deeply worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Claire started to say hesitantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. His and her highness, the second prince and princess Maurice, will guarantee my safety.\u201d Katherine consoled Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes sharpened, her gaze ice cold.</p><br/><p>Second prince\u2026 hmph. I see you\u2019ve forgotten your promise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will save you, mother, the way you to be so saved,\u201d Claire solemnly swore. Truthfully, Clare was fully capable of destroying the entire place and taking Katherine away, but the consequences? She and Katherine would have to stay in hiding for the rest of their lives. Of course Claire wouldn\u2019t do something so foolish.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, don\u2019t be brash. If possible, I would like you to go to Lagark and not get entangled in this battle for the throne. Your identity is too special,\u201d Katherine said</p><br/><p>Not get entangled?</p><br/><p>Claire smiled faintly, her expression full of confidence.</p><br/><p>From today onward, she could let the world know what a true battle was!</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, don\u2019t worry. I know my limits. The next time we meet will be in Hill Manor. I will be leaving now.\u201d Claire smiled, full of confidence.</p><br/><p>Katherine only saw a blur as Claire disappeared.</p><br/><p>Katherine opened the window,but Claire\u2019s figure was nowhere to be seen. She was extremely worried. However, the future far exceeded her expectations. Not a single person was prepared for what was to happen!</p><br/><p>Claire slinked stealthily through the night, her eyes ice cold.</p><br/><p>Even though Mother had not been harmed, she still had to settle the score!</p><br/><p>Claire was heading straight to the palace.</p><br/><p>In the palace, the second prince\u2019s bedroom was lit brightly.</p><br/><p>In the study, Nancy stood by the window, gazing outside nostalgically. A breeze swept through his bangs. He recalled the day Claire had fallen off her horse trying to chase him. He went to visit, but her bright eyes did not even look at him any more. Only now did he realize that Claire hadn\u2019t been the same since.</p><br/><p>He sighed. When did that stunning girl creep into his heart? When had he started to be unable to look away? And when had he started thinking about her constantly, worried for her?</p><br/><p>Nancy closed his eyes, letting out a sigh. What would he say the next time he saw Claire? How could he face her?</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, are you thinking about her again?\u201d Princess Maurice\u2019s voice came from behind.</p><br/><p>Nancy did not respond, only gazing into the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, this time, our hand was forced. There was no other way.\u201d Princess Maurice sighed quietly.</p><br/><p>Nancy remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a large hand you had there!\u201d A cold voice sounded suddenly in the study. The two heard the voice clearly. They could not be more familiar with this voice.</p><br/><p>Nancy and Maurice\u2019s hearts clenched. They both looked up towards the source of the voice. A cold dagger was already pressed against Nancy\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Princess Maurice called out, her voice trembling. Claire had abruptly appeared out of nowhere. Princess Maurice eyed Claire nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, your highnesses.\u201d Claire chuckled quietly, her voice devoid of worth. She still hadn\u2019t withdrawn the dagger.</p><br/><p>Nancy didn\u2019t move, his gaze decrepit.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t hurt brother,\u201d Princess Maurice said hastily. How had Claire snuck into the palace? Even without the numerous guards, there were the Tempest Warriors! The Tempest Warriors had much keener senses than the normal royal knights, but even they did not notice Claire\u2019s intrusion. Was Claire really only a double class magician warrior?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, is something the matter?\u201d Even though princess Maurice had kept her voice low, the Tempest Warrior stationed outside the door still sensed something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. Leave,\u201d princess Maurice raised her voice and ordered coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Without any hesitation, the Tempest Warrior left.</p><br/><p>Maurice worriedly looked back at Claire. If Claire just pressed the slightest bit harder, the dagger would pierce Nancy\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, it was all my idea, nothing to do with brother. If you need to vent your anger, take it out on me. Brother needs to be safe. Amparkland cannot be without brother,\u201d maurice said quickly, her voice low.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t dare to kill you?\u201d Claire laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>Just this one sentence made princess Maurice\u2019s heart sink. This sentence said everything. Their past friendship would no longer exist ever again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf killing me will dissolve your hatred, then go ahead. However, don\u2019t harm brother. Amparkland needs brother. We can\u2019t let those religious freaks take usurp royal authority.\u201d Princess Maurice\u2019s heart tightened. She caused everything. If Claire took her life, she had nothing to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaurice\u2026\u201d Nancy\u2019s expression was painful. He hadn\u2019t planned on the situation becoming like this.</p><br/><p>However, Nancy suddenly felt the cold pressure at his neck disappear and saw Maurice\u2019s shocked expression.</p><br/><p>Nancy whipped around abruptly, but Claire was nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Maurice slowly walked over, sighing. \u201cBrother, I\u2019m sorry. I caused you to suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Maurice.\u201d Nancy closed his eyes, then opened then abruptly. \u201cI have never regretted that decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Maurice watched him with a complex expression, her heart bitter. Born in the royal family, much was forced on you.</p><br/><p>Beneath the seemingly peaceful night were large currents.</p><br/><p>Morning. The sun\u2019s rays reached every crook and cranny of the capital.</p><br/><p>Claire currently sat in a luxurious, secret room, sipping tea. She listened seriously as a stocky, middle aged man before her explained the current situation. Xi Shaosi calmly poured tea for Claire, while Xi Shaoqi crooked his head, puzzled. After Claire found the manager of the slave market, she had immediately summoned the two twin brothers. What did she want?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Temple of Light\u2019s next move is to first establish your mother as a criminal, then use it to pressure the second prince. The Hill clan will definitely not let this happen. Something must be done.\u201d The stocky man continued, \u201cRight now, the second prince has the support of the Tempest Warriors and the Hill clan. The crown prince has the support of the Temple of Light and the Griffin Squad. On the surface, it appears the crown prince has the upper hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire listened quietly. The stocky, middle aged man before her was Philips, the manager of the slave market as well as a member of the Temple of Darkness. He did not have a title as member of the Temple of Darkness, but was well respected. Even the pope treated him with respect. This person was farsighted, able to see the big picture, and a powerful supporter of the Temple of Darkness. Currently, he was following orders to assist Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d Claire set down her cup, her expression still cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe military parade is in half a month. Divine Princess, if they can prove your mother is guilty before then, they will take the opportunity to announce it publically that day and everything will be set in stone.\u201d Philips frowned. Of course the Temple of Darkness would not approve of the Temple of Light usurping royal authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that emperor thinking,\u201d Xi Shaoqi hmphed. \u201cAs the emperor, how could he let divine right usurp royal authority? Why would he permit such actions?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

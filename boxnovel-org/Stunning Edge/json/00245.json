Camil spread out his hands, checking his fingers, which had already been scorched black.</p><br/><p>Mutations \u2026</p><br/><p>Mutations \u2026</p><br/><p>Little Ao Shuang, perhaps, you can change my fate \u2026?</p><br/><p>Camil let out a soft sigh, held Qi Ao Shuang and lightly rose and fell on the lotus leaves before disappearing from the surface of the lake. Those demi-humans didn\u2019t even have the chance to clearly see the appearance of the person next to them, much less attack him.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aushuang woke up again, she felt an indescribable sense of comfort in her body. Endless power filled his entire body. He even had a feeling that he was omnipotent. When he opened his eyes, he saw a tranquil night sky. A purple moon was above his head, and he was used to the cool wind. A faint, rough smell floated beside his nose.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang sat up abruptly and saw Camil with a bonfire by her side. Seeing that Xiao Ao Shuang had woken up, Camil smiled faintly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded, sitting up straight and continuing, \u201cTo be precise, it is very good.\u201d \u201cI feel like my body is filled with energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, almost all the heat in the entire lake has been absorbed by you, your body is about to explode.\u201d Camille smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you saved me.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said softly. She looked at Camil with a complicated expression. She was saved by Camil once again \u2026 Camille, why have you been following me?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Camil smiles disapprovingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saved me again, how should I repay you?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the blazing bonfire and asked softly.</p><br/><p>Camil was deep in thought when his eyes suddenly flashed with an indescribable glint. He seemed to want to say something, but he lightly smiled as he said, \u201cRepay. Don\u2019t tell me Little Ao Shuang wants to repay you with her body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang rolled her eyes, coldly snorted and said in a calm voice: \u201cYou only love yourself, do you still need me to repay you with my body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil laughs and says nothing. A trace of sadness flashed in his eyes, and disappeared in the blink of an eye. Only love himself? Hehe, from birth, I have already lost the qualifications to be a lover. That included loving himself. Love? What is it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d \u201cLittle Ao Shuang, Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun, who do you like?\u201d Camil suddenly threw out a sentence that completely stunned Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart trembled violently. She looked at Camil with a gentle gaze, but was unable to say anything. Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun \u2026 Xiao Ao Shuang had never thought about how to deal with this. When Feng Yixuan confessed to her, when Leng Lingyun confessed to her, she didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. Now that Camille asked, she didn\u2019t know how to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have an answer in your heart right now, because you don\u2019t even know it yourself. But time might tell you the answer. \u201d Camil gently rubbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head and comforted her, \u201cTime can prove everything.\u201d Don\u2019t think too much about it now. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille.\u201d How long have you lived? How long have you lived alone? \u201d Looking at Camil\u2019s expression, Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly asked in a daze.</p><br/><p>Camil shook his head gently, his smile still the same as before. He said gently, \u201cI \u2026 don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><br/><p> Qi Ao Shuang looked at Camil\u2019s expression. She was right, Camil had an undetectable sadness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang lowered her head and said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I say I\u2019m sorry?\u201d Camil looked at the bonfire, added a few pieces of firewood, and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If you want to say it, just say it.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sleep. We\u2019ll continue tomorrow.\u201d Camille lay back, squinting into the night. His heart was empty.</p><br/><p> \u201cThank you, Camille.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said softly, \u201cThank you for staying with me all this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil slowly closes her eyes, but in her heart, she laughs faintly. If you knew why I was always by your side, would you still thank me?</p><br/><p>The next morning, Xiao Ao Shuang finally saw their position clearly. This was a boundless plain. At first glance, it was completely blue. No wonder there was a rough smell when I woke up at night. As they walked forward, they constantly encountered demons that were attacking each other. Clearly, many of the demi-humans had done their best during this Martial Competition.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was not worried about the White Emperor and Hei Yu at all. Back then, the two of them were Great Demonic King\u2019s two Great Generals, and there was no one who could do anything to them. As for Feng Yixuan \u2026 Qi Ao Shuang fell into deep thought. What would Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s current strength be like? To be able to sneak into the Monster race without being discovered, his current strength should be quite extraordinary. Moreover, with the abnormally strong Young Master here, Feng Yixuan would be fine. What worried Qi Ao Shuang the most was Leng Lingyun! That was because the cold earrings on Qi Aushuang\u2019s earlobes reminded her that these were Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes, and also half of his strength. Leng Lingyun, who had lost half of her power, what would her strength be like now?</p><br/><p>Just when Xiao Ao Shuang was a little distracted, Camil stopped in his tracks. He narrowed his eyes, beaming with smiles as he said softly, \u201cXiao Ao Shuang, we are surrounded.\u201d \u201cFacing a fight like this is very rough, I don\u2019t have any sense of beauty, I\u2019ll leave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang came back to her senses, turned around and looked at Camil who had a carefree expression on his face, and laughed. He didn\u2019t know why, but seeing how Camil was feeling right now, he actually felt a little relieved.</p><br/><p>This was the Camille she knew, the Camille she knew.</p><br/><p>She could see the sadness in Camil\u2019s voice and eyes. Even though she did not know who Camil was or what he had experienced, Qi Ao Shuang had already treated Camil as a friend and family member. Naturally, she didn\u2019t want to see him suffer.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly raised her hands, the palm of her left hand released a strong golden light.</p><br/><p> The divine artifact was unsheathed!</p><br/><p>Golden light shot in all directions, terrifying one\u2019s heart and soul.</p><br/><p>Camil stood behind Xiao Ao Shuang with his eyes half closed, leisurely waiting to see Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>The surrounding demons gradually surrounded them.</p><br/><p>Looking at the surrounding demons, Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>It was an old acquaintance!</p><br/><p>It was Lila\u2019s brother, Hamms and his men.</p><br/><p>With a cold expression, he crossed his arms in front of his chest and silently looked in their direction.</p><br/><p> The group of demons surrounding Qi Ao Shuang and Camil were all of extraordinary strength. They stared at Qi Ao Shuang with covetous eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201d Hamms said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang was silent, what was the point of saying so much now?</p><br/><p>What could she say if she didn\u2019t even have a skeleton?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you say it. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d After a cold sentence, Hamms stepped back.</p><br/><p>The demons surrounding Qi Ao Shuang and Camil moved quickly.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang only smiled faintly as she held her long sword and slashed down on the spot.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the golden light was blinding, making people dizzy.</p><br/><p>Just like that, a vicious, ring-shaped flame attacked the group of demons in front of them.</p><br/><p> Without a scream, the demons were cut in half. Their eyes were still blank, and their bodies fell to the ground in two halves. Soon after, the raging flames engulfed their bodies, instantly burning them to ashes.</p><br/><p>This scene caused the other demons to turn pale with fright, and the expression on Hamms\u2019 face also changed greatly.</p><br/><p>He did not know when this human had transformed into a demon. Furthermore, he had the strength to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, leave.\u201d Hamms waved for the other demons to leave. He knew that no amount of demons would make a difference if this continued. It would only cause him to lose more subordinates, which would not benefit him in any way.</p><br/><p>Hamms slowly walked forward. With a light wave of his hand, a snow-white longsword appeared out of nowhere in his hand. The sword was suffused with a faint white light, exuding a rich magical element.</p><br/><p> A good sword!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Hamms immediately made his decision. He waved his hand and shouted in a low voice, \u201cRetreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before many of the demi-humans could recover their wits, Hamms had already taken the initiative to leave. Only then did the demons realize what had happened, and they hurriedly followed behind him. Despite his confusion, he obeyed Hamms\u2019 order and immediately retreated.</p><br/><p>Wei Ao Shuang didn\u2019t chase after him. He just stood there, watching the sword greedily devouring Hamms\u2019 sword.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Holmes finally understood why Wan Feng would be so courteous to this human, and gave her the rose badge. He also understood why the White Emperor and Black Feather would offend him for her.</p><br/><p>This human was definitely not simple! Her strength was actually on par with his, no! Her strength was actually above his! Now that she had demonized herself, why had she come to this Martial Competition?</p><br/><p>Becoming a Diremonster King? Impossible! Was there such a weird thing? A human who, after demonizing, participated in the Martial Competition and eventually became a Great Demonic King?</p><br/><p> A human becoming a Great Demon King and ruling over the Demon World?!</p><br/><p>Is that possible?</p><br/><p>Let alone the disagreement of all the demi-humans in the Demon Sector, perhaps the four supreme experts of the Demon Sector would never agree to such a decision?</p><br/><p>However, with the power of the four Martial Saints, they must have discovered the identity of the young girl. Why would they allow her to participate in the competition?</p><br/><p>Why all this?</p><br/><p>Hamms suddenly couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it.</p><br/><p>The treasured sword in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand devoured the evil demonic spirit without restraint, and finally fused together. Xiao Ao Shuang strangely brandished the sword in her hand, but did not discover the increase in the power of the sword. She could not help but flick the blade of the sword with her finger, muttering to herself: \u201cStrange, I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo feeling?\u201d Camil stepped forward to look at the sword in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand, looked at it with rapt attention, then suddenly smiled and said, \u201cNext time, try to find a demon clan sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the sword in her hand, still unable to see the difference.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sword just now, it\u2019s called the Sword of the Demons. It\u2019s Hamms\u2019s weapon.\u201d \u201cThis treasured sword can directly absorb the power of the demon\u2019s life core.\u201d Camille explained with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that Hamms used such a sinister weapon?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said in shock. Once the life core lost its power, this demon clan member would be basically crippled.</p><br/><p>Camille smiled gracefully and said softly, \u201cActually, I think Hamms is quite pure compared to you!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYou!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Camil angrily.</p><br/><p>Camille smiles like a peach blossom and walks in front. Qi Ao Shuang put away the sword in her hand and followed.</p><br/><p>The two of them walked together, and after passing through the rough terrain, they entered a mountain range. All the monsters he met along the way were easily dealt with by Qi Ao Shuang. She didn\u2019t even need to draw her treasured sword and used magic to easily deal with them. He didn\u2019t run into any experts like White Emperor Black Feather, nor did he see the figures of Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>After a night of rest, they passed through the mountain range unimpeded.</p><br/><p>He was close to the position indicated on the map before the start of the match.</p><br/><p>However, when they saw the scene in front of them, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>For what lay before them was a great maze of gardens. All sorts of plants were planted, and the huge trees were green and glistening. The winding passages were all so blurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaze?\u201d The big ears on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head quivered slightly, and Camil almost wanted to pinch them again. Due to Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s fierce glare, he finally stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Camil looked at the vast and complicated maze and said blandly, \u201cThis maze is not difficult to describe. We only need to make a mark at the intersection when we enter it. If there is a dead end ahead, we can return, or we can identify a wall and walk on it \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille doesn\u2019t say anything, just boom.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang unleashed a golden flame towards the huge tree in front of her.</p><br/><p>The tree fell and was then burned to ashes by Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>The space in front became empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you said is so troublesome, isn\u2019t it good to burn a path out?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows as she looked at the huge maze in front of her.</p><br/><p>Camil watched Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s brutal actions silently, just like that.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Camille felt powerless.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s much faster now. Just go straight ahead.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang laughed and continued to release the fire to open up a path in front.</p><br/><p>Camil followed silently behind, and for the first time he felt that his intelligence was not as good as Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Qi Ao Shuang advanced with her hands on her legs. Her speed was also fast, and the most important thing was that she would not get lost.</p><br/><p>In this gigantic maze, there were countless monsters whose minds were completely fixed on this. The majority of the demons were obediently walking through the maze, seriously marking it and trying their best to get it back and forth.</p><br/><p>Phew</p><br/><p>With a loud sound, the golden flame burned another green tree.</p><br/><p>A scream passed into the ears of Xiao Ao Shuang and Camil. There was someone behind the green tree. Oh, no, there was a demon!</p><br/><p>After the green tree was burnt to ashes, what was imprinted in front of Qi Aoshuang and Camil was a cute little loli who looked no older than 7 or 8 years old. She had big watery eyes, a delicate and pretty face, fair skin, golden curly hair, and a snow-white princess dress.</p><br/><p>What a cute little loli!</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, brother, you guys \u2026 are you guys going to pass through this maze?!\u201d The little loli\u2019s voice was as sweet as the sounds of nature itself. She timidly asked. She even looked at them innocently with her big watery eyes. There was a trace of fear in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the cute little loli in front of her and nodded. This child is so lovely, so lovely. There was even an urge to pick her up and kiss her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, then can Big Sis bring me along?\u201d \u201cLittle loli, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded, smiling faintly as she said: \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this big brother is so scary \u2026\u201d The little loli looked at Camil, and a trace of fear flashed in her eyes. She slowly moved towards the side of Qi Aushuang, as if seeking protection.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang smiled as she reached out to touch the little loli\u2019s head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this big brother is not scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s so scary \u2026\u201d I don\u2019t want to go with him. \u201d The little loli kept shrinking beside Qi Ao Shuang. Then she kept her big, pretty eyes fixed on Pride Frost\u2019s, as if pleading.</p><br/><p>Camille never spoke, a gentle, graceful smile still on his handsome face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes suddenly became a little blurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026 I want you to kill him, so you can only lead me out of this maze.\u201d The pretty little loli\u2019s voice was still as sweet as ever, but the words she said were abnormally terrifying. Her big watery eyes and Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes stared straight ahead, and her heavenly sweet voice continued to lower her voice. \u201cBig sister, I think you are very willing to do this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cQi Ao Shuang looked as if she was possessed by a devil.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang revealed a faint smile on her face. She took out the unique looking treasured sword from her left hand. When the little loli saw the sword thrown out by Qi Ao Shuang, her eyes were filled with shock, then with ecstasy.</p><br/><p> Qi Ao Shuang slowly drew her sword, her eyes no longer focused.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, big sister, kill this person and then bring me along to the road!\u201d The little loli\u2019s sweet voice had an indescribable enticement, making people unable to bear to reject her request. Her innocent mind made one\u2019s heart ache even more.</p><br/><p>The little loli looked at the sword held high in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand, feeling extremely happy. He really didn\u2019t expect that his harvest today would be this many fish. This woman\u2019s strength was really not bad. However, he was still bewitched by his own charm, and obediently obeyed his orders. Just rely on this woman\u2019s power to get out of this damn maze and order her to commit suicide. But perhaps she should be left to protect herself until the end of the game.</p><br/><p>Camil narrowed his eyes slightly as he looked at the triumphant smile in the little loli\u2019s eyes and silently smiled.</p><br/><p>What are you laughing at? He was still laughing even when he was about to die! Just as the little loli was about to ask, she felt a piercing pain in her chest.</p><br/><p>The little loli stared with her eyes wide open as she stared at the treasured sword in Cha\u2019s chest. She was stunned.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t seem to be blurry at all. Instead, she coldly smiled at the little loli\u2019s shocked face. As for Qi Ao Shuang, her eyes were filled with a mischievous glint.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026\u201d The little loli widened her eyes as she looked at the ice-cold looking Qi Ao Shuang in front of her in disbelief. How could this be? This girl actually didn\u2019t fall for his charm spell. She really wanted to ask how this cold-faced woman had gotten rid of her charm, but she could no longer finish her words. She straightened her back and her body slowly turned into ashes.</p><br/><p>What was left on the tip of the sword was a glowing Nucleus of Life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang picked up the Life Core from the tip of her sword and asked curiously.</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s the core of this fox demon\u2019s life.\u201d The Evil Demon Sword from before will completely absorb it, but after being merged with your treasured sword, your treasured sword will be very picky and won\u2019t eat this kind of thing. \u201d Camil said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Looking at the Nucleus of Life in his hands, Qi Ao Shuang did not mind at all and was about to put it away.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that something shocking would happen at this time?</p></div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

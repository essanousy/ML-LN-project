Would they not fear that this person might threaten their prestige? So they will definitely adopt measures to protect themselves. Based on the style of that bitchy Goddess of Light, she will definitely find the person before anyone else and subdue them to be one of her own. They will be extremely devoted to her and become one of her loyal lackeys in the mortal world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if they couldn\u2019t be tamed?\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes became slits, a cold ray emitting from her dark green irises.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen of course they would eliminate her early on, cleanly and thoroughly.\u201d Walter snorted and then spit out, \u201cThat bitch always did things this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Goddess of Light did this to you before?\u201d As soon as Claire asked the question, she felt it was a bit strange and sounded ambiguous. But from the hateful tone of Walter, there was something unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I started dark magic, I was the disciple of a healer. But that vile, ignoble man excluded and framed me, claiming my alchemy results as his own.\u201d Walter\u2019s mental ripples suddenly became violent. Apparently, he remembered some past memories and was extremely bothered.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t interrupt, only listening quietly to Walter furiously howl in a low voice. She could kind of guess what happened. Walter was very talented, so the Temple of Light took him in as their own, but others were jealous and excluded him. Becoming a despised dark magician must have had a lot to do with this.</p><br/><p>Walter suddenly became silent.</p><br/><p>Claire understood that Walter had calmed down and he didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore and she didn\u2019t ask any further.</p><br/><p>Everyone has the right to keep their own secrets.</p><br/><p>So Claire stayed in the garden feeling the breeze, thinking about other matters until the banquet ended.</p><br/><p>After the banquet ended, Claire and Duke Gordan left.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan leaned comfortably against the side of the carriage, his eyes closed in thought. Claire was also quiet. Suddenly Gordan opened his eyes and looked at Claire, \u201cClaire, what do you plan on doing with your fief?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, find someone to look after it for me. I haven\u2019t finished my studies.\u201d Claire answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I was thinking the same thing. Give me the castellan stamp, and I\u2019ll find a trustworthy person to take care of things. When you want to visit or manage things by yourself, you can always go anytime.\u201d Of course, Duke Gordan wouldn\u2019t take much notice of such a small city, and he definitely would not let these tedious issues affect Claire\u2019s learning of advanced magic from Sir Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Grandfather.\u201d Claire smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudy hard and learn from Master Cliff seriously. If one day you also become a wizard sage, then that day, the Hill clan\u2019s banner of roses will truly fly forever.\u201d There was a radiant look in Gordan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will work hard and not disappoint Grandfather.\u201d Claire nodded and said conscientiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have faith in you. One day, you will become my pride, become the Hill clan\u2019s pride, and even more so, Amparkland\u2019s pride.\u201d Gordan\u2019s powerful words resonated, his eyes burning with expectancy. \u201cRight now those people still view you the same way as before. I know there will be a day when you will give those people a huge surprise. One day, those people won\u2019t associate Gordan\u2019s granddaughter or Cliff\u2019s disciple with your name. I am sure that when they hear the name Claire, it will strike their ears with a roar of thunder! You are yourself, you are Claire Hill!\u201d Gordan stared intently at Claire, pouring out all the emotions in his heart.</p><br/><p>Claire only smiled and didn\u2019t say anything more, but inside she was incomparably moved. Right now, this old man in front of her finally looked just like an ordinary old man with high hopes for his granddaughter. Claire was even a little confused. Just now, the old man had understood her even better than herself. How he had such perception, Claire wouldn\u2019t understand for a long time in the future.</p><br/><p>But Gordan never thought that the scene that he was looking so forward to would come so quickly, so abruptly.</p><br/><p>In the middle of summer break, Claire\u2019s life was fairly boring.</p><br/><p>Meditation, then learning magic under Emery\u2019s guidance. Literature in the morning, equestrianship and fencing in the afternoon. Cliff had sent a few people to bring over precious items, but never showed up personally. The whole time he was busy with his experiment.</p><br/><p>No one knew that every night when Claire returned to her bedroom, she would be riddled with scars.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what good will come out of tormenting yourself like this?\u201d Walter\u2019s voice sounded in Claire\u2019s head curiously, smacking his lips. Every night when Claire returned to her bedroom and finished showering, her ghastly scars would show. And every time, she would wipe on some of the magical medicine she had asked for from Cliff that could heal the wounds instantly. Cliff never inquired why Claire wanted the medicine either. As long as it was Claire who asked for something in her letters, he would definitely give it to her, if possible.</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent, putting the medicine on her wounds like there wasn\u2019t any pain. Walter could only sense it, but didn\u2019t dare to look. Even if he had ten times the audacity, he still wouldn\u2019t dare to look at Claire\u2019s body. But he continued to feel doubt. Did Claire really have to do this? Did she have to do it to this extent? Right now she had Duke Gordan\u2019s care, Cliff\u2019s support, and could have anything she wanted. Why did she treat herself this badly?</p><br/><p>On the last ten days of summer break, something unusual happened.</p><br/><p>The neighboring country, Lagark, sent a few of their own magician students to have an exchange with the Sunrise Institute\u2019s. On the surface it was just an exchange, but everyone knew what it really meant. This competition was a show of strength. On this continent, Lagark was only second to Amparkland in terms of military, power, and strength. In recent years they had risen in prominence, and were looking for trouble, so of course this student exchange wasn\u2019t as simple as it seemed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t lose.\u201d Duke Gordan said solemnly, sitting at the table in his study, passing on the emperor\u2019s message.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grace, do you mean that we need to take special measures in the case of a necessary situation?\u201d Emery asked in a low tone. He stood aside quietly, clothed in a black magician\u2019s cloak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rule out that possibility. On that last competition, Lashia\u2019s win was very precarious, and only because something turned up suddenly on the other side. It\u2019s going to be hard to tell who wins this time.\u201d Duke Gordan was very serious. \u201cNot only will the emperor watch this competition, but the Temple of Light will also be present. All this time, the Temple of Light has been building their main temple in our country, the most powerful one. But if we lose this time, there is no guarantee that the Temple of Light won\u2019t switch sides.\u201d All of the nobility in the capital would come and watch the competition, so there was no way they could afford to lose. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that this competition was closely related to the country\u2019s politics and economy. It was far more complicated than people would think\u2026\u2026 So they had to win, even if it meant not playing fair!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and keep Claire out of this competition. She is still too young, and I don\u2019t want her getting hurt.\u201d Duke Gordan added, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your Grace.\u201d Of course Emery agreed happily. He, out of all the people, would not want anything to befall Claire.</p><br/><p>But would things happen so smoothly and simply as they planned?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

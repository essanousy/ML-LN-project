He suddenly exclaimed, \u201cFeng Yixuan, let her go first. Put her on the chair, quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Feng Yi Xuan heard this, he panicked. However, he still listened to the Moon King and carefully placed Qi Ao Shuang on a chair. As soon as Qi Ao Shuang was released, the Moon King rushed forward and pulled Feng Yi Xuan away. Just as Feng Yixuan was about to erupt, the scene in front of him left him completely stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d A loud sound rang out, and intense flames burst forth from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body. The flames were red, but also gold, and slowly engulfed Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d Seeing this, Feng Yixuan panicked and was about to step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, the fire won\u2019t hurt her.\u201d However, King Yue once again pulled Feng Yixuan back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d Feng Yixuan was alarmed as he recalled how Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body temperature was getting higher and higher.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fire seems to be from her soul, from her own body \u2026\u201d \u201cStrange\u2026\u201d Yue Wang frowned as he pondered, his eyes filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the golden lotus suddenly appeared. It was still holding onto the tail of Chang Kong and threw him into the embrace of Feng Yi Xuan. It then stood in front of Qi Ao Shuang and looked at Qi Ao Shuang with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden lotus, what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cIs this your flame?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan asked anxiously when he saw the golden lotus arrive.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d The expression on Golden Lotus\u2019s face became increasingly ugly. \u201cThis flame belongs to mom.\u201d In addition, it was hidden very well. \u201cIt seems like it has always been hidden in the depths of Mom\u2019s soul. It\u2019s so powerful!\u201d The golden lotus cried out in alarm. Suddenly, the golden lotus\u2019s figure began to fade away. The golden lotus\u2019s face also revealed a terrified expression. \u201cWhat a formidable power. He\u2019s going to swallow me \u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s complexion also changed. He turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang and cried out, \u201cAo Shuang, wake up! Wake up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus, how are you?\u201d At this time, Liu Li also appeared with a face full of fear. She turned her head and looked at the burning Qi Ao Shuang and anxiously shouted, \u201cGrandma, wake up! If you continue like this, Golden Lotus will die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer aura is also weakening. If she doesn\u2019t wake up soon, she will be in danger herself.\u201d Other than worry, there was doubt on King Yue\u2019s face. What was going on with this inexplicable flame? Furthermore, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s aura started to become unstable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d Feng Yixuan was anxious as well. He didn\u2019t care too much. He rushed forward and grabbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWake up, wake up!\u201d A heart-wrenching pain immediately assaulted Feng Yixuan\u2019s entire body, and it even pierced through his soul. This kind of pain, crying out for pain, wishing for death. However, Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t take back his hand. Instead, he bent over and hugged Qi Ao Shuang tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, wake up!\u201d Ao Shuang! Feng Yixuan painfully hugged Qi Ao Shuang tightly, allowing the abnormally hot flames to wreak havoc on his body.</p><br/><p>The scorching flames enveloped the two of them, and even though King Yue was worried, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Liu Li held onto the almost unconscious Golden Lotus, feeling anxious and afraid. Tears began to flow down her face. The sky was crouching on the Moon King\u2019s shoulder, anxiously looking at Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the flames began to die down and the searing pain on Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s body began to alleviate.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, you\u2019re awake?\u201d As Feng Yixuan felt the flame extinguish, he was overjoyed. He let go of his hand and happily looked down at Qi Ao Shuang. However, he was stunned the next moment.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t seem to be focused. She just sat there quietly, not moving at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t scare me!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart sank and he gripped Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulders tightly in panic.</p><br/><p>At this time, Liu Li cried out loud. The golden lotus had already lost all feeling and slowly collapsed to the ground. However, King Yue heaved a sigh of relief. He could tell that the golden lotus had only lost consciousness due to exhaustion and was not devoured. However, when he looked at Qi Ao Shuang again, he frowned. He found that he could not see through her at all.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly stood up and stared at Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s face. Her eyes were still unfocused. They were misty and empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang?\u201d Feng Yixuan looked at Qi Ao Shuang with suspicion. He had a nagging feeling that something was wrong with Qi Ao Shuang, but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint what was wrong with her. At this moment, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face turned cold. Her beauty was breathtaking, so beautiful that it was hard for people to breathe. The cold light almost made one stop breathing. This feeling caused a strange feeling to arise in Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart, but there was also a faint sense of familiarity to it. Just why was this happening?</p><br/><p>\u201cHa \u2026\u201d A soft sigh came out of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mouth. This sigh seemed to come from a very long time ago. It seemed to pass through the vicissitudes of life, as if the sea had dried up and rocks had rotted away. There are too many, too many emotions.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stared at Qi Ao Shuang in front of him; she was both familiar and unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly raised her hand and gently touched Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s face. An indescribable look appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally \u2026\u201d However, before Feng Yi Xuan understood the meaning of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s words, or perhaps Qi Ao Shuang might not have had the chance to finish speaking, her eyes slowly closed once again. This time, it seemed as if she was sleeping. He no longer looked as if he had suddenly fallen unconscious.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body slowly slid down. Feng Yi Xuan extended his hand and hugged Qi Ao Shuang. Her face was still as gentle as the one Qi Ao Shuang was stroking earlier. What did that mean? What finally happened? What was she trying to say?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s bring her in to rest first.\u201d You can change your clothes, this kid is fine. \u201cTake it in to rest.\u201d At this moment, King Yue spoke. This kid was obviously referring to the golden lotuses.</p><br/><p>After listening, Feng Yixuan was somewhat puzzled as to why he had to change his clothes. When he lowered his head to take a look, he suddenly felt extremely embarrassed. The clothes on his body had been burned to the point that not even a strand of them remained. His entire body was completely bare! As for the clothes on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body, they were completely undamaged!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s face turned red. He hurriedly carried Qi Ao Shuang and ran upstairs. Liu Li, who was standing behind him, was dumbstruck. She quickly turned her head away from Feng Yixuan and looked down at the unconscious Golden Lotus.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl, don\u2019t worry, this brat has gotten lucky from the disaster.\u201d \u201cQuickly bring him in and let him rest as well.\u201d King Yue looked at Liu Li and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you, Uncle.\u201d After Liu Li finished speaking, she carried the golden lotus and stomped upstairs, leaving Duke Yue petrified on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle \u2026\u201d Dashu \u2026 I, am I that old? \u201cI\u2019m so handsome and young, shouldn\u2019t I at least call you brother?\u201d King Yue was full of complaints.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to call me Auntie Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d Suddenly, a voice came from the side. He seemed to drink even more, and his entire body seemed to be unstable from walking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s true.\u201d After hearing Mishus\u2019 words, Moon King felt much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Even though he was a little drunk, Mishnu\u2019s mind was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either, but I\u2019m certain of one thing. That girl\u2019s body contains a lot of power.\u201d Yue Wang waved her hands.</p><br/><p>Mishus fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just wait and see.\u201d Moon King patted Mishus on the shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, is it possible that she is the White King?\u201d Mishus couldn\u2019t help but blurt out these words.</p><br/><p>Yue Wang was stunned, frowning slightly, \u201cThis is not impossible.\u201d Every birth of a king was inexplicable. \u201cWhen I became the King of the Moon, I was having my meal. Everyone at the table was so shocked that they spat out the food in their mouths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, who would have thought that the extremely thin and weak person would be King Yue?\u201d \u201cWhen some people were bullied when they were young, they only wiped away their tears and hid in a corner, refusing to come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d You\u2019re still bringing up the matter after so long! \u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Moon King reached out his hand to grab Mishus by the neck, shaking him until he almost vomited before letting go.</p><br/><p>\u201cUngrateful fellow, if it wasn\u2019t for me protecting you, you would have\u2026\u201d \u201cOhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh \u2026\u201d Mishnu rolled his eyes and reprimanded, but he didn\u2019t fight back.</p><br/><p>Yue Wang glared at him and pretended to be angry, but there was an undetectable gentleness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it is hard to say whether or not Qi Ao Shuang is the White King. \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s just wait and see. If she\u2019s the White King, it\u2019ll be much easier.\u201d Mishus said sternly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne more thing, I wonder how the other kings are doing.\u201d King Yue sighed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019re not easy to deal with either. If they\u2019re that easy to get rid of, wouldn\u2019t they be kings?\u201d Mishus comforted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Yue Wang nodded.</p><br/><p>At this time, Feng Yi Xuan had already settled Qi Ao Shuang up. He changed his clothes and stood beside her bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Feng Yi Xuan, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so shy.\u201d What the f * ck are you so shy for? I\u2019ve already seen through your body long ago. Don\u2019t mention me, my Xiao Ao Shuang has seen it as well. Not only has she seen it, she has even touched it\u2026 \u201cHrmph. Ahhhhhhh!\u201d The skies were originally squatting by the bed.</p><br/><p>However, the more and more embarrassed Feng Yi Xuan became, the more he covered his mouth and threw him to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t talk no one will take you for a mute. \u201cThere\u2019s still Ao Shuang who needs to rest. You need to be quiet.\u201d Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s face turned red as he warned the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look at that annoying kid. If he dies, it\u2019ll be very boring.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for Feng Yixuan\u2019s reply before skipping out.</p><br/><p>The room quieted down, leaving behind only Qi Ao Shuang who was breathing calmly and evenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang \u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan extended his hand and gently grasped Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand. He muttered to himself, \u201cWhy did I feel that you were a stranger to me just now?\u201d \u201cHow can there be such a feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was still sleeping. Her eyelashes that were like small brushes were trembling slightly. At this moment, she saw a strange scene.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun also eyed him as he approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood evening. Could I borrow a bit of your fire?\u201d Carter\u2019s icy face revealed a trace of a smile.</p><br/><p>Prince Banis blinked. Had he seen wrong? The stone-faced man could smile? The knights were even more shocked. It was the first time they had seen this powerful person take the initiative to talk to someone else, especially to strangers! The alluring woman\u2019s eyes also darkened, watching with narrowed eyes.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s response left Carter stiff.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s not enough room,\u201d Qi Aoshuang responded heedlessly. She took a sip of her cup, not even giving Carter so much as a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t there a lot of room?\u201d Carter then did something that shocked prince Banis and the rest even more. He smiled as he plopped down next to Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>How shameless! Qi Aoshuang was annoyed. She did not want to have any connections to this person. He was definitely difficult to deal with. This was her intuition. She did not want problems to arise.</p><br/><p>Carter eyed Qi Aoshuang fixedly. What he said next made Qi Aoshuang shiver. \u201cYoung lady, your voice is very similar to a person I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>He watched Qi Aoshuang intensely to see her reaction.</p><br/><p>But Qi Aoshuang showed no change in expression. \u201cWhat? I\u2019ve never met someone like you before.\u201d She paused, then said venomously, \u201cIt takes a certain level of skill to flatter others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Carter\u2019s expression. He examined Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression more closely, but was not able to discern any clues. He was certain that this ordinary looking girl\u2019s voice was the exact same as the person who had been seeking to battle, Claire. Claire Hill was like fireworks, falling after displaying her peak splendor. Naturally, he did not believe she had committed matricide in order to ingratiate herself with the Temple. Was this ordinary looking girl the previously shining Claire? He inspected her face with rapt attention, but was disappointed to see no similarities. Her every freckle was so realistic, there was no way she was using some kind of disguise. There was no traces of uses of potions either. It seems he had made a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI must have mistakened you for someone else, my mistake.\u201d Carter smiled, standing up to bow apologetically, then left.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun did not respond, continuing to make tea and roast meat. Right now, all they needed to do was wait for Ben to come out of his reclusive training.</p><br/><p>Prince Banis\u2019s party and Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun lodged on each side of the ravine, mutually ignoring the other.</p><br/><p>The night passed by peacefully.</p><br/><p>As day broke, the sun rays filled the entire ravine. The crisp bird calls could be heard.</p><br/><p>Prince Banis left his tent a little gloomily. Just as before, the captivating women did not let him do anything to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear\u2026\u201d Prince Banis\u2019s hand was pulled tenderly. \u201cAre you still mad? I already said as long as you fulfill this wish of mine, I\u2019ll become yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling the soft sensation on his elbow, Banis discarded his floomy thoughts. He wrapped his arm around her curvy waist, nodding. \u201cAlright, baby. You promised me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, of course, darling,\u201d the flirtatious woman responded coyly. Her eyes flashed with loathing, but it disappeared in a wink. Inwardly, she cursed, this disgusting pig. Did he think she was some kind of playing? If he wasn\u2019t born a prince, he would be a nobody. She just needed the cretin to attract the dragon race\u2019s attention for a moment. Humph. Whether he lived or died did not matter to her, as long as she could get that thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, get up! Get ready to leave!\u201d Banis coldly commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, where are we going?\u201d the captain asked, unsettled. Was their idiot prince really that dumb?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course into Dragon Valley,\u201d Banis replied haughtily.</p><br/><p>The captain\u2019s mouth dropped, staring at the prince incredulously. Wasn\u2019t that certain death? All just for that woman?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just take a look,\u201d Banis urged impatiently. Although he was perverted, he was not a fool. He knew how strong dragons were, but the beauty only wished to witness a dragon, that was all. It couldn\u2019t be that difficult. They would just enter to take a look, then leave immediately.</p><br/><p>Just take a look? That simple? A trace of doubt flashed in the captain\u2019s eyes. That bimbo only wanted to take a look? Perhaps it was so.</p><br/><p>After waking up and eating, they saw Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun had lazily just come out of their tents.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaby, let\u2019s go. You\u2019ll finally be able to meet a dragon. However, we must be careful.\u201d Banis smiled, pulling the alluring beauty\u2019s waist close to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, dear.\u201d The alluring woman smiled charmingly. Banis nearly swooned.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarter, you must protect my baby, ok?\u201d Banis turned to face the cold-faced Carter.</p><br/><p>Carter\u2019s face remained impassive. \u201cI am only responsible for your safety.\u201d His meaning was clear; he would not protect the woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Prince Banis\u2019s face darkened, about to explode into anger. But the alluring woman pulled him back, smiling. \u201cDear, you just need to protect me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, baby, I\u2019ll definitely protect you.\u201d Prince Banis nodded repeatedly, infatuated.</p><br/><p>The beauty gave him a lovely smile, but inwardly, she was disgusted with the arrogant prince. As her gaze passed by Carter, her eyes flashed venomously. She laughed in her heart. No matter, she had not planned on relying on them to protect her from the start. They only needed to attract the dragons\u2019 attention for a moment, that way she could infiltrate and steal that thing\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang watched as they packed up their stuff. As they started to walk to Dragon Valley, she frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang, what do you think?\u201d Leng Lingyun asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat brainless prince was persuaded to enter Dragon Valley, but I can\u2019t tell what that woman\u2019s intentions are.\u201d Qi Aoshuang took a bite of bread that Leng Lingyun had handed her. White Emperor and Black Feather were jumping around in the tent. They had been hiding there since last night so that none of Banis\u2019s men could see them.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun crouched down, passing a piece of bread into the flap of the tent so that the two little things would settle down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to follow them to see what happens?\u201d Leng Lingyun stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be hasty. Let\u2019s first wait and see.\u201d Qi Aoshuang watched as their figures disappeared out of the ravine. Carter also followed, clothed in pure white. Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes lingered on his figure the longest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be quite tragic, I imagine.\u201d Leng Lingyun responded indifferently.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled. \u201cDid I just detect dark humor in the venerable Divine Prince\u2019s voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Leng Lingyun responded with the exact same tone.</p><br/><p>But then something strange happened.</p><br/><p><i>Roar\u2026.</i></p><br/><p>There came the sound of an angered dragon from the end of the ravine.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun followed Qi Aoshuang\u2019s suggestion to wait and see. The result was pitiful, as expected.</p><br/><p>The entrance of Dragon Valley:</p><br/><p>The patrolling dragon angrily roared, the sound reverberating in their ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn humans, pay for your idiocy!\u201d the dragon roared. Terrifying dragon breath started to descend upon them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease let me explain, venerable dragon,\u201d Bani started to say, large beads of sweat on his forehead. As his group entered Dragon Valley, they suddenly ran into the dragon just as Qi Aoshuang had and was being berated. He originally thought that after fulfilling the beauty\u2019s request to see the dragon, they could return safely. However, the woman suddenly attacked the dragon with magic. It was only a small fireball, but it hit the dragon\u2019s nostril accurately. It was clearly provocative, hitting a sensitive spot. Then the woman ducked behind him, declaring he had forced her to do so. After successfully angering the dragon, she slipped away. Prince Banis realized he had been completely manipulated, but there was no point in explaining anything now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d Carter cursed silently. He stepped forward, gripped Banis under one arm, then quickly ran out the mouth of the valley. This all happened in a matter of seconds. The dragon was mighty, but with Carter\u2019s strength, running away was not anything difficult. Unfortunately, the remaining knights took the brunt of the dragon\u2019s anger. Dragon breath blasted. Soon, knights became scorched earth. The surviving knights lost the will to fight, all running towards the mouth of the valley with all their might. No one noticed the alluring woman with her cold grin. She was concealed behind a large true expertly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun watched as Carter ran out with the previously arrogant prince pinned under his arm, while behind him, knights ran as hard as they could with looks of terror.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

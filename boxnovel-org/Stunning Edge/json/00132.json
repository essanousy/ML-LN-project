For the eighth level, she had to face seven strikes of lightning!</p><br/><p>Without Golden Lotus\u2019s protection, how was she going to withstand seven strikes?</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s rapid departure left most confused. All of their gazes followed after the figure leaving in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Without a word, Feng Yixuan extended his wind wings and chased in pursuit. Shui Wenmo cursed in a low voice and dashed after them on foot.</p><br/><p>Jean and the others naturally understood what was going on. Claire had another breakthrough!</p><br/><p>The emperor frowned then turned to ask Li Mingyu, \u201cDuke Li, what is going on?\u201d Li Mingyu\u2019s face was full of worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, we have some private matters to attend to. May we take our leave?\u201d Li Mingyu requested, watching CLaire\u2019s figure disappear into the distance, farther and farther away.</p><br/><p>Before the emperor could reply, An Lisha said hastily, \u201cYour majesty, please take care of the situation. I will explain once I return.\u201d Immediately after, An Lisha flew up and followed after Feng Yixuan in pursuit.</p><br/><p>Jean and the rest also hurriedly left, dashing out the city.</p><br/><p>The emperor frowned slightly, watching An Lisha disappear into the distance, but he still immediately waved his hand to settle the crowd. The stage had already been destroyed so the tournament could only be delayed until tomorrow.</p><br/><p>In the air, Claire flew as fast as she could followed by Feng Yixuan and An Lisha. In the sky, thunder clouds were already amassing.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s heart sunk lower and lower. She had already sensed that the lightning would be different this time. Without Golden Lotus, would she be able to withstand them all?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire! Claire!\u201d Feng Yixuan anxiously called from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell are you shouting for!\u201d An Lisha said. She speedily gave chase. After passing by Feng Yixuan, she caught up to Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me!\u201d An Lisha grabbed Claire by the wrist immediately, forcing her to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Claire looked at An Lisha with shock. This woman was the one from that night! With absolute certainty!</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, what are you doing?\u201d Feng Yixuan also reached them.</p><br/><p>What? This woman was Feng Yixuan\u2019s mother?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, your heavenly tribulation is coming, correct?\u201d An Lisha\u2019s words made Claire freeze with shock. How did Feng Yixuan\u2019s mother know?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so I cannot stay inside the city. The heavenly tribulation will not be so small this time. If I stayed, many people would have been involved.\u201d Claire did not try to hide anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d An Lisha grabbed Feng Yixuan with her other hand and made all three of them stand together. Then she pulled out a scroll and tore it. With a white flash of light, the three\u2019s figures disappeared on the spot.</p><br/><p>Also able to fly, Leng Lingyun was the first to arrive. From far away, he could see the three had disappeared abruptly, so he understood that the woman had used a small scale spatial teleportation scroll! An extremely valuable spatial teleportation scroll that could teleport up to five people!</p><br/><p>Where did they go? Leng Lingyun frowned, scanning about, but unable to find anything. He looked up at the sky. The dark clouds were dispersing rapidly. No! Not dispersing, but quickly chasing after another direction! They disappeared in an instant!</p><br/><p>Jean and the rest had also arrived at this moment, but they only saw Leng Lingyun floating in the air alone, his expression solemn.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun, where\u2019s Claire?\u201d Summer scanned around anxiously, only to see no one.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was taken away.\u201d Leng Lingyun said quietly. He slowly descended.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaken away? Who took her away?\u201d Summer grew worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe woman who had just been chasing, Lagark\u2019s minister of defense, An Lisha.\u201d Of course Leng Lingyun knew An Lisha\u2019s identity. Although the main temple of the Temple of Light was not located in Lagark, the Temple of Light was very familiar with the state of affairs in Lagark.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Walter exclaimed. \u201cShe took away Claire? To where? What does she want? Why didn\u2019t you stop her? What if she wants to kill Claire now that Claire is wounded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter\u2019s worries were not unfounded. The relationship between Amparkland and Lagark was very strained. With the strength Claire had displayed, Lagark would definitely take notice and be on guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not know. When I had arrived, An Lisha had already taken Claire away with the spatial teleportation scroll. But you should not worry because Claire is currently a priest of the Temple of Light. Lagark will definitely not instigate a fight with the Temple of Light.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s voice was low, but exceptionally certain. Even the most successful and strongest country, Amparkland, would not dare to go against the Temple of Light, not to mention Lagark, whose strength was below that of Amparkland\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, Claire is safe?\u201d Summer let out a long sigh of relief. She had almost forgotten that Claire was currently a priest of the Temple of Light!</p><br/><p>Jean frowned deeply. Even if Claire was safe, where was she? Where did that woman take her to? What was her purpose?</p><br/><p>Jean stood silently, not moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing will happen to Claire. If my guess is correct, that woman wants to help her,\u201d Leng Lingyun said in a serious voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Where are they?\u201d At this moment, Shui Wenmo had also bounded over energetically, glorious, but he only saw Jean and the rest of the group standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was brought away. An Lisha used a spatial teleportation scroll,\u201d Leng Lingyun said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya! Why didn\u2019t they bring me too?\u201d Shui Wenmo yelled angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where they went?\u201d Jean turned and said to Shui Wenmo in a low voice, a trace of worry evident in his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Shui Wenmo shrugged, serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, then don\u2019t say such misleading words!\u201d Summer humphed coldly. She had become a bit angered seeing Shui Wenmo\u2019s attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, long time no see, little thief,\u201d Shui Wenmo laughed and greeted Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Summer turned away, ignoring him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, Lady An wants to help Claire\u2026\u201d Li Mingyu said with a low voice. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know where they went, so all we can do is wait.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen looked worried, wishing to speak, but stopped after she caught Li Mingyu\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s return and wait. There\u2019s no way Aunty An will harm her future daughter in law. Perhaps they will appear with great bravado.\u201d Shui Wenmo stretched lazily. Clearly, he had great faith in An Lisha.</p><br/><p>Shui Wenmo did not notice that his usage of the phrase daughter in law had caused a ripple in a few people\u2019s hearts when they heard this.</p><br/><p>Future daughter in law? Why did this phrase cause a sense of unease? Jean lowered his gaze. He silently turned away and left. Leng Lingyun watched Jean\u2019s retreating figure, sighed softly in his heart, then followed. Walter cursed internally. Just because you say she\u2019s An Lisha\u2019s future daughter in law she will be? F*ck, what a joke.</p><br/><p>In the end, they all returned.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Claire opened her eyes and discovered that she had arrived somewhere unfathomable. With a sweep of her gaze, she found that there were a few wooden houses circled by a low, wooden fence with a few large trees nearby. It seemed like a very ordinary farmer\u2019s home, but once she looked in a different direction, she discovered what was strange. Lifting her head, she saw that the blue sky was without clouds, yet there were birds flying. She squinted. Those small birds were seabirds! This was an island?! Listening closely, Claire actually heard the sound of intense wind whipping past. Claire concentrated her senses and was shocked once more. The small island was surrounded by a wind barrier. An unusual, intense layer of wind surrounded the small island, isolating it completely from the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026 master, hurry and come outside!\u201d An Lisha yelled at the top of her lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hell are you shouting about? You just arrived and you\u2019re already yelling!\u201d An energetic yet coarse voice retorted from inside the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lightning is about to strike, how could I not shout! Come out to block it right now!\u201d An Lisha was even more rude, her voice yelling back louder than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What lightning? What you\u2019re cultivating will not draw any lightning.\u201d Even though the voice inside the house sounded doubtful, there was the sound of quick footsteps.</p><br/><p>An old man in faint blue appeared at the entrance of the wooden house, his pair of eyes bright. He emitted an ineffable, bold aura. His brows and beard were already white, long, yet combed neatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, hurry and save us! The lightning will arrive any second!\u201d An Lisha anxiously said.</p><br/><p>But the old man ignored An Lisha and turned to Feng Yixuan, smiling widely. \u201cOi, you brat. You\u2019re already this big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, old man, you\u2019ve become more energetic. Your brows and beard became even more manly,\u201d Feng Yixuan laughed as he replied.</p><br/><p>Claire was a bit shocked. Feng Yixuan, who was usually so unruly and arrogant, was actually acting so lovable and obedient?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The old man did something that made Claire go . She watched as the old man pulled out a small comb out of one of his wide sleeves and started combing his brows carefully, then his beard. He appeared extremely pleased.</p><br/><p>Now Feng Yixuan switched to the topic at hand. \u201cOld man, hurry and help my future wife, and block the lightning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! You brat, you actually started chasing after girls?!\u201d the old man exclaimed loudly. Only then did his gaze land on Claire. Claire was currently in a very sorry state, her clothes torn, and although her wounds had already stopped bleeding, her clothes were still stained with blotches of red. She looked very terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d An Lisha started getting a bit urgent. Storm clouds had already started gathering overhead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d went the old man lazily. Then he looked up towards the sky and stroked his beard gently. Only then did he say disdainfully, \u201cWhat the heck are you getting worried for, isn\u2019t it just seven lightning strikes?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was a peaceful remote town close to the Mountain of Lost Souls. Although it was far away, it was very prosperous, because the Mountain of Lost Souls was also called Death Mountain. There were numerous magic beasts and also plenty of precious ores, but wanting to enter to get some easy money was life threatening and extremely dangerous, so many people would make preparations in this small town before entering. Some people would use up almost all their money here because no one could know if they could ever come out again, ever have the chance to enjoy life again. That\u2019s why although it was a small town, it had everything you could think of: bars, inns, all kinds of stores. You could buy ore, magic cores, magic beast furs and bodies.</p><br/><p>It was a very chaotic place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to lick it till it\u2019s clean, do you understand?\u201d A vulgar voice sounded from within the bar.</p><br/><p>It was followed by a peal of coarse laughter.</p><br/><p>The bar was filled and had no empty seats. Sitting in the middle next to a table was a scar faced man pointing at his thigh, bellowing at a waitress who was about to start crying. The scar faced man\u2019s thigh was soaked with wine all the way to the groin area.</p><br/><p>The waitress was on the verge of crying. She knew that she had run into trouble now. It was the scary looking man who had purposely knocked into her in the first place so that his pants had been soaked and now he was saying such filthy words. Lick where?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou slut, you can\u2019t understand me? You make my pants wet, now I\u2019m all sticky with wine, how annoying. Start licking now!\u201d The scar faced man started hollering again. He even reached out and pulled the waitress\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Vulgar laughter chorused throughout the whole bar, but no one helped. Instead, they were all waiting to see a good show. The owner of the barshop clenched his teeth, wanting to stand up for the waitress and protect her, but seeing the scar-faced person\u2019s warning expression, he started to hesitate. The people there were all unordinary, not someone he, such an insignificant person, could resist against. The other server, a man, wasn\u2019t there. If he was there, then the situation wouldn\u2019t have been so out of hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I didn\u2019t mean it, customer\u2026\u201d the waitress sobbed feebly, looking pleadingly at her boss, the owner.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you slut\u2026\u201d But then, when he hadn\u2019t finished speaking, a cold light flashed past, followed by a streak of blood in mid air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d The waitress\u2019s shriek nearly blew off the rooftop, because currently, the hand that was holding onto her had already left its owner! The hand just held onto her palm limply.</p><br/><p>The scar-faced man was staring vacantly at the splash of fresh blood in the air, when suddenly, a flash of pain brought him back to his senses! His hand had been cut off!</p><br/><p>A howl immediately covered up the waitress\u2019s shriek. The man stared with bulging eyes at a young man who walked coldly past him. The young man strode indifferently to the bar\u2019s counter and sat down quietly. \u201cOwner, get me some sweet wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner was afraid to even breathe out loud and immediately went to pour the sweet wine. He had seen everything that had just happened very clearly! It was this young man who had cut off the scar-faced man\u2019s hand with one slash of his sword!</p><br/><p>The bar went deathly silent. Everybody froze at the same time. They all stared, dumbstruck, at the young man who had suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard! Ah! You actually dare to chop off my hand! Ah\u2026 I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d The scar faced man hysterical howl sounded once more in the room, bringing everybody who had been staring blankly back to their senses. The young man sitting at the counter didn\u2019t turn around, didn\u2019t even blink. Instead, he sat there emotionlessly and gracefully sipped the sweet wine that the owner had brought. The scar faced man stood up abruptly, about to dash over to the young man sitting at the counter, but just as he took a few steps forward, a dagger flew, accurately stabbing his foot, sticking him in place. Everybody\u2019s ears were pierced, the mournful cry truly painfully loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pity, my dagger has been tainted.\u201d At this moment, the bar\u2019s door was pushed open once more, a golden-haired blue eyed beautiful woman appearing before everybody\u2019s eyes, looking regretful.</p><br/><p>Everybody turned around to look at the door. Under the harsh light, they could only see that a few people were standing at the doorway. After they could see clearly, they all gulped. A man who looked somewhat similar to her was standing behind the beautiful woman, also golden haired and blue eyed. The two\u2019s faces were both ice cold, not a trace of warmth in their eyes, making one\u2019s heart shudder. Behind them was a young man whose face was ice cold, a sword strapped to his waist, had a steady gait, and breathed lightly. Everybody could see with a glance he was a warrior of high cultivation. Meanwhile, the black clothed black haired man\u2019s expression was overbearing while he emitted a dangerous aura with every fibre of his being. The delicate and pretty man in a long robe standing next to him was also unordinary. He was actually a magician! Only the two girls standing in the back seemed harmless. But once they saw the hands of the girl with the bow on her back, they all changed their minds. An ordinary archer wouldn\u2019t have such thick calluses. Only the man in the back with golden hair who kept on smiling looked harmless.</p><br/><p>Watching the crowd, he smiled and said softly, \u201cTruly sorry for the inconvenience, my leader is moody today.\u201d After the gentle golden-haired man apologized, he strode in swiftly and stopped next to the person whose foot had been stabbed in place. He bent down slightly and pulled out the dagger, and then, without warning, gently sliced the neck of the howling scar faced man. Smiling, he wiped the dagger with a napkin from a nearby table, and then elegantly handed the dagger to the golden haired woman behind him.</p><br/><p>The scar faced man twitched as he fell over, blood spraying on the ground into a strange, sinister design.</p><br/><p>An alarming chill instantly filled the entire bar. The gentle and elegant man was actually such a terrifying and dangerous person!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the atmosphere was so terrifying, everybody in the bar was in cold sweat. Everybody got up one by one quietly, about to escape the place that was so constraining, their minds were about to collapse. Just as some people left their seats, the gentle golden haired man turned and smiled brightly. \u201cEverybody, don\u2019t forget to pay money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some were unable to bear this kind of pressure, throwing down money and running away while shrieking. They had seen murders before, but not such a graceful one!</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander, what were you doing, running here first by yourself and leaving us behind.\u201d Camille smiled gently, sitting next to the woman who was pretending to be a man, Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Clare only coldly humphed once and stopped talking. She raised her wine glass and continuing to drink as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are hot tempered. Didn\u2019t you only just carry the wind leopard for a few Li.because you lost a bet?\u201d Li Yuewen sneered as she walked forward. She said righteously, \u201cNot only am I increasing your arm strength, carrying burdens is also another important part of training.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cheated!\u201d Claire clenched and gritted her teeth. When she discovered the trick, it was already too late.</p><br/><p>\u201dIf you didn\u2019t discover it, then don\u2019t call it a cheat. You still have much to learn,\u201d Li Yuewen scolded.</p><br/><p>Claire stopped talking, turned around, and sipped her wine. It had always been her riding on Little Leopard, but today, their positions had changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, thank you for saving me\u2026\u2026\u201d A soft and gentle voice said from in between the two.</p><br/><p>Claire turned around, and saw the pale faced waitress who was struggling to smile. When Claire turned around once more, she saw that the dead man\u2019s severed hand was still holding onto the girl\u2019s palm. No wonder her expression was so unsightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet it off of her,\u201d Claire ordered Jean, who was right behind her, emotionlessly.</p><br/><p>Jean obeyed. He stepped forward, grabbed the dead man\u2019s hand, then pulled it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you very much,\u201d The waitress thanked them hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank us, it was nothing.\u201d Claire indifferently waved for the waitress to leave, then looked at the owner and said, \u201cOwner, do you have any rugosa rose tea?\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201dAh, truly sorry, customer. We, we only have wine and water here.\u201d The owner replied shakily. He had just seen the young man\u2019s terrifying way of doing things and his companion\u2019s gruesome actions, so he spoke more cautiously than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander, such a small place can\u2019t have any flowers.\u201d Camille softly sighed.</p><br/><p>Everybody behind Camille rolled their eyes. It was all because of this guy that Claire had become so evil! Claire simply had to drink rugosa rose tea after venting out her anger, but after searching the entire town, they couldn\u2019t find any.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, um I grow roses in my garden. If you don\u2019t mind, you can come to my house. I have stored some dried flowers too,\u201d the waitress said cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so? Then let\u2019s go.\u201d Claire immediately stood up, about leave.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen rolled her eyes, wanting to scold her, but thinking of Claire\u2019s dark mood today, she let it go.</p><br/><p>\u201cOwner, my little brother will be back soon, tell him I will first bring my saviors home.\u201d The waitress called to the bar owner.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, okay.\u201d The owner hurriedly nodded his head, seeing off the scary group to the distance.</p><br/><p>The waitress took off her apron then led them out the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat only knows how to live it up.\u201d Li Yuewen followed behind, muttering all the while, unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have trained her harsh enough recently, let her take a break today.\u201d Li Mingyu said, feeling a slight headache. On their journey, Li Yue Wen\u2019s methods of training has reached a severe level. Claire had to be on guard even when sleeping, or else her throat would have been slit open. Li Yue Wen often planned surprise attacks at night to develop Claire\u2019s alertness. As a result, Claire fought with dark circles under her eyes and resisted her sleepiness as she was constantly awakened by Li Yue Wen\u2019s sneak attacks. Her alertness improved, but the dark circles under her eyes became more severe too.</p><br/><p>The young girl walked in front, but continuously looked back at the young man behind her. He had golden hair and lovely green eyes. Although his dark circles were a bit severe, they couldn\u2019t conceal his peerless aura. It was this young man who had just saved herself from the clutches of the evil person, otherwise, who knows how it would have ended. Her little brother was out too. If it wasn\u2019t for this young man, then the result would be unthinkable. The young girl\u2019s heart began to beat faster.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Claire was looking completely unhappy. The wind leopard followed them from behind at the very back. When it was carried by Claire, it had been terrified out of its wits. Now, it didn\u2019t even dare to get close to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy family is only I and my little brother. Today, he went to the Mountain of Lost Souls. That crazy little, he said that recently there some kind of strange beast was about to come into being and that he wants to capture it and sell it for money.\u201d The girl started to talk to Claire. She didn\u2019t know what to say, so she only brought up the topic of her annoying little brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange beast?\u201d Camille became interested. He asked, \u201cDid your little brother say what kind of strange beast it was?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did, that lying brat, he said it was a deity beast,\u201d the girl replied helplessly, feeling a slight headache. \u201cHow could a deity beast appear here? And how could he capture it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Deity beast? Li Yuewen and Li Mingyu exchanged glances and both saw doubt within each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, my little brother brags about how he can use a little Dou Qi. He always thinks he\u2019s some kind of expert.\u201d The girl said exasperatedly as she lead everybody to the edge of the small town.</p><br/><p>There was a very small garden, ivy crawling on the wooden fence, the small table and a few chairs under the grape rack in the garden seeming exceptionally comfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactors, please sit down, I will go make tea.\u201d The girl seemed a little embarrassed. \u201cJust sit outside, the rooms are very messy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire lightly nodded her head, and sat down immediately without care for manners. Walter sat down silently immediately after her, because he had noticed there weren\u2019t enough chairs. He didn\u2019t want to stand, so he sat down first. Camille was smiling as he followed the girl inside to make the rugosa rose tea.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/stunning-edge-chapter-99\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 99\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/stunning-edge-chapter-101\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 101\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"24319\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

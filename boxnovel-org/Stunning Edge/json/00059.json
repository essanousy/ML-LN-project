He was so angry for Claire, because he clearly showed that he liked Claire. This wasn\u2019t strange.</p><br/><p>But why? Jean\u2019s hand quietly covered his chest. Why was it that just then, when he heard that chamberlain say those words, an inexplicable anger surged here, and became larger and larger?</p><br/><p>Why? Why was it that the moment he heard those words, killing intent immediately arose in his heart? Jean tightened his grip on his sword.</p><br/><p>Claire watched Feng Yixuan take their lives like a god of death, and for a moment, her heart became completely blank. What was this feeling?</p><br/><p>\u201cLandy! Go up. If I die, you won\u2019t get a single penny. My grandfather will even blame you.\u201d The pig skin young master retreated like his life depended on it, then suddenly shouted towards the lower floor.</p><br/><p>The next instant, an intense stream of water winded around the pig skin young master and rushed up, then turned into a dense forest of water arrows, filling the corridor and attacking within it.</p><br/><p>Claire frowned, using all her strength to construct a magic shield, because the magic undulation the other side had was unordinarily intense! Their strength was definitely not weak.</p><br/><p>Mournful cries rose and fell in succession in the corridor, because the water arrows were actually attacking indiscriminately. Besides going past the pig skin young master and not attacking him, everybody in the corridor became targets for the attack.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, after the mournful cries disappeared in the corridor, blood flowed like a river. The entire corridor had been dyed red. The pig skin young master\u2019s chamberlains had all died. And the other guests of the inn who had come out of their rooms all died by being run through by water arrows. Every corpse was riddled with holes!</p><br/><p>Such a malicious method! Not even letting their own men go!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan went back to Claire\u2019s side, coldly watching the entrance of the corridor\u2019s stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh man, so many people died.\u201d Black dragon Ben said nonchalantly while shaking his head, making his way to Claire\u2019s side while watching the corpses that covered the entire floor.</p><br/><p>Then he looked at Claire expectantly, saying, \u201cCan I make my move now? Can I eat that magician?\u201d</p><br/><p>Black dragon Ben was pointing at the magician who had slowly made his way up the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine.\u201d Feng Yixuan said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very poor, I don\u2019t have any money. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll kill you guys. I\u2019ll have money then.\u201d The magician who had made his way up the stairs said such words slowly and woodenly, without any tone or any warmth. \u201cThat\u2019s why, you should all die today. For my money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful.\u201d Claire said softly, frowning.</p><br/><p>This magician was definitely someone unordinary. Claire started to become a little worried, because just then, not only did she use all her strength to construct the magic shield, she had to secretly use Lotus power to block this magician\u2019s water arrow attack.</p><br/><p>Black dragon Ben twitched his mouth helplessly. So annoying, without Claire\u2019s consent, he couldn\u2019t do anything. Annoying, annoying, annoying\u2026. In any case, looks like nothing tonight was related to him, might as well go back to his room and sleep.</p><br/><p>Just when black dragon Ben was about to turn and leave, Claire suddenly said, \u201cBen\u201d quietly, stopping him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Black dragon Ben yawned, completely bored.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ll teach you your first lesson. You don\u2019t need to fight fairly. One against many is the so called group fight. It\u2019s fine to fight with all you\u2019ve got.\u201d Claire said sinisterly. \u201cAlso, just then I told you to resist. You don\u2019t need to resist now. When you need to, you can go back on your word. That\u2019s the second lesson I\u2019m teaching you today, you\u2019re really profiting tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s face froze, the little thief\u2019s mouth twitched, Shui Wenmo opened his mouth wide, Feng Yixuan had an expression of being overwhelmed. Walter just fainted.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the group fight started.</p><br/><p>Part 2: The crisis strikes</p><br/><p>Black dragon Ben gave a strange cry, spitting out a fierce fire ball. Instantly, the water and blood flowing in the corridor were evaporated. The other magician calmly and unhurriedly set up a water shield, but was pushed back by black dragon Ben\u2019s strange strength, but the water shield didn\u2019t break.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your great grandfather!\u201d Black dragon Ben cursed without care for his status. He had only used a third of his strength, but never thought that the other side would be able to resist this attack of his.</p><br/><p>Once again, the magician made his way up, but greeting him was an even more fierce, even more shameless attack. Jean and Shui Wenmo already ran up to give a barrage of attacks. Feng Yixuan was even more shameless, continuously releasing majestic magic. Claire yawned, leaning on the wall and spectating. Ben dragon Ben looked up and down, like he was seeing if there was enough room.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop looking, you\u2019re not allowed to transform!\u201d Claire knew what plan black dragon Ben was making. This despicable, uncultured black dragon wanted to transform and wreck the place.</p><br/><p>Black dragon Ben scratched his head, very depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly go and dispose of him, then run.\u201d Claire directed black dragon Ben.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by run?\u201d Black dragon Ben asked while frowning, not understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really profiting tonight, I\u2019ll teach you your third lesson. When you\u2019ve done an evil deed, quickly leave scene of the crime far away, the faster the better, the farther the better.\u201d Claire taught exceptionally seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean in a moment after we get rid of that person, we\u2019ll quickly go far away from this place?\u201d Black dragon Ben immediately understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, let\u2019s go.\u201d Claire waved her hand, indicating for black dragon Ben to join the \u201cgroup battle\u201d.</p><br/><p>Soon, the strong magician was beaten up to the point that he had no strength left to retaliate.</p><br/><p>He started wailing loudly, \u201cI don\u2019t want money any more, you guys win. No need to say goodbye.\u201d After shouting out these shameless words, the strong magician pulled out a scroll, ripped it, and disappeared,</p><br/><p>Spatial teleportation scroll?!</p><br/><p>Everybody was a little shocked. They never would have thought this kind of person who was hired actually had such a precious magic item.</p><br/><p>Since the \u201cgroup battle\u201d\u2019s opponent was gone, everybody stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re withdrawing from here. The faster, the better, the farther, the better.\u201d Black dragon Ben said seriously to everybody, carrying out Claire\u2019s valuable lesson.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Now Cliff lazily opened his door.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s escape through the window.\u201d Feng Yixuan pointed at a door, indicating for everyone to leave from the window of that room.</p><br/><p>Everybody left through the window one after another. Feng Yixuan lifted his brow and stealthily went down the stairs like a demon. When he found the pig skin young master who was quivering in a corner, his dagger lightly slashed. After he finished silencing him, he quickly returned to meet up with Claire and them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to have a warm bath, boohoo, there wasn\u2019t enough time to take a bath.\u201d The little thief had a sullen expression as everybody madly rushed in the night, hurrying towards the city gates.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can turn back to my original form and spit out some spit for you to wash.\u201d Black dragon Ben said, deadpan serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also warm.\u201d Feng Yixuan added with a vulgar smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cPah! You uncultured, disgusting black dragon! And you\u2019re a prince!\u201d Summer couldn\u2019t hold back her rage.</p><br/><p>Strangely, Ben didn\u2019t attack back and instead, stopped talking, running with everyone else.</p><br/><p>Walter sighed bitterly. These people who had stayed with Claire for a while were actually led astray.</p><br/><p>The group sneakily crossed over the city walls, madly running and disappearing into the night. If their identities were discovered, there would definitely be a dispute between countries.</p><br/><p>Naturally, in the end, the group slept outdoors.</p><br/><p>Everybody was tired out by running madly the whole way. They carelessly put up tents, then slept.</p><br/><p>Just when they had slept for a little, a gale of wind came, blowing their tents so hard the tents swayed. Then, the sound of many roars came from the distance sporadically.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow noisy! Who could sleep? I\u2019ll go slaughter them.\u201d Black dragon Ben got up angrily, walking towards the depths of the woods.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic beasts?\u201d Naturally, everybody was awakened, all hearing the distant roars.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wind attributed leopard and an earth attributed snake.\u201d Black dragon Ben scratched his ears, about to go towards the source of the sounds.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t say a word and only went too, following black dragon Ben stealthily.</p><br/><p>Cliff crawled out his tent, set up a magic barrier, yawned, then crawled back to continue sleeping.</p><br/><p>Summer also went back and continued sleeping.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo sleepy. Claire, Ben went to slaughter the magic beasts, what are you going for?\u201d Feng Yixuan yawned, looked at the tents, then looked at Claire\u2019s figure, debating whether or not to follow or continue sleeping. Perhaps Claire was going to get beast cores? With Claire\u2019s personality, that was something definitely plausible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, go. I\u2019ll be sleeping first.\u201d Shui Wenmo kicked Feng Yixuan\u2019s butt, kicking Feng Yixuan out the tent.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan rubbed his eyes that were about to close and followed Claire with Jean.</p><br/><p>It was only when they reached the place the magic beasts were roaring did they see what was going on clearly. A black wind leopard was currently fighting a gigantic earth snake. The leopard seemed to have used up a lot of strength, while the snake was was actually getting more brave as the fight went on. It was constantly touching the ground using its tail and making earth spikes, shooting them at the wind leopard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually both seventh grade beasts and also mature.\u201d Feng Yixuan said with surprise, looking at the wind leopard and big snake. This place actually had such high level beasts, something really incomprehensible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo annoying. Are they going to let me sleep or not?\u201d Black dragon Ben grumbled with a low voice, hearing the roars of the two magic beasts. Just when he was about to use dragon pressure to intimidate the two magic beasts and then slaughter them, Claire said, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Black dragon Ben asked, not understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust shield me, I\u2019ll get rid of that snake. The wind leopard will be mine.\u201d A sliver of a smile appeared from the corner of Claire\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with that little cat?\u201d Ben asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll understand tomorrow.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t explain and instead ran up, attacking the big snake while maintaining a distance.</p><br/><p>The next moment would be accurately called inhuman oppression.</p><br/><p>The giant snake had been broken into segments, magic core extracted, dead with a dismembered corpse.</p><br/><p>The wind leopard froze. When if came back to its senses, the first thing it did was run, wanting to run far away from the dangerous being.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

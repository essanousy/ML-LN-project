He said angrily, \u201cSir Roman, your granddaughter didn\u2019t want fight with my disciple, but wanted Claire\u2019s life! This is attempted murder, murder? Do you, sir, know what that word means?\u201d Cliff\u2019s expression was extremely serious. The word \u2018sir\u2019 was completely sarcastic. Would an esteemed Duke not understand what murder meant?</p><br/><p>Alice Roman\u2019s expression instantly turned pale. Of course she understood what those murder meant. Once this accusation became permanent, it would be hard to say what going to happen to her next.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan was silent the whole time with slitted eyes. Showing dislike publicly was not wise, and that didn\u2019t mean the Hill clan was some kind of pushover. He had already turned a blind eye the duel from last time and this time was actually an attempt to take Claire\u2019s life. But it looked like there was no need for him to speak. Cliff, that ultra-defensive person, would force the emperor to deal with it properly.</p><br/><p>The emperor glanced at the angry faced Cliff and the others who were cold faced, slightly sighing in his heart. This Alice could have offended anybody, but she had to try and murder Claire. Now with the people from the Temple of Light as proof, if it wasn\u2019t dealt with fairly, not only would he not be able to justify for Duke Hill, he wouldn\u2019t be able to justify it to the Temple of Light and Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Alice Roman is imprisoned, she shall be hanged.\u201d The emperor closed his eyes, not looking at Duke Roman\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change and the other\u2019s were also calm. Alice\u2019s eyes widened, then slowly closed. It wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s fault but herself for not listening to Grandfather, and instead provoking someone she couldn\u2019t afford to provoke. Now even death wouldn\u2019t be enough. She just hoped that no other family members would be implicated.</p><br/><p>Duke Roman\u2019s complexion instantly paled. He knelt down abruptly, \u201cYour highness, please pardon her. I would rather resign my post as the minister of finance, please pardon, your highness.\u201d Alice, who had been sitting at the back, instantly looked up, shocked and also torn seeing Duke Roman, seeing her own grandfather actually do such a thing for her.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s eyes instantly flashed open. He frowned, staring at the old man kneeling before him. A trace of fiery anger passed through his eyes. He actually resigned for this situation!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Very good! You dare to threaten me now?\u201d The emperor stood up abruptly, staring angrily at the old man kneeling before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour servant, doesn\u2019t dare. Your servant is only hurried to defend the victim.\u201d Duke Roman said fearfully, but didn\u2019t give any indication that he was going to rise. Alice\u2019s eyes flashed with remorse and pain. She wanted to dash up there, but was pulled back by her cousin.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. Since it\u2019s like this, I\u2019ll help you. Starting from today, you aren\u2019t the minister of finance any more. You\u2019re also not a duke any more, but a baron. Alice will not have any titles for her entire life. All Roman officials will drop three ranks!\u201d The emperor seemed to be truly angered now. It was the first time that a minister dared to threaten him.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan squinted without a word. He had worked for the government for so many years, so naturally, he understood the emperor\u2019s nature. Nobody was allowed to challenge the emperor\u2019s authority. Did Duke Roman really not know?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour servant accepts your order. Many thanks, your highness, for sparing Alice.\u201d Duke Roman tottered as he got up. It was like he had aged ten years in an instant.</p><br/><p>The emperor coldly humphed, then glanced at Duke Gordan and said, \u201cDuke Hill, do you have any objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone, your servant has no objections.\u201d Duke Gordan said quietly with a lowered head.</p><br/><p>The emperor glanced at the Duke Roman, who had his head lowered. \u201cHumph!\u201d He left, sleeves flying, without a care that others were still there. Of course, under this circumstance, nobody took offense at the emperor\u2019s attitude.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Duke Gordan\u2019s mood soared. Now there was a vacancy for the minister of finance, he needed to get someone he trusted to that position.</p><br/><p>Claire watched Alice rush forward and support Duke Roman, her gaze complex, all sorts of feelings arising. Suddenly, in an instant, she felt a envious of Alice. She had such a grandfather who would protect her at any cost. It was truly praiseworthy that such a situation actually existed in this competitive world.</p><br/><p>And so, Alice and her cousin supported Duke Roman as they left slowly. The moment she stepped out the entrance, Alice turned and looked intensely at Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire understood the gaze.</p><br/><p>Deep hatred, hatred that seeped into the bones!</p><br/><p>It was an irreconcilable hatred!</p><br/><p>And so, the matter was dealt with.</p><br/><p>While Duke Gordan was extremely happy on the inside, he maintained an unsatisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine prince, fortunately, you saved Claire today. I thank you with the all my heart. Sir Cliff, you stepped forward bravely for Claire today, I thank you with utmost respect. Sir Lawrence, Divine princess, many thanks for your defence today. If you all don\u2019t mind, may I invite everybody to dinner to express my thanks?\u201d Duke Gordan said, exceptionally cordial. Naturally, he was planning something. He had truly gotten lucky today, having the chance to establish good relations with these influential people, especially the people of the Temple of Light. The relationship between royal authority and divine right had always been very subtle. Maintaining a good relationship with them on the outside only had benefits.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s no need for his grace to mind. It was only a small effort.\u201d Clearly, Leng Lingyun disliked formalities, tactfully declining quietly.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the others didn\u2019t agree. They also didn\u2019t like such formalities.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in ten more days it will be Claire\u2019s birthday. I hope that when the time comes, everybody will do us the honor of coming.\u201d Duke Gordan was worthy of being an old fox, immediately adding this on.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Claire, your birthday is soon?\u201d Cliff and Lawrence asked at the same time, smiling widely. After saying that, the two turned to glare at each other at the same time.</p><br/><p>Claire was a bit at a loss. Birthday? She remembered that there seemed to be a day like that, but it seemed like all of them were celebrated with Mother. She didn\u2019t have any deep impressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does my disciple\u2019s birthday have to do with you? What are getting so emotional for?\u201d Cliff glared at Lawrence.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire almost became my disciple. As her elder, of course I care and need to send a gift.\u201d Lawrence said nonsense without looking embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPah! Since did my darling disciple almost become your disciple, say that again!\u201d Cliff grabbed Lawrence.</p><br/><p>Then the two left noisily, not caring for everybody behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will definitely go to Claire\u2019s birthday. Today, I\u2019ll just take my leave. I just returned to the capital, so I have some matters to deal with at the temple of Light.\u201d Leng Lingyun replied politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? Great! We will be honored with your presence.\u201d Gordan smiled slightly, but was exceptionally happy.</p><br/><p>Shock flashed through Liuxue Qing\u2019s eyes. She almost thought she heard wrong. Leng Lingyun had agreed to attend a boring banquet? He hated those the most! Many lady nobles had invited him before and he turned them all down, but today he had agreed so quickly. Was this still only because Xuanxuan liked Claire?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine princess, do you have time to go?\u201d Duke Gordan\u2019s words pulled Liuxue Qing back to her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll come with the divine prince.\u201d Liuxue Qing smiled warmly, extremely elegant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe would be truly honored.\u201d Duke Gordan smiled widely, his mood very obvious.</p><br/><p>Claire hadn\u2019t said anything the whole time, because she felt uncomfortable. First, when Alice\u2019s family dropped in status, second, because of Duke Gordan\u2019s actions. Claire knew clearly that their drop in status wasn\u2019t because the emperor was overly shielding her, but because Duke Roman did his best to protect his granddaughter that the emperor had been enraged and it had come to this. Suddenly, Claire felt a little conflicted. If her existence became went against the Hill clan\u2019s interests one day, then which one would Duke Gordan choose?</p><br/><p>From when everybody left the palace to when Liuxue Qing was going onto her carriage, her gaze had never left the furry meatball on Claire\u2019s head. As the carriage started, Liuxue Qing drew back the curtains lightly and started at the figure that became smaller and smaller, frowning and pondering, Suddenly, Liuxue Qing\u2019s pupils widened.</p><br/><p>She remembered! That fur ball was the furball on the black dragon\u2019s back who had appeared on the day the goddess of Light\u2019s gift!</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing stifled her instinct to to cry out and secretly glanced at Leng Lingyun, who was sitting next to her. She understood that if she told Leng Lingun now, it would only make him dislike her. This matter needed to be told to the pope, if she told Leng Lingyun after confirming, it wouldn\u2019t be too late. If it was really related to Claire, that wasn\u2019t necessarily good either. Leng Lingyun\u2019s attitude towards that girl was getting better and better. If it continued on, there would be trouble.</p><br/><p>Currently, Claire was rubbing Little Leopard\u2019s head, talking to Duke Gordan.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, come back home. Since such a thing happened today, your mother will definitely come back to see you. If she knew you and your father\u2019s relationship was so bad, she would grieve.\u201d Naturally, Duke Gordan knew Claire\u2019s weakness, guiding her cunningly.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak. She didn\u2019t want to see that Marquis Roger. That father of hers never qualified for being a father.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your mother saw this situation, that you had family you ignored, the she was be heartbroken. Also, your birthday is almost here, are you going to stay at Camille\u2019s house continuously and let the guests come to see me, a scruffy old man? When your mother comes back, are you going to let your mother celebrate your birthday at Camille\u2019s house?\u201d Duke Gordan said quietly. He knew in his heart that saying this would definitely make Claire go home.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, Grandfather. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll come home after seeing the auction.\u201d Claire nodded, comprising.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan smiled and said his decision. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. When the time comes, I\u2019ll send Emery to give you a few golden banknotes. If you take a fancy to anything, just send a signal. Just treat it as my birthday present to you.\u201d Claire respected Emery very much, so if he sent him out, how could Claire not go home?</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. But my friend will still stay at Teacher Camille\u2019s house because she it\u2019s better if she doesn\u2019t see Father.\u201d Claire said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to worry, I already scolded him. A situation like that will never happen again. You should bring all your friends back.\u201d Of course Duke Gordan was thinking about the black clothed, black haired man.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Claire frowned, agreeing reluctantly. Then she mounted onto the wind leopard. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be going back to Teacher Camille\u2019s house and return the day after the auction.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Duke Gordan smiled widely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

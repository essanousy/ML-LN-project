Really, she would have never thought that at the very last moment, it was actually the god of Darkness who came to save her!</p><br/><p>The golden dragon started to shudder slightly. The fear in his heart was continuously expanding, expanding\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>This pressure was a deity.</p><br/><p>Why would a deity descend here?</p><br/><p>Also, it was the most evil, most cruel god, the god of Darkness!</p><br/><p>Naturally, he didn\u2019t think that the god of Darkness descended to find a miniscule, insignificant dragon king like him for some small talk.</p><br/><p>The golden dragon started to go weak at the knees. He wanted to run, but it was as if roots had grown from the bottom of his feet; he was unable to move even the slightest bit.</p><br/><p>The strong pressure made everybody exceptionally uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>And the most weak, Summer, was blue in the face and had already fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithdraw your pressure, I feel uncomfortable!\u201d Claire used all her strength to squeeze out these words.</p><br/><p>The golden dragon\u2019s heart started to palpitate. What was this lowly human doing? So impolite to the god of darkness! Perhaps she wanted to fall into the endless Darkness and suffer for all eternity. Who didn\u2019t know the god of Darkness ways of doing things, who were unaware? Angering him would make one wish they weren\u2019t even born. Out of all the gods, the most terrifying was the god of Darkness.</p><br/><p>But, the next moment, the golden dragon\u2019s mind basically exploded. In the next instant, pressure was gone, but not the pressure for him. The pressure towards the lowly humans were removed! The surrounding Darkness had become much more faint. But the golden dragon still beared with the terrifying pressure.</p><br/><p>Why? What was going on?</p><br/><p>Why would the god of Darkness listen to a trifling lowly human\u2019s words?</p><br/><p>How was it possible?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou four legged reptile, you actually had the delusion of destroying my offering.\u201d Claire was familiar with the deep and evil voice that slowly sounded. The angry tone made one\u2019s heart tremble.</p><br/><p>Offering? The golden dragon looked at Claire fearfully. This human was the god of Darkness\u2019s offering??</p><br/><p>How could it be?</p><br/><p>Everybody besides Feng Yixuan and Cliff also had huge changes in expression. Offering? What did that mean? What offering? Just then, the person the golden dragon wanted to kill was Claire, perhaps Claire was the god of Darkness\u2019s offering?! Such a thing was possible?</p><br/><p>After the god of Darkness undid the pressure on Claire and them, Shui Wenmo quickly went down to Summer\u2019s side, who had already spit blood and passed out, and crouched down, worriedly carrying Summer, resting Summer against his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, she\u2019ll wake up in a moment.\u201d Cliff went up and inspected Summer.</p><br/><p>Claire exhaled, sat down, and cocked her head, waiting for a good show. In any case, she was safe for sure, very safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cVenerable god of Darkness, I, I didn\u2019t know she was venerable one\u2019s offering. I, I definitely didn\u2019t mean to destroy venerable one\u2019s offering, I swear.\u201d The golden dragon attempted to resist the pressure, stuttering as he spoke. He watched Claire\u2019s relaxed movements incredulously, she actually dared to sit there.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid four legged reptile, didn\u2019t the Dragon God teach you any manners?\u201d The sinister voice was incomparably unfeeling, making the golden dragon\u2019s heart palpitate sporadically.</p><br/><p>\u201cVenerable god of Darkness, I, I really didn\u2019t know she was venerable one\u2019s offering. If I knew, I definitely wouldn\u2019t have done it. Please believe me, please forgive my stupid actions.\u201d The golden dragon said cautiously, trembling. He understood the god of Darkness\u2019s temperament very clearly. Perhaps he would give face to the Dragon God and let him live. But, if he angered the god of Darkness, he wouldn\u2019t care for it. If the god of Darkness really killed him, the Dragon God wouldn\u2019t fight to the death for a dragon king that had offended the god of Darkness. At most, the Dragon King would try to please the god of Darkness and then he would find another dragon to be king.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost. Next time, if I see you doing anything to my offering, I will make you wish you were dead.\u201d The god of Darkness spit out these words indifferently.</p><br/><p>When the golden dragon heard the god of Darkness\u2019s words, he became ecstatic. The god of Darkness actually let him go! Great! The golden dragon immediately struggled to fly.</p><br/><p>Just as the golden dragon was struggling to fly, the sinister, low voice coldly sneered quietly. Next, the golden dragon felt an intense pain from his tail joint, so painful, he was about to faint. Then his body slanted. When the golden dragon looked back, he was extremely alarmed. His entire tail, including the root, had been cut off. Blood continuously splashed out of the cut wound.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow get lost. This is my lesson to you. Next time, it won\u2019t be resolved so easily.\u201d The god of Darkness sneered disdainfully, voice completely bloodthirsty and arrogant.</p><br/><p>The golden dragon was completely terrified, not even daring to let so much as a fart, hurriedly flapping away as if his life depended on it, not even stanching the blood flow.</p><br/><p>And so the golden dragon ran off in such a miserable manner, not even daring to look back once. The unpleasant sight of blood spilling everywhere was a ghastly sight. He became the first dragon king in history to not have a tail.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the god of Darkness didn\u2019t leave immediately. Instead, he let out a terrifying, cruel laugh, then asked mockingly, \u201cYou want to find the god of Sprites to undo my mark, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Who would want to wait for death?\u201d Claire said boldly, not hiding anything.</p><br/><p>Everybody\u2019s became worried. Claire actually dared to be so impolite when speaking to the god of Darkness! Although Claire was his offering and he wouldn\u2019t kill Claire currently, that didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t make Claire suffer. The golden dragon just now was a clear case.</p><br/><p>Contrary to everybody\u2019s expectations, the god of Darkness didn\u2019t do anything to Claire. Instead, he laughed madly, his laugh sounding completely satisfied. \u201cLittle thing, you don\u2019t need to go any more. Yesterday, the god of Sprites gambled with me, lost, and promised me something. No matter what happens, he won\u2019t undo my mark. Hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d The sinister voice was completely satisfied. Evidently, the god of Darkness was in a pretty good mood today.</p><br/><p>What? The god of Darkness and the god of Sprites gambled???</p><br/><p>Did they mishear?</p><br/><p>Gods would gamble with each other? And the god of Darkness who represented evil and the god of Sprites who represented purity and disinterest gambled?</p><br/><p>Instantly, everybody thought they had misheard. But, something from the bottom of their hearts told them it was true. No need to struggle, it was true, really true, was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrow quickly, my beautiful offering.\u201d The god of Darkness laughed cruelly, then gradually disappeared.</p><br/><p>The surrounding darkness slowly disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s face darkened as she fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u2026 What\u2019s going on?\u201d Jean slowly walked over, asking a little hesitantly. Everybody else was also filled with confusion. Feng Yixuan was silent, his expression exceptionally unsightly.</p><br/><p>Claire let out a long breath, then stood up to stretch and said to Shui Wenmo and Jean, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all in a moment. You two should soak your weapons in this dragon blood. Don\u2019t waste anything. Anything else that can be gathered should be collected into bottles. In the future, good armor will be made and soaked in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody was struck brilliantly by lightning. At this moment, the first thing that Claire wanted to do was actually this!</p><br/><p>Shui Wenmo and Jean obediently soaked their weapons in the blood. The other people helped collecting the dragon blood. Ben shifted his mouth, standing at the side, not speaking. He looked at the fainted little robber, Summer, from the corner of his eye.</p><br/><p>A moment later, everybody finished and sat down. Jean and Shui Wenmo looked at their weapons that were radiating an ineffable splendor, both happy. Weapons that had gained power from dragon blood would be many times stronger than before. But dragon blood was considered a treasure. Pah, how many people had the capabilities of getting dragon blood? At this moment, Summer started to awaken slowly.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at everyone\u2019s gazes and lightly sighed, knowing what they wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>Claire took off the glove on her right hand and then raised it, showing the strange design of six black stars in a circle.</p><br/><p>Everybody\u2019s expressions changed. They were all unordinary and naturally had heard of what this circle of six black stars represented. But they had the impression that this was only an outlandish legend.</p><br/><p>But they were currently seeing it on Claire\u2019s hand. Also, before, the god of Darkness\u2019s descent meant that it wasn\u2019t a legend, but real.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Jean looked at Claire with a complicated expression, but unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>Cliff and Feng Yixuan were both silent, their expressions as calm as water.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder the god of Darkness would come and save you.\u201d Ben said, suddenly understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean whenever you face danger the god of Darkness will go and save you?\u201d Summer asked, somewhat awed. If it was like this, wasn\u2019t there nothing Claire could be afraid of?</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Claire replied insipidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen aren\u2019t you invincible?\u201d Summer started to get excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire smiled strangely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Summer frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause sooner or later, the god of Darkness with take Claire\u2019s life.\u201d Shui Wenmo lowered his voice and said to Summer quietly, admonishing a little.</p><br/><p>Summer\u2019s expression changed. Now she realized how impudent she was. It wasn\u2019t the time to ask this, but to be worried for Claire\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because of that.\u201d Claire looked up at the sky, her gaze profound.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Summer immediately asked.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t answer right away. Instead she looked up at the sky. Quietly, she said, \u201cThe god of Darkness has descended twice, but hasn\u2019t shown his true appearance. But do you think the Temple of Light can\u2019t sense this strong Dark power?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, the Temple of Light!</p><br/><p>Since Claire was the god of Darkness\u2019s offering, then naturally, she was of help to the god of Darkness. Would the Temple of Light let such a person go?</p><br/><p>Of course not!</p><br/><p>Everybody fell silent. Everything that happened today was far greater than they could comprehend.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Now that we know finding the god of Sprites is useless, let\u2019s go back.\u201d Claire got up. She saw Little Leopard, who was still trembling behind the tents, and beckoned at it.</p><br/><p>Everybody didn\u2019t speak, all silently following from behind.</p><br/><p>Just as Claire and them reached the border town, they bumped into somebody Claire knew well.</p><br/><p>The Temple of Light\u2019s Holy Prince, Leng Lingyun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

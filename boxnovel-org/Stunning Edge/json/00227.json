He knew very well that he wasn\u2019t a match for him. But the Eight-Winged Angel wasn\u2019t stupid. He wasn\u2019t a reckless person. He stabilized his emotions and said in a deep voice, \u201cThey won\u2019t interfere in the war between humans? They are just here for sightseeing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The Black Dragon nodded. That devilish smile on his handsome face made the Eight-winged Angel\u2019s heart shudder. The Eight-winged Angel knew very well that even if the dragon race didn\u2019t participate, as the Dragon King had said, the existence of these enormous dragons alone was already enough to intimidate them. The war between the two countries had already started. Just the fact that these huge dragons stood on Ragka\u2019s side was enough to cause the other side\u2019s morale to be unstable, to the point of breaking down!</p><br/><p>How hateful! The Eight-winged Angel gnashed his teeth in anger. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the Goddess was preparing for the Holy War and didn\u2019t have the time to think too much, the situation on this side wouldn\u2019t have turned out this way!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Dragon King, are you saying that even if we attack them, you will not interfere?\u201d The Eight-winged Angel drew his greatsword and pointed it at Qi Aoshuang and the rest as he asked coldly.</p><br/><p>Ben laughed and moved to the side holding Summer in his arms, happily saying, \u201cWe will be bystanders.\u201d He actually took out two stools from his Space Ring and gave one of them to Summer. Summer looked worried. She was about to say something, but Ben grabbed her hand and shook his head at her. As this scene fell into Shui Wenmo\u2019s eyes, his heart ached as if it had been twisted by a knife.</p><br/><p>\u201cChuxin, come. Let\u2019s watch the show together.\u201d A playful smile appeared on Dong Fenghou\u2019s devilish face. With a gentle move of his fingers, beautiful vines grew from the ground. On the vines, there were also five colored flowers blooming, and the two vines quickly formed two beautiful large rattan chairs. Dong Fenghou pulled Qiao Chuxin to sit on the rattan chair. What was even more exaggerated was that Dong Fenghou had summoned another two small teacups. He handed one to Qiao Chuxin and carefully explained, \u201cThe honey in here can maintain your beauty. It\u2019s only been secreted once every 50 years.\u201d Qiao Chuxin was worry about Qi Aoshuang, but Dong Fenghou said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Aoshuang\u2019s strength has already changed. We can\u2019t help her, why don\u2019t we just sit by and watch. We won\u2019t drag them down.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s a good, powerful reason, and it\u2019s the truth. At this moment, their strength would only drag down Qi Ao Shuang and the rest.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang skimmed her lips\u2026 These people trusted her too much. They were just watching the show.</p><br/><p>As for the Radiant Temple, they got furious! These lowly humans were actually making fun of them, looking down on them! Unforgivable!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d The Eight-winged Angel brandished its huge sword and fiercely hacked at Qiao Chuxin\u2019s chest \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>With a clear clang, Dong Fenghou instantly summoned a huge beast covered in steel armor to block this fatal attack. Then, he turned around and urgently said to Qi Aoshuang, \u201cGo on, we will support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold sweat trickled down the back of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlas! All these people are being led astray by you.\u201d Black Feather\u2019s voice came from behind, filled with sorrow.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang could not refute.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap.\u201d Just like that, White Emperor\u2019s cold voice rang out. The next moment, a white shadow flashed out from behind Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>Black Feather shrugged his shoulders, and a black afterimage flashed out as well.</p><br/><p>Terrible screams rang out!</p><br/><p>Two of the Winged Angels and one of the Eight-winged Angels were cut in half and laid there. A large amount of blood stained the ground beneath them.</p><br/><p>The crowd didn\u2019t even see White Emperor and Black Feather had made their move.</p><br/><p>There were only three people who could see clearly: Black Dragon, Qi Aoshuang and Feng Yixuan!</p><br/><p>White Emperor\u2019s weapon was a snow-white sword, and black feather\u2019s was a shiny and black sickle. After killing them, the two quickly retrieved their weapons.</p><br/><p>No one had thought that the reincarnated White Emperor and Black Feather would have such terrifying strength.</p><br/><p>The archbishop stood there blankly as he looked at the scene in front of him. In his hearts, the angels were invincible. But they were easily wiped out just like that.</p><br/><p>Things quieted down and all around was still.</p><br/><p>The people behind Qi Aoshuang couldn\u2019t believe it. That was it?</p><br/><p>The wind gently blew past, blowing away the fallen leaves.</p><br/><p>The autumn wind was not very cold, but the archbishop seemed to be standing in an icehouse, stopping all his actions and words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh \u2026\u201d Qi Aoshuang finally broke the silence. She looked at the archbishop, \u201cShall we continue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the archbishop could run away, Black Feather had raised his sickle. But Leng Lingyun stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill him. Catch him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The archbishop was easily brought back by Black Feather.</p><br/><p>He waved the archbishop in his hand, causing his internal organs to nearly burst out.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep him. His words are more persuasive than anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want? I won\u2019t betray the Goddess!\u201d The archbishop was trembling, but his tone was resolute.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Xi Shaosi snorted, \u201cI know you are loyal, but what we want is your identity, your body, not your unshakable loyalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of despair appeared on the archbishop\u2019s face, and in the next moment, he fainted when Qi Aoshuang flicked her finger. When he opened his eyes again, his attitude had completely changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d The archbishop politely asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d Dong Fenghou said to Qi Aoshuang. Mental control was amazing. Amongst this group of people, no one owed more spiritual force than him except Qi Aoshuang. So what followed was a completely one-sided secret massacre.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of the archbishop, the group entered the Radiant Temple. The rest of the Eight-winged angels and Winged angels were all found and killed. There were a few angels left in Amper Land.</p><br/><p>Camil\u2019s plan went unusually smoothly. Although the followers of Ragka\u2019s Radiant Temple did not believe what was written on the paper, but, just as Camil had said, there was no need for them to believe. Faith is a solid thing. You can\u2019t change it overnight. As for the military, they were the defenders of royal authority. From the beginning to the end, they did not believe in the Radiant Temple.</p><br/><p>The Radiant Temple\u2019s forces had been secretly wiped clean. It became an empty hall.</p><br/><p>The huge dragons were crouching around the capital. The emperor of Ragka offered them food and water. He was the one who had benefited the most from this affair. At this moment, he couldn\u2019t even close his mouth when he smiled at Anisa in the palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Anisa, hahahaha \u2026\u201d The emperor squinted his eyes and laughed, unable to finish his words. \u201cWe no longer have to watch those divine staffs swindle and cheat in our territory, wasting our time. Haha \u2026 with the dragon race\u2019s help, haha, it\u2019s certain that we well win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dragons won\u2019t help you.\u201d Anisa splashed cold water.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t. As long as they appear in the sky, we could win! What can Amper Land do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are truly vindictive. They\u2019ve directly killed them.\u201d Anisa\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Haha, it\u2019s really all thanks to your daughter-in-law. The dragon race\u2019s support is because of her. Furthermore, her strength has advanced by leaps and bounds, and the people around her all possess terrifying strength. \u201d Anisa fell silent and did not say anything else. The emperor looked at her and frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the grievances and suffering of that child. This time, she is going to face those people head-on. I don\u2019t know what exactly would happen. But I don\u2019t want those people to make her suffer any more. \u201cAnisa sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no problem. We\u2019ll destroy the Hill Mansion. They won\u2019t meet. Your daughter-in-law doesn\u2019t need to face the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Anisa shook her head slightly. \u2018You don\u2019t know that child. Let her deal with it herself.\u201d Anisa said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cAfter the army advances, I will make sure that no one moves against the Hill Mansion.\u201d The king spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang stayed in Lee\u2019s house. She locked herself in her room. No one bothered her. Everyone understood that it was best to leave her in peace.</p><br/><p>The night was cold. Qi Aoshuang was lying quietly on bed, holding the Treasure Cat. The kitten yawned, rubbed its face with its paws, and arched its body in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s arms, looking for a comfortable place to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Bao, what do you care about the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow?\u201d The kitten stared at Qi Aoshuang with wide eyes before mewing again \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Heaven Breaker, right?\u201d Qi Aoshuang looked at it and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow!\u201d The kitten nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou miss him?\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled as she rubbed her little head.</p><br/><p>The Treasure Cat nodded again. Although there were many delicious foods in this world, she only misses that person.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the matter is settled, I\u2019ll send you back, okay?\u201d The kitten returned to Qi Aoshuang\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Aoshuang raised her head. The light movement from the window did not escape her sense. She put down the kitten, stood up and walked to the window, gently pushed it open, then snappily smiled and said: \u201cIt\u2019s so late, why are you sneaking around here?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

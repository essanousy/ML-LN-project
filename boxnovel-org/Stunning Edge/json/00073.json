Why did she feel like she was something that attracted weird beings? Walter, the spirit, the Golden Lotus who arrogantly called her Ma, and this furry White Emperor. This adorable guy was actually her master.</p><br/><p>Claire stared at the furry White Emperor with wide eyes, coldly humphing in her heart. Just wait, she would definitely reverse the contract, definitely become White Emperor\u2019s master!</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter.\u201d Claire suddenly called.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Walter responded out of reflex.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want a body, besides finding and possessing a suitable body, are there any other methods?\u201d Claire asked while frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but no.\u201d Walter said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that can give rebirth to someone\u2019s body, but it is the Temple of Light\u2019s treasure. It\u2019s said that the goddess bestowed it to an unknown pope and it has been enshrined in the Temple of Light\u2019s main palace hall ever since. Who could get it? Doesn\u2019t this mean no?\u201d Walter explained in a long-winded manner. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t like other people\u2019s bodies, I still long for my own body. But that thing, although it sounds ok, how is it possible to obtain?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Claire was frowning and thinking of other things.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your body is reborn, will you be recognized? For example, the Divine Prince who killed you?\u201d Claire asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that day when I was fighting with the pretty boy, I had completely covered myself. I also didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Walter replied truthfully.</p><br/><p>Claire sat in the lotus position, not speaking anymore, pondering.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire! You, you won\u2019t think about going to steal from the Temple of light, will you? Don\u2019t you know how dangerous it is? You won\u2019t necessarily be able to enter in safely, and even if you go in, there\u2019s no guarantee you can bring it out!\u201d Walter cried in alarm. Then, very worriedly, he said, \u201cAlthough I really want my body, I don\u2019t wish for you to be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Claire replied halfheartedly, still pondering.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t be mistaken. I don\u2019t mean that I\u2019m afraid of something happening to you. It\u2019s just that, if something happens to you, what do I do? I\u2019m just a stone.\u201d Walter explained hastily. But the more he spoke, the more lacking in strength it was. He felt annoyed in his heart. Why did he feel like the more he tried, the worse it became? Could it be that he took a liking to this little devil? Pah! How could it be possible?! This little girl still hadn\u2019t finished maturing, and her personality was so vile. She often treated him evilly. How could he take a liking to such a despicable person?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Claire was still absent minded.</p><br/><p>Walter relaxed. Looks like this little devil didn\u2019t care about his words. Not bad, not bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter.\u201d Claire suddenly called, startling Walter at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha, what?\u201d Walter asked cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does the treasure that can give rebirth to your body look like?\u201d Claire asked, her face completely serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha, what are you going to do?\u201d Walter asked, somewhat shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, I\u2019m going to get it for you and let your body be reborn.\u201d If you have a body, you can help me even more than now. Claire didn\u2019t say the last sentence out loud. But Walter always not having a body was also not right either.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Walter started shouting, \u201cDo you know how dangerous it is?! Right now you still have the mark of the god of darkness on the back of your hand. If it\u2019s discovered by people from the Temple of Light, what would the result be?\u201d Walter was extremely anxious, immediately trying to block the idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as they don\u2019t discover it, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Claire shrugged as she replied, not caring at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said it simply, but do you think the Temple of Light is really that easy to get in? You think the thing inside is really that easy to take? The Temple of Light has as many experts as the clouds, and also, that thing is bound to be enshrined in the main palace hall.\u201d Walter was extremely anxious, hurriedly stating some of the dangers, trying to prevent Claire from going.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was going to break in through the front.\u201d Claire raised a brow lightly. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m very skeptical. Isn\u2019t it relatively valuable? Shouldn\u2019t it be hidden in a certain secret location?\u201d Claire was didn\u2019t completely understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the Temple of Light fakes helping people and is arrogant. That\u2019s something the goddess bestowed to mortals, naturally they\u2019ll show it off and tell everyone that the goddess cares about the temple. Another reason is that the Temple of Light is extraordinarily confident in their strength. Think about it, who in the world dares to steal from the Temple of Light?\u201d Walter said while frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI dare.\u201d Claire revealed a trace of a strange smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Do you want to die?!\u201d Walter hurriedly and angrily said. \u201cDo you know how dangerous that way is?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it look like? There should be some kind of barrier on it, right?\u201d Claire pondered, stroking her chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say! Of course there\u2019s a barrier. But it shouldn\u2019t be very strong, because the Temple of Light is extreeeeemely arrogant.\u201d Walter snorted and then suddenly froze, his gaze becoming vulgar. \u201cClaire, you\u2019re working so hard to for my body to be reborn, could it be that you took a fancy to me? When did you start to secretly love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t say a word, pulled out the Spiritual Stone, and then pinched it indifferently with all her might. Walter was about to faint, spazzing, and then was silent.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t waste any more time. She sat in the lotus position, closing her eyes, thinking back to the third level of the mental cultivation method in the Treasured Book of Lotuses, and started to cultivate.</p><br/><p>No sound, no form, no I, no heart.</p><br/><p>Claire only felt that she had entered a fantasy-like realm. Everything around her disappeared. Warmth, she only felt a strange warmth.</p><br/><p>Being unconscious, Walter couldn\u2019t see the faint golden glow around Claire\u2019s body that looked so pure, so beautiful.</p><br/><p>White Emperor, who had been lying down nearby, stared at Claire without moving.</p><br/><p>After who knows how long, Claire finally opened her eyes. The golden glow instantly disappeared. A trace of a satisfied smile appeared on Claire\u2019s lips. Fusing together Dou Qi and magic elements into the lotus power was extremely efficient. She was just missing a bit and almost able to comprehend the third level. It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t break through, but that Claire still didn\u2019t want to have tribulation lightning here and destroy Camille\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>But Golden Lotus\u2019s voice suddenly sounded in Claire\u2019s mind. \u201cMa, the later on it is, the harder it is to break through. The level of magic and Dou Qi you have right now can at most help you quickly advance to the seventh level. Later, it\u2019ll be harder. But don\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019ll block the tribulation lightning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you change your address?\u201d Claire said, somewhat helplessly.</p><br/><p>But Golden turned a deaf ear to Claire\u2019s protest. \u201cMa, goodnight.\u201d After saying goodnight, it fell silent.</p><br/><p>Claire was a little speechless, completely unable to handle Golden Lotus. She slowly closed her eyes, a slight smile appearing on her lips. Now with her eyes closed, the area she could sense was even farther. It was now dusk outside. She slowly expanded her consciousness, passing through the aisle to the main hall. She could actually sense the situation in the main hall. Everybody was preparing to eat, but Summer muttered, why hasn\u2019t Claire finished meditating yet, did she need to go and call her or something? But Camille blocked her, saying that it\u2019s best to not bother a magician meditating.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s shock was endless. She had only cultivated to the third level and was already this abnormal, so what about later? This is a spiritual sense? The phrase suddenly popped up in Claire\u2019s head, but immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Camille, Jean, and Ben all felt something strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like someone is watching?\u201d Camille turned and looked around in confusion, but didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also feel like somebody\u2019s watching us.\u201d Ben snorted and said in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>Jean watched the surroundings alertly, but was also unable to discover any clues.</p><br/><p>Satisfied, Claire slowly withdrew her consciousness. She started pondering. Just then, the two words, spiritual sense, suddenly flashed in her mind and felt very familiar, a strange kind of feeling. But she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. Why?</p><br/><p>Claire got up. White Emperor gave a chirp, then pounced on Claire\u2019s back. While he was at it, he climbed up to Claire\u2019s shoulder, then onto her head, claiming his treasured seat again.</p><br/><p>Claire walked to the main hall just as Camille and the rest were preparing to eat their meal. Seeing Claire come, Summer happily jumped over, pulling out a couple of tickets and waved them happily. \u201cClaire, your Grandfather\u2019s really awesome. He\u2019s so efficient, getting us tickets so fast. He also gave \u2018that thing\u2019 over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Claire knew what \u2018that thing\u2019 meant. It was the dye potion that was going to be used to change the precious pearl\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d Camille smiled warmly. \u201cYou were shut up in that room and meditating for so long, you should be hungry. Eat a little more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire nodded and walked over. When she got close to Camille, Camille used a volume that only the two of them could hear and squeezed out from the gaps of his teeth, \u201cI was looking forward to you dying of hunger inside there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis wish of yours will never be fulfilled.\u201d Claire also smiled like a flower and squeezed out.</p><br/><p>They were very friendly while eating, or at least, on the surface.</p><br/><p>After eating dinner, Claire returned to the bedroom and pulled out the spiritual stone, rubbing it over and over.</p><br/><p>Walter suddenly awoke, watching Claire\u2019s actions with wide eyes. Currently, the spiritual stone was like Walter\u2019s body, it could let Walter feel everything. With Claire rubbing the stone, it felt like his whole body was being rubbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, stop, what are you doing?\u201d Walter called in surprise, trying to quickly stop her. \u201cI already woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Claire stopped, looked at Walter, and said, \u201cSay it, what does the treasure that can give rebirth to your body look like? Ah, why is your face so red?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Walter swallowed back the words he was about to say. If you rub me like this, how can my face not be red? Unfortunately I\u2019m a normal man!</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly!\u201d Claire poked the Spiritual Stone and said impatiently.</p><br/><p>Walter was afraid Claire would poke him again and hurriedly said, \u201cAh! It looks about the same as a conch shell.\u201d Then he quickly added, \u201cEven though I told you, don\u2019t go. It\u2019s too dangerous over there, not somewhere you can go with your current strength. Even if you advanced to the grand wizard stage, you still wouldn\u2019t be able to enter safely and escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Claire ignored Walter and instead, gave a forceful pinch, making Walter faint. Then she packed up some things, got up, left the room, and then went to Ben\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Claire knocked and opened Ben\u2019s door. He appeared drowsily. Of course, if he wasn\u2019t busy, then he would go to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what are you doing?\u201d Ben was confused and didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Tonight, I\u2019ll give you a lesson. A very important lesson.\u201d A trace of a crafty smile appeared on Claire\u2019s lips.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

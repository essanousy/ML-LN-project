Summer felt around and also leaned against the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what are you thinking about?\u201d Summer asked with her head tilted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Claire replied without a thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, you\u2019re thinking about that annoying Father, right?\u201d Summer pouted.</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent, not speaking any more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re implying that you agree.\u201d Summer said certainly. After saying that, she looked up towards the stars and said, \u201cYou having that kind of a father is even more annoying that not having one. My father died trying to save me when I was little. I\u2019ve remembered my entire life what my father said then. Live, only by living is there hope. That was the last bit of love I received from my father.\u201d Summer sighed quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it was like that\u2026\u201d Claire responded in a low voice. That was why she had such an intense clash with Claire\u2019s father today.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why when I saw your father was actually so disgraceful, I got angry and wasn\u2019t able to control myself.\u201d Summer stuck out her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually need to thank you. You defended me so much.\u201d Claire smiled, her smile filled completely with sincerity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how are you going to thank me? I want the most valuable treasure in the world, can you give me it?\u201d Summer asked mischievously, sticking her waist out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will definitely be a day when I give you the most precious treasure in the world.\u201d Claire promised, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, you said it, don\u2019t break your promise.\u201d Summer reached out happily towards Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire revealed a knowing smile and also reached her hand out. The two small hands grasped each other tightly.</p><br/><p>But never in her dreams did Summer think that her words today would actually be fulfilled by Claire. The most valuable treasure in the world was really given to her. Of course, that\u2019s something to talk about later.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are my first friend.\u201d Summer tightly grasped Claire\u2019s hand and said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are also my first friend.\u201d Claire tightened her grasp on Summer\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>(TL: HmmmMMM? What\u2019s that supposed to mean, what do Jean and them represent for you, huh?)</p><br/><p>The two girls looked at each other while smiling. Everything was said in that silent moment.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a slight, abnormal movement in the air made Claire be on guard. Claire quickly pulled Summer behind her.</p><br/><p>The next moment, a figure appeared nimbly from the stone wall in front of them, a shining dagger silently pressed to Claire\u2019s throat. If just the slightest bit of force was used, the dagger would be able to pierce through Claire\u2019s throat.</p><br/><p>Now Walter started crying out in surprise, \u201cWho is this person? There\u2019s actually Dark aura on their body, there really is. Also, you actually didn\u2019t discover her coming close? It can\u2019t be? Claire, aren\u2019t you really skilled? Aren\u2019t you the best at this? How did you suddenly lose your touch? Someone came close to you and you didn\u2019t detect it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire watched the person clothed in black alertly. The petite figure indicated that the terrifying person who came like a ghost was a woman. It wasn\u2019t that she hadn\u2019t discovered her, but that she had discovered her too late. Just as Claire discovered her, she had already approached her.</p><br/><p>Summer was so anxious her palms were full of sweat. Claire looked at the black clothed woman and didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>If this black clothed woman just thrusted slightly with her dagger, Claire\u2019s light would be taken.</p><br/><p>Who on earth was this frightening woman?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman if really frightening. You didn\u2019t even discover her. Now what do we do? Claire, you should use magic and hit her flying.\u201d Walter hurriedly shouted.</p><br/><p>If she could, then Claire would have pinched Walter so hard he fainted. If she could hit her flying, did he even need to mention it?</p><br/><p>Although right now Claire didn\u2019t dare to counterattack, she knew her life was in danger, because that vile god of Darkness would definitely appear whenever she was in danger.</p><br/><p>But the woman actually didn\u2019t make any other movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d The petite figure snorted disdainfully, then turned around and disappeared.</p><br/><p>A peal of cold wind blew, bringing Claire and Summer back to their senses.</p><br/><p>Summer grabbed Claire\u2019s clothes tightly and asked, terrified. \u201cClaire, what\u2019s going on, what is up with that woman? So mysterious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. This woman is very strong. I discovered her just then, but even though I discovered her, I wasn\u2019t able to dodge.\u201d Claire said seriously, puzzled, \u201cBut what did her action just then mean? She didn\u2019t seem like she intended on killing me. On the contrary, it seemed a little like flaunting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlaunting?\u201d Summer was puzzled. What did she mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cFlaunting that she could kill me but didn\u2019t.\u201d Claire said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a senseless person?\u201d Summer opened her mouth wide, somewhat incredulous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of people in the world.\u201d Claire looked up at the vast night, but she kept on guessing who on earth the outstanding and skilled person was. She thought over and over, but wasn\u2019t able to think of who had any grievances to do this kind of senseless action.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, as expected, with you, dangers will automatically come knocking at the door.\u201d Summer started crying, looking like she still had lingering fears.</p><br/><p>Claire: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut seeing that the first thing you did was pull me behind you to protect me, I\u2019ll still be your friend.\u201d Summer said very righteously as she posed, hands on her hips as she swung them.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo wash and sleep.\u201d Claire said, stupefied, sweating from the back her head.</p><br/><p>(TL: sounds weird in english, but think of manga/manhua/manhwa characters when they see a really shameless action)</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019ll go to sleep.\u201d Summer said goodnight and turned and left.</p><br/><p>Claire sat on the stone wall, quietly leaning on the pillar. Suddenly, she thought of something and called, \u201cWalter, Walter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Walter impatiently replied. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to sleep right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust then you said you sensed that that assassin had Dark aura on them?\u201d Claire asked, frowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That kind of concealed and hard to perceive Dark aura, even the Temple of Light can\u2019t sense it, haha, but I, Walter, could definitely discover it.\u201d Walter boasted.</p><br/><p>But Claire was silent. Who could it be with the trace of Dark aura? And they could conceal it so well. She didn\u2019t have any grievances with a person with this kind of background, right?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, that petite, black figure had already left Camille\u2019s house, disappearing into an alley. In a tidy little hotel, a blonde haired young man was currently leaning against the window, looking into the night. The next moment, a figure silently appeared behind him. A bright dagger was pressed to his throat.</p><br/><p>But the blonde haired handsome man\u2019s expression was calm. He said quietly, \u201cDid you meet her yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d The person clicked their tongue unhappily, withdrew the dagger, and then teared off the black cloth that was covering their face. They walked to the side of a table and sat, unsatisfied, then poured herself a cup of water, gulped it down. \u201cHow did you know I went to look for her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know you well?\u201d The handsome blonde haired man smiled and walked over, also sitting down. He looked at the woman who looked somewhat similar to him. The woman appeared to be less than twenty, also had golden colored hair, azure pupils, and was a standard beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you understand. As the elder brother who has lived with me for so many years, how could you not understand me?\u201d The woman said, peeved, setting down the cup with a thud.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand her. Why she abandoned us for such a disgraceful man, abandoned our family.\u201d The blonde haired man\u2019s gaze suddenly became cold, squeezing out these kinds of words from the gaps of his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, you\u2019re still tangling with this question. It\u2019s already been so many years, something that has been an unalterable fact for so long.\u201d The blonde haired girl sighed quietly. Of course she knew that person would forever pain her elder brother\u2019s heart. To her, it was the same. That\u2019s why she went tonight to see that person\u2019s child.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was the child?\u201d The blonde haired man suddenly asked. \u201cIs she the same as the rumors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, she actually discovered me. Although she couldn\u2019t dodge, she didn\u2019t fear death. She even pulled her friend behind to protect her immediately.\u201d The blonde haired woman poured another cup and said seriously.</p><br/><p>The blonde haired man frowned slightly. He understood his younger sister to the point that he couldn\u2019t understand her even more. She was proud and arrogant. A person who could make her make this kind of assessment would mean that they were not just \u2018not bad\u2019 in truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, she\u2019s different from the rumors?\u201d The blonde haired man asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for that, I don\u2019t know. In the rumors, she\u2019s an idiotic man-chaser. For the idiotic part, she doesn\u2019t seem like it. As for if she\u2019s a man-chaser, I don\u2019t have a way to confirm that part.\u201d The blonde haired girl yawned and stood up. \u201cBut, elder brother, don\u2019t forget our purpose for this trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. You should go and rest.\u201d The blonde haired man said indifferently.</p><br/><p>The blonde haired girl looked back and warned. \u201cAlso, elder brother, \u2018that person\u2019 is in the imperial palace. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t get any thoughts of wanting too see, it\u2019s too dangerous. If we don\u2019t achieve the purpose of this trip and something also happens to you\u2026 You know that old man\u2019s temper.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blonde haired man was silent, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, did you not hear what I said? I\u2019ve already lost a dear person. I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you!\u201d The blonde haired woman was a bit angered, raising her voice as she shouted.</p><br/><p>After a long time the blonde haired man let out, \u201cI know. You should go rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blonde haired girl gave a humph, turned to open the door, and left.</p><br/><p>The blonde haired man slowly got up, stood beside the window, and silently watched vast night scene, his feelings extremely complex. The distance between him and that person was so close, but he couldn\u2019t go to see her once?</p><br/><p>The blonde haired man slowly raised his hand, an average looking ring on his finger. With a flip of his hand, a round bronzeware about the size of a fist appeared out of nowhere in the blonde haired man\u2019s hand. That ring was actually an interspatial ring, something that was rare throughout the entire continent! The bronzeware in the man\u2019s hand had a simple design that emitted an indescribable mysterious aura, and the bronzeware had an empty cavity in the middle, like it was missing something. The blonde haired man gently stroked the cavity. It was lacking a precious pearl there. Once they found the precious pearl and inlaid it, it would be able to show a splendid road, finding treasure.</p><br/><p>At that time, would he be able to find everything he had lost? Would his wishes be satisfied?</p><br/><p>The next day, Claire didn\u2019t go to classes because she knew that once she got to school, Lashia would definitely grab, not letting her go, and let out a torrent of words that would compliment Father, then plead her to go back home. She didn\u2019t want to go back to the home that didn\u2019t have Katherine, or at least, she didn\u2019t want to now.</p><br/><p>Claire sat in Camille\u2019s back garden, reclining on a rocking chair, swaying back and forth. Small blasts of cool wind blowing felt extremely satisfying and coupled with drinking Camille\u2019s expensive scented tea, it felt more satisfying.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, Claire, come and see, there\u2019s something good, something good.\u201d Summer\u2019s voice came from afar.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

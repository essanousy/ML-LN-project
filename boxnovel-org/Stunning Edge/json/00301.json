If it was an ordinary man, he would definitely be incomparably excited. However, Qi Ao Shuang was extremely frustrated in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cParina, listen to me. I\u2019ve made it very clear before, and now it\u2019s the same attitude, and it will be the same from now on.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t accept you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said patiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know. You have a sweetheart, and the reason why you worked so hard to break through is to meet her at that place. I know it all.\u201d Parina did not wait for Qi Ao Shuang to finish before raising her voice and growling. However, her voice was already laced with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you should know very well that I can\u2019t accept you and I can\u2019t like you!\u201d \u201cI only regard you as my little sister, don\u2019t you want me to completely cut off this last bit of love!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice became colder and colder.</p><br/><p>I know that no one can take the place of that person in your heart, and I will never be able to take the place of him. My request is very humble, and I only hope that before you go to that plane, I can quietly stay by your side. Parina finally cried. She raised her head and looked at Qi Ao Shuang, her face full of tears as she asked, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, can\u2019t you do this as well?\u201d \u201cJust use me as a substitute. Just treat me to your side during this period of time \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart was in a mess. Looking at how miserable Parina was feeling, she wanted to tell her: \u201cI am not a man, and I cannot accept your love.\u201d \u201cIn this world, everyone is a special existence. No one can take the place of anyone else!\u201d But would she believe it? He would only think that he was trying to fool her with such an absurd excuse. Things have the opposite effect.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang closed her eyes helplessly, sorting out her thoughts in her mind, trying to think of a way to convince Parina if she refused.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cXiao Aushuang, let me stay by your side before you go to that plane \u2026\u201d Parina sobbed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, because you\u2019re going to die here tonight.\u201d A cold voice suddenly sounded in the silent night.</p><br/><p>Immediately following that, a terrifying force came through the air, heading straight for the Palina in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s pupils contracted. She hugged Parina tightly and abruptly turned around, letting that terrifying power all land on her body.</p><br/><p>With a stuffy groan, Qi Ao Shuang bore the brunt of the attack.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even have to wait for this person to appear before he knew who it was. This person was Dittancz! He was actually following me! Xiao Ao Shuang was furious in her heart. Furthermore, she wanted to kill Parina!</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang, are you alright?\u201d Parina raised her head and looked at the blood dripping from the corner of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mouth in fear as she asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang reached out to wipe the blood from the corner of her mouth, then turned around and pulled Parina behind her. Looking at the figures gradually appearing in the night, she coldly said, \u201cDylan, I warned you that you don\u2019t need to intervene in my matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she tried to block your progress, and she deserved to die.\u201d Dickens slowly approached them and appeared before their eyes. His expression was as cold as ice, and there was not a single ripple in his eyes when he said those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was truly angry now. Again and again, Dittos had interfered in his own affairs, this time trying to kill Parina, and would not allow such a thing to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, don\u2019t force me to hurt you.\u201d \u201cThis woman can\u2019t stay, she will stop your progress.\u201d \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026\u201d Dittos\u2019 tone was extremely calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t fall in love with a woman.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was furious in her heart, \u201cI don\u2019t have a shred of affection for Parina, you don\u2019t need to waste your time thinking about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut she likes you, so she must die.\u201d \u201cHer entanglement can upset you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, I said you don\u2019t have to worry about my business.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang shouted in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not up to you!\u201d With a cold look on his face, Dylan was about to make his move.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face sank. She knew that one day, she would fight with Dittos, but she didn\u2019t expect that this battle would come so quickly. Parina, who was standing behind Qi Ao Shuang, had a face full of fear. She didn\u2019t think that she would become the direct cause of the fight between the two. At this moment, she was filled with regret. Dittas\u2019 strength had always been above Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s. If Qi Ao Shuang suffered damage due to her, how could she endure it?</p><br/><p>Dittos said no more, and his face fell. Qi Ao Shuang lowered her body slightly, keeping her guard.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, no one saw how Dentance had made his move. A violent blast of air swept over the two of them.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression did not change at all, and with a casual wave of her hand, the violent shockwave disappeared.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Dotans was slightly moved. He raised his eyebrows and a satisfied look appeared in his eyes. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s strength had risen so quickly! To his surprise. Perhaps, today\u2019s battle truly wasn\u2019t certain of victory or defeat. However, this didn\u2019t change his determination to kill Parina.</p><br/><p>When Dittas was about to make another move, an anxious shout came from the air, \u201cStop!\u201d Stop it! \u201cListen to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Jonathan\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Dittos stopped what he was doing and frowned slightly as he looked at Jonathan, who was running over. Xiao Ao Shuang also turned her head to look at Jonathan\u2019s anxious face, but she didn\u2019t move aside. She continued to protect Parina behind her. Parina looked dazedly at the back of Xiao Ao Shuang and was extremely touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d Dittos looked at Jonathan with displeasure.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was also puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittas, you\u2019re going to kill Parina because you\u2019re afraid of being bothered by Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s feelings, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jonathan asked instead of answering Dittos\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Dittos did not say anything. His face was gloomy, but he had already tacitly accepted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simple.\u201d There is no need for such a nuisance. \u201d Jonathan turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang and said, \u201cParina, compared to you losing your life due to Qi Ao Shuang, and being plagued by feelings, I think it\u2019s better if I tell you the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d A wave of uneasiness welled up in Parina\u2019s heart and grew in size.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang frowned as she looked at Jonathan who had a conflicted expression. She did not understand what Jonathan was trying to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, if you tell me your secret, will you feel troubled?\u201d Jonathan asked carefully. After all, Qi Ao Shuang definitely had her concerns regarding the status of a man.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned. She looked at Jonathan\u2019s face, wanting to know what he meant. Jonathan slowly took out a mirror and said to Qi Aushuang, \u201cThis mirror can see a person\u2019s true face.\u201d \u201cLast time, I stole a glance at you in the mirror \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her words, Qi Ao Shuang had already understood the meaning behind the so-called true face. He felt that Jonathan\u2019s recent attitude toward him was strange, that he had seen that he was a woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let Parina see for herself.\u201d Because I said she wouldn\u2019t believe me. \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang could not help but make such a decision. Because she knew that if she didn\u2019t solve Parina\u2019s problem, she would only sink deeper and deeper into it. In the end, he would be beyond redemption. She might as well take advantage of the situation to make her completely give up. He believed that none of them would reveal his true identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Parina started to panic, and the uneasiness in her heart threatened to overwhelm her.</p><br/><p>Dittos frowned and stood aside silently, looking at the scene in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome and see, you will understand. \u201cLong pain is better than short pain, you don\u2019t have to worry about Qi Ao Shuang in the future.\u201d Jonathan stepped forward and pointed the mirror at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t look!\u201d Parina vaguely understood what was going on. Her heart was gradually filled with uneasiness and fear. She lowered her head, unwilling to look at the mirror.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes met with the mirror, and she raised her eyebrows in shock. It had been a long time since he had seen himself like this.</p><br/><p>Black hair and black eyes \u2026</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked over his shoulder and froze when he saw what the person in the mirror looked like.</p><br/><p>What a stunning face! Her hair was as black as ink, her eyes were bright and rarely seen, and her lips were rosy and small. It was just that the slight sadness between her eyebrows had not changed. Such a stunning, perfect face stunned Jonathan for a moment. He had thought that Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s true face would be a beauty, and he could guess it from that stunning glimpse. However, he never thought that Qi Ao Shuang would be so beautiful that it would cause people\u2019s hearts to ripple!</p><br/><p>Seeing Jonathan\u2019s soul leave his body, Dittos finally moved over, glanced into the mirror, and froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what kind of mirror is this?!\u201d After a long time, Dickens finally spoke, but this time his tone was different.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Semidivine Artifact, a replica of the True Knowledge Mirror. \u201cIt can\u2019t be wrong!\u201d Jonathan came back to himself and answered Dittos\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Dittos became silent. His expression was unsettled and he did not move anymore. He just turned around and left silently.</p><br/><p>Parina kept her head down, not daring to look in the mirror. She was afraid, afraid that when she saw the mirror, everything would be different.</p><br/><p>\u201cParina, look!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be fine after reading it!\u201d Jonathan urged Parina impatiently. Because Parina couldn\u2019t keep pestering Qi Ao Shuang like this.</p><br/><p>Slowly, slowly, Parina raised her head. Jonathan held the mirror and waited patiently. As soon as she looked up, however, she looked down again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to deceive your feelings, Parina, or hurt you. But you can\u2019t go on like this. It would only cause more damage. I\u2019ll tell you the truth today. I\u2019m a woman. I look like a man now, but I\u2019m a woman. And there would be a day when she could recover. Do you understand \u2026. Qi Ao Shuang tried her best to persuade him, but her tone slowed down.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

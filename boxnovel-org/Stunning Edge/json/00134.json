She handed it to the old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019ll let me see?\u201d The old man gazed at Claire incredulously, echoing her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm. Go on,\u201d Claire said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, where\u2019s your medicine? Claire is wounded,\u201d Feng Yixuan exclaimed with panic, noticing her wounds. Ever since they had left the capital, Claire had never said a word, leaving her wounds untreated. Coupled with dealing with the lightning, they had completely forgotten Claire\u2019s wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, medicine.\u201d The old man hurriedly rummaged through his interspatial storage ring, the pulled out a small blue and white porcelain bottle. He shook out one small pill and handed it to Claire, saying, \u201cEat this, I guarantee you\u2019ll feel much better immediately. Si Konglin gave me this medicine and it cost me quite a bit to trade for it.\u201d The old man said this with a bit of a heartache. It was clear he was only being this generous because Claire had promised to let him see her grimoire. His words were also meant to be friendly.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t hold back and swallowed the medicine in one gulp. Sure enough, a cooling sensation spread throughout her whole body, lingering especially her wounds, and her aches and pains quickly melted away. She felt refreshed and exceptionally comfortable. What was the medicine? Claire was extremely shocked. Treatment from priests and alchemists could not compare with its effects.</p><br/><p>Claire handed over the grimoire and the old man received it happily. But after he impatiently glanced over the cover, his expression changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha-what are these words?\u201d The old man frowned, blinking as he asked. He seemed to be talking to himself, yet also asking Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent.</p><br/><p>After pausing for a moment, the old man immediately continued on, about to flip through.</p><br/><p>But then something strange occurred. The grimoire remained shut!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d The old man frowned, then tried to flip it open again, but once again, he was still unable to open it.</p><br/><p>They all froze. What was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, are you trying to be dramatic again?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked seriously, his gaze sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe dramatic my ass! Which one of you see I\u2019m trying to be dramatic? Would I really open just a book so dramatically?\u201d the old man fumed at Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan froze. In other words, the old man was really unable to open it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I open it?\u201d The old man fumbled around with the book, inspecting it.</p><br/><p>Claire was also surprised. Originally, she had thought it wouldn\u2019t matter because he wouldn\u2019t be able to read Chinese. If he could, that meant he had also come from another world like her and it would be another matter to deal with.</p><br/><p>But she had not anticipated this situation. He was actually unable to open the book?</p><br/><p>The old man tried to open it while exerting strength, but the ordinary looking book did not budge.</p><br/><p>After trying for a while, the old man finally gave up and asked Claire suspiciously, \u201cThis is the grimoire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Claire said anything, Feng Yixuan said a little angrily, \u201cHuh? Old man, what are you trying to imply? How could Claire try to trick you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt <em>is</em> the grimoire.\u201d Claire walked over and took the book, also very confused. What was this situation? With a light flip, the book opened immediately.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the room fell silent.</p><br/><p>Thousands of expressions passed through the old man\u2019s face. Feng Yixuan and An Lisha watched on in a daze. Claire frowned, a surge of confusion in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d The old man grabbed it angrily, glaring with wide eyes at the words. But he couldn\u2019t read it! Thus, the old man tried to flip to the next page, but he couldn\u2019t!</p><br/><p>Claire calmly helped old man flip to the next page. But again, the old man could not understand.</p><br/><p>The old man turned rigid, sitting stiffly in place.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression remained tranquil. She continued to flip the ages and the old man continued to not understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Si Konlin, you dared to screw with me!\u201d The old man bellowed, extremely angry. He turned and bounded over to Feng Yixuan. \u201cCome over, boy, check if you can flip it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan obediently dashed over and flipped the pages easily.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s face greened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSi Konglin! You shameless old thing! You actually restricted me! Won\u2019t let me see or learn? Discriminating against my Heavenly Astral Wind? You just won\u2019t allow my Heavenly Astral Wind to be bound to your Golden Lotus? Then I\u2019ll do just that!\u201d The old man stood up, angry now, stomping all about.</p><br/><p>The other three remained frozen.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle lass! You <em>must </em>learn Heavenly Astral Wind from me! I\u2019m going to teach you every single thing! I\u2019m going to piss off that damn Si Konglin!\u201d the old man hollered angrily. Now they understood what he meant by bound together!</p><br/><p>After the old man said this, Claire was frozen in place as were An Lisha and Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, conveniently, you should also learn along the way. Your wind blades are pretty good. Doesn\u2019t it feel great after being unsealed?\u201d the old man ordered without care for their opinion.</p><br/><p>An Lisha was filled with glee. Master was going to teach Feng Yixuan so easily? The reason why she had never taught Feng Yixuan Heavenly Astral Wind is because she vowed to her master she would not teach others it and because she understood how much he cared about it, but today, he had agreed to teach him so easily. And it was simply out of convenience. Her eyes settled on Claire, sighing in her heart. Whether it was because of the girl\u2019s luck or Feng Yixuan that brat\u2019s good foresight was unknown.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Senior, I am fire attributed,\u201d Claire said softly. Meanwhile, Claire had determined one thing: the person named Si Konglin was probably from the same world as her! He was the one who created the grimoire in Chinese. It was only unknown how he had lost it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? That doesn\u2019t matter. From now on, you must learn from me! It doesn\u2019t matter how many levels you learn! You just <em>have</em> to learn! Even just one level is fine! Since you know the Treasured Lotus Style, you must learn my Heavenly Astral Wind, otherwise, how else can I anger that old thing to death?\u201d the old man bellowed angrily, then added a little shamelessly, \u201cAfter all, I blocked seven lightning strikes for you today! Can you at least humor me? Even if it\u2019s just one sentence, you must learn it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire was completely like *. Her lip twitched, wanting to say something but not knowing what to say. The old man sure was strange. Since when was this kind of exchange a thing? Was she even allowed to refuse? Claire felt a bit of a headache coming on.</p><br/><p>*reminder: this means her expression turned into the same way the Chinese character looks. It\u2019s often used as an emoji</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I already have a master,\u201d Claire said after thinking for a moment. Although she knew that learning the old man\u2019s supreme techniques would probably save her life if necessary, she couldn\u2019t become his disciple. And Claire understood that being fire attributed, she wouldn\u2019t be able to learn the essence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t become your master even if you wanted me to.\u201d The old man swung his hips gleefully. Of course he had a plan in mind. Firstly, the girl seemed to be An Lisha\u2019s future daughter in law, so he couldn\u2019t accept her as his disciple, or else their relationships would become a mess. Secondly, the girl was neither his nor Si Konglin\u2019s disciple, but would be able to practice both of their techniques. What would Si Konglin\u2019s expression be after he found out? Just thinking about it made him giddy.</p><br/><p>Eh? Claire watched the giddy old man a bit blankly. Teach her without becoming her master?</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, what\u2019s your name? It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue.\u201d The old man stroked his beard thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire Hill,\u201d Claire responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh good. From now on, call me senior Feng Astral!\u201d the old man instructed, wagging his finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Feng Astral?\u201d Claire repeated. It sounded so weird and was definitely not his real name.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Got a problem? Doesn\u2019t this name sound very profound and domineering?\u201d The old man shot a glance at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no problem.\u201d Claire shook her head a little depressedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. An Lisha, return and do what you need to do. Wait for when I think these two fellas are ready,\u201d the old man instructed An Lisha.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Master. Ok. I\u2019ll leave Claire and Feng Yixuan to you,\u201d An Lisha agreed with a smile. She turned to Claire. \u201cJust humor Master for saving your life for now. Even if you learn just one level, consider it fulfilling his wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since An Lisha had already said this, Claire couldn\u2019t find an excuse to refuse.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, what about the competition?\u201d Claire frowned, remembering that Lagark\u2019s competition didn\u2019t seem to have finished yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already brought glory to the Li clan. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll had over the royal weaponry rights to the Li clan. Also, I\u2019ll instruct Shui Wenmo and Feng Yixuan to get rid of the others, then surrender. The Li clan will be considered the winner,\u201d An Lisha declared her decision, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Claire glanced at An Lisha with a complex expression, unable to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misinterpret it as us helping you! With your current strength, both Shui Wenmo and Yixuan are not your match! So the winner was going to be the Li clan anyways.\u201d An Lisha\u2019s expression turned serious as she explained. \u201cJust cultivate here without worry.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

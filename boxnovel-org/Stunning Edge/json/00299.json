A long time ago, when the Star Academy chose the so-called four school beauties, Arnie had only come to report to the school before she had disappeared.</p><br/><p>And then we found out that the four school beauties were Lenny. (a tragic figure who has died) Parina (Often playing with a man with an aggrieved and adorable face) Bethofenib A headstrong girl actually has a sweetheart in her heart. And then there was the one in front of him, Eber.</p><br/><p>However, it was only after they met up with Aisha that they said that she was the true beauty of the school. Her looks were the best, and she was the one who was the most benevolent.</p><br/><p>Eiber was not as pretty as the other three, and if Arnie was included, Eibert would not be able to rate the Colonel\u2019s flowers.</p><br/><p>So Ibel had always been hostile to Ashanina.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking. Camille. Qi Ao Shuang said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Camille?\u201d The sky was surprised.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was silent for a while. Her eyes were misty, and her thoughts were drifting away. Camille, Camille. Who was he? He was someone who had been with him all along. A good person? No. Not a bad guy, either. He is so habitually at his side, the person who has been gently smiling to make his own rose tea. He was the one who seemed to be toying with himself but was really worried about himself.</p><br/><p>Camille, Camille.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang said this name softly in her heart.</p><br/><p>What did Jing Feng mean by that? Was Camille in trouble? Was Camille faced with a problem he couldn\u2019t solve?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t tell me, Che.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll ignore you.\u201d Seeing that Qi Ao Shuang was only lost in her own thoughts, Chang was so angry that he ignored her and disappeared into Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body as soon as he said those words.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang washed her body quietly, slowly spreading out her hands, looking at these familiar and unfamiliar hands, her heart was filled with complex emotions. A cold feeling came from his earlobes. This body belonged to Feng Yixuan, and the earring on the earlobe was from Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes. Now, with them, the three of them were one. This feeling was very strange, very subtle.</p><br/><p>After taking a shower, Qi Ao Shuang changed her clothes and went out. For some reason, she wanted a cup of Rose Tea. If he wanted to drink, he would have to find a teahouse on the bustling street to the west of the academy.</p><br/><p>Walking out alone, he found an elegant teahouse. Qi Ao Shuang sat by the window and ordered a pot of rose tea, quietly savoring it. Sure enough, Camil\u2019s scented tea was the best. Or, should he say that he was already used to the smell?</p><br/><p>It was drizzling outside, and the windows were slowly becoming hazy. Qi Ao Shuang looked through the hazy window and her thoughts flew far away. On that day, the weather was dark as well. When they met the Eastern Wind Marquis, Camil had somehow gotten a small parasol to block the splashing sea water while everyone stood on the city wall to repel the sea beasts. It would have been funny, but the movements, displayed by Camille, were so elegant and natural. Even that fellow Ah\u2019Bao ran up to Camil to dodge the seawater.</p><br/><p>At that time, everyone was really happy together. But, happy time is always very short, when can everyone get together again? All sorts of memories surfaced in her mind. Thinking back to those happy days, a faint smile appeared on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, I thought you didn\u2019t know how to laugh.\u201d A charming and delicate voice suddenly reached Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s ears. Following that, a wave of sweet fragrance assaulted her nose. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes flashed. Aisha Nina giggled as she sat in front of Qi Ao Shuang. She raised her eyebrows and looked at Qi Ao Shuang in a flirtatious manner.</p><br/><p>The smile on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face instantly disappeared. She looked coldly at the pretty girl in front of her, and said lightly: \u201cYoung Miss\u2019s appearance is indeed out of proportion to her inner qualities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what do you mean?!\u201d Ashanina\u2019s expression changed. She no longer had the smiling expression she had before. Instead, she looked at Xiao Ao Shuang angrily and said, \u201cAre you saying that my appearance is the opposite from my inner self?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, I forget my courtesy. It\u2019s hard for me to compliment Miss on her upbringing.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang did not hesitate to speak. First, it was because the girl in front of him had interrupted her warm memories. Second, she had always been looking at her as if she was her prey. This woman was very curious about him. However, Qi Ao Shuang would not give her the chance to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d You talk to a lady like that! \u201d Aisha Nina looked at Qi Aoshuang, her face slightly red. This was the first time someone had said that to her without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything. Instead, she picked up her teacup and took a sip of tea before turning her head to look out the hazy window. On the street, everything was wet with the long drizzle. Gradually, the air became fresher and fresher.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know your secret, hmph!\u201d \u201cYou are not a man, you are a woman,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>After saying this, Azana focused on observing the reaction of Qi Ao Shuang. Unfortunately, she was disappointed. Qi Ao Shuang remained calm and did not even turn her head to look at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d You, you\u2019re so rude! You put a lady aside and put the back of your head against her. Annoyed by Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s cold attitude, Arena clenched her teeth and said these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the impolite person? This lady, you sat opposite me without my permission, and said a few insulting things to me. I\u2019m already very polite to you for not having an attack. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang only turned her head slightly, the corner of her mouth curling into a mocking smile as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Aisha Nina was speechless. She sat there in a daze for a while, unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, our Goddess Ashanina will be humiliated one day?\u201d Suddenly, a high-pitched voice filled with a sense of schadenfreude was heard.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she looked out the window at the rain, feeling a little depressed. Why is it so difficult to find a quiet place and be alone for a while? He didn\u2019t want to stir up trouble, but the gossips came one by one. Who was this woman?</p><br/><p>\u201cEber!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s better for me to be humiliated than someone else\u2019s lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d You shameless woman, what else can you do but seduce men? \u201cWhy? Did you end up deflated after getting your eye on Qi Aoshuang today?\u201d The woman sat down next to Qi Ao Shuang and started to curse. Then, she started to mock Qi Ao Shuang for taking joy in his misfortune.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not turn her head around, only staring at the rain outside.</p><br/><p>The two women\u2019s eyes met each other in mid-air with lightning speed.</p><br/><p>This was not surprising. A long time ago, when the Star Academy chose the so-called four school beauties, Arnie had only come to report to the school before she had disappeared. And then we found out that the four school beauties were Lenny. (a tragic figure who has died) Parina (Often playing with a man with an aggrieved and adorable face) Bethofenib A headstrong girl actually has a sweetheart in her heart. And then there was the one in front of him, Eber. However, it was only after they met up with Aisha that they said that she was the true beauty of the school. Her looks were the best, and she was the one who was the most benevolent. Eiber was not as pretty as the other three, and if Arnie was included, Eibert would not be able to rate the Colonel\u2019s flowers. So Ibel had always been hostile to Ashanina.</p><br/><p>This was not the direct reason why Ibel hated Arnie so much. It was because Eibert had a sweetheart, but the lover changed his mind when he saw her and pursued her fiercely. After being played with by Ashanina, she abandoned him. She wanted to turn around to find Ibel, but she was beaten half to death by him and told him to scram again. But the two men\u2019s beams had come to an end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never seduce men. It\u2019s those cheap men who put it up themselves.\u201d Azana\u2019s words were filled with thorns, and her spearhead was naturally aimed straight at that unfaithful lover of Ibel\u2019s. Ebel\u2019s face turned red in anger as he slammed the table. He stood up angrily, pointed at Arnie\u2019s nose and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because men like women!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang stood up helplessly as she looked at the rosetea that had been spilled on the table, and said in a low voice to Abel.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Eber was fuming. How could she listen to what Xiao Ao Shuang said? She crossed her arms and shouted angrily, \u201cWhat are you letting me do?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you see that I\u2019m in trouble right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang did not say anything. With a gentle wave of her hand, Ibel lost his balance and flew up into the air, pouncing towards Aisha who were waiting for a good show.</p><br/><p>The two women exclaimed and fell into confusion.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang just stood up, called the waiter over and changed her seat. After he sat down, he immediately set up a barrier to prevent any noise from happening in the outside world. It wasn\u2019t until nightfall that Qi Ao Shuang stood up, paid her and slowly walked out.</p><br/><p>Walking to the entrance, looking at the hazy rain outside, Qi Ao Shuang smiled and stepped into the drizzle.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ashanina was in Johansson\u2019s dorm room, angrily accusing Qi Ao Shuang of her crime in the teahouse. Jonathan yawned and listened absent-mindedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you listening to me, you damn boy?!\u201d I was bullied. I was bullied! \u201cYou\u2019re still so indifferent!\u201d Ashanina grabbed Jonathan by the neck and shook him desperately.</p><br/><p>Jonathan came back to his senses, but he said something that made Arnie almost spit out blood. \u201cI say, Witch, it\u2019s okay if the person who provoked you was someone else. I can beat him up.\u201d \u201cBut, Qi Ao Shuang, I can\u2019t beat him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I, I, I, pah!\u201d Aranina was so angry that she almost vomited blood. Her grip became stronger and she shook it desperately. \u201cYou useless one. You have no ambition. You actually dare to say such useless words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d Jonathan scratched his hair and answered nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2019re pissing me off!\u201d Aranina suddenly let go of Jonathan\u2019s collar and sat down beside him in a huff.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, witch, is there anything else you need?\u201d If it\u2019s all right, just shut the door while you\u2019re out and I\u2019ll go back to sleep. \u201d Jonathan yawned.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid pig, you only know how to sleep!\u201d Asana was about to leave when she suddenly remembered something. She turned to Jonathan and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the work I asked you to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jonathan still looked confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to use the mirror to see what Ao Shuang really looks like!\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d Ashanina wanted nothing more than to kick Jonathan in the face.</p><br/><p>Jonathan shuddered, remembering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cResults?\u201d Asana looked at Jonathan and asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I saw him, but he\u2019s really a man, and he\u2019s a man with a normal orientation.\u201d \u201cAnd he\u2019s very popular,\u201d Jonathan answered, with a wry smile. \u201cParina pursued him relentlessly, and his senior sister put down her pride to pursue him.\u201d Unfortunately, his vision was too high. Furthermore \u2026 Jonathan\u2019s eyes dimmed as he said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what?!\u201d Asana asked quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, he has a sweetheart.\u201d Jonathan looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d How is that possible? \u201cI didn\u2019t see who he was close to.\u201d Asana frowned, puzzled. \u201cJust like you said, it seems that the relationship between Parina and Tarina is one-sided.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see what kind of woman he has special feelings for \u2026\u201d Asana thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, you\u2019re still going to investigate about that!\u201d Jonathan pursed his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know!\u201d The first time I saw this man, I knew he was a man of love and loyalty. As she said this, she was taken over by Jonathan.</p><br/><p>\u201cPositive interpretation!\u201d You\u2019re right, I felt the same way when I first saw him. \u201d Jonathan said affirmatively.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, how else could you be my little brother?\u201d Asana rolled her eyes at Jonathan and continued, \u201cSay, how could such a person be one of those beasts I mentioned?\u201d He was definitely not a man like Dittas. But if he has a sweetheart, why doesn\u2019t he look at me? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says that he doesn\u2019t have one? It\u2019s just that you can\u2019t find the person he loves.\u201d Jonathan spoke in a strange tone, but for some reason he began to feel sour in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Asana was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person he loved has long gone to another realm. Before him, he stepped into the Space Shattering Realm. That\u2019s why he had to work so hard and continue cultivating.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to that plane to meet up with his sweetheart.\u201d Jonathan rolled his eyes impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Asana\u2019s face looked better. If so, it was no longer a matter of charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor real!\u201d \u201cAlright, you can leave now. I want to sleep.\u201d Jonathan yawned, threw himself on the bed, and gave the order to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me back the mirror.\u201d Ashanina held out her hand for what she wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep it for me for now. It\u2019s such a fun thing, I\u2019ll only give it to you after playing for a while.\u201d Jonathan closed his eyes and stopped her before she could say anything else. \u201cI say, Sister Witch, you\u2019re not so stingy, are you?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a little thing. Lending it to my only little brother to play with for a while isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d \u201cDamn child!\u201d Asana stared at Jonathan who was lying on the bed, turned around and left helplessly. He closed the door behind him.</p><br/><p>The footsteps in the corridor gradually faded away. Johansson then took out the mirror and carefully touched it. He didn\u2019t want to borrow the mirror for fun. He was afraid that if he gave the mirror back to Aisha Nina and she went to check on him, his true identity would be exposed. We can\u2019t let that happen.</p><br/><p>He had just put the mirror back when there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Johansson asked impatiently. Just as he was about to say that he was sleeping, he tactfully disappeared into the distance. But then he heard the familiar voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. Let\u2019s go. It\u2019s dinner time.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve slept all afternoon. It\u2019s about time.\u201d When Xiao returned from the teahouse, she came to find Jonathan and went to the cafeteria for dinner. It seemed like it had been a while since he had been to the cafeteria. In the afternoon, he ate some pastries to fill his stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201cComing, coming!\u201d Jonathan hurriedly dressed and went to open the door. Jonathan was not reserved in front of Asharana, nor in front of Qi Ao Shuang. But it was different now. Now that he knew that she was a woman, Jonathan began to notice. He would definitely not appear in front of Qi Ao Shuang so blatantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you rested well?\u201d After opening the door, Qi Aushuang stood in front of him and asked with some concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s go and eat.\u201d It\u2019s been so many days since I\u2019ve had dinner in the cafeteria that I\u2019ve started to miss it. \u201d Jonathan grinned, hiding his panic.</p><br/><p>The days began to go by in such a methodical manner. Xiao Ao Shuang and Jonathan frequently went into the academy\u2019s library and material storage. More often than not, the two of them would enter the Stellar Heavenly Pagoda together, and it was unknown what they were doing there.</p><br/><p>All of this was witnessed by Dittos. He only looked at their actions with approval, not moving forward with them.</p><br/><p>However, the person who was the happiest was the Headmaster. When the Headmaster saw all of this, he was extremely happy as he watched the strength of Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan grow stronger day by day. On the other hand, Brill, who had already entered the Sky Tower, had never shown any signs of breaking through. It was better for them to place their hopes on Qi Ao Shuang and the rest. Dylan, Qi Ao Shuang, and Jonathan were indeed the top three students in the academy. Their strength was increasing by the day, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before they completed the mission. Furthermore, with their talent, they would definitely be able to \u2026</p><br/><p>The dean stood in front of the window, looking down at the silhouettes of Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan. The two were on their way to the Sky Tower. A satisfied smile appeared on the dean\u2019s face. After nodding slightly, he turned around and met the pair of gloomy eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, Elder Valentine, why are you looking so gloomy?\u201d \u201cOur mission is about to be completed. Shouldn\u2019t we be happy?\u201d A smile appeared on the dean\u2019s handsome face as he walked past the person standing in front of him and sat on the sofa beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope this mission will never be completed!\u201d The elder named Valentine wore a gloomy expression as he slowly walked to the window. Looking at the backs of Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan, his heart sank.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, don\u2019t tell me you want to stay here forever and not think about our hometown?\u201d Don\u2019t you miss your family? \u201d The Dean shook his head and smiled sarcastically. \u201cValentine, have you forgotten the pain we have to suffer every year if we don\u2019t complete the task?\u201d \u201cLife is worse than death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather die in that battle.\u201d Valentine\u2019s face grew darker and darker, and he put his right hand to his empty left sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d If you die here, your soul will never return to our homeland. \u201d The dean tried to comfort her, but a hint of sadness flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that require so many lives and souls to bear?!\u201d Valentine suddenly turned and raised his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cValentine!\u201d Pay attention to the tone of your voice! Also, I\u2019m the one in charge here. Get out of here! \u201cDo not act without my orders!\u201d The dean stood up angrily and shouted back at Valentine, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t let that person go back then, why would we be on our guard now?\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t want to go back alone, but you have to think about the other brothers! \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say. Think about it yourself!\u201d Without waiting for Valentine to leave, he slammed the door and left. Valentine was left alone in the room.</p><br/><p>Valentine looked at the closed door of the room, and his eyes faded and faded.</p><br/><p>Finally, he let out a long sigh and turned to look at the blue sky through the window.</p><br/><p>When will things start?</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, didn\u2019t you not want to step into the Space Shattering Realm?\u201d \u201cWhy are you working so hard now?\u201d After Xiao Aushuang and Jonathan entered the Heavenly Tower again, Xiao Aushuang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind now.\u201d Jonathan blinked and rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d \u201cYou know it\u2019s dangerous, but you still want to go?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang walked forward while Jonathan followed closely behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo reason, I just want to go with you.\u201d Jonathan seemed to be perfunctory, but there was a voice in his heart telling him that because he didn\u2019t want to see anything wrong with Qi Ao Shuang, he had to follow her.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not pursue the matter any further. She could tell that Jonathan was being perfunctory. There wouldn\u2019t be any result if he continued asking, so he decided to just leave it at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Qi Ao Shuang, do you feel any changes in your body right now?\u201d \u201cAiya, to be honest, how far do you think you are from breaking through?\u201d Jonathan sounded anxious as he suddenly saw a figure in the distance. That\u2019s Dittos! Jonathan clearly remembered the bet between Qi Ao Shuang and Dittancz in the main hall of the Tian Dao Sect. If Qi Ao Shuang breaks through after Ditanth, then Ditanth will kill everyone related to Qi Ao Shuang. He was one of them! Jonathan subconsciously touched his neck and swallowed his saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot far.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Aohan replied in a low voice, then he raised his head and looked at the Dittos in the distance. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s gaze turned cold. Although this man was lonely and sorrowful, he was not from the same world as him. This paranoid person would never be able to become friends, and would never be able to become friends.</p><br/><p>Dittos heard the voices of the two men and stopped where he was, waiting for them to come forward.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan stopped as well. The three of them stared at each other in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang \u2026\u201d After a long time, Dittas finally spoke first, calling out Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s name in a low voice. This was the first direct exchange between the two of them since they left the Tian Dao Sect.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Love is willing to give up everything for a person, not take the lives of others recklessly! You don\u2019t respect people, you\u2019re selfish, you only love yourself, you don\u2019t think about other people\u2019s feelings at all. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you seem to know how to love?\u201d The Heavenly King\u2019s eyes flashed with a faint sneer.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetter than you, at least.\u201d Lily snapped angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are willing to die for the people you love?\u201d The Heavenly King\u2019s voice was faint and abnormally feminine.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I will never kill the man I love the way you did. \u201cThat\u2019s not love at all!\u201d Lily angrily rebuked the King.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, I didn\u2019t kill him. I\u2019m with him forever. \u201d The Heavenly King turned his head to the mirror beside him and murmured, \u201cHow can you mediocre people understand what the ultimate of love is \u2026\u201d Now, everyone finally understood why the decorations in the palace were so strange. It turned out that there was a mirror here!</p><br/><p>In her eyes, the King of Heaven was an absolute pervert.</p><br/><p>The King smiled faintly, turning to look at Xiao Aushuang and said: \u201cI will not argue with you.\u201d Love is what you ask yourselves. Go where you\u2019re supposed to go. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Lily bit her teeth and squeezed out the two words.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King glanced at Lily before shifting his gaze to Jin Yan. A trace of mockery flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that you loved the Heavenly King, and that\u2019s why you betrayed him and murdered him?\u201d Mishus carried the unconscious Moon King in his arms and asked with a dark expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d You can leave with them now, or you can choose to stay and get out. \u201cAs long as you keep your word, I don\u2019t want to bother you anymore.\u201d The Heavenly King said with a look of disdain, \u201cAll of you are no match for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mishus\u2019 face sank. It was extremely unsightly, but just as the Heavenly King had said, they had no other choice. Only by relying on the cooperation of the various kings could he undo the seal and exterminate the Heavenly King. But now that the Winged King had left, the current King of White and King Yong probably wouldn\u2019t be willing to kill the Heavenly King either.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I hope you can keep your promise.\u201d Mezus picked up the Moon King and left the hall without looking back. Moon King was severely injured and needed to be treated and rested as soon as possible, but Mishus didn\u2019t want to waste time in these areas. He could tell that the person behind Qi Ao Shuang had an extraordinary relationship with the Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King didn\u2019t pay any more attention to Mezus. Instead, he slowly walked to the throne and pressed on its armrest. The chair emitted a creaking sound and slowly moved to the side, revealing a passageway.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Camille has ordered it.\u201d The Heavenly King stood at the side and looked at the crowd, \u201cIf you want to go, then go. If you don\u2019t want to go, then stay.\u201d Perhaps he would never be able to come back to that place again. Maybe, but no, you\u2019ll never find him. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over there?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked subconsciously.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King only smiled faintly, not saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d stay with you forever.\u201d Feng Yi Xuan leaned close to Qi Ao Shuang. His voice was light but firm.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun smiled and took a step forward.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan\u2019s resolute gaze didn\u2019t need to be said, so Lily naturally moved closer to him. Everything goes without saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up.\u201d \u201cIt may be too late.\u201d The Heavenly King said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ao Shuang.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for the matter to come to an end.\u201d Feng Yixuan said in a deep voice and took the initiative to lead the way.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression changed. She wanted to stop Feng Yi Xuan, but Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s figure had already disappeared into the passageway. The next one, Leng Lingyun, also followed. At this moment, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart sank, and a sinister voice sounded from behind her: \u201cStop pretending to be so nice.\u201d Get in. The matter will soon come to an end. \u201d After saying that, Qing Hua extended her hand to push Qi Aushuang aside. Qi Aushuang was caught off guard and was pushed into the tunnel by the force, as she threw herself into it in a sorry state.</p><br/><p>Qinghua let out a cold snort, then followed after him.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan\u2019s expression darkened. Resisting his impulses, he followed without hesitation. Lily pulled Jin Yan to the corner of his clothes and chased after him.</p><br/><p>Dittos was about to step forward as well, but the Heavenly King was somewhat taken aback. He asked, \u201cYou want to enter as well?\u201d Why? You\u2019re not after these trivial things, are you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Dittas paused for a moment, looked at the Heavenly King, and said softly, \u201cAre you afraid of loneliness?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heavenly King was stunned, as was Jonathan. When they came back to their senses, Dittas had already disappeared into the tunnel.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, Heavenly King, I\u2019ll be leaving too.\u201d It was the only human thing I\u2019d known of Dittos in years. People were all afraid of loneliness. No matter how great a person\u2019s achievements were or how powerful he was, he would still be lonely without anyone by his side. But Dittos, the silly bird, thought only of love. Actually, a cold and heartless person couldn\u2019t be strong. One had to have feelings as a backer. Love, kinship, friendship. I think of this idiot as a friend, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have one. \u201d Jonathan was at a loss. He looked up at the king and asked, \u201cKing, in your eyes, is there only love?\u201d</p><br/><p>King Tian opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but found that he could not say a word. Lilly\u2019s angry words had not left him speechless, but Jonathan\u2019s words had left him at a loss as to what to say. Friendship? In the past, he seemed to have such a beautiful friendship, but he didn\u2019t cherish it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not stepping into this passageway for the sake of Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d I like her, but she doesn\u2019t want me to follow her at the cost of my life. But that idiot Dittas, I can\u2019t let him go. Jonathan smiled sadly, his eyes lonely. \u201cYou are the number one love, but friendship is number one in my world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jonathan went into the passage without looking back.</p><br/><p>It would have been a shock to know Jonathan and Dittas at this time. No one would have thought that Jonathan, venomous and outwardly dissolute, would be such a righteous man. The subject, however, still had only his own Dittos in his eyes. But that\u2019s the way it is, human feelings are always so subtle. You are the most important person in a person\u2019s life, but for that person, you may not matter. Life is full of drama and irony.</p><br/><p>After Jonathan entered the tunnel, his vision went dark and his body felt as if it was stuck by a net. After struggling to get out of the net, his entire body relaxed. Then a blinding light flashed in front of him, and Jonathan instinctively put his hand under his eyebrows. When he got used to the light in front of him, he found a brand-new world in front of him.</p><br/><p>Looking around, he saw endless fields, green and lush. It was quite a pleasant sight to see. Xiao Ao Shuang and the rest of his men were standing right in front of him. They were on a small hill with a huge green tree. The green tree was like a huge parasol, suddenly blooming on the mountain. No one seemed to have recovered enough to see what this place was.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pure raw power, and it\u2019s filled with this power.\u201d Azureflower suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch, where is this?\u201d \u201cThe air is fine.\u201d The sky also suddenly drilled out of Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s body. After that, he jumped onto the tree and began to deeply breathe the air here. As for Jin Lian and Liu Li, they soon appeared. Although Jin Lian was still a little haggard, but the two of them couldn\u2019t conceal the excitement and excitement on their faces. Clearly, this place was very unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this?\u201d Lily raised her head and looked at the blue sky without a trace of impurity, then looked at the boundless wilderness and asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>No one could answer him.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked back. The passage was gone. However, he did not panic at all. Before he came in, his heart was already very clear.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked over, and she was also puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the dwelling place of the gods.\u201d Suddenly, a voice rang in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind. This voice was exactly the same as hers, but it was filled with coldness and indifference.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s her! It was the goddess!</p><br/><p>In an instant, Xiao Ao Shuang realised who was speaking to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe god\u2019s residence?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang murmured the words of the goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder. I was wondering why this place is so full of raw and pure power.\u201d \u201cSo this is the dwelling place of the world\u2019s true gods.\u201d Qing Hua\u2019s eyes slightly darkened as she spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe residences of the God of Father and the Goddess?!\u201d Everyone immediately thought of this and their faces were filled with astonishment and disbelief.</p><br/><p>This was actually the residence of the God of Father and the God of Mother? How did Camille set up such a channel?</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille, Camille \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang suddenly had an ominous feeling in her heart.</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Ao Shuang mumbled Camil\u2019s name in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Camil, however, appeared in front of Qi Ao Shuang in an instant.</p><br/><p>It was still that handsome and gentle smile, it was still that brilliant and dazzling golden hair, it was still that azure blue eyes that were as bright as gems.</p><br/><p>Just like that, he appeared in front of Qi Ao Shuang with a big smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang shouted in surprise.</p><br/><p>Camil, on the other hand, continued to smile. Gradually, the crowd realized that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>The Camil that appeared before the crowd was not a physical entity, but an image. It was just a lifelike shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, I\u2019ve finally waited for you \u2026\u201d Camil spoke slowly, a gentle smile still on his face, but Qi Ao Shuang finally noticed.</p><br/><p>Camille seemed very weak.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was something as ridiculous as that?</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst leave this place quickly. In a while, there will be lightning strikes. This lightning is no small matter; it\u2019s not something the human body can resist.\u201d Claire said to them solemnly. \u201cThis lightning is only directed towards me. If you leave, there will be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d When they heard Claire\u2019s words, their expressions changed greatly.</p><br/><p>There was actually something like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss! You even said that it\u2019s something the human body can\u2019t resist, how, how are you going to resist?\u201d Jean became worried, wanting to rush to Claire\u2019s side. But Cliff had already set up a sturdy barrier and even put up a couple of layers. Naturally, people outside weren\u2019t able to reach Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019ll immediately undo the barriers.\u201d Cliff also became frantic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time, master. If you undo them right now, I will definitely die. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll still have a sliver of hope for living. Quickly get out of the way.\u201d Claire immediately shouted at Cliff to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Claire, what on earth is going on?\u201d Cliff was so frantic, his face was full of sweat, but he didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you after, don\u2019t bother me now.\u201d Claire immediately sat in the lotus position, clapping her palms lightly before her chest, starting to use the second level of the Treasured Lotus Style.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first withdraw.\u201d Ben advised Cliff and Jean, seeing the rumbling dark clouds and the lightning and thunder within the layers.</p><br/><p>The two weren\u2019t willing to take even one step away.</p><br/><p>Black dragon Ben instantly transformed back, grabbed one of them in each claw, then immediately retreated.</p><br/><p>The rumbling sound of thunder resonated into the horizon. A lightning writhing about amidst the dark clouds, making one\u2019s heart alarmed and one tremble with fear, completely charged with berserk and dreadful power.</p><br/><p>One, just one lightning bolt!</p><br/><p>Claire clenched her teeth. She should be able to withstand it.</p><br/><p>A shocking, dreadful, snow white lightning bolt streaked across the night sky, directly striking at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff and Jean both frantically cried out.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t some small lightning from a magician, it was a natural lightning bolt from the sky!</p><br/><p>Brimming with berserk and unsteady power.</p><br/><p>The bolt of lightning lit the surroundings white.</p><br/><p>As he watched the situation, Ben froze. His claws loosened, dropping Jean and Cliff.</p><br/><p>They saw very clearly that all of Cliff\u2019s barriers were struck broken by the lightning bold, but didn\u2019t see it wound Claire.</p><br/><p>Because they couldn\u2019t see Claire!</p><br/><p>Claire was wrapped up tightly by a gigantic golden lotus. The giant golden lotus shined brightly, dazzling more so within the night, more beautiful than anything that could be imagined. It deeply shocked their souls, making one unable to move their gaze away.</p><br/><p>The lightning bolt broke Cliff\u2019s barriers and attacked the golden petals, but was like a stone that had been thrown into the sea and sunk to the bottom: without any reaction.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the dark clouds dissipated. The night sky was once again glittering with stars, as if the dark clouds and lightning just then was their hallucination.</p><br/><p>The two humans and dragon just blankly stared at Claire, deeply engrossed by the golden lotus wrapped around Claire. Slowly, the golden golden lotus gradually opened its petals, showing Claire, who had was sitting inside. Everybody would remember this sight for a long time. The current Claire was so at peace and beautiful, attracting one\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>Claire gradually opened her eyes and slowly got up. Looking down and seeing the giant lotus beneath her feet, she inwardly cursed at the creator of the Treasured Lotus Style cultivation method. How sneaky. The golden lotus seemed to be specialized for the tribulation lightning. In other words, every time she comprehended, there would be tribulation lightning and the golden lotus would protect?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Cliff and Jean hurriedly rushed over, both looking very worried.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the golden lotus suddenly shined millions of rays of light, completely submerging Claire. Slowly, the light dimmed down.</p><br/><p>Everybody was in shock as they watched Claire close her eyes, hair blowing, her sleeves also flying fast. Her refined look stunned one\u2019s heart. An indescribable feeling of freedom emitted out of every fiber of her being. It was as if something from deep within her body was slowly sprouting, then blossoming.</p><br/><p>Then the bright golden lotus slowly disappeared. The surroundings darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Everyone hurried over.</p><br/><p>Claire sighed quietly. How was she going to explain to them?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you, you advanced?\u201d Cliff watched Claire and suddenly shouted, pleasantly surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re actually now at the level of a wizard, before, you were only a grand magician.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? Wizard?!</p><br/><p>The capital\u2019s temple of Light.</p><br/><p>In front of the inscription of the goddess of Light, there was the green haired woman, the temple of Light\u2019s best prophet. She was currently kneeling, eyes closed, in front of the divine inscription.</p><br/><p>A moment later, she slowly got up and opened her strange pair of eyes.</p><br/><p>The goddess had just given out orders!</p><br/><p>The person the goddess wanted to find was in Yowusali!</p><br/><p>They needed to immediately send people there to find them!</p><br/><p>Advanced? She advanced just like that?</p><br/><p>Claire looked at her hands suspiciously, feeling something was different from before. There was some kind of power filling her body. But, she had so suddenly just like that? Did it have to do with the Treasured Lotus Style?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what was that flower just now? Why would lightning strike?\u201d Ben continued to ask, suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u2026\u201d Claire was thinking of how to reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d An impatient shout came from the distance. It was Feng Yixuan\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned to see Feng Yixuan madly dash over.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything you saw just then was what I learned from the book from Summer.\u201d Claire replied briefly, not planning on hiding anything.</p><br/><p>Learned it from that book? Jean was suspicious. The words on the book didn\u2019t seem to be from this continent, why was Claire able to understand them?Ben\u2019s expression was even more confused. Cliff, on the other hand, was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, are you alright?\u201d Feng Yixuan rushed over, grabbing Claire\u2019s hand. He inspected her up and down. Seeing Claire was not the slightest bit wounded, he calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about that dragon? Why was there lightning just then?\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned, sizing up the surroundings. The surroundings were a mess, many large crevices in the ground, and also many fractured trees and shattered stone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ran away.\u201d Claire pulled away her hand and said insipidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt ran away?\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s mouth opened wide. Dragons were arrogant beings, why would one suddenly run away?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe had some business, so he suddenly ran. It seemed like someone was calling him.\u201d Claire said, her expression completely serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Feng Yixuan scratched his head. Then, a stab of pain came from the nape of his neck and he jumped up. \u201cShui Wenmo, that scum, he actually attacked me secretly again. If I don\u2019t completely beat him up this time, he won\u2019t know\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t die here. Let him take you away.\u201d Claire stopped Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan froze and just stood there, facing away from Claire, suddenly quieting down. Nobody could see his expression.</p><br/><p>From far away, Shui Wenmo and Summer also made their way over. They had hurried over after confirming they were safe.</p><br/><p>As they came close, everybody saw that one of Shui Wenmo\u2019s eyes had become a panda eye, evidently from Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the dragon.\u201d Summer asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was some matter to deal with at Dragon Valley, he was suddenly summoned over.\u201d Ben had understood Claire\u2019s real meaning, lying without any indication of guilt.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Our luck is so good.\u201d Summer jumped up and down.</p><br/><p>Ben had said these words, so naturally, there was some credibility.</p><br/><p>But now they had already created a grudge with the golden dragon. Wanting to safely pass through Dragon Valley would be harder than hard, basically impossible, because offending the dragon race\u2019s king equated to offending the entire dragon race. If they were discovered while passing through Dragon Valley, with one dragon breath, they would turn to dust.</p><br/><p>Was it good luck or bad luck?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s first leave this place. With something that big happening here, soon there will be people investigating.\u201d Cliff said, looking at the disordered surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s first pack up our things and leave.\u201d Claire turned, looking for something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Jean asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, here. Little Wind,<sup></sup>come over here.\u201d Claire happily beckoned.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan turned, baffled. Was Claire calling him? It couldn\u2019t be.</p><br/><p>The wind leopard that had been withdrawn in a corner slowly stood up, trembling as it walked over. This guy had not dared to run. Just then, he had seen everything, so much so that he didn\u2019t dare to run. Imprinted deeply into his heart was that Claire was extremely frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Wind?\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s mouth twitched as he pointed towards the slowly walking over wind leopard, completely confused as he asked, \u201cHe\u2019s Little Wind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou gotta problem?\u201d Claire rubbed the wind leopard\u2019s soft fur, extremely satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you touch it and call out my name, I\u2019ll be thinking of strange things.\u201d Feng Yixuan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s face darkened. While stroking the wind leopard, she said, \u201cFrom now on your name is Little Leopard, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pitiful wind leopard looked at the dominating Claire and then nodded heavily.</p><br/><p>Now Claire relaxed. Everybody didn\u2019t need to carry anything as everything went into Cliff\u2019s interspatial ring. But the ring couldn\u2019t carry anything living. The four horses couldn\u2019t travel there and it would be up to them to walk there. But now it was different.</p><br/><p>The wind leopard\u2019s tall body, soft fur, graceful body, and thick padded feet completely made it a top notch mount.</p><br/><p>Currently, Claire was riding the wind leopard, face full of content. Claire had practically laid down, half of her body touching the wind leopard\u2019s back. Summer seemed to be afraid of furry animals, staying far away.</p><br/><p>After leaving the place far behind, Claire yawned. The sky was already faintly glowing white. The ruckus had transpired the whole night, so they didn\u2019t get to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rest here. You guys should go back to where you came from. There\u2019s no way you can pass through Dragon Valley.\u201d Ben sat down and said insipidly. \u201cYou\u2019ve offended that narrow minded, vicious and merciless guy who\u2019s sure to remember it. Now he\u2019s even inherited the royal golden power. Once his wound is better, he\u2019ll immediately think of a way for revenge. It\u2019s better to first think of how to deal with him.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

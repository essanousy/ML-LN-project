Normally, she was afraid of him, but today, she had the chance of being a little mean to him. Naturally, she wouldn\u2019t let the opportunity go.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d Ben followed from behind, embarrassed. As he left, he cautiously glanced at Claire a few times.</p><br/><p>Jean was at the very back. He closed the door quietly, then stood there at the door.</p><br/><p>After Leng Lingyun saw that everybody have left, he set up a magic barrier. Only after making sure there was no change of eavesdropping, he turned and looked at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you want to ask how all the earth spikes changed directions and turned to that person instead?\u201d Claire got right to the point.</p><br/><p>But Leng Lingyun asked, \u201cI\u2019m curious about that too, but I only wanted to ask, who created the anomaly that day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either. When I arrived I only saw the lightning and thunder.\u201d Naturally, Claire wouldn\u2019t explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026.\u201d Leng Lingyun stared at Claire. He said quietly, \u201cWhen you were at Yowusali, did you see something like that happen too? Although it was in the outskirts of a relatively remote city, some people still witnessed it.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes flashed, but she said expressionlessly, \u201cWhat do you want to say, your highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know about that anomaly or is that anomaly related to you?\u201d Leng Lingyun said slowly and carefully. Although it was a question, his certain tone showed that Leng Lingyun was sure that it was related to Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent, but internally, she was cursing. As expected, this divine prince isn\u2019t that easy to fool.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone rumored to be an idiotic man chaser that was actually a genius in the end. With this kind of a miracle, the anomaly in the sky counts as nothing.\u201d Leng Lingyun stared at Claire intensely, like he was trying to find an answer in Claire\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is your highness so concerned?\u201d Claire pointed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m curious myself, second, the pope has entrusted me with investigating.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s response was honest, but then he said exceptionally seriously, \u201cBut, please trust me. I wouldn\u2019t do anything that could harm you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Leng Lingyun said this, Claire froze.</p><br/><p>What did that mean?</p><br/><p>Why did it sound a little suspicious?</p><br/><p>Claire stared at the man in front of her, but couldn\u2019t find any traces of lying in his violet eyes that were full of sincerity.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun was also watching Claire. In his mind, Xuanxuan\u2019s words sounded: \u201cElder brother, promise me, you need to protect that big sis well. That big sister is a good person, only she can do what I have always wanted to do but couldn\u2019t. This is my only request, elder brother.\u201d Leng Lingyun didn\u2019t understand why the always sensible Xuanxuan would suddenly say those words. Her gaze wasn\u2019t requesting, but pleading. Although he didn\u2019t understand, Leng Lingyun immediately promised. To him, Xuanxuan was the most important thing in the world. Whenever Xuanxuan had a request for anything, he would always agree.</p><br/><p>Claire just stared at the person in front of her without moving. Could she trust the person before her?</p><br/><p>Claire was a bit hesitant. From the first time they had met, she had felt something unusual.</p><br/><p>Really unusual. What was it about him that was different? Why did she have such a feeling?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince your highness has already promised, is there a need to question me?\u201d Claire said quietly, smiling faintly. Actually, the faint words had already answered Leng Lingyun\u2019s doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really you?\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned slightly. The person the pope wanted to find was Claire? But was it a good thing or bad thing?</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent, not saying anything any more.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun also fell silent.</p><br/><p>In his heart, he had already made a decision.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun slowly stood up, looking at Claire as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t find any trouble for you. You should first rest. I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d After saying these words, Leng Lingyun left.</p><br/><p>Claire watched Leng Lingyun from behind as he left, her gaze a bit complex. This man\u2019s attitude was very strange. Truly, very strange. Before, he was a cold person who stayed away from people, aloof, but now he said such words. Perhaps he had been affected by something?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at this time, Liuxue Qing had already returned quickly to the temple of Light and seeing the pope.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack clothed, black haired man? Strength so powerful you couldn\u2019t see through him?\u201d The pope say on a chair, questioning Liuxue Qing quietly. The embroidered design of suns decorated the pope\u2019s snow white robe while his expression was solemn and dignified.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think he and the black dragon from that night are related. But I can\u2019t tell exactly what the black clothed man is. Please inspect him, your holiness. The black clothed man is definitely not human.\u201d Liuxue Qing was sure of Ben\u2019s identity. One the pope confirmed the black clothed man\u2019s identity, then it would be certain that the theft of the goddess\u2019s gift was related to Claire! It was undoubtable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I understand. You may leave.\u201d The pope waved slightly, indicating for Liuxue Qing to leave. Liuxue Qing still wanted to say something, but seeing the pope\u2019s cold expression, she swallowed back her words and quietly withdrew.</p><br/><p>The pope stood up, his face already ice cold, his eyes even colder. If what the divine princess said was true, then the theft of the goddess\u2019s gift was definitely related to that girl. No matter who, since she had actually done a thing, violating the goddess, she definitely had to be punished. With all these indications, the divine princess\u2019s words wouldn\u2019t be far from the truth. The divine princess\u2019s power was the greatest validation!</p><br/><p>When Leng Lingyun returned to the temple, he didn\u2019t directly report to the pope. Instead, he went to find the greatest clairvoyant, L\u2019Or\u00e9al.</p><br/><p>He knocked on her door quietly. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s celestial voice came from within. \u201cCome in, Lingyun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun opened the door quietly and saw the green haired L\u2019Or\u00e9al currently standing calmly in the middle of the room, a huge transparent crystal ball on a stand. Leng Lingyun looked the woman with a complex gaze. He had always held L\u2019Or\u00e9al with high regard. This woman was not arrogant or impatient, always the most calm headed and fair person.</p><br/><p>\u201cL\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2026\u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun sighed quietly, not saying anything else. L\u2019Or\u00e9al had already stopped him with a light wave of her hand.</p><br/><p>A heavenly voice came from L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s mouth. \u201cI know what you came to ask. The person the goddess had been looking for is already found, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun froze for a moment, falling silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cA useful blade or weapon against us.\u201d L\u2019Or\u00e9al said faintly, her gaze still strangely empty, but this strange and empty pair of eyes were often able to see the future accurately.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026.\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you must make her become our temple\u2019s blade instead of weapon against us.\u201d L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s voice gradually became quietly, her tone meaningful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun understands.\u201d Leng Lingyun nodded. With just a few words, Leng Lingyun already completely understood L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s meaning. Claire was the exceptional person the goddess was looking for to be used for the temple, her prospects brilliant and bottomless. If she wasn\u2019t used by the temple, then she would become a great threat. Then the temple would definitely find to think up every possible way of getting rid of her. Xuanxuan\u2019s eager, pleading face appeared once more in Leng Lingyun\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Leng Lingyun.\u201d L\u2019Or\u00e9al smiled profoundly.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun bowed slightly, then quietly withdrew.</p><br/><p>After knocking on the pope\u2019s door, the pope\u2019\u2019s benevolent yet dignified voice came. \u201cLingyun, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>After entering, Leng Lingyun saw the pope standing at next to the window with an icy cold expression. He seemed to be pondering about something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness.\u201d Leng Lingyun said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been progress made for the matter of the theft of the goddess\u2019s gift.\u201d The pope said coldly.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun froze, then said while frowning, \u201cA lead has been found so soon? Who exactly was it that was able to steal the goddess\u2019s gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>But the pope didn\u2019t respond to Leng Lingyun\u2019s question immediately. Instead, he turned and said meaningfully, \u201cToday when you went to find Claire, was there a black clothed black haired man who\u2019s strength you couldn\u2019t see through and seemed inhuman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun frowned slightly, not understanding the purpose of the pope\u2019s question, but he remembered the scene of Claire being struck flying violently. He couldn\u2019t help but nod slightly. \u201cCorrect. His power was very strong, and his power is very wild.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he have a human aura?\u201d The pope asked quietly, but he already knew the answer.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun fell silent. After a long time, he shook his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t feel any human aura from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d The pope humphed coldly, his eyes already filled with fury. Audacious! A trifling castellan actually had the arrogance to steal the goddess\u2019s gift! She was actually able to summon a grandiose dragon to do such shady business!</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun couldn\u2019t help but call out a little worriedly, \u201cYour holiness?\u201d How could he not feel the huge change in the pope\u2019s aura?</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s eyes became icy cold, but he suppressed his fury. He turned towards Leng Lingyun, already planning how he was going to punish Claire.</p><br/><p>The pope adjusted his expression and asked, \u201cThat\u2019s right, what did you come here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person the goddess was looking for has been found. I have already confirmed with L\u2019Or\u00e9al. It is them.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s words lightened the pope\u2019s dark complexion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Already found? L\u2019Or\u00e9al also confirmed?\u201d The pope became a little excited. This was earth shaking news! The goddess had ordered to find the person long ago, yet they had only found out now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, already found.\u201d Leng Lingyun looked at the excited pope and revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who caused the anomaly in the sky?! Are you sure?\u201d The pope asked a little eagerly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It was she who caused the anomaly in the sky.\u201d Leng Lingyun replied certainly. \u201cThe person who caused the anomaly in the sky that morning is none other than Claire Hill.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

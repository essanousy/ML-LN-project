He just stared at Leng Lingyun, frozen.</p><br/><p>The pope suddenly feel like the earth shattering news was unbearable. The person he had sentenced to death in his heart a moment ago was suddenly now the person the goddess had always been looking for. The average person wouldn\u2019t be able to bear such a feeling. A moment ago, his heart had hit rock bottom. Now, it shot up to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness?\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned slightly, somewhat puzzled as he saw the expression stuck on the pope\u2019s face. It was the first time he had seen the always expressionless pope display such strong emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh, oh?\u201d Only after a while did the pope finally come back to his senses. Then he stuttered, \u201cWha, what did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said\u2026.\u201d Leng Lingyun was about to repeat the words he just said, but was stopped by the pope with a wave of his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I heard you. Claire Hill is the person the goddess was looking for.\u201d The pope had already accepted this fact.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun fell silent seeing the pope act abnormally, not understanding what exactly was wrong with the pope.</p><br/><p>The pope tottered over to a chair, then sat down. He started to try to remember everything he knew about Claire. Usually, the pope didn\u2019t have any impressions of nobles, but Claire Hill was an exception. In his eyes, the battle Claire hand with the Lagark student didn\u2019t count as much, because she was just a double classed magician warrior and her skill level wasn\u2019t very high either. Then he heard that she was originally some kind of useless idiotic man-chaser, but she had become Cliff\u2019s disciple. What else was there?</p><br/><p>He rubbed his temples. \u201cLingyun, find everything you can about Claire Hill for me, as detailed as possible.\u201d The pope said, somewhat at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your holiness.\u201d Leng Lingyun agreed and withdrew, leaving a very conflicted feeling pope alone in the room.</p><br/><p>In the empty room, the pope stood in a daze by the window. Seeing the blue sky, he muttered to himself, \u201cGoddess, are you playing a joke on me? Or, mighty goddess, are you testing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, all information about Claire was sent to the pope.</p><br/><p>The pope read the information attentively, afraid of missing any details. Leng Lingyun, who was standing beside him, was puzzled, not understanding. He had never seen the pope so cautious before. No, to be more accurate, he had never seen the pope so cautious towards a single before. What exactly was going on? But there was one thing Leng Lingyun was sure of: currently, the pope had no intention of hurting Claire. Eliminating a single person didn\u2019t require understanding their past in such detail.</p><br/><p>As he looked, the pope\u2019s hands trembled, the look in his eyes changing constantly. Sure enough, Claire Hill was no normal person! She had always been looked down upon as an idiotic man chase, but she had rose quickly in status: she had gained fame from the battle against the Lagark student, became Cliff\u2019s disciple, became the Niya city\u2019s castellan, and quickly dealt with the plague. Double class magician warrior, and her skill level was already high. As a magician, she was already a wizard, and as a warrior, she had already advanced to a grand warrior! Could a normal person improve so quickly? Did she change suddenly? Or had she been concealing her strength and biding for time,?</p><br/><p>After he finished reading the information, the pope stood up abruptly, already having made a decision. Seeing Leng Lingyun\u2019s confused expression, he smiled. \u201cLingyun, in a few days it\u2019s Claire\u2019s birthday, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun nodded. It had been written very clearly in the information, so why was the pope still asking this?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s send her a grand gift.\u201d The pope smiled mysteriously. He set the information aside, a glint in his eyes. He said quietly, \u201cThen, we\u2019ll be welcoming a new priest.\u201d</p><br/><p>A grand gift?</p><br/><p>A new priest?</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun was amazed seeing the pope smile profoundly, feeling a premonition.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo, achoo, achoo\u2026..\u201d Sitting next to the window in a rocking chair, only after Claire sneezed three times did she stop.</p><br/><p>(TL: In manga and stuff, sneezing means someone\u2019s been talking about you.)</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, are did you catch a cold?\u201d Katherine, who was nearby, hurriedly got up to close the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Mother, only an itch in my nose.\u201d Claire smiled, waving offhandedly to stop what Katherine was doing. Seeing Katherine\u2019s gentle gaze, Claire\u2019s heart warmed. Once Katherine found out that she had been wounded, she immediately returned from the palace along with princess Maurice. Only after she was soothed for a long time did she return to the palace. Meanwhile, Katherine had been left behind to take care of Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs someone talking about you behind your back?\u201d Summer, who had originally paring a fruit, now hid it behind her back carefully because she was afraid Claire\u2019s three sneezes would make the fruit dirty even though she had been paring it for Claire to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s that annoying idiot, Alice Roman.\u201d The nearby blonde girl, Lashia, frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Claire froze. Why did Lashia suddenly mention her?</p><br/><p>Katherine glanced towards Lashia, but Lashia didn\u2019t see. Instead, she said proudly, \u201cElder sister, you still don\u2019t know. Last time when that idiot tried to murder you, she had been pardoned by the emperor reluctantly, but her grandfather had been fired from his position and all the officials of the Roman clan had their statuses lowered by three levels.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded lightly. \u201cI know, I was there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you don\u2019t know the wonderful thing that happened afterwards. A few days ago, the whole Roman clan actually deserted the country, all disappearing in one night seeking asylum in Lagark. The emperor was so angry, he ordered for their arrest, but Lagark didn\u2019t take any actions\u2026\u2026\u201d Lashia said excitedly, not noticing Claire\u2019s eyes darkening.</p><br/><p>The entire Roman clan actually fled? Surely, it was due to the emperor becoming extremely angry. It seemed that it was because of her that the situation had been exacerbated to this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, it\u2019s not because of you. It\u2019s said that it was the young man who had tried to murder you with Alice that day persuaded them to seek asylum at Lagark\u2026.\u201d Lashia said hurriedly, finally noticing the change in Claire\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cLashia!\u201d Katherine raised her voice a bit, stopping what Lashia was going to say.</p><br/><p>Lashia stuck her tongue out and shut up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019ve troubled you.\u201d Naturally, Claire understood that Katherine didn\u2019t want her to feel guilty, so she shouted at Lashia to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your birthday in a few days. Don\u2019t think too much of it.\u201d Katherine smiled gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded lightly, a faint smile on her lips, enjoying the current peaceful atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Summer and Qiao Chuxin, those two girls, disappeared without a trace for the next few days, saying they were preparing presents.</p><br/><p>Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.</p><br/><p>This day, the Hill mansion had become unusually lively early morning. There was an endless stream of horses and carriages before the mansion. Luxurious carriages entered constantly, the chamberlain\u2019s voice was about to yelled hoarse. At the entrance, the hands of maids who were welcoming honored guests and helping accept presents were about to go soft.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan stood at the entrance, his face rosy red, his mood extremely good. In comparison, Marquis Roger was very calm. He only stood behind Duke Gordan and assisted welcoming guests.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis highness, the second prince has arrived, her highness, the princess, has arrived!\u201d The chamberlain announced loudly, drawing his words out. The second prince and princess were both peers from Claire\u2019s school and also friends secretly, so attending the banquet was normal. Everybody smiled towards the second prince and princess, greeting them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Cliff has arrived!\u201d The chamberlain said loudly with all his energy, successfully attracting everybody\u2019s gazes over.</p><br/><p>Cliff was wearing a set of new clothes, energetically getting off his carriage, attracting everybody\u2019s gazes. As a master, naturally he had to attend his darling disciple\u2019s birthday.</p><br/><p>Nobles arrived constantly, the carriages already crowded together so much there was no room in the mansion. Even Gordan himself didn\u2019t expect that there would actually be so many people attending. Many aristocrats and influential figures had even brought their children. Of course Gordan knew what it meant. Claire would definitely have an arranged marriage, but because he still hadn\u2019t found the most suitable candidate, he didn\u2019t worry about it for now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe divine prince and divine princess have arrived!\u201d The chamberlain\u2019s voice was excited, almost hysterical. Influential figures of the Temple of Light had actually also appeared!</p><br/><p>After Duke Gordan finished greeting Cliff, he immediately welcomed and greeted Leng Lingyun and Liuxue Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highnesses, we are honored with your presence.\u201d Duke Gordan laughed, obviously in a very good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grace, you invited us so sincerely, we were bound to attend.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease sit.\u201d Duke Gordan proposed happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grace should be busy. We\u2019ll just take care of ourselves.\u201d Leng Lingyun nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo many people have arrived. Just a moment ago, we had even seen carriages of the royal family.\u201d Liuxue smiled as gently and elegantly as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Claire is classmates with the second prince and princess\u2026\u201d Duke Gordan smiled as he replied. Naturally, he didn\u2019t understand the deep meaning behind Liuxue Qing\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing inspected the surroundings, unable to suppress the joy in her heart. The more people, the better. Once his holiness exposed the black clothed man\u2019s true colors and convicted Claire, would Duke Gordan still be able to smile? Stealing the goddess\u2019s gift was a capital offense. No matter who it was, they would all be punished. Even the emperor wouldn\u2019t be able to shield her! Liuxue Qing was secretly pleased. His holiness sure knew how to pick his timing choosing this day in particular to punish Claire. Today, basically all the nobles of the capital had come, even the pope was going to come. What tricks could she play when being exposed before so many people? Soon, she would experience dropping from heaven to hell.</p><br/><p>The formerly extremely spacious grand hall was now bustling with activity. Luxurious clothes moved everywhere. The upper class women separated into groups and conversed with elaborate fans. The gentlemen were holding wine glasses and elegantly discussing together. Many high grade fruits and delicious foods were laid out on a long table. Fragrant wine, lovely music, this time, Duke Gordan had spent quite a bit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019ll take care of this bird thing? \u201d The dragon god\u2019s lips twitched, and then he seemed to be talking to himself: \u201cthat little bitch were too scheming, and I really disliked her. \u201d</p><br/><p>The black dragon had finally figured out everything from this. It was probably because the goddess of light had grasped the weakness of the face-saving dragon god, so she went to pretend pity and signed a contract with the powerful dragons that they couldn\u2019t casually attack a human being and that could not invade their territory.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t like that little bitch, let me go to help my friend. I\u2019ll help them in the dark. \u201d The black dragon frowned and interrupted the dragon god\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stupid pig, your identity has been recognized. Help, fuck help! Don\u2019t teach me any more lessons! \u201d The dragon god was furious hearing this. He pointed at black dragon\u2019s nose and began cursing. After cursing, he rolled his eyes, looking at the sky and didn\u2019t say anything. What he was thinking about is unknown.</p><br/><p>The black dragon was already very observant, so it obediently sat on the cloud, waiting for the dragon god\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastard, why didn\u2019t I find out that you were in the dragon clan? You are so cunning and deceitful, I should have discovered you long ago. Why haven\u2019t I noticed it before? \u201cDragon god has suddenly changed the topic.</p><br/><p>The black dragon opened its mouth wide. \u201cAre you praising me or insulting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could take it as praise.\u201d The dragon god nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy human friend taught me, and I learned so much from her. Only then will I be able to kick the former dragon king off the stage. \u201d Seeing the dragon god\u2019s attitude, the black dragon had understood the old man\u2019s preference, so he calmly told it to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn good, good. \u201cThe dragon god nodded with a smile on his face.\u201d I like her\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you mean I can go help her?\u201d The black dragon laughed in a sycophantic manner.</p><br/><p>\u2018When did I say okay? \u2018 The dragon god\u2019s face darkened as he said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>The black dragon didn\u2019t have the time to pull a long face than the dragon god rolled his eyes and chuckled, \u201cwe can\u2019t directly help her but we can do in the dark. I\u2019ve already seen the bitch disagreeable, and it\u2019s better to drag it down sooner. \u201d</p><br/><p>Black Dragon said: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Judy carried the crowd rushing toward to the Orc clan. Without Qi Aoshuang\u2019s asking about directions, Judy said she knew it and continued to fly in that direction.</p><br/><p>Judy never stopped flying even in the night. She knew that if she slowed down a little bit, perhaps her master\u2019s two friends would be dead!</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Judy.\u201d Jin Yan sat in the front seat and gently patted Judy\u2019s head with his hand, comforting her in light voice.</p><br/><p>Judy gritted her teeth and didn\u2019t speak. She was afraid that she would let go of her strength if she spoke. She kept fluttering her wings and flied on.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang felt anxious. She felt guilty towards Judy, who was exhausted, but she couldn\u2019t stop now. If she stopped, everything would be too late.</p><br/><p>After flying for two days and nights, Judy finally arrived at the Orc clan. In front was the orc\u2019s territory, and Judy could no longer hold herself back. She let out a wail and fell down. Her huge body straightly fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201cJudy!\u201d Jin Yan\u2019s expression changed and he urgently called out.</p><br/><p>However, Judy had completely exhausted her stamina by this time. She was completely exhausted and lost consciousness as she could not control her massive body.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang immediately spread her golden wings and flew up to cast layers of barrier of enchantment to catch Judy\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>At this time, Aosta floated up to the sky. Without waiting for everyone to make a move, he began chanting a complex mantra. A strong wind blew under Judy\u2019s body, slowing down her speed of descent. After that, a small green ball appeared from in Aosta\u2019s hand, and in an instant, it became a huge, soft green bed, which held Judy\u2019s already slow-down body steadily.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan sighed in relief. He then checked to see if Judy had been injured, and Leng Lingyun also helped him.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and Aosta were still in the air.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked at Aosta and said softly, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for you I saved her,\u201d he said coldly and then flew down to join the crowd. Qi Aoshuang also flew down neglecting Aosta\u2019s arrogance. She secretly sighed in her heart about the amazing power of Aosta.</p><br/><p>\u2018Judy, are you okay? \u2018 Qi Aoshuang\u2019s immediately asked anxiously when she landed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is okay, she is just tired.\u201d Leng Lingyun whispered.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan stood by Judy\u2019s neck and gently stroked her neck. Judy\u2019s heavy breathing and throat were rising and falling, her eyes still closed.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gently flew over and looked at the distressed Jin Yan, \u201cJin Yan \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, it\u2019s fine.\u201d It was as if Jin Yan knew what Qi Aoshuang wanted to say and stopped her.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang bit her lips and said, \u201cYou take care of Judy here, I\u2019ll go in with them. If Chu Xin and Dong Fenghou weren\u2019t here, it would be better if you were here. \u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan opened his mouth to say something but nothing come out of his mouth. He knew Qi Aoshuang\u2019s thoughts. She want him to take care of Judy here. It was an excuse to stop Qiao Chuxin and Dong Fenghou \u2026 However,he could not find a reason to refute this excuse.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan finally nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and Leng Lingyun flew up toward the territory of the Orc clan. Just as they were about to reach the edge of the Orc clan\u2019s territory, a cloud of dust rose up ahead of them. A group of crowd were approaching.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

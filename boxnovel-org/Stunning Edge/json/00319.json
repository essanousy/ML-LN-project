The worry and anxiety in his eyes fell into the Moon King\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMishus \u2026\u201d \u201cPut me down.\u201d King Yue struggled to say these words, \u201cI\u2019m running out of time.\u201d \u201cI, I have something to say to you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how is that possible?\u201d Something glinted in Mishus\u2019 eyes. He also knew that the woman was the Winged King\u2019s sister. She caused a huge ruckus when the Wings King was born. This was because she was indeed much more outstanding than the Winged King, but the one who became the Winged King was not her. She was indeed a rare genius, for it was a matter of great agitation. Later on, he worked hard to study Occupy and poison, and eventually, he disappeared into thin air and gradually disappeared out of people\u2019s line of sight. Who would have thought that he would appear here today.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy consciousness is about to dissipate \u2026\u201d Yue Wang\u2019s face revealed a sad smile, \u201cThere are some things that I\u2019ve always wanted to say to you, but I\u2019m afraid that if I don\u2019t say it this time, I\u2019ll never wake up from my slumber, and I won\u2019t have the chance to say them again \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yue Ya!\u201d Mishap and despair slowly filled Mishap\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan and Lily stood to the side, watching as the wound on Duke Yue\u2019s chest slowly healed. However, Duke Yue\u2019s face became paler and paler.</p><br/><p>At this time, Feng Yi Xuan and Qi Ao Shuang were still at the entrance of the main hall. Qi Ao Shuang looked at the pile of ashes on the ground and was unable to come back to her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, you, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked softly.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly turned her head to look at Feng Yi Xuan, but her eyes were completely empty. Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart trembled. He understood that something strange had happened to Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow annoying, why haven\u2019t we found him yet?\u201d How long will it take? \u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s cold voice rang out. She approached Feng Yi Xuan, then suddenly blossomed into a mesmerizing smile, \u201cQuick, find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and he are mine.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled as she pinched Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s chin. Suddenly, she frowned and said, \u201cThis way, when will we be able to find him?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve only been out for a short time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stared dumbly at the gorgeous Qi Ao Shuang, unable to say anything.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang let go of Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s chin and walked straight into the main hall to the Moon King and Mishus\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>Moon King was still struggling to speak to Mishus.</p><br/><p>\u201cMezus, I just wanted to tell you in the end.\u201d I love you. I loved you from the first time you saved me. \u201d King Yue\u2019s face became paler and paler. He could only feel his eyelids getting heavier and his consciousness becoming more and more indistinct.</p><br/><p>These words were already shocking to the world. Jin Yan slightly raised his brows, but he didn\u2019t have much of a reaction. Lily, however, covered her mouth in astonishment, staring at King Yue with her eyes wide open.</p><br/><p>However, to everyone\u2019s surprise, Mishus forced a smile. \u201cI know, I know.\u201d Do you think I really want to build a harem with beauty? \u201cSecular eyes do not allow us to be together. If we were together, how much harm would it cause you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMishus \u2026\u201d Duke Yue\u2019s eyes shone with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Ya\u2019er, I will definitely find the antidote for you!\u201d Mishus grasped the Moon King\u2019s hand and said passionately.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to find the antidote.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang interrupted coldly, \u201cAlright, look for him now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mishus was stunned, as was Emmie and Lily. Feng Yixuan frowned slightly and stood to the side without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Before Mishus could react, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand directly pressed onto the Moon King\u2019s chest. In an instant, a dazzling flame entered the Moon King\u2019s body, who frowned and screamed in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Upon seeing this, Mishen was so shocked that he wanted to rush forward to stop Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang didn\u2019t even turn her head. Her expression darkened. She was sent flying with a loud bang, crashing into the table and chairs behind her. The sounds of crashing and clattering could be heard incessantly.</p><br/><p>Duke Yue\u2019s pupils dilated. He wanted to say something, but a scorching pain burst out from within his body, making him almost unable to breathe.</p><br/><p>Lily looked at the scene in front of her with some anxiety. She looked at Qi Ao Shuang before turning her head to look at Jin Yan. Jin Yan was indeed calm. Lily stopped saying yes and waited.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan looked at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back and felt conflicted.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qi Ao Shuang withdrew her hand. She turned her head to look at Jin Yan coldly and said, \u201cHurry up and find him!\u201d After Qi Aushuang said this, she slowly closed her eyes and no longer made any other movements.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d Feng Yi Xuan hurriedly came forward to support Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>At this time, King Yue also slowly sat up. He then looked at Mishus, who was grimacing in pain and unable to get up for a long time. He softly called out, \u201cMishus \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA crescent moon?\u201d \u201cYou, are you alright?\u201d Mishen looked at Duke Yue\u2019s face in astonishment. Right now it was a little red, completely different from the paleness just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like I\u2019m fine.\u201d Yue Wang stood up, touching his chest with a frown, \u201cJust now, there seemed to be a ball of fire burning within my body, I was in so much pain that I wanted to die.\u201d But now it feels good, no, very good. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe poison has been detoxified?\u201d Mezus struggled to his feet, his mouth wide open.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At this moment, Jin Yan indifferently said, \u201cWrap up your things and prepare to depart.\u201d \u201cThis matter must be settled as soon as possible. Also, find that person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d \u201cWho is it?\u201d He grinned and got up. King Yue\u2019s clothes were also puzzled. \u201cQi Aoshuang\u2019s appearance is so abnormal. What exactly is going on with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d \u201cWho is she looking for?\u201d asked Matthews, baring his teeth.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan fell silent, not saying a word. Lily also looked curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun.\u201d Feng Yixuan said these three words in a low voice. He did not know why, but he felt that the him that Qi Ao Shuang mentioned was Leng Lingyun. There was no mistake, it was Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>Moon King and Mishus looked at each other, speechless.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan walked over to Qi Ao Shuang and softly called out to her with her eyes closed, \u201cMiss, Miss \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang raised her head as if she had just woken up from a dream and looked at the crowd, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember \u2026\u201d Before Lily could finish her words, she was stopped by Jin Yan\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>Looking at the strange looks in everyone\u2019s eyes, Xiao Ao Shuang frowned as she thought about it, and said in a low voice: \u201cDid, did I do something strange just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one said anything. Qi Ao Shuang looked towards Feng Yi Xuan, but he remained silent. However, he had already tacitly accepted it.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang lowered her eyes, feeling a little depressed in her heart. At that moment, she suddenly froze. This was because she felt the strange power within her body slowly expanding! Qi Ao Shuang gently opened her hand, and her eyes slightly darkened. She concentrated, and a flame suddenly appeared on her palm. The red flame, just as she had seen it in her own dream.</p><br/><p>This was a flame that belonged to her and was completely different from the fire that had gathered fire elements since she had arrived in this world! Such a thought suddenly appeared in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan called out, \u201cMoon King, Mi Xiu King, we\u2019ll set off after a short rest.\u201d \u201cThat woman means that the new White King and King Yong are both with the Heavenly King. It seems that we can go find the Winged King directly to the Heavenly King.\u201d</p><br/><p>Moon King and Mishus looked at each other. The two of them first nodded their heads worriedly, then their faces reddened in silence.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan didn\u2019t pay any more attention to Moon King and Misius. Instead, he squatted in front of Qi Ao Shuang and said, \u201cMiss, don\u2019t think too much about it.\u201d \u201cI think when I find Leng Lingyun and Camil, there will be an answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the resolute expression on Jin Yan\u2019s face, Qi Ao Shuang nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan simply clenched Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>As they set off, Qi Ao Shuang remained silent as if she had something on her mind. Feng Yi Xuan silently stood beside him. Ember Yan and Lily walked in front while Moon King and Mishus walked in between them, a little awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Jin Yan, the Winged King\u2019s castle has already moved to the Blue Sea.\u201d Lily suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Jin Yan turned to look at the smiling Lily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you forgotten?\u201d \u201cI have this.\u201d Lily playfully stretched out her palm, and there was a black line on her palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cLily!\u201d Upon seeing this, Jin Yan was alarmed. \u201cYou actually used your secret technique!\u201d Are you crazy? \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead if you have five black lines on your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you worried about? Look, isn\u2019t that just one?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no need for the next four.\u201d Lily giggled.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWhen did you use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d Lily cracked her mouth and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d Jin Yan asked with some concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt. I had a night\u2019s rest last night. It doesn\u2019t hurt at all now.\u201d Lily smiled brightly. In fact, only she knew that every time she used this secret skill, her eyeballs felt as if they were filled with steel needles, as if they were suffering from the pain of death. Her secret skill was to focus all of her power into her eyes. Her line of sight could reach over ten thousand miles away. This was the secret skill of their clan. The stronger a person was, the further away they would be from them. Lily was the best in her race, so she naturally saw the furthest. This secret skill could only be used five times in a lifetime. After using it five times, one\u2019s eyes would explode and die. Therefore, most people would not use it five times.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to use it in the future.\u201d Jin Yan seriously reminded her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I will only use it for big brother Jin Yan.\u201d Lily smiled brightly and agreed.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan smiled before extending his hand to stroke Lili\u2019s head. He turned around and said to everyone, \u201cLet\u2019s head straight for Bluesea. The Winged King\u2019s castle is floating in Bluesea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lillie touched her head, the warmth of Ember\u2019s palm on it. She smiled sweetly and lowered her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, how do you know?\u201d Moon King and Mishus asked in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cLily is from the distant clan. She saw it.\u201d Ember explained briefly. Moon King and Mishus looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the Wings King really knows how to choose a place. \u201cThere is no human habitation in Bluesea. It is said that there is a mysterious creature living in the sea. It is very dangerous.\u201d Duke Yue sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, that\u2019s just a legend.\u201d Mishus said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>The group of men ran towards Bluesea. Mishus\u2019 mount slowly flew through the air. No one noticed that just as they entered the sky above the blue sea, there was an undetectable throbbing feeling deep under the sea.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

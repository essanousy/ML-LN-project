Every person has their own limit, I also do, that\u2019s why I understand very clearly. Attacking the limit is intolerable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Summer watched Claire\u2019s burning gaze, not saying a word for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dressed up like a boy to protect yourself and prevent a little trouble, that\u2019s all. Now you can do whatever, because we will protect you well. Whoever looks disfavorable to you, just go up and beat them up, leave the rest for us to settle.\u201d Claire said with a brow raised.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Really?\u201d Summer became happy. Although she disguised herself as a boy, her delicate and pretty appearance still caused a lot of trouble. There were some nobles who didn\u2019t just keep girls as pets and also wanted to lay a hand on pretty boys. She made a dangerous escape each time. She hated those perverts, but she didn\u2019t have the power to fight back. Now that she heard what Claire said, naturally she became happy.</p><br/><p>Walter curled his lip, very speechless. Claire, that little devil, really knew how to hit their weak spot: beat with a stick, then offering a carrot, as if if they didn\u2019t join her gang, then they would be done for. Only, he really didn\u2019t expect this thin and weak youngster to actually be a girl. Not only that, they were actually someone from the Ai Luo family, the number one ranked thief family in the world. They dared to steal anything and they were able to steal anything. Rumors say that historically, the most outstanding thief had even stolen something from the Temple of Light after infiltrating into their main temple, and even cut off a lock of hair from the Pope! Nobody was willing to provoke this kind of terrifying family. Who knew if one day you would awake to find a part of your body gone. But it was very hard to formally become a part of the, family and required passing an extremely difficult exam.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally. From now on, you can return to dressing like a girl.\u201d Claire smiled and seriously nodded as she promised. Which normal girl didn\u2019t like beauty? Which was willing to dress themselves as incomparably sloppy?</p><br/><p>(TL: me)</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s what you said. You can\u2019t force me to do what I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d Summer happily said. \u201cWhenever you need me, just tell me. I will try my best for anything within my limits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Claire smiled brilliantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom today on, Summer is one of us.\u201d Claire gave everyone solemn introductions. \u201cSummer, this is Wenmo Shui, this is Yixuan Feng, and this is my knight, Jean. May everyone please get along well from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually a woman?\u201d Wenmo Shui frowned as he circled around Summer and sized her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, very good, very good.\u201d Yixuan Feng smiled so wide his eyes were crescent moons. So it was like this, haha, very good. It\u2019s a woman, not a pretty boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Summer was very uncomfortable with Wenmo Shui\u2019s gaze and said angrily, \u201cDo you think I can\u2019t steal all your clothes at night and make you walk out of your door naked?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m stupid, if you steal everything, at worst, I\u2019ll just not walk out the door.\u201d Wenmo Shui started fighting with Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe you can choose any room from the castellan castle. After two days, we\u2019ll leave this place. I want to go to the Sprite Forest, and on the way we\u2019ll go through Dragon Valley. When the time comes, I\u2019ll come up with a way to do what I agreed with you.\u201d Claire explained to Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Summer didn\u2019t pay attention to Wenmo Shui anymore and turned to agree with Claire\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, where did this little beauty come from?\u201d Cliff\u2019s voice came from the main hall, directly followed by him running in like the wind in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, this is a new person to join us, Summer Ai Luo, she\u2026\u201d Before Claire finished speaking, Summer called out in surprise, because Cliff, that old perverted wolf, lifted up Summer\u2019s skirt with one swipe.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Claire said angrily, unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, this person is really Sir Cliff?\u201d Summer held down her skirt, and hid behind Claire with lingering fears with her head poking out to look at the vulgarly laughing perverted old wolf. She had long before heard that everything was good about Cliff except that he was very perverted, but she never would have thought he would actually make this kind of unacceptable action to a person he had just met.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at Cliff\u2019s vulgar smile and unhappily said, \u201cMaster, I\u2019m warning you, you\u2019re not allowed to make a move against Summer, or else I\u2019ll slaughter you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff curled his lip and didn\u2019t speak any more.</p><br/><p>From that point on, with Cliff around, Summer definitely wouldn\u2019t wear a skirt any more.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng and Wenmo Shui were both stupefied. This was their first time they had seen this side of Sir Cliff.</p><br/><p>And like so, the day passed with much ruckus.</p><br/><p>Night descended, all living beings silent.</p><br/><p>Claire leaned on the bedpost, flipping through the book she had gotten from Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what is this? You can understand the words on it?\u201d Walter was extremely puzzled. The words on it didn\u2019t seem similar to the words everyone knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little.\u201d Claire said perfunctorily.</p><br/><p>Treasured Lotus Style Cultivation, a mysterious way of cultivation.</p><br/><p>In total there were ten levels.</p><br/><p>But Claire felt it was weird because it only had the first level for cultivating and the rest were all repeats, all repeating the contents of the first level. Only after flipping to the very last page did Claire realize what was going on. It was because only after learning the first level and then infusing the pages with lotus power would the contents of the second level appear, and so on so forth.</p><br/><p>After Claire set up a magic shield, she sat in the lotus position and started cultivating following the method on the book.</p><br/><p>Walter was extremely puzzled, not understanding why Claire would suddenly do these unusual actions, because this wasn\u2019t meditation at all.</p><br/><p>Claire just kept maintaining this position for two hours. Under the incredulous gaze of Walter, a small golden lotus appeared on Claire\u2019s forehead. But once Walter want to look more carefully, the golden lotus disappeared instantly.</p><br/><p>But now Claire had entered a mysterious kind of realm. An indescribable happy Qi entered into all four of her limbs, and suddenly, she could feel everything around her clear as crystal. Even with her eyes closed, she could still feel everything around her very clearly. It was a strange feeling she had never felt before, being able to sense all the objects in the surrounding based on the the movement of air.</p><br/><p>Only after a long time did Claire slowly open her eyes.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s gaze returned to the book, a light smile emerging on her face.</p><br/><p>She seemed to have picked up a treasure this time.</p><br/><p>Claire laid back down, looking at the nearby White Emperor. White Emperor just continued to be in a deep sleep. It seemed like last time when he transformed into a human form and insta-killed that Benjamin, it used up a lot of strength. Now, he kept on sleeping deeply to slowly recover.</p><br/><p>Walter already lost interest and fell asleep. Although a spirit didn\u2019t need to sleep, Walter forcefully closed his eyes to sleep. Using his words, it was only this way that he could feel he was a normal person.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Emperor\u2026\u201d Claire gently stroked White Emperor\u2019s furry body, her eyes revealing a complex expression.</p><br/><p>White Emperor\u2019s last words from the time when he insta-killed Benimo were deeply imprinted into her memory.</p><br/><p>My contractor, quickly mature.</p><br/><p>Claire clenched her fist tight.</p><br/><p>Strong, she must become strong!</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes became cold. Looking at White Emperor, her gaze became colder and colder, but unwilling and wronged even more so!</p><br/><p>Because White Emperor\u2019s and Claire\u2019s contract was actually a master-servant contract.</p><br/><p>However, the master wasn\u2019t Claire, but White Emperor!!!</p><br/><p>White Emperor was Claire\u2019s master!</p><br/><p>Only if Claire continuously became strong and surpassed White Emperor would she be able to reverse the contract.</p><br/><p>It would be then that Claire could become White Emperor\u2019s master!</p><br/><p>She definitely needed to become strong, and reverse the contract to become White Emperor\u2019s master! Claire breathed out a deep breath, slowly closing her eyes.</p><br/><p>Two days later, Claire had roughly finished dealing with all the matters and then gave Heath the right to act on behalf of the castellan. With Niya city\u2019s residence seeing her off, Claire\u2019s carriage left Niya city.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually very popular.\u201d Summer said sourly. Summer and Claire, along with Jean, were in the carriage. Currently her head was sticking out the window, looking at the group of Niya city\u2019s inhabitants behind the carriage.</p><br/><p>Claire was silent, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>If they wanted to go through the Spirit Forest, they would have to pass through Youwusali, a relatively behind-the-times, barbaric country, then pass through a hazy swamp and Dragon Valley in order to reach Sprite Forest. They had already obtained border passes. Many days prior, once Duke Gordan received Cliff\u2019s message that he would bring Claire to go learn from experience, he immediately sent out people to find the fastest way to get passes.</p><br/><p>Once they were far from the city, Cliff made everyone switch into the most ordinary clothes. They sold the carriage and all rode on horses, disguising themselves as a small group of adventurers. This way they would save themselves a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>Early on, Cliff had told Claire that on the journey, Claire and them would deal with whatever they met themselves. Only if there was a life-threatening danger would he make a move and save him. Only this way could they achieve the results of learning from experience.</p><br/><p>His words made very good sense.</p><br/><p>Claire also felt that doing it that way was good.</p><br/><p>But could someone tell her why there was a dragon here? Wasn\u2019t it that they had to go Dragon Valley \u2013 the place where dragons lived \u2013 to see dragons?</p><br/><p>Why was it that the moment they entered the ravine filled with thick fog, they would suffer from a dragon\u2019s attack?</p><br/><p>There was a gigantic three-headed black dragon, one head spit fireballs, one spit water arrows, and there was one that could actually blow out wind blades.</p><br/><p>Bizarre!</p><br/><p>What kind of dragon was this?</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy me\u2019s mood right now is really bad! I\u2019ll slaughter you guys!\u201d This dragon actually could spit out human words!!!</p><br/><p>Claire set up a fire shield, blocking the water arrows the giant dragon had spit out. Summer was behind Claire. Looking at the mad giant dragon, she stuttered, \u201cClaire, I did want to steal teeth, but aren\u2019t there too many mouths?\u201d</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t say! A normal dragon would have one head and one mouth, but this dragon actually had three heads and three mouths, wasn\u2019t it too many?</p><br/><p>Cliff stood far away, observing the other side\u2019s situation from high up.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng and Claire set up magic shields, blocking the waves of mad attacks from the giant dragon. Their hearts were incomparably depressed. What was going on? They had never heard of a dragon here, only a few lower level magic beasts. Before they entered the ravine and were resting in a village, the villagers all warned them repeatedly that recently, this ravine was always filled with thick fog, and from time to time, produce the sound of angry roars. Many low level magic beasts ran away from this ravine. The villagers all said that a high level magic beast had arrived, so nobody went into the depths of the ravine to hunt or gather herbs and all worked at the ravine\u2019s valley. They definitely wouldn\u2019t take even one step into the inside that emitted fog in the morning. Once they heard these outsiders actually wanted, they naturally advised them repeatedly with kind intentions.</p><br/><p>Claire and them thanked them for their kind intentions, but they had to enter the ravine, because going through the ravine was the fastest path. If they turned back and took a detour, they would be delayed by perhaps ten days. Naturally, they weren\u2019t willing to waste that time. It was just a high level magic beast, their group of people could handle it easily.</p><br/><p>But could someone tell them what was going on?</p><br/><p>Why was there a gigantic three-headed dragon amidst this thick fog?</p><br/><p>The giant dragon seemed to be very angry, continuously roaring, attacking them with all its might. Claire and Yixuan Feng felt more and more strained as they guarded.</p><br/><p>But soon, they discovered something off. From the very beginning that dragon stood at the same place while attacking, not going forward at all. Also, the dragon race was supposed to be very powerful, able to oppress humans. The pressure this dragon gave them was very little. At the very beginning, his attack was easily blocked by Claire\u2019s and Yixuan Feng\u2019s magic shield, something somewhat outrageous.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat back!\u201d Claire and Yixuan Feng called out in a low voice at the same time. The small group of people retreated quickly, directly to Cliff\u2019s side. Cliff leisurely sat down below a tree, then saw everybody\u2019s sorry figures. It was then that he slowly said, \u201cYou finally found out that the dragon is imprisoned there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was at a loss for words, all looking straight at Cliff and not saying anything.</p><br/><p>This old fox; he had long before discovered a clue, but he sat here to watch the ruckus.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned back to look at the black dragon amidst the fog. Sure enough, that black dragon was still there, not chasing over and all the fireballs, water arrows, and wind blades he produced also could only attack on the ground not far away from them.</p><br/><p>Cliff stood up lazily, pulled out a wand, and then started chanting a spell. In that instant, a huge gale blew fiercely towards the colossal dragon. The next moment, the thick fog dispersed and the giant dragon\u2019s body appeared.</p><br/><p>Around the giant black dragon on the ground in four directions were four pillars, half the height of a person. On all the pillars there was a shiny ball of light. In the middle of all the balls of light were a chain of light. The four cables of light bounded the giant dragon firmly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Camille\u2019s gentle voice carried hidden anger. \u201cDid you read too many stupid books?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, you hit me?\u201d Claire covered the top of her head and then glared with resentment at White Emperor, who had just speedily slid to her shoulder, taking refuge. This thing was too immoral. Camille\u2019s speed was too quick, so Claire didn\u2019t have time to dodge, and this little thing was too good, dodging so quickly at the crucial moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I hit you? Quickly bring it out and let me see!\u201d Camille said tenderly, yet dangerously at the same time.</p><br/><p>Claire said from the corner of her mouth, \u201cYou\u2019re sure you won\u2019t do evil to evil?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s hand raised again. Camille hugged her head and immediately dodged to the side.</p><br/><p>It was only after the two stared at each other for a while that Claire slowly brought out the object.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe goddess\u2019s gift? What are you going to do with this?\u201d Although Camille recognized in a glance what the object was, he wasn\u2019t very surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, it\u2019s useful.\u201d Claire rolled her eyes at Camille. This bastard that bullied the weak, doing whatever he wanted with his speed that was faster than hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, I actually thought it was something good. Go to sleep.\u201d Camille snorted, then immediately left out the door.</p><br/><p>Camille looked suspiciously at the door. What did this guy\u2019s reaction mean? Really strange.</p><br/><p>But in any case, now she could let Walter\u2019s body be reborn, something worthy of being happy about.</p><br/><p>Claire closed the door, sat back on the bed, then pulled out the Spiritual Stone and started pinching it viciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t pinch!\u201d The first sentence Walter said when he awoke was this, but he was actually burning with rage on the inside. This devil pinched pretty hard this time. If he wasn\u2019t pinched, who knew when he would wake up.</p><br/><p>Claire stopped pinching Walter, pointing at the conch shell at the side and asked Walter, \u201cHow do you use this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter opened his mouth wide, dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d Claire faked jabbing at the spiritual stone, softly jabbing without any politeness, making Walter come back to his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire! You really got it? You actually, really got it?!\u201d Walter was exceptionally excited, his gaze completely incredulous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you how to use it!\u201d Claire asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, oh, just open the conch shell then grind the thing inside to powder and sprinkle it over my soul\u2019s body but you must make a magic barrier you can\u2019t let the light leak out to avoid other people discovering it I\u2019m about to have a body I\u2019m really happy.\u201d Walter immediately and obediently replied in one breath without any breaks, including the last sentences, which also flowed smoothly.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t waste her breath anymore, immediately creating a barrier, then opened the conch shell, taking out a glossy, round, small ball. She stood on the bed, pinching the ball into powder, preparing to sprinkle everything over Walter\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Walter\u2019s expression suddenly had big changes as he cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>But it was already too late, the powder had already been slowly scattered onto it.</p><br/><p>Claire also wanted to stop, but the powder already had been sprinkled, all landing on Walter\u2019s soul. A line of bright light emitted from Walter\u2019s body, making one unable to open their eyes. Claire squinted slightly, but couldn\u2019t see exactly what was happening in the light.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Walter\u2019s low voice came from the white light.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Walter, are you alright? Why did you want me to wait?\u201d Claire heard that Walter\u2019s voice seemed to be pretty normal, there wouldn\u2019t be something wrong with that thing, was there?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Walter\u2019s low voice came, but he only answered the first question.</p><br/><p>Claire sat down, stroking her chin, waiting for the white light to scatter, wanting to see what was going on.</p><br/><p>The white light slowly scattered, slowly revealing Walter\u2019s body. First was the head, his delicate and pretty face and jet-black, beautiful hair, next, his slim shoulders. Claire\u2019s eyes widened as she watched. How mysterious, Walter\u2019s body was really being reborn! Slowly, the lower part of Walter\u2019s body also became visible. Claire just sat on the side of the bed, watching Walter\u2019s body be reborn. Shoulder, chest, waist, next was\u2026</p><br/><p>Claire became petrified. The part below men\u2019s waist was\u2026</p><br/><p>Walter covered his vital area, looking at Claire\u2019s ashen face, and said, \u201cJust then I said wait. I wanted you to give me some clothes and after you finished sprinkling, you could wait while sitting in the corner of the room.\u201d Walter had on a look like it had nothing to do with him and not his fault.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Claire grabbed a pillow and threw it at Walter. Walter reached out and caught it, then covered his important place with the pillow and retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. That thing can only give rebirth to my body, not add clothes. I also didn\u2019t want it to be like this.\u201d Walter explained to the ashen faced Claire, feeling wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand me telling you to get out?\u201d Claire was about to flare up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you should in any case give me a blanket to let me wrap up my body.\u201d Walter looked at Claire impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet the hell out.\u201d Claire pulled out a blanket while she was at it and threw it at Walter. Walter hastily wrapped up his body, cutting a sorry figure as he ran out.</p><br/><p>While Walter ran out the room, the sound of a door slamming shut came from behind him.</p><br/><p>Walter stood in the aisle. Now it was already early morning, the sky already brightening. Walter\u2019s naked body only had a blanket wrapped around his waist. He stood at Claire\u2019s door in a daze. A cold wind blew. Walter shuddered, then came back to his senses. He turned, knocked on the door, and said, \u201cClaire, you\u2019re just going to throw me here like there?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no sound from inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have the heart to throw me here? Not preparing anything? Shouldn\u2019t you explain my identity to them? Isn\u2019t it no good that I seemed to have suddenly appeared?\u201d Walter knocked on the door with all his might.</p><br/><p>There was still no sound inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a while, other people will wake up and see a beautiful man who\u2019s not wearing clothes and knocking on your door in the early morning, what do you think they\u2019ll think? Other people with think that you\u2026\u201d The next moment, Walter\u2019s hand that was knocking landed on nothing, becoming rigid in mid air. In front of him was Claire\u2019s face so dark, he was about to start sweating.</p><br/><p>Walter still didn\u2019t understand how senseless he was, saying mockingly, \u201cI\u2019m not responsible for what other people think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Immediately, Walter\u2019s miserable cry broke through the dawn. Everybody greeting a new day with this cry.</p><br/><p>Once everybody hurried over to the entrance of Claire\u2019s room, they saw a delicate and beautiful man with bumps all over his head, crouching painfully on the floor, hugging his head while crying mournfully, only a blanket wrapped around his waist. Claire had an ashen face. She had just stopped her painful hits.</p><br/><p>Everybody immediately fell a wild wind blow. What was this situation?</p><br/><p>With sharp eyes, Summer saw the blanket around Walter\u2019s waist. She frowned as she said quietly, \u201cThat blanket seems like the blanket from Claire\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the wild wind was a bolt out of the blue.</p><br/><p>Everyone was struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>Claire gave a cold look at Summer, the meaning in her eyes couldn\u2019t be more clear. Would you have died if you didn\u2019t say that sentence? Was that really necessary?</p><br/><p>Summer gulped, seeing Claire\u2019s cold gaze, shrinking back somewhat fearfully.</p><br/><p>Jean looked at the person who was crouching on the ground. He said quietly, \u201cWalter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter looked up at Jean, showing a smile that was more painful than crying. \u201cJean, you should give me a set of clothes first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you recognize him?\u201d Summer suddenly understood. \u201cIn other words, this guy wanted to attack at night, and then was hit by Claire into this and thrown out?\u201d Summer said thoughtlessly from her imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rest! Nobody is allowed to disturb me!\u201d Claire\u2019s face darkened even more. She turned, slamming the door, ignoring the people outside her door.</p><br/><p>At the dining table, Summer stroked her chin, sizing up Walter, who was currently eating. Jet-black, silk-like hair, delicate and refined face, eyes like water, looking charming no matter how you looked at him. Such a gentle and refined person, even if you beat Summer to death, she wouldn\u2019t believe this delicate and pretty man would attack Claire in the middle of the night. Unless he didn\u2019t want to live. Just then she was talking without thinking. Now she was thinking carefully that if this person was Claire\u2019s friend, he would definitely not recklessly go to Claire\u2019s room and attack at night, unless he didn\u2019t want to live. With Claire\u2019s temperament, that woman, she would definitely cut him to pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho on earth are you? Why did you appear in Claire\u2019s room?\u201d Summer asked, stroking her chin, looking suspiciously at Walter, who was eating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Walter, you?\u201d Walter asked after he finished eating, wiping his mouth with a napkin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSummer. You still haven\u2019t answered me.\u201d Summer frowned and continued to interrogate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came last night, but a peal of wind blew away my clothes. That\u2019s why I became like this.\u201d Walter spouted nonsense in a deadpan serious tone.</p><br/><p>Summer\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk, then forget about it, hmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter only smiled, not answering. The less people knew about this matter, the better.</p><br/><p>Camille carried a large pan of meat to the back garden, cursing incessantly in his heart. That damn brat, it would be fine if she just got a strong magic beast to raise in the backyard, but now she had another living person. Was she treating him like a charity?! But he never thought that that brat would steal the goddess\u2019s gift for a human.</p><br/><p>At the moment, Claire was sitting in a lotus position on the bed, meditating.</p><br/><p>Now Walter had a body, so the spiritual connection between him and Claire had also disappeared. The most important problem was that Walter was a Dark magician and how to hide the Dark aura that was with his body. Before they could think of a way, they could only let this guy hide in a room and not come out for now. This guy still looked like the wanted criminal from the Temple of Light\u2019s list, right?</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, there was the sound of a quiet knock at the door.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

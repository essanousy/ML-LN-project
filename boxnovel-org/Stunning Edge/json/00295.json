Even if I have to lose my life? \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jonathan was anxious and quickly asked a series of questions.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan who looked like he was going crazy. Suddenly, a faint smile appeared on her face. Her eyes seemed to be filled with a sense of loss, as if she could see very far through Jonathan.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked at the smiling Qi Ao Shuang in a daze. Why did he have such a strange feeling? This Xiao Aushuang was clearly laughing, but why did she give off such a sorrowful feeling? What was her grief, and why? Suddenly, Jonathan wondered why Qi Ao Shuang was acting like this. He felt a slight pang in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, everyone has their own persistence.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang reached out her hand and patted Jonathan\u2019s shoulder, smiling, \u201cEveryone\u2019s determination is unshakable, and mine is the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Qi Ao Shuang walked past Jonathan and walked on alone. Jonathan stood still for a long time.</p><br/><p>Everyone had their own persistence.</p><br/><p>Jonathan slowly turned his head to look at his shoulder. There seemed to be the warmth of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang, why did you choose to go to that place even though you knew you might die? What was the reason why he had to go? Was someone waiting for her there? A faint jealousy rose in Jonathan\u2019s heart. What kind of person was it, who could make Xiao Aushuang go to that dangerous place so recklessly?</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d Suddenly, Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s voice sounded in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cHow did you come back to life?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked in a teasing tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d It was as if I was dead. I was sleeping in your body. By the way, he had upgraded himself. \u201cI heard all that just now.\u201d \u201cI also want to know how you knew there was a chance of losing your life, or do you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, since when did Wind Origin become such a gossiper?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not directly answer him, but instead smiled as she changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d \u201cThis young master is asking you a very serious question!\u201d The sky was beginning to brighten with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her head and looked into the distance, remaining silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang, tell me, why is it?\u201d What is the reason for your death? I don\u2019t want you to die. Tut, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not worried about you, I\u2019m just afraid that if you die, I won\u2019t be able to find someone as strong as you to be my home anymore. Then I\u2019m going back to that boring place. \u201cAre you listening to me? I\u2019m asking you a question!\u201d The sky was chattering noisily.</p><br/><p>However, the corners of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s lips curved up in a faint smile as she said softly: \u201cZhangkong, in that place, there are two people waiting for me.\u201d I must go, I must go to them. To that end, I will not hesitate to pay any price. \u201d Xiao Aushuang understood that even though the sky was noisy and noisy, it was actually just worrying about her.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo people?\u201d Who? Where are they waiting for you? They have already reached the Space Shattering Realm and went there before you? So you\u2019re going to look for them? However, Qi Ao Shuang, I heard some of what you guys said earlier. Are you sure you\u2019ll be safe where you want to be? \u201d This time, the worry in his voice could not be hidden.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d \u201cZhangkong, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t put you in danger.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled faintly, comforting Chang.</p><br/><p>\u201cPah!\u201d This young master is not a person who is afraid of death! \u201cHow dare you treat this young master like this? If this young master gets angry, then I will go back to sleep.\u201d Chang Kong spat angrily, his voice fading away from Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang smiled, shook her head and continued walking forward. When he got back to the dormitory, he saw that Parina was leaning against a big tree with a worried expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cParina?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d \u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d When Parina heard Xiao Aushuang\u2019s voice, she was stunned for a moment before she raised her head and saw his face. After seeing his face, she ran over ecstatically and threw herself into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, I \u2026\u201d Parina opened her mouth to be interrupted by Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s whisper.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, your brother is fine. I\u2019ll let him find a place to settle down first.\u201d I\u2019ll take care of this as soon as I can. \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang lowered her head and said to Parina in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I believe in you. I believe in you \u2026\u201d Parina lifted her head from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s embrace. She looked at Qi Ao Shuang and nodded resolutely. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly girl, alright, it\u2019s not good to be seen like this.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang grabbed her shoulders and pulled her out of her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Hmph! \u201cThat\u2019s better, in case that senior sister of yours still has unorthodox intentions towards you!\u201d This time, Parina no longer concealed her thoughts. Instead, she directly said something that caused Xiao Aushuang to be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cParina?!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression changed as she looked at the person in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, you\u2019re different, you\u2019re different from those idiots!\u201d You are a good man! I like you, I like you! \u201cYou\u2019re different, you\u2019re special!\u201d Looking into Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes, she resolutely and quickly said those words. After saying that, he threw himself into Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s embrace and hugged Qi Ao Shuang tightly.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang almost fainted! He was both shocked and annoyed. What he feared the most had actually happened! Parina had been tempted by him!</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to me, Parina. You can\u2019t like me, and I can\u2019t be with you.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang lifted Parina out of his embrace once again and tried to persuade her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know. We are not on the same level, and your strength is far above mine. Once this matter is settled, there will be a day when you will leave me and leave this place.\u201d But I just hope I can be with you, by your side, before you leave. \u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Parina raised her head and looked at Qi Ao Shuang as she earnestly narrated her story. Her eyes sparkled.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang felt a headache coming on, and she said patiently: \u201cParina, listen to me, it\u2019s impossible between you and me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Don\u2019t you like me? I\u2019m not beautiful enough? Or am I disobedient? \u201cIf you\u2019re not satisfied with anything, I can change it!\u201d Parina was getting anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not these questions, it\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang felt embarrassed. After thinking for a while, she looked at Parina\u2019s earnest eyes and said, \u201cParina, I like you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her words, Parina was already in high spirits. She was so happy that she was about to pounce on him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I just think of you as a sister, you know?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s just a cute, occasionally willful little sister.\u201d These were indeed the words from the bottom of her heart. Towards Parina, Xiao Aushuang only treated her as a little sister. This little girl, although she was a little willful and playful at times, she was not bad in nature, and could even be said to be a good girl. From the way she took her brother, he could tell that she was a good woman with good feelings and loyalty.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d You\u2019re talking nonsense! \u201cYou just like me, how can you use such a lousy excuse to fend me off?!\u201d Parina stomped her feet and looked at Xiao Ao Shuang angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Just as Xiao Ao Shuang was about to explain further, a weird laughter came from the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cParina, you\u2019ve been with Ao Shuang for so long, haven\u2019t you found a serious problem?\u201d \u201cHaha.\u201d The weird laughter was none other than Jonathan, who was walking over!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Parina was stunned. She turned around and looked at Jonathan, who had a wretched smile on his face. She felt suspicious and an ominous feeling arose in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t realize that we, Ao Shuang, don\u2019t like women?\u201d He liked men. \u201cI\u2019ve long been in love with her. We\u2019re a couple.\u201d Jonathan walked over and naturally put his arm around Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulders. He chuckled as he looked at the pale-faced Palina.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang trembled, her face darkened. She resisted the urge to break the hand on her shoulder, and remained silent with a darkened face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Jonathan, you, you. Parina was shocked and angry. She pointed a finger at Jonathan, wanting to curse Jonathan for being a pervert. However, she didn\u2019t curse him out. This way, she might be able to scold Xiao Ao Shuang along with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Nonsense! Parina\u2019s eyes were filled with tears as she looked pleadingly at Qi Ao Shuang. \u201cQi Ao Shuang, it\u2019s not true. Jonathan is talking nonsense right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang held back her internal injuries and did not say a word.</p><br/><p>Is this the default?</p><br/><p>Despair flashed through Parina\u2019s eyes. Qi Ao Shuang, was it really not normal? Was it really a match with Jonathan? How could this be? How could that be!</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, what shall we have for lunch later?\u201d Jonathan looked at her with a smile.</p><br/><p>As for Qi Ao Shuang, she remained silent. To Parina, such an action seemed to tacitly accept everything.</p><br/><p>Perina could bear it no longer. Tears welled up in her eyes and ran away.</p><br/><p>When Parina\u2019s figure disappeared, Jonathan saw an unknown object enlarge in front of his eyes. Then, the intense pain from her eyes made him scream again and again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh \u2014 Ao Shuang, you, how could you bear to hit me?\u201d \u201cBut, but your\u2026\u201d Jonathan covered his eyes and cried out like a ghost. He wanted to say \u2018lover\u2019, but after seeing the murderous look in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes, he didn\u2019t dare to say those two words out loud.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face turned green. Clearly, she was not happy with the way she rejected Parina. But\u2026 Xiao Aushuang looked up at the sky, but the result was good, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang sighed softly and walked forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, wait for me. Where are you going?\u201d Jonathan got up and was about to follow.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! Cut off your tongue!\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang turned around and looked at Jonathan with a cold gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s no one else here.\u201d Jonathan was still smiling mischievously, a strange feeling rising in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said coldly and walked forward quickly.</p><br/><p>Jonathan was still giggling.</p><br/><p>When he returned to the dormitory, Jin Yan stood silently at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master.\u201d Jin Yan spoke softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cJin Yan, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, a woman by the name of Tarina came looking for you.\u201d Jin Yan whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister, why have you come looking for me?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was even more confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk me to give you this letter.\u201d Jin Yan handed over a letter.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang took it over and quickly opened it. After looking through it, her face turned solemn.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cYoung master, what happened?\u201d Jin Yan asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly nodded without saying anything. In the letter, Tanina had told her one thing: the chaos in the Heavenly Dao Sect. Talina expressed all of this hesitantly to Qi Ao Shuang, saying that she did not have the right to ask Qi Ao Shuang to clean up the sect. However, she had no other choice. She could only ask for help from Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tian Dao Sect has something on. I want to make a trip.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang put the letter away and said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, you want to go to the Heaven\u2019s Path Sect?\u201d \u201cThen?\u201d Jin Yan frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to follow me. Stay with Wynes and help him. After all, he has yet to regain his footing. Furthermore, there may be some evil remnants of the previous City Lord that may be detrimental to him. \u201d Without waiting for Jin Yan to object, Qi Ao Shuang smiled and said, \u201cJin Yan, don\u2019t worry about me. I will take care of everything.\u201d \u201cAnd there\u2019s someone who won\u2019t let me get into trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan\u2019s heart sank. Looking at the self-mocking smile on the corner of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mouth, he naturally understood who the person that Qi Ao Shuang was talking about was. That was Dittos, the cold-blooded and dangerous man. Naturally, that person would not allow any accidents to happen to Qi Ao Shuang. A perverted desire to protect \u2026 To satisfy his hidden fear of loneliness.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Just stay with Wynes. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I\u2019m done.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly became absent-minded. How long will it take for that mysterious man in white to reappear?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, be careful.\u201d Jin Yan lowered his head and spoke slowly in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you have to be careful as well.\u201d I\u2019ll go to Tarina now. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang sighed softly. She didn\u2019t even open the door to her dorm before turning around and walking out. In her letter, Tanina had said that she would wait at the school gates until nightfall. If Xiao Ao Shuang did not show up, she would return to the Heavenly Dao Sect by herself.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aushuang appeared at the school gates, the waiting Tanina revealed an expression of joy. She abruptly stood up, wanting to rush over to welcome them, but in the end, she held it back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister, are you alone?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang walked closer and only saw that Talina was alone. She couldn\u2019t help but ask with some doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey \u2026 they\u2019re going back first.\u201d \u201cI \u2026\u201d Talena felt a little awkward.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang understood that those people probably thought that she wouldn\u2019t interfere in the affairs of the Tian Dao Sect, so they all went back first. It was no wonder that these people thought this way. Qi Ao Shuang was originally arranged by elder Artis, and had no ties or feelings with the Tian Dao Sect. Regardless of how chaotic the Heaven\u2019s Path Sect was, it was still reasonable. Was it only Talina who was willing to give him a try? Just as Qi Ao Shuang thought of this, she was thunderstruck by what she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I know you will definitely come.\u201d I know you won\u2019t let it go. \u201d Hearing these words, Tanina\u2019s eyes sparkled as she stared fixedly at Qi Ao Shuang. Qi Ao Shuang felt a chill run down her spine. Because of that look in her eyes, why did she look so similar to Parina?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister, don\u2019t misunderstand, I didn\u2019t come here because of you. \u201cNo matter what, I am from the Heaven\u2019s Path Sect, recommended by the Heaven\u2019s Path Sect to participate in the examination.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was afraid that Tanina would have feelings for her just like Parina, so she immediately explained. Although her words weren\u2019t pleasant to hear, Xiao Ao Shuang felt that it was necessary to clarify them as soon as possible, \u201cSo, Senior Sister, please don\u2019t misunderstand me. I don\u2019t have any intentions for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ta Lina\u2019s expression changed slightly as her eyes dimmed. However, she recovered immediately and said with a smile, \u201cNo, Qi Ao Shuang, I didn\u2019t think that you were here for me.\u201d I just know you\u2019re not a heartless person. \u201cYou will definitely help the Tian Dao Sect tide over this crisis. You are a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stab! \u201cPlease, do you want everyone to say that?\u201d What good people? Don\u2019t you know that good people usually end up badly?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s hurry up and set out.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, Ao Shuang, wait! Where are you going?\u201d Jonathan\u2019s voice came again.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang frowned and pursed her lips. She wanted to ignore Jonathan and leave, but when she saw the expectant expression on her face, she hesitated for a moment before making a tough decision.</p><br/><p>All right, Jonathan, you silly bird! Just in case I still brought you along, if I were to encounter that kind of situation again, at most I would just suffer an internal injury and beat you up once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the Tian Dao Sect.\u201d \u201cCome on, come on, it\u2019s good to have free labor.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said as she turned to look at Jonathan. Out of the corner of her eyes, Qi Ao Shuang noticed the disappointment in Tanina\u2019s eyes. There was no chance for the two of them to be alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh, Tian Dao Sect?\u201d Was it the civil strife? \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go as well. I should be able to help you.\u201d Jonathan ran over and pointed out the current situation of the Tian Dao Sect. Talina\u2019s expression changed. The conversation between the two of them could already be seen. Qi Ao Shuang did not tell Jonathan what had happened in the letter. Why did Jonathan already know about what had happened in the Tian Dao Sect?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything more, turned around and walked down the stairs. The two followed closely behind.</p><br/><p>The long stone staircase wound down, with Qi Ao Shuang in front and Jonathan and Tarina following side by side. Jonathan glanced at her out of the corner of his eye and noticed the look in her eyes as she looked at Qi Ao Shuang. He could not help but sigh in his heart: another woman poisoned by Qi Ao Shuang. If these ladies were to know of the true identity of Qi Ao Shuang, wouldn\u2019t they go into a frenzy? Was the person she was madly in love with actually a woman? I hope this woman doesn\u2019t force me to use \u201cextraordinary methods\u201d like Parina did. I\u2019m afraid my eyes will be in trouble again. Jonathan couldn\u2019t help touching his eyes and sighing.</p><br/><p>After walking down the stone staircase, they reached the bottom of the mountain. Qi Ao Shuang turned to look at Ta Lina and asked, \u201cCan you fly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tarrina was stunned for a moment, then she shook her head embarrassedly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang hesitated for a moment. Just as she was about to take Ta Lina with him, Jonathan had already grabbed her, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll just take you with me. Ao Shuang, you can lead the way. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang felt relieved. She smiled gratefully at Jonathan before slowly floating up. Jonathan grinned, then flew up with Tarina in his arms. Looking at the back of Qi Ao Shuang, her heart was filled with mixed feelings. She could tell from the relieved smile on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face just now.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang, are you that unwilling to be closer to me? Was it because of that woman? The one called Parina? Tarrina lowered her eyes and said no more.</p><br/><p>The three of them headed towards the Tian Dao Sect with the fastest speed possible. Only when they arrived in front of the massive stone gate of the Heaven Gate did the other disciples arrive. When the disciples arrived and saw Qi Ao Shuang and the other two descending from the sky, they were extremely shocked. Especially when Jacklin saw the impassive Qi Ao Shuang landing in front of him, he felt even more conflicted. The pretty boy that he had identified back then was now the second ranked student in the school, possessing the strength of an 8-star. Previously, he tried his best to stop himself from asking for help from Qi Ao Shuang in front of everyone, because he believed that she was a heartless person. However, Qi Ao Shuang appeared here even faster than them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister, Senior Sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior sister \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A group of disciples surrounded him, their faces full of pleasant surprise. None of them thought that Qi Aoshuang would actually come, and Jonathan was with her as well. Jonathan was by no means a kind man, much less a busybody. But now they were all here at the same time. Other than the fact that Qi Ao Shuang was willing to invite him, was there any other reason?</p><br/><p>The disciples of the Heavenly Law Sect had guessed wrong about this. Jonathan was not invited by Qi Ao Shuang, but by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it is now, but we just arrived. However, according to the Junior Brothers and Sisters who were still in the sect, things weren\u2019t looking good. The inner workings of the Tian Dao Sect had already been divided into seven or eight factions \u2026 At this time, Jacklin\u2019s attitude towards Qi Ao Shuang had already improved, and he took the initiative to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go in and take a look.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the wide but empty open ground in front of her and said with a frown.</p><br/><p>Why would there be internal strife in the Tian Dao Sect all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>What was Artis doing?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was the first to lead the way, and the others quickly followed behind. Jonathan followed.</p><br/><p>Talena stood at the very back, staring at the back of Xiao Ao Shuang in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister!\u201d \u201cOnly you can invite Junior Brother Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, junior brother has feelings for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, senior sister and junior brother, do you still need to say that?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve already fallen in love long ago!\u201d</p><br/><p>A group of junior sisters were chattering incessantly around Talina.</p><br/><p>Talena pursed her lips, about to say something.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

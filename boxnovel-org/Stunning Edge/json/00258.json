She raised her head, her eyes filled with disdain as she coldly said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know our names, nor do you have the qualifications to know them.\u201d Only the last person who passed the exam had the right to know. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t pass the examination just now, leave now. Don\u2019t let me say those words a second time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold beauty\u2019s voice was not loud, but it was exceptionally clear in everyone\u2019s ears. The man who had spoken just now had mysteriously flown out just like that. It only stopped after it knocked down several large trees behind it. He vomited blood and did not get up for a long time.</p><br/><p>However, the cold beauty coldly snorted with disdain. Her eyes were filled with mockery.</p><br/><p>The entire empty space became quiet in an instant.</p><br/><p>Just like that, there was a deathly silence. No one would have thought that this cold and beautiful lady would act without warning, and in such a heavy manner at that!</p><br/><p>Some were angry, some were unwilling, some were surprised, but no one stood up and said a word.</p><br/><p>In an instant, many of the people who had a favourable impression of this cold-eyed woman frowned in dissatisfaction. This woman was not only arrogant, but also cold and callous. However, there were also a few people who were more determined to fight. If they could tame such a woman, it would be a good thing. Right now, he was just thinking about it. The other party\u2019s strength was still there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, don\u2019t mind me, this is my senior sister\u2019s temper.\u201d He hoped that those who had passed the first round would go all out in the second round. \u201cThose who don\u2019t pass, don\u2019t be discouraged. In the future, there will still be chances. Those who don\u2019t pass, please leave now.\u201d At this moment, the slightly younger youth spoke up with a smile, breaking the awkward atmosphere.</p><br/><p>There will be opportunities in the future. Yes, I hope that I can smoothly pass next year\u2019s exam. Those who failed the exam could only console themselves like this.</p><br/><p>At this time, someone went to help the person who was paralyzed on the ground, unable to get up. Rustling sounds could be heard as the people who had failed the exam slowly packed up their belongings and left.</p><br/><p>The three men standing at the foot of the stairs did not show any signs of impatience or impatience. They quietly waited for the disqualified person to leave.</p><br/><p>The empty area became quiet once again. The people who remained behind were all unharmed. Although there were some people who had thoughts of leaving, after seeing the person who was seriously injured after being questioned, they all dispelled that thought. To fool the students of the Star Academy, this idea seemed too naive. Furthermore, his opponent was an 8-star master teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose participating in the second round, please follow us immediately.\u201d The white-clothed man in the lead said something indifferently before turning around and walking to the front.</p><br/><p>The cold beauty and handsome sunny youth followed closely behind. A faint trace of gentleness flashed in the cold beauty\u2019s eyes as she looked at the man in white. As for the handsome sunny youth, when he saw this scene, a disdainful sneer appeared on his lips.</p><br/><p>The others also slowly stood up, quickly putting away their belongings and following behind.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang followed behind with an indifferent look on her face.</p><br/><p>The group continued to walk forward. When they were halfway up the stairs, they saw a tall and black iron door. It suddenly appeared in the middle of the road, cutting off the road ahead.</p><br/><p>The white-clothed man in the lead stopped and gently pushed open the tall and heavy metal door. The iron door squeaked. Behind the iron gate was a dark mountain range. This sudden appearance of a steel door actually connected an unknown area! Another spatial technique? Qi Ao Shuang was slightly surprised. This Star Academy was not simple at all!</p><br/><p>At the same time that the door was gently pushed open, someone exclaimed in a low voice, \u201cThat\u2019s made of darksteel!\u201d So heavy \u2026 He didn\u2019t say anything after that. The meaning behind his words was that the heavy iron door was easily pushed open by the man in white as if it didn\u2019t weigh anything at all. It was clear that this man in white was extremely powerful.</p><br/><p>Pushing the door open, a cold breeze blew into his face. It made people shudder in fear.</p><br/><p>The white-clothed man in the lead turned around, his handsome face still expressionless. He only said calmly, \u201cThe second round of the examination will naturally enter this metal door. Passing through this area, there will be such an iron door at the end. We will receive you there.\u201d If he survived five days, he would pass. Remember, only five days. Over time, there will be others there to receive you and take you away from the Stellar Mountain.</p><br/><p>Everyone began to whisper amongst themselves. Every year, the Stellar Academy\u2019s examinations were different. So, even if the disciples who passed the exam before told the disciples they participated in the exam to them, it was useless.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang narrowed her eyes, how could it be so simple? Just through this area?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the cold voice of the beautiful woman rang out once more, \u201cThere are so many ferocious magical beasts inside, it\u2019s unknown if they\u2019ll survive to pass through here.\u201d \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t want to join us can leave right now.\u201d Although there were no ripples in her tone, the contents of her words made people feel indignant. Do you think they are cowards? If so, would they still participate in the school\u2019s assessment? It was as if he agreed with the beautiful woman\u2019s words. A terrifying beast roar came from the door, full of deterrence. It lasted for a long time, and it was soul-shaking. Some people\u2019s hearts couldn\u2019t help but beat like drums, while others had thoughts of retreating.</p><br/><p>When the cold lady saw this, she disdainfully sneered: \u201cThink it through before you go in.\u201d \u201cIf you lose your lives in there, it can only be said that you are not strong enough.\u201d The Star Academy\u2019s examination had always been this cruel. It was normal for someone to die during the examination. However, every year, many disciples were attracted to participate in the assessment. One could see how extraordinary this Stellar Academy was.</p><br/><p>As soon as the words of the beautiful lady were spoken, Qi Ao Shuang slowly walked past her side with a calm expression, stepping into the tall and heavy metal door. After which, she disappeared into the darkness of the night.</p><br/><p>The cold beauty was stunned for a moment before she frowned. A trace of disdain flashed across her eyes. He was just a boorish fellow, yet another idiot who was in a hurry to die.</p><br/><p>The man in white glanced at the dark night. A strange light flashed in his eyes, but it only lasted for an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The handsome youth in the sunlight slightly raised his eyebrows, then he smiled at the unhappy crowd and said, \u201cMy senior sister\u2019s words were also without malice, she only reminded everyone not to lose their lives in vain.\u201d The magical beasts inside were indeed very powerful. If you\u2019ve thought it through, please. \u201cI hope everyone will be careful and make it safely through this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>With these words, there were already people who wanted to prove that they weren\u2019t afraid of death, so they hurriedly stepped into the iron gate and entered the unknown area.</p><br/><p>Just now, when she saw Qi Ao Shuang enter, she had been secretly worried. Now that she heard the handsome youth\u2019s words, she immediately led her juniors and juniors to enter the iron gate.</p><br/><p>All the disciples stepped into the metal door and disappeared into the night.</p><br/><p>The white-clothed man looked at the vast night sky and remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittas, how many people do you think will pass this exam?\u201d The handsome youth in the sunlight asked the man in white with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should call me senior brother.\u201d Jonathan. Without waiting for the man called Dittos to speak, the cold beauty coldly opened her mouth and reprimanded him impolitely. She was clearly dissatisfied with the name of the man in white that the youth in the sunlight called her.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the smiling youth suddenly said coldly with a disdainful expression, \u201cLenny, don\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d It is only a matter of face for me to call you senior. Follow the academy\u2019s rules and do not reveal your true name until you pass the examination. \u201cYou are only a bit older than me. I can casually call you senior sister, but you are really going so far as to put your face on the line.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lenny\u2019s expression changed and he was about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, you, third place in ten thousand years, you want to fight me?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget, the people who make the first provocation will be punished.\u201d At this moment, the sunny youth no longer had any sunlight to speak of. His words were extremely sarcastic and sarcastic. As for Third Bro of ten thousand years, he nearly caused Lani to go berserk.</p><br/><p>These three people all had extraordinary identities. After passing the Star Trial, one would be able to reach the top within the eighth level of the Heavenly Pagoda. They were students of the 8-star class. The white-robed man in the lead called him Dittas, but he never moved from the first position. The youth in the sunlight was called Jonathan. Although he was a bit younger, he had been following closely behind, keeping second place. Third Bro of ten thousand years naturally referred to this cold beauty, Lenny. Jonathan had never liked Lenny, who was always high and mighty, as far as he was concerned, like an open peacock. Why, because the peacock opens the screen, the ugly buttocks will be exposed. In Jonathan\u2019s eyes, this woman who was untouchable to anyone else was nothing more than a shallow-faced, stupid woman.</p><br/><p>The Star Academy wasn\u2019t divided into grades according to the order of enrollment, but into different grades according to the Star Trial. For example, even if the students who had just entered this year participated in the Star Trial, those who could pass the eighth level would have the strength of eight stars. They would be in the same class as the students who had passed the eighth level of the Star Trial. Even if it was a long time ago, students who had not reached the 8-star level would still be courteous to them. This place was a world where the strong were revered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026\u201d A cold glint flashed in Lani\u2019s eyes, and he was about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go and wait for them there.\u201d Do not make unnecessary disputes. \u201d Dittos lightly interrupted the conversation between the two. He reached out his hand and gently drew a line in front of his eyes. A white light gradually formed a door, and he stepped in first.</p><br/><p>When Dittos spoke, they both stopped arguing. A hint of uneasiness and gentleness flashed in Lenny\u2019s eyes as he looked at Dittas. Afraid that his words and actions had left a bad impression on Dittos.</p><br/><p>Jonathan sneered and followed him.</p><br/><p>Lenny glared at Jonathan\u2019s back and followed.</p><br/><p>In the darkness of the night, Qi Ao Shuang lifted her head and looked at the seemingly calm front. However, when a gentle breeze blew, Qi Ao Shuang narrowed her eyes. The wind told her that there was danger ahead. There were too many ferocious magical beasts in front of them, ready to fight. As soon as these disciples entered the area, the magical beasts in the area sensed them. He was grinding his teeth as he waited for the food to arrive. In the eyes of the magical beasts, these people were all delicious delicacies.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her head and looked towards the sky. The sky was dark, without the moon or the sun. It was completely different from the place they were at just now. The Sun and the Moon of the chaosworld coexist. The world existed at the same time of day and night. There was a full moon in the sky when they had been waiting in the open space.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss hiss ~ ~\u201d A light breeze seemed to have life of its own as it swirled around Qi Ao Shuang, letting out an almost inaudible sound. Qi Ao Shuang let out a faint smile and said in a low voice: \u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d As for that light wind, it seemed to understand what Qi Ao Shuang was saying, as it flowed happily around Qi Ao Shuang. She gently blew on her hair.</p><br/><p>If anyone saw this, they would definitely be shocked. This was because this youth could actually understand the sound of the wind and was able to communicate with it. Had the Elven Prince Austar been there, he would have been appalled as well. One had to know that he was an Elf, and he had the talent to communicate with the wind. However, this youngster was able to reach such a level in just a short month!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang put away her smile, and took off a leaf that was about the size of a palm. With a light wave of her hand, the leaf floated in the air. Qi Ao Shuang flew up lightly with a concentrated gaze, and in an instant, her aura vanished. Or, rather, her breath dissolved in the air around her.</p><br/><p>The wind blew gently, and it was as if Qi Ao Shuang was weightless. She stood on the leaves and slowly flew into the night sky, disappearing into the night.</p><br/><p>Tarina, who had been following them, did not see Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s figure. A faint sense of worry arose in her heart. That youngster just barged in alone. He wouldn\u2019t be in any trouble, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jacklin looked at the somewhat entranced Tanina and asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d Let\u2019s go. Don\u2019t let us leave on the way, and don\u2019t go too far. \u201cBe careful.\u201d After recovering from her daze, Tanina immediately ordered calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The disciples all nodded with serious expressions. They did not doubt her words.</p><br/><p>The group of people cautiously made their way towards this unknown region.</p><br/><p>The three of them had just arrived at another thick space.</p><br/><p>Jonathan tilted his head and teased. \u201cDittos, do you want to bet on who arrived here first?\u201d Open the door and we\u2019ll wait. \u201d</p><br/><p>Before Dylan could say anything, he lightly spat in disdain, \u201cWhy are you opening the door so early in the morning?\u201d In two days. \u201cDo you think those people can come in such a short time with their talent?\u201d Lenny looked at Jonathan with a sneer, as if laughing at his innocence.</p><br/><p>However, just as Lenny finished speaking, the heavy metal door slowly opened \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

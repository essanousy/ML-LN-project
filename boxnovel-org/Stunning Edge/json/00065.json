Once the bodyguards saw the Divine Prince greet Claire, they felt that the person sitting on the seventh grade magic bast was definitely unordinary. When Claire had appeared with Little Leopard, she had attracted many gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be, this pretty boy came to kill you?\u201d Walter cried out in alarm. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, they couldn\u2019t be so quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked at Leng Lingyun\u2019s smile. She didn\u2019t know if it was her misperception, but she kept on feeling like this cold guy\u2019s current smile seemed to be much more real than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did your Highness know I was here?\u201d Claire also smiled and asked. \u201cDid your Highness come here for business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause Xuanxuan wanted to meet you, I brought her to the Hill mansion, but you weren\u2019t there. Duke Gordan said you came here to train from experience. Are you going back now?\u201d Leng Lingyun continued to smile gently. \u201cI came here because the Temple of Light had some business to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that. Yes. We\u2019re going back now. How is Xuanxuan doing?\u201d Claire suddenly understood. She recalled the adorable yet mysterious little girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty well. It\u2019s just that she wants to see you very badly.\u201d Leng Lingyun suddenly said sincerely, \u201cMiss Claire, if I may be so bold to as a favor, I hope you agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that you want me to see Xuanxuan.\u201d Claire smiled, naturally understanding what Leng Lingyun wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I hope Miss Claire agrees.\u201d Leng Lingyun said a bit embarrassedly, \u201cI have never seen Xuanxuan be so concerned about a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. No problem. But Xuanxuan is at the Temple of Light, isn\u2019t it a bit unsuitable?\u201d Claire asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Divine Princess has promised to bring Xuanxuan to visit once Miss Claire arrives home. I just hope Miss Claire won\u2019t decline.\u201d Leng Lingyun actually made a rare joke. Although this joke wasn\u2019t funny at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, okay. Then we\u2019ll first take our leave to not hinder you in your work.\u201d Although it wasn\u2019t funny, Claire still faked a laugh.</p><br/><p>Walter felt nauseated, yet admired the two\u2019s skills, both continuously so profound, both formidable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Miss Claire, I wish you a good journey.\u201d Leng Lingyun said goodbye. Seeing the group of people standing not far behind, he said in a low voice, \u201cMiss Claire\u2019s group of friends is not bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thank you.\u201d Claire politely thanked, then the two parted.</p><br/><p>Once Leng Lingyun\u2019s figure disappeared from everyone\u2019s line of sight, Walter started creating a ruckus. \u201cDidn\u2019t this pretty boy come here for you? I thought he came to find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire quieted down. Finally, she said to Walter slowly, \u201cIt should be connected to me. The Temple of Light should have sensed such a strong Dark power and such dense Dark aura. That\u2019s why the sent out the Divine Prince to investigate, or get rid of it after investigating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Walter frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m related to it.\u201d Claire said softly. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know why his little sister acts so close to me, it\u2019s pretty useful that way: an opportunity to know the Temple of Light\u2019s movements. We could be on guard ahead of time. And the Temple of Light is formidable; it\u2019s only been two days and they\u2019ve immediately sent people out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Temple of Light has temples in every country and have set up portals.\u201d Walter disdainfully clicked his tongue. \u201cThey\u2019re all built by the blood, sweat, and tears of the commoner\u2019s hard earned money. So many people are willing to donate money, hmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Portals? No wonder Leng Lingyun was able to come here so quickly. No wonder he was investigating instead of just arriving.</p><br/><p>\u201cReplenish some supplies and buy a carriage to return on the main road.\u201d Cliff was a bit sickly, feeling extremely unhappy. Now undoing the mark was hopeless, how could his mood be good.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Just as Claire was about to reply to Cliff, Feng Yixuan\u2019s serious voice came from behind with a very complex mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan?\u201d Claire turned and saw Feng Yixuan\u2019s solemn expression. Rarely did Feng Yixuan had such a serious expression, his gaze resolute, like he had made a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, wait for me. I will become strong and then return.\u201d Feng Yixuan watched Claire with a burning gaze, every word said earnestly.</p><br/><p>Claire was stunned, unable to say anything for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle guy, you\u2019re going to go?\u201d Cliff blinked and said, confused. This guy had such a sincere attitude towards Claire, but now he was actually going to leave?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause he resents that he\u2019s too weak and has no way to protect you, he wants to become strong and then return.\u201d Shui Wenmo curled his lip and said to the side, \u201cJust get strong yourself, why do I have to suffer with you too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire suddenly remembered that at the battle, Shui Wenmo stopped Feng Yixuan from undoing his seal, saying that he was unable to withstand the power. What was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will return.\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t leave Claire. \u201cI will definitely return. I\u2019ve said before that I will marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire was at a loss for words. In reality, based on appearance, Feng Yixuan was not yet fifteen while Claire was only thirteen years old. Did the people of this world mature early or did Feng Yixuan, this child, have a unique way of thinking?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are going to leave now?\u201d Summer watched Shui Wenmo suspiciously and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we\u2019re going to go right now.\u201d Shui Wenmo shifted around hesitantly, then looked at Summer and suddenly said seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll also return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch, so what if you return.\u201d Summer clicked her tongue, not caring.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, little guy. I wait for you to become strong then return.\u201d Cliff smiled slightly. This little red haired guy had very good potential and his temperament was not bad. He would miss him a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d Claire said, smiling.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes shined. He grabbed Claire\u2019s hand, saying emotionally, \u201cDarling, I will take care of myself well, you should also take care of yourself and wait for my return.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, a certain somebody was crouching on the ground, covering his eye, and grimacing in pain. True to her word, Claire had done what she had promised, hitting Feng Yixuan\u2019s other eye.</p><br/><p>The surrounding passersby showed curious and surprised gazes when seeing this group, but nobody dared to approach and talk. How could they provoke someone who could use a seventh grade magic beast as a mount?</p><br/><p>After they exited the city, Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo reluctantly bid farewell to Claire. More accurately, it was Feng Yixuan who was reluctant.</p><br/><p>And so the group and one wind leopard returned back to the capital.</p><br/><p>Hill manor.</p><br/><p>In the study, Duke Gordan sat, looking at the rose regalia on the wall, silent.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Duke Gordan spoke. \u201cEmery, what do you think of the people Claire brought back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Emery thought for a moment, then replied prudently, \u201cSir, that black clothed man is very strong, very dangerous. He emits an inhuman pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad. That black clothed man is exceptionally strong, something really inconceivable.\u201d Duke Gordan exposed a smile and stood up. Duke Gordan wasn\u2019t a flower stand. Few people in the capital had experienced his true strength. Of course a clan\u2019s core wasn\u2019t so simple.</p><br/><p>Emery was silent. Strong was good. But there were no gain without risk. Naturally, he understood what Duke Gordan meant. If this black clothed was well disposed, then he would be of great assistance to the Hill clan. But\u2026\u2026 if such a strong person opposed the Hill clan, then it would be a big headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire has reaped many profits this time, haha.\u201d Gordan laughed. Evidently, his mood was very good. Claire had advanced into a wizard and also brought back such a strong person.</p><br/><p>But Emery was worried. Power that was too strong wasn\u2019t easily handled. There were too many cases of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Claire, I live here from now on?\u201d Summer plopped onto the gorgeous bed, satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Remember, just don\u2019t cause any trouble. If you don\u2019t like something or somebody, just reject them.\u201d Claire said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. The food is good, the living conditions are good, I won\u2019t cause any trouble. But really, I never thought your family would be so rich.\u201d Summer rolled around on the bed happily. This was actually her first time living so luxuriously. At her home, she trained rigorously, not to mention her living conditions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Claire nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour rolling posture is so ugly.\u201d Suddenly, Ben\u2019s judging voice came from the doorway.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually came in without knocking, you uncultured guy!\u201d Summer said angrily.</p><br/><p>Ben shrugged, not caring. \u201cYour door wasn\u2019t even closed, why would I knock?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Summer was so angry she jumped up, but at the same time, she didn\u2019t dare to do anything to Ben. She only cursed internally, damn you, uncultured Ben.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, the Temple of Light\u2019s Holy Princess requests an audience.\u201d A maid stood at the door and reported cautiously. For some reason, the black clothed man nearby gave an ineffable pressure, making one want to leave quickly.</p><br/><p>So soon?! Claire was a bit surprised. She had just arrived back home for a moment and the Temple of Light already knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, I\u2019ll go there soon.\u201d Claire said indifferently and waved offhandedly, indicating for the maid to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this too quick? They must have known when you entered the city. Why does the Temple of Light pay so close attention to you? In any case, it\u2019s not anything good.\u201d Summer muttered, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere thoughtlessly, don\u2019t make any trouble. Especially you, Ben. Remember what you\u2019ve promised me. Don\u2019t act recklessly, got it?\u201d Claire urged repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, got it, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Ben waved offhandedly. \u201cGo meet that Holy Princess or whatever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded, turning to leave.</p><br/><p>The Divine Princess was not so simple. She knew the moment she had entered the city and immediately went to visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Divine Princess likes that pretty boy, the pretty boy is only kind to his little sister, his little sister only likes you, so the Divine Princess dislikes you. Claire, your future is very dark.\u201d Walter took joy in Claire\u2019s misfortune.</p><br/><p>TL: still brighter than my future</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak. She was fine with feigning courtesy, but if that Divine Princess thought she was easy to mess with, then she was gravely mistaken.</p><br/><p>Claire walked to the grand hall. Just as she entered the grand hall, a small figure swiftly ran over and pounced on Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sis, I missed you so much.\u201d Naturally, the melodious voice was the adorable little girl, Leng Xuanxuan.</p><br/><p>Nobody see the sliver of profoundness that flashed through the Divine Princess\u2019s eyes when she saw that scene.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

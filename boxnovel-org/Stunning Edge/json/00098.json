Claire was shaken dizzy, but she didn\u2019t dare to refute.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Yuewen. That the treasured sword has chosen Claire as its master is a fact. We can\u2019t change anything.\u201d Li Mingyu said quietly.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen let go of Claire\u2019s collar furiously, but still glared at Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire glanced at the sword in her hand and her lips twitched. She really wanted to say, I also didn\u2019t want the sword to accept me as its master, but against Li Yuewen\u2019s killing gaze, Claire sensibly repressed her urge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Was it that only people from the Li clan could be accepted by the sword? Why would I be able to pull it out?\u201d Claire looked suspiciously at the sword in her hand, perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you could\u2026\u201d Li Yuewen said angrily, about to say something, but Li Mingyu warned her in a low voice, \u201cYuewen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu\u2019s expression was extremely complex. He said quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s already a fact that Claire has been chose to become the master of the Azure Ripple sword. Since it has actually done so, there must be a reason. It\u2019s just that we are unable to know exactly why.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire watched the two who had complex expressions. She kept on feeling like the two were hiding something, but wasn\u2019t able to tell exactly what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an artifact? I don\u2019t feel anything unusual abbout it.\u201d Claire said doubtfully. She raised the Azure Ripple sword and lightly swung it around.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Azure Ripple sword is a weapon that can grow. As you continuously develop, he will also develop with you and display his might. This is why he is called an artifact. Seeing the Azure Ripple now, it seems that it really is only a normal sword.\u201d Li Yuewen said moodily.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the Azure Ripple sword that was originally glowing silver slowly darkened and turned into a very ordinary longsword.</p><br/><p>Claire brandished the Azure Ripple sword dejectedly, wanting to say, it\u2019s only a weapon, but it actually looks down on people so much. In any case, it was the first time she had heard of a weapon that could grow.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now what do we do? Originally, you two wanted to find this sword to revive the Li clan. Now you will return empty handed\u2026\u201d Claire worried asked the Li siblings. Although Claire wasn\u2019t satisfied, she immediately remembered this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can only improve one step at a time then. We have already tried our best. If the heavens want to end our Li clan\u2026\u201d Li Minyu\u2019s voice was a little bleak.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen became frantic, immediately saying, \u201cElder brother! That won\u2019t happen! I won\u2019t let the Li clan end!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the circumstance, Claire started feeling conflicted. It it wasn\u2019t for the sword crazily choosing her as its master, the situation wouldn\u2019t have developed into this!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan, can I do anything for you?\u201d In the end, Claire asked this quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. It is heaven\u2019s will that the sword has accepted you\u2026\u201d Li Mingyu said quietly, but before he finished speaking, Li Yuewen interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you need to work for us, you need to pay responsibility!\u201d Li Yuewen said loudly, angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, my responsibility, my wrongdoing.\u201d Claire nodded over and over. \u201cThen what can I do for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree months later, at the four major clans\u2019 competition, you need to battle on behalf of the Li clan! Using the Azure Ripple sword!\u201d Li Yuewen said righteously and forcefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Claire\u2019s mouth opened wide. She stared at Li Yuewen. \u201cOutsiders can represent the Li clan in fights?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said you were an outsider?!\u201d As she spoke faster and faster, Li Yuewen almost said something, but meeting Li Mingyu\u2019s meaningful gaze, she immediately changed it and said angrily, \u201cOur Li clan\u2019s Azure Ripple sword has already accepted you as its master! You can be considered half a member of the Li clan! What\u2019s wrong with representing us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Claire blinked, staring at the ordinary looking Azure Ripple sword, even feeling a little innocent and wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it not! You stinkin brat, acting like you\u2019re innocent even though you benefited! Now the artifact has even acknowledged you as its owner, isn\u2019t it proper for you to work for the Li clan?\u201d Li Yuewen looked incredibly resentful and anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that seems to make some sense.\u201d Claire stroked her chin, then sighed. \u201cAlright, then three months later, I will represent you in battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Li Yuewen nodded, satisfied.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu was frozen and still hadn\u2019t come back to his senses. The two made their decision just like that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut right now, you are way too weak. You can\u2019t even bring out half of the Azure Ripple sword\u2019s power right now. I\u2019ll train you for the next three months.\u201d Li Yuewen\u2019s eyes lit up, incomparably \u201cwicked\u201d.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s mouth trembled. She suddenly felt like her prospects had become gloomy. Claire glanced at the sword in her hand a little resentfully, cursing at how unlucky she was just then. She could have rested on anything because of her feet falling asleep, but she just had to rest on the damn sword. Now she was actually in hot water! It really wasn\u2019t her fault, how depressing!</p><br/><p>Everybody casted sympathetic gazes at Claire. Camille shrugged slightly, showing that although he felt sympathy, he couldn\u2019t do anything. On the other hand, the meaning in Jean\u2019s eyes were clear: no matter where Miss goes, I shall follow!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll train in Mountain of Lost Souls for the next two months and then return to the Li clan and train for the third month.\u201d Li Yuewen said viciously.</p><br/><p>Claire was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go now. How do we go out?\u201d Claire asked, puzzled looking at the giant curved slide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s stairs over there.\u201d Camille smiled and pointed at a long staircase at the side.</p><br/><p>Everybody turned to look. Sure enough, they saw that there was a well kept staircase next to the slide. They all felt frustrated and then suddenly thought that whoever had designed the cave and set up the barrier was truly mischievous. Even though there was a staircase, they just had to experience sliding down painfully as their bottoms were scraped.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, there was an alarmingly loud sound from the cavern\u2019s entrance and then the cavern started to shake violently. Stones continuously dropped and the entire cavern was on the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to collapse! Ahhhhh!\u201d Summer screamed fearfully.</p><br/><p>With a wave of her hand, Claire constructed a barrier that surrounded everybody.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Hua clan!\u201d Li Yuewen\u2019s expression was ice cold as she spoke decisively.</p><br/><p>Everybody froze. Claire was also perplexed. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, nothing can hidden over the seas, if there was a boat, we could have definitely discovered it. Our captain and sailors were all chosen by the city lord personally and are all loyal soldiers of the empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stones thumped as they smashed on the the barrier. Although the shaking of the cave looked very dangerous, it didn\u2019t collapse in the end. Instead, the light from the cave\u2019s entrance was gradually disappearing. The entrance was being buried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one explanation: someone infiltrated as one of the sailors.\u201d Li Yuewen\u2019s expression became colder and colder.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d Camille said softly, \u201cI saw every person the city lord chose, they were all citizens of the empire, purely from Amparkland. Their backgrounds were all clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a person being replaced, but someone\u2019s soul!\u201d Li Yuewen clenched her teeth.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the cavern had finally quieted down. There were stones all over the place and the entrance was completely sealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Claire sensed something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hua clan has a high level evil magic. It can transfer a person\u2019s soul to another person\u2019s body, engulf their soul, and then control their body.\u201d Li Mingyu\u2019s expression was also becoming unsightly. He said in a low voice, \u201cWho would have thought they would spend so much to stop us. They actually sent someone who could use such high level magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>A clash between spiritual powers? Claire had figured out what kind of power it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if the person they\u2019re trying to take over has strong spiritual power?\u201d Claire immediately asked as she undid the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there would be a backlash. If it was a heavy blow, then they would be dead and if light, then they would become a vegetable. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t dare to use the evil magic so easily. This time they chose to use it against one of the sailors and didn\u2019t dare to choose any of you guys.\u201d Li Yuewen sneered. \u201cI reckon they wanted to blow of the cavern and bury us alight, but the cavern can\u2019t collapse so easily. That\u2019s why they will definitely be waiting for us at the entrance to ambush us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get rid of them!\u201d Ben said sinisterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat magic seems really interesting.\u201d Walter smiled toothily, becoming interested. As a Dark magician, naturally he would want to experience the evil magic, or, better yet, learn it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually want to know where their true body is.\u201d A strange smile appeared on Claire\u2019s lips. She said softly, \u201cIf their body is destroyed, then what will happen to their soul that\u2019s in another body?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Claire\u2019s words, everybody\u2019s heart suddenly shuddered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out first then talk.\u201d Claire carried the ordinary looking Azure Ripple sword, leading the way.</p><br/><p>They group went up the staircase. Ben waved his hand casually, casting magic to clear the path.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, Li Yuewen suddenly stopped and called out, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Claire frowned slightly. She concentrated and sensed the surroundings, but didn\u2019t find anything out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you rely on the brute force of this dragon too much. It won\u2019t benefit your growth at all! So from now on, he can\u2019t do anything, unless you\u2019re on your dying breath!\u201d Li Yuewen said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Claire\u2019s mouth was wide open. Seeing the staircase covered in stones, she had a headache. Did she want her to start doing everything by herself now?</p><br/><p>\u201cGood luck, Commander. I will fan you from behind.\u201d Camille had on a remorseful expression as he was standing right behind Claire, preparing to wave a small fan he had gotten from who knows where for Claire.</p><br/><p>Ben immediately moved out of the way and withdrew.</p><br/><p>Summer started smiling soundlessly. Qiao Chuxin blinked, she seemed to be a little confused.</p><br/><p>Walter yawned and leaned on the wall, starting to wait. Just as Jean was about to say something, Li Yuewen said coldly, \u201cIf you want Claire to die onstage at the competition three months later, you can interfere.\u201d Jean silently withdrew.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

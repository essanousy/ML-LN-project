Before this large crowd of people, Claire had not given her any face. But in her heart, she was secretly delighted. This meant that Claire would not choose to side with the Temple of Light. Liu Xueqing turned, meaning to return to her seat, but she was faced with Leng Lingyun\u2019s gaze. The unconcealable hatred and anger in his eyes gave Liu Xueqing an abrupt shock. More unease grew in her heart. However, she had a thought. So long as Claire went past the point of redemption, Lingyun would be hers. The future is long! She would definitely win Lingyun\u2019s heart because she had her trump card, Xuanxuan!</p><br/><p>Everyone in the hall started to whisper. What did Claire\u2019s attitude mean?</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s eyes narrowed, gleaming with profoundness.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister!\u201d Lashia excitedly called. For some reason, all her worries had disappeared. She just felt that with elder sister\u2019s appearance, everything would be resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cCl-Claire\u2026\u201d Roger watched Claire with a complex expression, hundreds of emotions welling up in his heart.</p><br/><p>Second prince Nancy and princess Maurice both stared at Claire blankly. Never in their wildest dreams did they expect Claire to appear here.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan\u2019s expression grew more and more unsightly. What was Emery doing? Claire had actually entered the main hall! If Claire decided to side with the Temple, then she would be considered unfilial and disdained. But if Claire decided to side with the Hill clan, she would be openly betraying the Temple as its priest. The consequences were unimaginable!</p><br/><p>Claire could not afford to appear!</p><br/><p>All attacks and criticisms would be towards her! No matter what she decided, she would be forced onto a path of demise!</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun stared fixedly at Claire, unable to move his gaze away. She had come! In the end, she came! Did she know what she would face?</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, your majesty.\u201d Claire gave a standard bow, then continued coldly, \u201cWe will know immediately whether my mother is under mind control or not. I hope your majesty will be just and fair, sentencing the person who cast the spell along with the true poisoner their deserved punishments instead of letting a weak woman bear all responsibility. Hiding the truth and pushing all blame onto a weak woman is something to be disdained by the entire world and leave a stain in history.\u201d Claire stood there boldly, her words loud enough to be heard from anywhere in the hall.</p><br/><p>How aggresive! How impudent her words were!</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s expression finally changed, turning green. His eyes shot daggers at the girl before him. Such arrogant words! Was she ridiculing him? Did she know who she was talking to!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I trust his majesty will be wise and punish the true criminal.\u201d Claire smiled faintly, her words cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can prove that Katherine Hill is being mind controlled, then good. If you cannot, then you will pay the price for your impudence.\u201d The emperor\u2019s voice was ice cold and authoritative.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who is controlling my mother is right in this hall! Sitting on that side, with the crown prince. What does this mean? Shameless framing, vile and repulsive! Such a person deserves to sit on the throne? If such a person were to sit on the throne, then Amparkland will never be glorious again.\u201d Claire raised her hand and pointed at the crown prince.</p><br/><p>Gasps sounded one after another in the hall. Although many were aware this was a scheme and realized something was wrong with Katherine\u2019s abnormal confession, no one expected this girl to expose the truth so straightforwardly, leaving everyone in indescribable shock!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudence! Slandering royalty is punishable by death! Arrest her!\u201d a royal knight standing beside the emperor stood up and yelled. The emperor did not say a word. Of course he would allow the arrogant and foolish girl to be taught a lesson. The Temple of Light would most likely not oppose and the Hill clan would be given a warning.</p><br/><p>Immediately, a small band of knights surrounded Claire.</p><br/><p>Before anyone could react, Claire laughed coldly and with a slight wave of her hand, a violent force shot out in all directions.</p><br/><p>All the knights around Claire were struck flying. They lost their balance and slammed heavily into the walls or the railings of the second floor before sliding down helplessly. The royal guards lay on the ground, pools of blood beneath them, unable to move. These would would take years to recover from.</p><br/><p>The hall fell silent.</p><br/><p>Everyone could hear the sound of their own breath.</p><br/><p>The power Claire had displayed was actually that of a wizard sage!</p><br/><p>The pope froze, staring fixedly at the stunning young girl. She had actually already reached the level of a wizard sage! Her strength was actually already this terrifying? Was it real?</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s expression grew more and more unsightly, his eyes flashing with even more terrifying profoundness. Did Claire know what she was doing? She was actually challenging the Temple so openly, becoming enemies. Did she really think he was afraid to do anything to her? L\u2019Or\u00e9al sat silently beside the pope, her strange eyes on Claire the entire time. She originally did not need to come, but this morning, she had read from the stars something unusual would occur,</p><br/><p>The crown prince\u2019s expression also darkened. Claire did not care for her relation with the Temple at all as she opposed him. This girl\u2019s power strength was even more of a headache.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it is slander or not, we shall know immediately.\u201d Claire humphed coldly. This cold laugh made many people\u2019s hearts quiver.</p><br/><p>Sitting next to the first prince, Eric stood up emotionally with clenched fists. He yelled, \u201cWhat evidence do you have? How dare you insult his highness, the crown prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire humphed coldly. With a flick of her finger, an invisible, terrifying force abruptly struck Eric\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Without a sound, Eric\u2019s entire body started to convulse. Blood slowly trickled out of the corner of his mouth. He slid down to the ground weakly. The crown prince\u2019s expression changed greatly. He reached out hurriedly to support Eric. Eric was still breathing, but all of his cultivation had been destroyed, his meridians broken. He had become a cripple and would never be able to be a warrior ever again!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dared to actually attack your blood brother!\u201d the crown prince cursed with gritted teeth.</p><br/><p>But Claire was indifferent. \u201cBastards don\u2019t deserve to be in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hall started to erupt. No one expected Claire to openly attack here! Did she even respect the emperor? But some people were very satisfied. Eric had betrayed his clan and was going to allow his birth mother to die. Anyone with a conscience could see this was unacceptable.</p><br/><p>But everyone understood in their hearts one truth. Absolute power wielded absolute authority. As a wizard sage, Claire was now an unsurmountable mountain.</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s expression continued to darken. This action was a slap in his face before everyone.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s complexion was already dark as could be. Claire\u2019s actions were not just a slap in the face! This was a slap, another slap, and then a spit in the face!</p><br/><p>But the power Claire had displayed with just a flick of her finger left many people frightened. No one else on the crown prince\u2019s side dared to stand up and retort.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze was on the stunning girl. Fear, envy, adoration, disbelief\u2026</p><br/><p>Roger was very emotional, yet also worried. Eric, that bastard. That day, he had hesitated for a moment and did not get to kill him before the crown prince intervened. Today, Claire\u2019s actions left him very satisfied. However, later? Roger\u2019s heart tightened. Lashia clenched her fists excitedly, staring at Claire with adoration.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing could not contain the excitement in her eyes. Claire had not attacked once, but twice! This idiot! Haha, everything was over. Claire\u2019s actions meant a complete separation from the Temple, becoming enemies. Leng Lingyun\u2019s gaze stayed on Claire, his eyes filled with worry. Noticing from the corner of her eye, Liu Xueqing\u2019s gaze became even more venomous.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire Hill!\u201d The emperor was already on the verge of exploding.</p><br/><p>But Claire ignored this. She turned and said, \u201cI came to break the mind control on my mother. Soon, we will know I speak the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, please calm. Claire is still young and doesn\u2019t understand her bounds.\u201d Duke Gordan stood up. He appeared fearful, but in reality, he was protecting. Of course, the emperor knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour majesty, please allow Claire to represent the Hill clan in examining Katherine\u2019s spiritual condition,\u201d Duke Gordan added, his tone respectful.</p><br/><p>The emperor\u2019s expression was dark, but he could only comply. Claire\u2019s identity was simply too extraordinary: member of the Hill clan, Cliff\u2019s beloved disciple, a priest of the Temple of Light. Although it seemed that she had broken relations with the Temple of Light, before the Temple announced anything, he could not be certain. Most importantly, at such a young age, she was already a wizard sage.</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s gaze was profound. He was weighing in his heart. Claire was chosen by the goddess, but had turned on the Temple publically. What should he do? He would have to communicate with the goddess before deciding. However, he was not worried at all that Katherine\u2019s mind was being controlled. It was impossible to break! Only a sorcerer would be able to break it, and the only one was in a distant country with Lawrence.</p><br/><p>Claire reached out and placed her hand on Katherine\u2019s forehead. Gradually, her hand began to emit golden light.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

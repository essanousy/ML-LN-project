However, the young master and Feng Yixuan did not attend. The happiest thing in the banquet was to recruit a treasure cat. She devoured the food happily before patting her stomach in satisfaction and lying down on the table in front of Xiao Ao Shuang, snoring softly.</p><br/><p>Marilyn and a few of her guardian angels were present at the evening\u2019s feast, and Sistar was more gracious to them now. He must have figured out a lot of the details.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang ate this sumptuous dinner absent-mindedly, then left with the treasure cat. Marilyn and Sistar went alone to the study in Sistar to discuss the matter, and were not so much taken into account as by the perversity of Qi and Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Camil sat at her seat, elegantly tasting the red wine, watching Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s departing back as she pondered.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang hugged the sleeping cat and asked the maid, Feng Yi Xuan, about his room, then she went to look for him.</p><br/><p>Standing in front of the door, Xiao Ao Shuang raised her hand and wanted to knock, but she did not fall down for a while. In front of his eyes was Feng Yixuan\u2019s complicated expression and sorrowful eyes.</p><br/><p>What had happened to him since they\u2019d parted?</p><br/><p>After standing at the entrance for a long time, Qi Ao Shuang finally knocked on the door gently.</p><br/><p>The familiar voice came through the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s low voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang didn\u2019t make a sound. She was afraid that if she did, Feng Yi Xuan wouldn\u2019t even open the door for her.</p><br/><p>He lightly knocked on the door again, and footsteps could be heard from inside.</p><br/><p>When the door opened, it revealed Feng Yixuan\u2019s beautiful face.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood there silently, gazing deeply at the girl before him. Actually, he already knew who was standing at the door, but \u2026 \u201cYi Xuan, why?\u201d Why don\u2019t you recognize me? \u201cYou are clearly the Yi Xuan I know!\u201d Looking at the person in front of her, Xiao Ao Shuang finally couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer and started questioning him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan opened his mouth slightly, but only a single word came out; \u201cI \u2026\u201d He then stopped speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan!\u201d Why? What the hell is wrong with you? I can clearly see the deep sadness in your eyes. Why? What makes you so difficult? \u201cIs it because of me?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang suddenly felt very flustered. She suddenly felt that Feng Yi Xuan was about to leave her and would never come back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I will end the Holy War for you. Definitely! \u201cI won\u2019t make you sad\u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan slowly lowered his voice. His eyes didn\u2019t move away from Qi Aushuang\u2019s bright face, but he didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Feng Yi Xuan in astonishment. Seeing the pain and patience in his eyes, she involuntarily cried out. She wanted to ask something, but was interrupted by a loud shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d What are you doing here? \u201cGo away!\u201d The young master\u2019s angry voice rang out, and in the next moment, the young master was standing beside Qi Ao Shuang, glaring at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned her head to look at the young master. The young master was so angry that his eyes were about to spew fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here, hurry back to your room!\u201d The young master roared angrily at Qi Ao Shuang before forcing Feng Yi Xuan into the room. With a bang, he closed the door.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang stood at the door absent-mindedly, staring at the closed door for a long time before leaving dejectedly.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Feng Yi Xuan was quietly leaning against the window, looking out into the darkness. It was as if he was in a state of mind \u2026 \u201cHow irritating, how annoying!\u201d The young lord was spewing fire.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan turned a deaf ear to her words and only looked outside quietly. In his heart, he was thinking about the results.</p><br/><p>Ao Shuang, Ao Shuang \u2026 There\u2019s a lot I want to say to you.</p><br/><p>I will end the Holy War for you.</p><br/><p>Never make you sad, absolutely!</p><br/><p>However, my vows will always stay by your side.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never be able to do it again. \u2013 The night was dark.</p><br/><p>The next morning, at breakfast, she saw the look on Sistar\u2019s face and Marilyn\u2019s smile of satisfaction, and it was clear that the two men had already discussed the details.</p><br/><p>The expressions of these two people were always ambiguous, making people easily think wrong of them.</p><br/><p>Sistar\u2019s attitude toward Marilyn had also become very courteous.</p><br/><p>Since it had been agreed upon, it was naturally time to act.</p><br/><p>The first step was to establish a new base for the Radiant Temple. Marilyn had chosen the new Shining Court in Orlicon, far from the City of the Center, so that it was more convenient to act between the former Shining Court and the present Shrine of the Dark.</p><br/><p>Sistar was unusually positive. After tens of thousands of years of being suppressed, the situation was about to change. Naturally, he spared no effort in helping Marilyn establish her political power.</p><br/><p>It had to be said that Wistar was very rich now. They made their way secretly to the city, bought a large number of houses in the heart of the city, and began to build new ones.</p><br/><p>The construction of the Celestial Realm was not as complex as the Mortal Realm. Three days later, a majestic palace rose from the ground. And the grand seal at the entrance of the palace caused everyone in the city to be extremely shocked. That was the symbol of the Radiant Temple!</p><br/><p>When Marilyn appeared, dressed in a holy white dress and accompanied by four Ten Winged Angels, the subjects of the city were all excited and boiled up.</p><br/><p>The Goddess of Light had actually come!</p><br/><p>After the Goddess of Light said some words majestically, the citizens of the entire city were extremely excited, their blood boiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom today onwards, the Radiant Temple will officially move to Orloff City. I, Marilyn Sophel, will lead you to banish the darkness and fill the world with light, purity, and integrity. \u201d Marilyn\u2019s face was holy, and her beautiful face exuded an inviolable dignity.</p><br/><p>For a long time on this day, the entire city of Orl\u00e9n could not be at peace.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was standing in an attic high up in the palace. She looked down from the window and couldn\u2019t help but pout as she watched Marilyn and her guardian angels accept the worship of the people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only the first step.\u201d Sistar\u2019s deep voice floated over. \u201cWe still need to hold a light academy to select Angel Warriors for her and increase her strength.\u201d He believed that those old fellows in the central city should have received the news as well and would definitely take action. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to know how they look.\u201d Wistar said with a schadenfreude.</p><br/><p>Elders Guild? She looked at Marilyn, who was enjoying flowers and praise. Compared to Angelica, the former goddess of light, she was really lucky.</p><br/><p>As expected, Marilyn was not someone who was easy to deal with. She raised her strength in the Light Academy in the fastest possible time and issued a nationwide warning order. Annually, the selection was advanced. This time, the selection would take place in the new Divine Capital, Orliang City.</p><br/><p>The hot-blooded young people were all rushing to register.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the world, the Goddess of Light was the ruler of the Radiant Temple. After all, on the surface, the Goddess of Light represented the Light.</p><br/><p>The elders in the central city naturally received the news first.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, Marilyn that bitch!\u201d He actually dared to say that the Radiant Temple had moved there! \u201cBastard, then what are we?\u201d A woman in a luxurious dress flew into a rage in a room decorated with luxurious decorations. She threw all the vases and teacups in the room onto the floor and smashed them into pieces. Her pretty face was full of malevolence, and her beautiful eyes were about to spit fire. If Marilyn stood in front of her now, there was no doubt that she would rush forward to scratch her hair and spit.</p><br/><p>This richly dressed woman was none other than the chosen next Goddess of Light, Flora.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Flora, take a look at you. There isn\u2019t a single trace of the noble appearance that the Goddess of Light should have.\u201d A handsome man beside her persuaded helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Father!\u201d \u201cThat bitch Marilyn, she dares to openly oppose us like this!\u201d Flouro stomped her feet angrily and complained unwillingly to this man.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Be patient.\u201d What can Marilyn do by herself? \u201cIt will be dealt with soon.\u201d A cold light flashed in the handsome man\u2019s eyes. He was a member of the Council of Elders, and also Floura\u2019s father, Dives.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlora, you must remember, you are the Goddess of Light. Look at you, you are still acting so willfully and willfully. What if his subjects saw him? \u201d As soon as he said these words, a deep voice rang out. The speaker was a man who looked very much like Dervis. He was Deavis\u2019s father, Flora\u2019s grandfather, and a member of the Presbyterian Council, Gudbrand.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that Flora was chosen as the next Goddess of Light. Out of the nine Elders in the Elders Guild, four of them were related to her by blood, while the other two were her uncles, so they unconditionally supported her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Grandfather.\u201d Flo lowered her head in embarrassment and restrained herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Marilyn, the little bitch, wants to be independent, too. \u201d A cold light flashed across Di Wei\u2019s eyes as he said with disdain, \u201cOnce we capture her, I will make her wish she was dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, father, hurry up and move. It will be too late if you don\u2019t make it. Everyone will really think that it\u2019s the Radiant Temple!\u201d Flarra urged.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl, it\u2019s too late for you to say anything. We will send people to clear it out.\u201d Deavis tapped her forehead and chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d \u201cFather?\u201d She then turned her head to look at the laughing and profound Gudbrand and happily asked, \u201cGrandfather, is what father said true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s true. You little girl, when will you be mature and steady?\u201d She lowered her head and smiled embarrassedly. \u201cI will learn from you.\u201d \u201cI can do it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Let\u2019s just wait for the good news now.\u201d The tone in his voice was incomparably cold. He had already ravaged Marilyn a hundred times in his heart, this damned bitch. If it weren\u2019t for her beauty, he would have killed her on the spot long ago and brought back the Crystal of Faith. He never thought that this little slut would actually dare to establish her own sect! Hmph! As long as he brought her back, he would definitely make her beg for death!</p><br/><p>In the past, with the help of the Pegasus, it was difficult to find traces of them in every city.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see where else she can run this time!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Father, I heard that Marilyn has a few 10-Winged Angels guarding her. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Flora asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Di Wei\u2019s face darkened as he viciously said, \u201cThis b * tch is actually enlightened. She let her subordinates absorb the Angel\u2019s Heart that we sent to hunt her down, so she advanced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, the person we sent is also an eight-winged angel. It\u2019s impossible for him to be defeated so easily and then be absorbed by us.\u201d She frowned and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it was a sneak attack. All in all, Marilyn, this little bitch, seems to have changed a lot on this flight. \u201d Reeves frowned slightly as well, pondering. Marilyn no longer seemed to be the young woman who had looked innocent and cautious. Her heart seemed to be changing dramatically. This was not a good sign!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, I won\u2019t fail again. \u201cThis time, Father sent six 10-Winged Angels and a twelve-Winged Angel to capture her.\u201d Dervis said confidently.</p><br/><p>Gudbrand narrowed his eyes and shot a cold glare. Yes, this time, there must be no mistake. We must capture Marilyn and take back the crystal of faith!</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, Flora, remember not to make a scene like this. \u201cRemember, you are the Goddess of Light.\u201d \u201cI still have things to do. I\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d She nodded.</p><br/><p>Gudbrand stood up and left with Dervis. The place they were going to was the secret room in the backyard. There were successive Radiant Goddesses imprisoned there, and now, it was their time to enjoy themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2026. Ollie City. Holy Hall.</p><br/><p>Within a large, bright study.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was leisurely sipping the rosetea, looking at the thick documents on the table.</p><br/><p>There were indeed many hot-blooded youths in the Divine Realm. In just a few days, so many people had come to register. The busy Charlotte and the others were bedraggled, even more beaming with joy.</p><br/><p>The Light Academy had already begun their intense teaching. Right now, Marilyn urgently wanted to increase her own strength.</p><br/><p>Thus, the first batch of Angel Warriors would soon be born, and at that time, the double play between Sistar and her would also take place.</p><br/><p>But in between, be wary of the Presbyterian flies.</p><br/><p>Ever since that night, Feng Yixuan hadn\u2019t said a word to Qi Ao Shuang nor had he looked her in the eye. However, Qi Ao Shuang could sense that a burning gaze would often land on her. Every time she turned her head to search for this gaze, she couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang knew very well that those were Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s eyes. There was nothing wrong with them.</p><br/><p>That night, it was quiet.</p><br/><p>Everyone was fast asleep, and Marilyn was tired from an early day\u2019s rest.</p><br/><p>The silent Radiant Temple silently snuck into the group of \u2018birdmen\u2019. They were the Angel Warriors sent by the Council of Elders.</p><br/><p>The leader of the Twelve-Winged Angels waved his hand gently, and the six Ten Winged Angels silently followed him into the main hall. All they had to do now was go to Marilyn\u2019s bedroom and take her back and wait for the Presbyterian trial.</p><br/><p>The dark hall was quiet. A few angels carefully walked upstairs. Just as he was about to step up the stairs, the surroundings suddenly lit up. At that instant, the entire hall was also surrounded by Spirit Formations. It was completely isolated from the outside world.</p><br/><p>Not good!</p><br/><p>It was a trap!</p><br/><p>The Angel Warriors of the Elders Guild were all startled. They now understood that their opponents had been waiting for them for quite some time.</p><br/><p>Although they were surprised, they didn\u2019t panic. This was because they knew exactly how powerful their opponent was. Even if they had fallen to the point of absorbing the angelic hearts of their own kind, they would not be their match. The other side only had four Fallen Ten Winged Angels, which was very different from their strength. This battle was without suspense!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they had guessed incorrectly.</p><br/><p>What appeared before them was not an angel with snow-white wings and the current goddess of light, Marilyn.</p><br/><p>It was a demon girl with blood-red eyes, and a human girl with black hair and black eyes!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Twelve-Winged Angels!\u201d The young lord narrowed his eyes and maliciously sized up the Twelve-Winged Angels standing in the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon!\u201d Demon! The angels standing in the hall exclaimed. The demons had appeared in the Divine Realm, and they were still here in Marilyn\u2019s place! No wonder Marilyn was so fearless. She was originally acting together with the dirty demons!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d What are ghosts screaming at night? \u201cDon\u2019t you know it will affect other people\u2019s sleep?\u201d When the young lord saw these Angels crying out in alarm, he wrinkled his brows and started to curse impatiently. He flipped over and jumped down, attacking the Angels standing there unceremoniously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirty demon, Marilyn!\u201d You filthy woman, you are in cahoots with the dirty demons \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u201cAhhhhh!\u201d The strange cries replaced the angry shouts behind him.</p><br/><p>The young lord was indeed the young lord. His attacks were extremely vicious and each of his moves were deadly.</p><br/><p>Even without Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s help, a few powerful Angels could only barely dodge her blows, but their wounds were constantly increasing.</p><br/><p>When the young lord saw the blood, he became even more agitated, as if he had been injected with chicken blood. His attacks became even more vicious. He seemed to be venting, but at the same time, he seemed to be enjoying it.</p><br/><p>What was even more hateful was that the Young Lord was able to kill them, yet he didn\u2019t kill them. Instead, he beat them until they were half dead, half alive, and then came to beat them up. In the end, each of the angels was badly battered and bruised, and they no longer looked as handsome as before. The Twelve-Winged Angels at the head of the group were much better off. At the very least, they were able to discern the appearance of the previous group. The others were all in a terrible state.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbominable demons, you guys \u2026\u201d The leader of the Twelve-Winged Angels spat out a mouthful of blood as he awkwardly spoke. And there was a tooth in the blood he spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing anymore, it\u2019s boring!\u201d The young lord didn\u2019t wait for the Twelve-Winged Angels to finish speaking. His face turned cold, and a tyrannical glint flashed in his eyes. With a wave of his hand, black flames instantly surrounded the Angels.</p><br/><p>Terrifying cries of pain immediately echoed throughout the hall. It was unable to penetrate through and just like that, it continued to irritate people\u2019s eardrums and cause them to tremble with fear.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned as she watched the Angels burn alive. Not only the body, but also the soul!</p><br/><p>This was the Young Chieftain\u2019s strength. This was the Young Chieftain\u2019s nature \u2026 With such a painful way to die, the Young Lord narrowed his eyes and enjoyed it.</p><br/><p>Slowly, the bodies of the angels burned away, leaving a few glowing hearts on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re cheap again.\u201d The young master made a cutting sound with disdain, put his hands behind his head and walked back to his room unconcernedly. By them, she meant, of course, the angels by Marilyn\u2019s side, and these pure powers made them more powerful by their absorption.</p><br/><p>Only after the young master left did Marilyn, Charlotte, and the others appear. They all looked at the angelic heart on the ground with complicated expressions. His mind was filled with that terrifying scene from a moment ago.</p><br/><p>Young master, this person\u2019s strength is actually this terrifying.</p><br/><p>Marilyn was glad that she and she were not enemies.</p><br/><p>How could Marilyn know the Young Chieftain\u2019s true identity? She could only assume that he was an ordinary demon with such terrifying strength. He had no idea that the Young Chieftain was the Little Devil King who acted as if he saw someone die and the flowers wilt. Even the Demon Generals would walk around her when they saw her. How could she be a good person?</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang clearly knew the Young Lord\u2019s identity, and now she had a better understanding of him. Young Chieftain, she doesn\u2019t seem to know many things, and only acts according to her character.</p><br/><p>No matter what, the angel sent by the Elders Guild had been easily disposed of by the Young Lord. He wouldn\u2019t leak out any information, and he would solve the problem silently and perfectly.</p><br/><p>Next, Marilyn worked hard to develop her power.</p><br/><p>Her people are constantly blessed in nearby cities and in the city of Orliang to solve problems for people. More young people came to the selection, proud to be angel fighters. Soon, Marilyn\u2019s Angel Warriors already had Four-Winged Angels.</p><br/><p>The Elders Guild waited again and again but did not wait for the satisfactory news. The Angels they sent out just disappeared like a stone sinking into the ocean.</p><br/><p>Marilyn\u2019s power, however, was at its peak.</p><br/><p>Marilyn\u2019s reputation rose to an unprecedented level after several attacks by Sistar and the successful defeat of Marilyn\u2019s men.</p><br/><p>The whole of Orlian was a festival of flowers and applause, delivered to the Temple of Light and to the angels of Marilyn without a shred of stinginess.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked out the window at the jubilant crowd below, the Maneki-Neko lazily laid down on top of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s head and looked down.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamil\u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Camil asked gently, brewing rose tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think these people are crazy?\u201d Sistar hadn\u2019t done anything unforgivable, but these people hated him. The Radiant Temple and the Darkness Palace didn\u2019t have any conflict of interest, but they fought every day. The Radiant Temple had always wanted to destroy the Radiant Temple. What is the meaning of this? \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is their belief in survival, their spiritual dependence.\u201d Camil smiled and handed over a teacup. \u201cSimply put, they are bored and need to find something to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stood up and took the teacup from Camil, but in her heart, she was in deep agreement with Camil\u2019s words. These people were obviously looking for something to do. It was the same with the Holy War! Because of these people\u2019s boredom, their lives would be reduced to ashes! He absolutely would not allow such a thing to happen.</p><br/><p>As Marilyn\u2019s influence grew more and more stable, the Council of Elders would never swallow its anger again. They\u2019re going to make a big move soon.</p><br/><p>But they would not be allowed to do so.</p><br/><p>The best defense is offense.</p><br/><p>It was better to strike first.</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>At this time, the sound of knocking came from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ao Shuang, I have your guest.\u201d The maid in white respectfully said to Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Customer? In the Divine Realm, did he know anyone?</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Camil with suspicion.</p><br/><p>Who could it be?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

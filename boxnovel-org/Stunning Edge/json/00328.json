This man could not be considered a good person, but he was not a bad person either. From beginning to end, perhaps he had them in his hands, but he had never done anything against her. On the contrary, he had been guarding her in his own way. His mysteriousness and power made Qi Ao Shuang never suspect that such a man would be in trouble, but the facts in front of her showed everything. At this moment, Camil was extremely weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, you\u2019re finally here.\u201d To be able to take one last look at you, to make sure you\u2019re all right, that\u2019s enough. \u201d Camil smiled weakly. Although his smile was as gentle and noble as ever, it made Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s nose ache. To Xiao Ao Shuang, Camil was just like her family. Before she knew it, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s reliance on Camil had already become a natural habit, and this habit was already deeply rooted in her bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille, what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cIs this really the place where the Fathers and the Mother live?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang held back the pain in her nose and asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Camil slowly appeared in front of Qi Ao Shuang, his eyes focused only on Qi Ao Shuang. He gently reached out his hand to touch Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face, but suddenly passed through it. Camille\u2019s face darkened a little, then he smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough for you to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang had a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAusten, remember my real name, Elias Camille.\u201d Camil smiled and suddenly turned to look at Feng Yi Xuan. He said in a low voice, \u201cFeng Yi Xuan, treat Ao Shuang well in the future.\u201d Go back to the Ceylon Continent and live happily. \u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi Xuan was stunned. Seeing the seriousness in Camil\u2019s eyes, he slightly frowned. \u201cCamil, just who are you?\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAushuang, this little fool, is somewhat slow-witted towards emotions. The person she likes deep in her heart is you. Even though you are sometimes very impetuous as an idiot, but you are very reliable. Every time Ao Shuang is in danger, you will be the first one to appear. I\u2019ll trust her to you. \u201d Camille\u2019s smile was as warm as jade.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille, what are you talking about?\u201d It was as if he was giving orders to his successors. Pah pah! \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that, tell us what\u2019s going on.\u201d How could Feng Yixuan\u2019s impatience bear with Camil\u2019s ambiguous words?</p><br/><p>However, when Camil spoke of Ao Shuang\u2019s true intentions, Ao Shuang was slightly stunned, but Leng Lingyun did not seem surprised. She just stood to the side with a calm expression, and no one could see the pain in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve set up a restriction around the place you two are standing at, so he won\u2019t be able to detect it. Now that I\u2019ve seen you guys, I feel at ease. Go back to where you belong. \u201d Camille smiled, looking at Qi Ao Shuang. \u201cAo Shuang, don\u2019t forget me. My real name is Elias Camille \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished speaking, Camil didn\u2019t give any more reaction to Qi Ao Shuang or the others. His body gradually became blurry, and the air around where they stood also began to circulate rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpatial transformation \u2026\u201d Dittos said these words in a low voice, his eyes filled with surprise. Who was this golden-haired, blue-eyed man in front of him? He actually possessed such a terrifying power, and he seemed to be in a very weak and unfavorable state.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Camille! What\u2019s wrong with you? What happened? \u201cDon\u2019t send us away, let\u2019s go together!\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s heart became more and more flustered, and she shouted out loudly. She reached out her hand to touch Camil, but she managed to pass through Camil\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, there\u2019s no need to know.\u201d All you have to do is live happily with your lover and friends. \u201d Camille smiled. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d After Camil finished speaking, his figure was about to disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAzure Flower!\u201d Leng Lingyun shouted in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d After a cold snort, Qing Hua directly extended her hand and a ray of light enveloped Camil\u2019s body. Camil\u2019s expression turned to one of shock. After a few seconds, he disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was panicking, and she shouted out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you shouting for!\u201d If you want to save him, then be quiet. \u201d Just as Xiao Ao Shuang was panicking, the cold and impatient voice of the goddess appeared in her mind once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s pupils dilated.</p><br/><p>Qing Hua stood where she was and frowned before kneeling down respectfully towards Qi Ao Shuang, \u201cMaster, I welcome your return.\u201d \u201cThis body, as well as the power that originally belonged to you, please take it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qinghua\u2019s action caused everyone to be stunned, and suddenly, Qi Ao Shuang felt something very important leave her body at that moment. This feeling was extremely painful, as if he was digging out his heart and lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang lowered her head, trying her best to hold back the pain in her body. However, she was still unable to resist the pain, and she slowly squatted down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d When Feng Yi Xuan saw Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s abnormal state, he anxiously extended his hand to support Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>A hint of worry flashed across Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes, but she resisted the urge to move. She just stood there quietly.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body gradually emitted a dazzling red and white glow. At some point, Golden Lotus and Liu Li had been ejected from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body and were unconscious beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, are you alright?\u201d \u201cAo Shuang!\u201d Feng Yixuan was burning with anxiety. He raised his head to look at the blue and white flowers. A violent light flashed in his eyes, and he was about to attack them. As long as he killed this woman, everything would end.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, this will harm Ao Shuang.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s cold voice rang out, stopping Feng Yixuan\u2019s actions. Facing the furious and anxious eyes of Yi Xuan, Leng Lingyun remained indifferent, \u201cDoing this will only enrage her. She will devour Ao Shuang\u2019s will right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s face sank. He clenched his fists and turned his head to look at the increasingly painful Qi Ao Shuang. The pain in his heart was even more excruciating.</p><br/><p>Lily tightly held onto Jin Yan\u2019s arm and worriedly asked in a small voice, \u201cElder brother Jin Yan, elder sister Ao Shuang will be fine, right?\u201d \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Jin Yan softly said these words, but his heart was already tense. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face was turning paler and paler. Was this all right? Originally, he had thought that he would be able to successfully separate their consciousness after meeting Camil. However, he never expected that after coming here, this place was filled with pure energy, allowing the Auland woman in her to regain the power to separate herself after waking up. Would she take this opportunity to do anything to Ao Shuang? Jin Yan\u2019s heart was also uneasy and anxious.</p><br/><p>His eyes grew colder and colder, and his hands tightened into fists. \u201cDon\u2019t be impulsive, didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d \u201cIf we attack that woman now, Ao Shuang will also be in danger.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s low voice sounded calmly in Dittas\u2019 ears, dispelling the same impulse as Feng Yixuan had.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, it\u2019ll definitely be fine. Be patient.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s deep voice seemed to have the power to soothe people, and Dittos\u2019s clenched fist finally relaxed.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the light from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body poured out, shining upon the body of Qing Hua. A painful expression slowly appeared on Qing Hua\u2019s face, but she did not move an inch. She did not even make a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jin Yan, then \u2026 what will happen to that person?\u201d Lily tugged on Jin Yan\u2019s arm as she asked in fear. This was only because the expression on Qinghua\u2019s face was getting more and more painful, more and more twisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be consumed, and then completely gone \u2026.\u201d Jin Yan slowly said with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d Lily\u2019s face changed, she looked at the blue and white flower that was suffering great pain. An indescribable feeling arose in his heart. Although that woman was very annoying, was she going to disappear just like that? For her master, she had contributed everything without any complaints, and then completely disappeared. Was this worth it?</p><br/><p>The expression on Qing Hua\u2019s face gradually changed from pain to calmness before it slowly turned cold again.</p><br/><p>As for Qi Ao Shuang, she gradually regained her composure. The intense pain vanished, and what replaced it was a feeling of emptiness that was hard to describe with words.</p><br/><p>Qinghua slowly opened her eyes, her eyes exuding an ice-cold light, terrifying the heart and soul of anyone who looked at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, are you alright?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan helped Qi Ao Shuang up. His face was full of worry and his voice was trembling. He was afraid that Qi Ao Shuang would never reply to him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d Qing Hua stood up abruptly and said those words coldly. Looking at Feng Yixuan\u2019s attitude towards Qi Ao Shuang, it was as if a thorn had pierced through her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slowly raised her head, but her eyes were clear.</p><br/><p>She and Blue Flower were just staring at each other, their eyes cold. Qi Ao Shuang suppressed the discomfort in her body. Looking at the blue and white flowers, Qi Ao Shuang could clearly feel that the power in her body had not only recovered, but had increased to an unprecedented level.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t expect that\u2026 Qing Hua\u2019s voice was incomparably cold, and a tyrannical light gradually appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang smiled with difficulty and said slowly: \u201cHowever, most of the power is still on your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cThese belong to me!\u201d Blueflower let out a loud shout.</p><br/><p>The conversation between the two instantly became clear. Everyone now understood what they meant. Leng Lingyun was also stunned, because even he did not expect the power of that person to be separated. Or could it be that some of the forces had chosen to take on the role of the master? Thinking of this, Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart sank. In her temper, the consequences of having her things taken were unthinkable. What would she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, want to save that man?\u201d The Son of Sin. The corners of Qing Hua\u2019s lips curled up into a sneer.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamille!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression changed, and she immediately understood who the man Qinghua was talking about was. But why the Son of Sin?</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026 Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart sank to the bottom. She always struck the most deadly blow to someone\u2019s soft spot. And now, he was going to do the same to Ao Shuang?</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

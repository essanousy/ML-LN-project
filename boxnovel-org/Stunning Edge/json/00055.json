Since they were going to provoke them, then they would have to deal with them properly: eliminate them from the roots, definitely not allowing them to get the chance to turn the tables. Not even a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jean consented lightly. Icy coldness emanated from his eyes. He pulled out the sword with a whoosh and then added on a layer of Dou Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you guys? Do you guys know how great of a sin it is to block the Temple of Light from arresting traitors?\u201d One of the holy knights yelled out in a hurry as he saw another two strong people join the fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter we kill you, we\u2019ll burn your corpses until not even dust remains and melt your armors. Who could know they were people from the temple of light?\u201d Claire\u2019s cold voice made the holy knights tremble with fear. This girl, what she said was definitely true. She definitely planned on doing it. Such a young age yet actually such a cruel heart?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them run away.\u201d Claire warned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t.\u201d Feng Yixuan snorted, already cruelly waving his hand for more to go over.</p><br/><p>Claire walked next to the holy knight who Shui Wenmo had been protecting, crouched down slowly, and was actually stunned to see the girl in the embrace of the holy knight was black haired and black eyed! Perhaps this girl was the person who could topple the Temple of Light? The person who was predicted to come once in a millennium? That\u2019s why this girl was chased to be killed?</p><br/><p>But Walter\u2019s voice sounded at this moment. \u201cClaire, don\u2019t thinking blindly. This girl isn\u2019t the person from the prophecy. Look at the depths of her eyes, there\u2019s a trace of blue. Although it\u2019s very faint, it\u2019s truly there. This should be how the Temple of Light kills a thousand innocents to not let one go. This is one face of the Temple of Light\u2019s methods. Today, their luck was very good, bumping into us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked closely. Sure enough, she saw a trace of blue in the girl\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, this girl\u2019s destiny is very average.\u201d Walter said confidently. He understood the stars a little.</p><br/><p>Claire picked up the about-to-faint holy knight\u2019s sword and turned to also join the fight.</p><br/><p>The fight became four versus five.</p><br/><p>Once Cliff had walked over slowly and heedlessly, he saw a scene that almost made his heart jump to his throat.</p><br/><p>Claire and a few guys were pursuing and attacking a few knights from the Temple of Light extremely viciously, only hitting vitals, so much so that it looked like they wouldn\u2019t stop until they killed them.</p><br/><p>But their opponents were not holy knights from the Temple of Light for nothing. Confronted with Feng Yixuan and them\u2019s vicious attacks, they neutralized them one by one. Meanwhile, Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo\u2019s flawless coordination gave them a headache incessantly.</p><br/><p>Claire and Jean also coordinated very well from sparring, also making their opponents fight strenuously.</p><br/><p>Cliff stared at the scene in front of him, not coming back to his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys, what are you doing?\u201d Cliff frowned as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Cliff?!\u201d The lead holy knight recognized Cliff in a flash and then acted as if he had seen a savior, crying out hurriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Cliff.\u201d Claire said angrily, a slash of Dou Qi slicing past, closely following an attacking fire ball.</p><br/><p>Cliff frowned, confused at the state of affairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, these beasts wanted to violate that girl and we stopped them. They even wanted to lay a hand on me, saying they happened to light a child my age, even saying that this kind of small body felt the best to violate.\u201d Claire\u2019s face didn\u2019t redden nor heartbeat quicken as she casually made a bunch of lies. These kind of shameless and vulgar words made the holy knights all stare blankly and faces flush red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Cliff immediately became angry dramatically, pulling out his wand as he was about to fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Sir Cliff, please listen to our explanation. We are the Temple of Light\u2019s most faithful knights, how could we do this kind of thing, we\u2026 ah!!!\u201d There was no ending to the \u201cwe\u201d, only a mournful cry.</p><br/><p>Claire expressionlessly stuck out her tongue. In reality, she knew very clearly that this kind of botched lie would have no way of tricking Cliff. But the circumstances had already turned into this. Cliff had no choice but to join them, because he understood the way of the Temple of Light better than anyone else. Claire\u2019s words were only to give him an excuse to not stop them from killing.</p><br/><p>If Cliff made a move, then who could fight back?</p><br/><p>Soon, the holy knights fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster. Uh, then you go rest first. We\u2019ll come in a while.\u201d Claire smiled gently. The bloody spectacle on the ground was not suitable for the elderly to see.</p><br/><p>Cliff faced the sky. \u201cYes, today\u2019s weather is pretty good. I\u2019ll go first and roast meat while waiting for you guys.\u201d After he finished speaking, he picked up the few hares Shui Wenmo had just dropped on the ground and turned and left immediately. It would be best if he didn\u2019t see the execution of the people from the Temple of Light and pretend he didn\u2019t see anything. After all, they were people on Lawrence\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, support them up. Treat them a bit.\u201d Claire said, looking at the wounded holy knight and the girl completely covered in blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d The girl completely covered in blood look at the emotionally, thanking. She didn\u2019t have any wounds on her body; all the blood on her body was the holy knight\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d Jean bent down and grabbed the heavily wounded holy knight, leaving as Cliff did.</p><br/><p>The holy knights who were currently unable to struggle all angrily and incredulously watched Cliff\u2019s figure disappear. That was Sir Cliff, no doubt about it. Then the blonde haired girl was his disciple, Claire Hill! The rumored male-chaser who had suddenly started to straighten out. They actually dared to brazenly make a move on people from the Temple of Light?!</p><br/><p>\u201cPile them up, I\u2019ll burn them.\u201d Claire said to Shui Wenmo and Feng Yixuan as a cold light appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? The goddess of Light\u2019s all seeing vision will record all your sin down. You will be punished\u2026\u201d The leading holy knight rebuked angrily.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo turned a deaf ear, rapidly making their moves. Shui Wenmo first went forward and slashed one after the other, slitting their throats. The holy knights all died with their eyes open wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cPah! Goddess of Light\u2019s all seeing vision. More like dog vision.\u201d Walter hatefully spat.</p><br/><p>Shui Wenmo quickly and nimbly piled up the corpses.</p><br/><p>Claire chanted and started the set the corpses on fire. Slowly, the corpses gradually turned to ashes, but the armor melted very slowly. They all had some kind of boost effect from magic. As Claire frowned, pondering how to melt these armor as fast as possible, a strange Qi flowed in her body. In front of Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo\u2019s stunned gazes, Claire\u2019s flames gradually turned gold colored. The armor instantly melted, turning into a pool of molten iron, flowing slowly off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck again for anything that could expose their identities?\u201d Claire stopped her flame, walking forward to inspect if there was anything on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just need to leave.\u201d Shui Wenmo drew his sword, chopping the ground with a low grunt. Then, a large dent appeared in the ground. Without another word, Shui Wenmo burst with Dou Qi again, raised the ground that been burned, and flipped it over into the huge dent, burying all traces.</p><br/><p>Only after the three inspected the surroundings carefully again and were completely sure did they prepare to go back.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Shui Wenmo stopped, quietly calling Claire\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Claire turned and looked towards Shui Wenmo, not understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Shui Wenmo\u2019s thank you was very quiet, but very clear.</p><br/><p>Claire immediately understood what Shui Wenmo meant. Yes, if it wasn\u2019t for Shui Wenmo, they wouldn\u2019t have been dragged into this conflict, wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved with the Temple of Light\u2019s matters, and wouldn\u2019t have become the formidable Temple of Light\u2019s enemy even more so.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thanking for? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Nothing happened here.\u201d Claire smiled, turning to leave.</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on the corner of Shui Wenmo\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>But Feng Yixuan fiercely grabbed Shui Wenmo\u2019s neck and spoke in a voice only loud enough for the two to here. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Claire is mine. If you dare to fight with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Even if this world was destroyed, I still wouldn\u2019t have a fraction of those kinds of thoughts toward your wife.\u201d Shui Wenmo snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, at least you have tact.\u201d Feng Yixuan released Shui Wenmo\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>The two walked to the camp with their arms around their shoulders.</p><br/><p>The holy knight and girl completely covered in blood were still a riddle. They believed that what they said would explain what on earth was going on.</p><br/><p>When they arrived back at the camp, the holy knight had already been treated with Cliff\u2019s medicine, looking a lot better.</p><br/><p>Seeing Claire and them arrive back, the girl completely covered in blood hurriedly stood up to welcome them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit down. How is his condition right now? And what was going on?\u201d Claire waved, indicating for the girl the sit down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of that stupid prophecy, the Temple of Light sent people to kill her. A sincere and innocent girl, a weak girl without any strength.\u201d The nearby holy knight who was still a bit weak said somewhat hatefully. \u201cHow could this kind of girl topple the Temple of Light? Her eyes are clearer than spring water!\u201d After the holy knight finished speaking, he turned to look at the nearby, worried girl. The girl shook her head lightly, unable to bear it. \u201cI, I don\u2019t deserve venerable sir at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat venerable sir, I\u2019m already someone the Temple of Light will chase and kill, I\u2019m already a fallen knight.\u201d The knight laughed calmly and extended his hand, tightly holding the girl\u2019s hand. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say this a long time ago? We\u2019ll die together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how corny~~\u201d Walter shivered.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I also want to die with you.\u201d The next moment, Feng Yixuan gripped Claire\u2019s hand fiercely, looking at Claire exceptionally seriously as he said those kinds of words.</p><br/><p>Everyone froze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He said in a relaxed manner, \u201cI was just asking, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter froze. He turned to Leng Lingyun whose attitude seemed genuine, becoming suspicious. He gave up just like that? He didn\u2019t want to fight against him?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy current identity is a member of the Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps, healer class.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled at Claire as he said this. \u201cAnd you are my commander. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Leng Lingyun said this, everybody relaxed. Walter sighed in relief. But Claire didn\u2019t say a word. Nobody knew what she was thinking at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you are our healer. Shouldn\u2019t you heal me\u2026 Your secondary commander?\u201d Camille said icily, his tone a little annoyed. \u201cSo the commander\u2019s wound is a wound, but mine isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody\u2019s gazes shifted over and they saw Camille\u2019s hand covered in blood. Only then did they remember that just then, Camille had extended his hand blocked the fatal strike. And only he could have such reflexes! If Camille was called the number one assassin, then Li Yuewen would be called the number two assassin. If it wasn\u2019t Camille standing behind Claire and someone else, who knew if Claire would still be alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I forgot.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled embarrassedly and hastily walked over, starting to heal Camille. However, Leng Lingyun\u2019s embarrassed smile made everyone feel like they had seen wrong. Since when did the Divine Prince smile like this? In their minds, he always had a fake smile, always had a formal, suffocatingly elegant bearing. But today he had showed this kind of expression. Was he possessed or something?</p><br/><p>While Leng Lingyun healed Camille at a side, everybody else glanced at each other. Only then did they come back to their senses and all go to ask about Claire\u2019s condition. White Emperor also worriedly watched Claire while crouching on Li Mingyu\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now,\u201d Claire said faintly. \u201cGo and see if they have anything good on their bodies.\u201d Jean walked to Li Mingyu and extended his hand. He took Claire away naturally and carried her in his embrace. Everyone else started searching. Strangely, Summer ducked away to the side, pale faced. The bloody mangled corpses looked simply too disgusting.</p><br/><p>Walter crouched down, preparing to search, but he saw that the low level earth fairies were still gripping the twins\u2019 corpse\u2019s\u2019 feet tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Fenghou, you idiot, hurry up and summon back your earth fairies!\u201d Walter furiously turned around cursed at Dong Fenghou who was still crouching at the edge of the marshland and mumbling to himself, \u201cYou really are as dumb as a pit. Not doing anything when we need you to and only doing things when we don\u2019t need you to!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Dong Fenghou summoned the low level elemental fairy back. Then he stared vacantly into space, like he was wondering what he should do to not be like a pig.</p><br/><p>After Leng Lingyun quickly finished healing Camille, he continued to heal, healing Claire. Amidst the brilliant white light, Claire\u2019s wound soon healed, no traces of anything left over. Without the heart being pierced and being treated immediately, Claire really had the best of luck. \u201cAhaha, there\u2019s so much,\u201d Walter called out happily, then called out again loudly, \u201cAre these interspatial rings? It can\u2019t be, they have interspatial rings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire already didn\u2019t have any major problems; she only had a slight headache. She struggled free from Jean\u2019s embrace and walked over to Walter\u2019s side, then said faintly, \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Walter didn\u2019t think much of it as he pulled the ring off the magician\u2019s finger and handed it to Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire emotionlessly received it, then pulled out a small dagger. She pricked her finger with it and dropped a drop of blood in the ring. She was still expressionless as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s mine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit! It really is an interspatial ring!\u201d Seeing Claire\u2019s bold and shameless behavior, Walter got so mad, he started jumping up and down. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just say you were looking? Why did you directly drop your blood and become the owner? Too unfair, too shameless! Who acts like that?\u201d Unless the previous owner renounced ownership, nobody else could be the owner of an interspatial ring unless the owner died. Would the little devil renounce ownership? Only in his dreams! Everyone else also enviously stared at the interspatial ring on Claire\u2019s finger. Claire completely disregarded them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, the space isn\u2019t very big, it\u2019s only one cubic meter. But the stuff inside\u2026\u201d Claire ignored Walter\u2019s protest and started checking for what was inside instead. Although the space inside was very small, the interspatial ring was still extremely rare and precious.</p><br/><p>Under everybody\u2019s incredulous gazes, Claire pulled out precious items one after another: a ninth grade magic core, five eighth grade magic cores, nine seventh grade magic cores, along with a few enchanted scrolls, a few bottles of potions, a few uncommon ores and rare herbs. They were all extremely valuable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re rich\u2026\u201d Walter stared wide eyed as Claire pulled out the items and heehee-ed. He inspected one of the potions and after sniffing it, started crying out more exaggeratedly, \u201cGender changing potion! Holy, I wonder who they were, they actually have something this valuable. Ah, and this! Heavens, this can transform your body, transform your body into, hehe\u2026\u201d Walter laughed vulgarly and stopped talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cTransform into what?\u201d Claire grabbed the potion and started inspecting it, but couldn\u2019t tell what was unordinary about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTransform you into someone completely different. It can transform you into a super beauty, make your chest big, waist small, butt big. The way you look now\u2026\u201d Before Walter finished speaking, he was hit flying with a fist and started crying \u2018aiya\u2019 mournfully.</p><br/><p>Claire withdrew her first and stared skeptically at the bottle in her hand. Internally, she was surprised. Something so magical existed?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a slender, white hand reached over. Claire looked up and was met with Leng Lingun\u2019s violet eyes, so she loosened her grip and Leng Lingyun took it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a beauty potion,\u201d Leng Lingyun said certainly after inspecting it. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it before. Even if it\u2019s an ugly woman, after they drink this potion, they\u2019ll become a beauty. But it\u2019s related to how they look originally. For example, if an ugly woman drinks it, they will become an ordinary beauty, but if someone who was originally a beauty drinks it, they will transform into a stunning beauty. However, it has a time limit. Drinking a small sip can last for five or six hours. The more you drink, the longer it lasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter glowered at the pretty boy, not understanding how the pretty boy would know such peculiar knowledge. Didn\u2019t people from the Temple of Light pretend to be noble and looked down on things like this the most? But this guy actually said he had seen it before?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a transforming potion, if you drink a small sip, you will transform into your original appearance, it also lasts for only five to six hours and also lasts longer the more you drink.\u201d Leng Lingyun continued to inspect the other potions and sighed, \u201cThese things are all really valuable, so what are their identities? They actually have interspatial rings and items as precious as these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire put away the potions away and said without change in expression, \u201cNow they\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone felt contempt, however, they were all thinking of Leng Lingyun\u2019s words currently. Who exactly were these people?</p><br/><p>\u201cI know who they are now.\u201d Li Minyu said, his voice low. Currently, he was holding a small badge. The small badge was white and had a very simple design, a lightning bolt. But the lightning bolt was black, sharply contrasting against the white background.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Black Lightning\u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression changed. He frowned, which he rarely did. \u201cThat explains why those five\u2019s strength was so powerful and they had such precious items.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack lightning?\u201d Qiao Chuxin asked while blinking, confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lightning bolt that\u2019s black, Black Lightning.\u201d Li Mingyu\u2019s expression started to become a bit unsightly. \u201cWe have provoked powerful people now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPowerful? Haven\u2019t they already died?\u201d Qiao Chuxin was even more confused. Didn\u2019t the corpses on the ground speak for themselves? How powerful could they be? They had already died, afterall.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just low level people among Black Lightning.\u201d Li Mingyu pinched the badge and said icily, \u201cAfter we finish gathering everything, we need to destroy the corpses quickly, not a trace can be left behind.\u201d What? They were all shocked. They were still considered low level? A warrior evenly matched with Jean, a magician who could instacast, an archer who could use magic, and the twin sisters who could control people with shadows, these people were considered low level? These people who had almost defeated them were actually only low level people?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as he says.\u201d Camille\u2019s expression was actually also solemn right now. A profound sliver flashed in his eyes. They could only tell that Camille also knew the Black Lightning organization.</p><br/><p>The always gently smiling Camille actually had on such a solemn expression currently. Everybody understood that this time, the situation was definitely not so simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Fenghou, come over here.\u201d Camille beckoned towards Dong Fenghou who was still pondering over what to do. \u201cNow we can use you.\u201d Dong Feng went \u201cOh\u201d and immediately realized, scampering over. Everybody was shocked. The young man had proven how stupid beyond words he was once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe egg is about to crack open,\u201d Li Yuewen suddenly called out.</p><br/><p>Camille stroked his beautiful chin and smiled as he said, \u201cThen first quickly get rid of the corpses and then see what exactly is inside the egg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou scampered over as Camille beckoned with his finger. After he obediently ran over, Camille gave an order.</p><br/><p>\u201cSummon things from another dimension that can eat corpses.\u201d Camille instructed. When everybody heard this, they thought it was good idea: eating everything cleanly, then summon the strange beasts back to their dimension. Who would be able to figure it out then?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

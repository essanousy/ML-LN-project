That night it was only because this despicable, man-crazy idiot shamelessly tricked her into thinking Grandfather had arrived that she had suffered that sneak attack. Afterwards, she was grounded for a whole month. In that annoying time, Lashia had thought it all out very clearly. If it wasn\u2019t for Claire using those shameless, dirty, underhanded methods, she definitely wouldn\u2019t have lost. Lashia fumed with rage and clenched her teeth every time she thought of the humiliation and terror of that night. Burning shame, a terrible disgrace to be scared by that idiotic man-chaser. She must definitely pay back that humiliation! Pay it back a hundredfold!</p><br/><p>Standing in front of Lashia was an old man wearing a long magician\u2019s robe. The gold flower embroidered at the chest area showed his level as a magician was second only to Cliff, a wizard. But, this one level difference between them was a huge gulf. This was the principal of the Sunrise Institute and Lashia\u2019s master \u2013 Mozart. Mozart looked at the blonde haired girl\u2019s back, understanding that was Lashia\u2019s older sister, Claire. He didn\u2019t have any positive impressions of Claire. He already heard about her absurd actions, of course, from his prized disciple, Lashia.</p><br/><p>The two boys behind Lashia were of course her seniors. Everyone looked at Claire with disgust.</p><br/><p>Lashia saw Claire ignoring her and her whole body shook, ready to explode, but she remembered this was the Magician Council and she was with her master. In the end, she restrained herself, and asked the nearby Jean coldly, \u201cJean, what are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to the second Miss, we are here to find Master Cliff.\u201d Jean answered emotionlessly, neither servile nor overbearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d After hearing this, Lashia almost laughed out loud. That moronic man-chaser also wants to see Cliff? That\u2019s way too funny, haha. Is the great master Cliff someone an idiot can meet whenever? It was only after pleading with their master for so long that he agreed to let them meet the great Cliff, hoping he would give some guidance.</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s eyes flashed an indescribable light for a millisecond. There was a trace of ridicule, but it was very indistinct.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, even you want to meet Sir Cliff, this is such idiotic nonsense.\u201d Lashia laughed mockingly. The two men behind Lashia also had a ridiculing expression. It was extremely clear that Claire wanting to meet Cliff was even more outrageous than a toad wanting to eat swan meat.</p><br/><p>Like before, Claire didn\u2019t respond to Lashia\u2019s ridicule. She also ignored the principal beside Lashia. Maybe the other students would respectfully give their greetings when they met the principal, but Claire didn\u2019t show respect at all. He was just the superior of those teachers who taught the basics, nothing more. Towards the teachers who taught the basics she held a sliver of respect, but she felt nothing towards the principal.</p><br/><p>Jean also kept quiet, not saying anything about Cliff already accepting Claire as his disciple.</p><br/><p>Mozart quietly coughed, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Lashia, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d Lashia understood their purpose wasn\u2019t to taunt and ridicule Claire, but to do more important things. She would teach this idiot a lesson the next suitable time they met.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that Mozart saw the bracelet Claire was wearing and cried out in shock, \u201cTransportation Bracelet!\u201d Of course he recognized that bracelet, his master Cliff had meticulously created that precious treasure with care. Transportation was a very high level magic. Once someone reached a certain level, practicing this magic wasn\u2019t very hard, but embodying transportation into a magical device was extremely hard. But this precious item was now on this girl\u2019s wrist!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what is it?\u201d Lashia was also surprised, because it was very rare to see her master look so out of control.</p><br/><p>Mozart didn\u2019t answer Lashia\u2019s question, but instead looked at Claire and cautiously asked, \u201cClaire, where did you get your bracelet from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone gave it to me.\u201d Claire indifferently replied. She only answered out of respect for his position as a principal and she had to give him some face.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! That\u2019s one of Master\u2019s most precious treasures!\u201d Mozart cried out in surprise. But if it wasn\u2019t given to her, then how did she get it? It wasn\u2019t possible that his master lost it and Claire just randomly found it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Lashia shouted in surprise. Mozart\u2019s other two disciples were also shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen she must have stolen it!\u201d Lashia angrily yelled, \u201cClaire, you thief, how shameless! You\u2019re disgracing the Hill family too much, I will\u2026 \u201d Again, Lashia lost all reason because of Claire. Unceasingly she blurted out everything in her brain. Jean raised his brow. How did he not notice this angel-looking second Miss was so uncouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a pig?\u201d Claire\u2019s light sentence made everyone present deathly quiet. \u201cHow many people in the world can steal from the wizard sage Cliff?\u201d</p><br/><p>After this sentence, Lashia\u2019s mouth seemed like it was glued open, wide and not closed.</p><br/><p>Mozart\u2019s expression became serious and the two other disciples stared blankly, frozen in place.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was deathly silent, the sound of hurried footsteps sounded from the entrance of the Magician Council.</p><br/><p>Cliff, that perverted old man, skipped out the door. The moment he saw Claire his smile blossomed. Running quickly out, his mouth started vulgarly exclaiming, \u201cOh~ Oh~~ My beloved darling disciple, I thought you would never come to find me. I waited for you forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mozart blanked out, completely frozen. Master was calling him what? And so nauseatingly? Is he mistaken? This had never happened before.</p><br/><p>Everyone else also blanked out, but they were happy. They never thought that Cliff liked their master this much. Their hope that Cliff would give guidance grew.</p><br/><p>Only Jean had an undetectable ridiculing cold smile.</p><br/><p>The disciple who went to report almost bit his tongue off. He only said that there was a blonde-haired girl who even threatened him that he would suffer consequences if he didn\u2019t go and report. He never thought that Cliff would ignore those arrogant words and almost flew out.</p><br/><p>The people all were frozen in awe, but the more surprising thing had still not happened.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Cliff had already rushed up to Claire and attempted a hug, which Claire dodged. Then Cliff agilely turned and extended his hand to lift Claire\u2019s skirt. The skirt was only lifted for an instant before Claire quickly withdrew backwards. Jean held onto Claire\u2019s waist and Claire kicked out with force. Her foot landed accurately on Cliff\u2019s face. These series of actions all happened very smoothly with no breaks in between. Jean and Claire\u2019s coordination was very well timed.</p><br/><p>Crows cawed in the sky, leaves floated around in the air.</p><br/><p>Awkwardness\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>(In the future, Cliff kept this habit. Every time he met Claire he would attempt to lift up her skirt, never tired of it despite her threats. But he never succeeded.)</p><br/><p>For all the years Mozart lived, this was the first time he felt that his heart would malfunction, unable to bear with the situation at hand.</p><br/><p>Lashia\u2019s brain completely stopped running, her face a mixed colored palette, as splendid as could be. She just stood there motionless like an idiot. Her two seniors almost fainted, foaming at the mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~~ My precious Claire, how could you treat your Master this way?\u201d Cliff acted like nothing was wrong, and stood up with a blank face. He fished out a handkerchief and pouted. On his face there was an obvious footprint.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long are you going to keep holding me?\u201d Claire completely ignored Cliff\u2019s emotional complaints, and instead glanced at Jean to speak coldly.</p><br/><p>Jean hurriedly let go at once, helping Claire to her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare lift my skirt again, I\u2019ll slice you to pieces.\u201d Claire\u2019s ghastly tone brought the two petrified apprentice magicians at the door back to life. They both desperately rubbed their eyes, doubting that all they\u2019ve seen today were hallucinations.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my darling disciple, don\u2019t be like that.\u201d Cliff still didn\u2019t change his bad habit and squinted pervertedly at Claire\u2019s bosom. \u201cLet me guess, today you\u2019re wearing a round corset.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who came back to their senses twitched their mouths. Although they knew Cliff was perverted, they never imagined he could be so brazen and shameless.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s cold gaze made Cliff a little uneasy. He coughed and became a little more serious. \u201cWell, Claire, first follow me to my laboratory. I\u2019ll give you my notebook.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded.</p><br/><p>Cliff led Claire and Jean into the Magician Council just like that. He was so cheerful that he had totally forgotten about his other disciple, Mozart, who was standing at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Mozart finally called out to Cliff who was about to go in.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Only then Cliff turned around and saw Mozart. \u201cAh? Mozart, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence made Mozart\u2019s mouth tremble.</p><br/><p>These two completely different treatments made everyone flabbergasted and wordless.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, it was you who said you had time today and told me to come over.\u201d Mozart answered carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019m busy now. Come another day.\u201d Cliff was now totally focused on Claire, there was no way he could have time to spend on Mozart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d Mozart obediently nodded without any objection.</p><br/><p>Everyone stared at Claire as she disappeared into the Magician Council\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>Lashia looked at Claire\u2019s back and almost swallowed her teeth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

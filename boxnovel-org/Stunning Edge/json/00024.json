The legendary Sir Cliff acted so intimately with that idiot and even fawned over her! Hatred, jealousy, unwillingness, Lashia was swallowed up by these emotions in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what\u2019s going on? Why is that idiot so close with Sir Cliff?\u201d Lashia gritted her teeth, pushing down her emotions. If Claire was in front of her right now, she might have jumped on her and bitten her a few times. She was supposed to be the talented genius girl! She was what the world revolved around! That moron had now climbed up on her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure either. But the thing I do know is, Master has already taken her as his disciple and treats her very dotingly.\u201d Mozart sighed lightly. He understood Lashia\u2019s feelings, but Claire becoming his Master\u2019s disciple was already uncontestable. He hoped this wouldn\u2019t deal too much of a blow to his proud and arrogant disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible. She\u2019s a man-chaser, and so stupid and ignorant.\u201d Lashia\u2019s mood was extremely agitated. How could she accept this situation?! This idiot man-chaser she looked down on and hated the most is now her revered master\u2019s junior sister!!! What kind of bullshit joke was this, not even funny. This was the first time Lashia cursed so indecently in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Master, how is it possible? She must have seduced Sir Cliff.\u201d One of the other disciples said very certainly. His face was also full of wrath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, master, you must figure out what really happened. Maybe that man-chasing Claire drugged Sir Cliff with a love potion.\u201d The other disciple added, undeterred.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Nobody expected Mozart\u2019s face to change. He angrily reprimanded, \u201cAll of you shut up, you\u2019re not allowed to talk rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all quieted down. This was the first time they had seen their Master so angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour jealousy has blinded you, making you lose all reason! Where did your self-restraint, your intellect go?\u201d Mozart scolded angrily. \u201cDo you think Claire, who hasn\u2019t even become a true magician, can drug a wizard sage? Master is perverted, but have you ever heard of Master doing irrational things or become muddleheaded due to feminine charms? You\u2019re not just falsely accusing Claire, but also dishonoring Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all froze and felt fear, not even daring to breathe too loudly. None of them could afford to dishonor Cliff. Mozart\u2019s words pricked their heart like a needle. Yes, not to talk about Claire, but even their Master didn\u2019t have the capabilities to drug Cliff. The truth really was merciless, that the legendary great Cliff really accepted Claire, the man-chaser, as a disciple.</p><br/><p>Mozart looked his three ashen-faced disciples and sighed quietly. These three were all very talented, but they were too young and too easily jealous. With that temperament their road would be a bumpy one. Maybe he had pampered them too much. Looking at it now, not letting them experience any setbacks was the wrong teaching method.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lashia apologized first. Her meekness was one of the biggest reasons that Mozart was so fond of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we\u2019re sorry.\u201d The other two disciples also quickly apologized.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are all too young. I hope you can become more mature, and not let your eyes, or here, be deceived by outside appearances.\u201d Mozart said sincerely, pointing to his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d They all nodded in response, looking a bit ashamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know why Master would take Claire as a disciple, it is now the undeniable truth. She is now my junior sister, and I expect you to have proper respect.\u201d Mozart sighed, a little resigned. He knew that based on Lashia\u2019s spoiled personality, she just might go pick a fight. He sighed again. \u201cLashia, do not do anything extreme, do you understand?\u201d Mozart wasn\u2019t worried about Lashia and Claire\u2019s sisterly relationship, but that Cliff might get angry. Cliff was a very protective person, and from his attitude today towards Claire he could tell that Cliff liked Claire very much. If his precious Claire was hurt, no one could bear his wrath.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d On the surface, they all promised, but Mozart couldn\u2019t know their true thoughts. Lashia also agreed obediently, but inside her heart, jealousy and hate grew crazily like weeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, one day we will know why Master has taken her as his disciple. Right now what we need to do is to continue our learning.\u201d Mozart led them on. The three exchanged glances, and followed behind.</p><br/><p>In the Magician Council, Claire observed the interior.</p><br/><p>She was on the first floor right now. It was like a big plaza with a few windows around. These were where magicians could apply for assessments. In the middle, there was a huge, round platform. Looking up, the ceiling above the round platform was empty. It was actually a huge elevator that went straight to the top.</p><br/><p>Getting onto the elevator, Cliff casually started chanting, and the round platform steadily ascended. When they slowly reached the second floor, Claire was surprised to find that it consisted of shops closely lined together. Every shop had a shopkeeper, and judging by the style of their robes, they were all apprentice magicians. Why? Claire asked herself. Didn\u2019t magicians all hate those greedy merchants? How would they themselves open shops?</p><br/><p>Cliff seemed to see Claire\u2019s confusion and laughingly explained, \u201cThese shops have all been created by magicians themselves, and are used to trade magical items, but not sell.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like this, Claire immediately understood. This was a great idea and made interactions between magicians easier.</p><br/><p>On the third floor were personal laboratories of magicians, the higher up, the higher the status.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the top floor was Cliff\u2019s laboratory.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhaha, Claire, look, how is my place?\u201d Cliff, exactly like a child showing off, pointed at his huge laboratory and laughed, pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything special.\u201d Claire indifferently responded. In fact, a magician\u2019s laboratory was incomparably messy, with a certain order in the mess. Perhaps only the owner would know where his supplies were.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d A notebook suddenly appeared in Cliff\u2019s hand and he handed it to Claire, \u201cHere, these are my notes when I first became a magician. They should be very useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire accepted it and flipped through it, raising her eyebrows. Sure enough, the views in this notebook were very unique and to the point. Can\u2019t deny that this perverted old man is still very smart. As the only wizard sage in all of Amparkland, he did know his books.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresently, you\u2019re not ready to use too high level spells, I\u2019ll teach them to you when the time comes. The world of magic is exquisite and wide. You can\u2019t be too patient on learning magic.\u201d Cliff said seriously. This happened to coincide with what Emery had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know, Master.\u201d Claire\u2019s \u201cMaster\u201d made Cliff elated again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext week is the princess\u2019s birthday, you must arrive early.\u201d Cliff suddenly changed the topic.</p><br/><p>Claire was a bit puzzled. Based on Cliff\u2019s character, normally he wouldn\u2019t care about the outside world and wouldn\u2019t attend this kind of boring banquet, but now he brought up this topic himself. How could it not be weird? Then Claire saw Cliff\u2019s evil grin, and her intuition told her that nothing good would come out of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, did anyone ever tell you your smile is very obscene?\u201d Claire frowned at Cliff, who was still laughing evilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Really?\u201d Cliff immediately became serious and asked frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your purpose?\u201d Claire didn\u2019t trust her vulgar Master\u2019s words. The more serious he was, the more suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, haha, ahaha~\u201d Cliff laughed so hard he couldn\u2019t close his mouth. \u201cHaha, it\u2019s just that that old man will also go. Ahaha~~\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked at Cliff skeptically, curious about who the old man he was talking about was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell well, darling disciple, wait for me to finish this experiment and then I\u2019ll go find you. In Duke Hill\u2019s castle, right?\u201d Cliff laughed, obviously in a really, really good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded and didn\u2019t ask anything. In any case, she would find out which old guy it was that her master mentioned on that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, you must go early to the palace.\u201d Cliff mentioned again just in case. Even if the princess didn\u2019t invite Claire, Claire still would have gone as Cliff\u2019s disciple, a status to which no one could object.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Claire responded. Suddenly she remembered something. \u201cMaster, do you have any special wands or anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind do you want?\u201d Cliff blinked as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to give the princess a gift, but I haven\u2019t thought of anything suitable. She must already have many jewels and whatnot.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t show the slightest trace of modesty when revealing her intention.</p><br/><p>Cliff glanced around, thought for a moment, and then suddenly a gorgeous wand appeared in his hand. It was exquisite, with many clear and beautiful jewels inlaid on it, reflecting the light perfectly, looking so pretty and useful. The antique designs on the wand made it look even more mysterious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis really isn\u2019t anything precious, but it\u2019s enough to cajole a young girl who likes pretty things.\u201d Cliff handed the wand to Claire.</p><br/><p>Although Cliff said this, the wand was not a cheap thing. It was just that in Cliff\u2019s eyes, it wasn\u2019t much. After taking it, Claire frowned slightly. She was thinking about how to trick this perverted master into giving her some of his treasures.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Good, I\u2019ll continue on with my stupid experiment.\u201d After sending Claire off, Cliff went up again and immersed himself in an experiment.</p><br/><p>Claire and Jean left the Magician Council and went on the carriage. Claire leaned on the side of the carriage in the back with her eyes closed to rest.</p><br/><p>After the carriage traveled for a while, Claire suddenly opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>Claire looked towards Jean, a flash of coldness in her eyes. Jean\u2019s eyes were also icy.</p><br/><p>The coachman wasn\u2019t going on the right path.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the path back to the Hill castle! Coachmen had to go through a rigorous selection, and were absolutely loyal to the Hill clan. So who else could have commanded the coachman?</p><br/><p>An imperceptible callous smile emerged on Claire\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>That over-pampered, silly girl, seems like the previous beating wasn\u2019t enough for her to learn her lesson.</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s eyes were completely cold. He slowly lifted his head towards Claire and said steadily, \u201cAnything detrimental to you, anything in your way, I will eliminate without any hesitation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire quietly laughed, \u201cEven if it\u2019s the Hill Clan\u2019s second Miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Jean said decisively. His handsome face was as cold as glaciers and his eyes were as frigid and deep as the night sky.</p><br/><p>Claire smiled but didn\u2019t speak and quietly looked at Jean.</p><br/><p>After a while, Claire opened her vermillion red lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then let me see your resolution. Let me see your loyalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the carriage, Claire\u2019s quiet voice was like a demon\u2019s faint sigh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Pulling Claire\u2019s hand, Summer was also sucked in right after.</p><br/><p>Instantly, four people had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Ben humphed coldly, extended his hand, and also disappeared before their eyes.</p><br/><p>Jean didn\u2019t saw a word, walking forward and disappearing voluntarily. Everybody else looked at each other in dismay. Camille shrugged and walked forward in a relaxed manner. Everybody also went right after, all disappearing at the cave\u2019s entrance.</p><br/><p>Just as they were sucked into the barrier, they felt an irresistible force down. The sound of Summer and Qiao Chuxin\u2019s shrieks came.</p><br/><p>Claire was rolling her eyes, completely speechless at whoever had designed the path. It felt like a rollar coaster!</p><br/><p>Sliding down a giant curved slide, specks of ores inlayed in the walls shining like stars, lighting up the cavern. Everyone rapidly slid down one after the other. Summer and Qiao Chuxin\u2019s shrieks could be heard at different intervals. The feeling of weightlessness was very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Finally, everybody slid down in a disoriented manner. After standing steadily with difficulty, they started to size up the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Claire rubbed her sore bottom ungracefully, cursing the person who had set up the barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the treasure?\u201d Summer exclaimed in surprised.</p><br/><p>Everybody looked the direction Summer was looking and saw a tall platform made of white marble, stairs made out of a few layers of the same white marble leading upwards. A sword was sticking out of the white marble platform, an extraordinarily ordinary sword! A complete mismatch with the sparkly, beautiful white jade platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow ordinary. I thought it would be a precious sword completely embedded with gems,\u201d Summer said a little disappointedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would just be flashy and useless,\u201d Li Yuewen said icily. Obviously, Summer\u2019s attitude made her a little angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we find the treasure too easily?\u201d Walter peered at the surroundings skeptically.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you find it or not because the artifact chooses his owner. Even if someone finds it, if they can\u2019t pull him out, then it will just be a decoration and can\u2019t be used,\u201d Li Mingyu explained.</p><br/><p>Claire remembered his past words and understood. The artifact was created by their Li ancestors and only descendents of the Li clan could pull it out. No wonder Li Mingyu was so unhurried, he believed that it was impossible for the artifact to choose anyone besides them Li siblings.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it really looks ordinary.\u201d Ben walked up the the white jade platform and crouched down, looking suspiciously at the sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know!\u201d Claire also went forward and examined it, coldly lecturing Ben, \u201cThe more ordinary something looks, the more enigmatic. Ordinary looking things often make people lose their guards. Biding your time and then making a fatal blow at the right moment can achieve what was previously impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ben frowned as he watched Claire, listening intently to Claire\u2019s teachings, then nodded. \u201cIn other words, making a pretense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrick your enemies, make them think you\u2019re useless, then beat them up viciously. This method is very effective,\u201d Claire continued to teach coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh.\u201d Ben nodded over and over, remembering this exceptionally keenly.</p><br/><p>The two\u2019s teacher and student appearance made everybody look in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu slowly walked forward, watching the ordinary looking sword profoundly. He knew that the sword was definitely not as simple as it looked.</p><br/><p>Just as Li Mingyu approached the treasured blade, a strange situation happened.</p><br/><p>The sword started to vibrate slightly, slowly glowing silver.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen smiled joyously and was relieved. The sword definitely had a consciousness. There was hope for reviving the Li clan!</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu also started to become a bit excited. The treasured blade that he had been looking for was right before his and actually had a reaction towards him approaching!</p><br/><p>Claire stared wide eyed at the scene before her, gasping internally. The artifact really did have a will and could choose its owner! Everybody else also stared unflinchingly and held their breath seeing the scene before them.</p><br/><p>As Li Mingyu came closer, the sword vibrated more intensely and the sword became brighter.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu was completely solemn. He stood before the treasured blade and said in a dignified manner, \u201cPlease reply to my summon. Follow my will, guide the Li clan towards prosperity once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody hadn\u2019t moved their gaze, watching Li Mingyu\u2019s actions closely, fearing they would miss the mysterious moment when the artifact would accept its owner.</p><br/><p>Li Minyu solemnly closed his eyes and slowly extended his hand, setting it on the sword hilt, then pulled with force.</p><br/><p>Instantly, there were infinite rays, striking the soul\u2026\u2026 strange!</p><br/><p>The treasured blade did not move a single inch. It just vibrated and glowed silver as before.</p><br/><p>What? After being shocked for a moment, Li Mingyu pulled forcefully once more.</p><br/><p>The treasured blade did not move a single inch, just as before!</p><br/><p>Everybody blinked, perplexed. Didn\u2019t he already finish making a big show out of it, why hadn\u2019t he pulled it out yet?</p><br/><p>Claire also frowned, looking at Li Mingyu, not understanding exactly what he was doing. What was he doing, just standing there and not pulling out the sword?</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen frowned slightly because with her older brother\u2019s personality, Li Mingyu wouldn\u2019t continue to hesitate and not pull out the sword! An ominous premonition arose in her heart.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu pulled forcefully once more, but the treasured blade was still stuck in the white jade platform as before, not moving at all.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu\u2019s expression finally changed. He slowly let go and said in a low voice, \u201cI can\u2019t pull it out. Yuewen, you try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Everybody gasped in surprise. Li Mingyu actually couldn\u2019t pull the sword out?! The treasured blade actually did not accept Li Mingyu as its owner?! But wasn\u2019t the blade continuously vibrating and lighting up when Li Mingyu was going up? Was it playing around?</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Li Yuewen pointed at her nose and asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. In the Li clan, besides me, you also have the right.\u201d Li Mingyu\u2019s tone was a big complex. The Li clan had already fallen to such an extent and only they two siblings were persisting to support it.</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation before them, Claire and everyone else weren\u2019t able to say a word. They just quietly waited.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen\u2019s expression became conflicted as she slowly walked up to the white jade platform. She slowly extended her hand out, her hand shaking slightly. She hoped she could pull it out, but at the same time, hoped she couldn\u2019t. What did being able to pull it out mean? Did it mean that Elder brother wasn\u2019t as good as her? If she couldn\u2019t pull it out, then how would the Li clan revive? Li Yuewen felt completely conflicted, but in the end, still set her hand on the sword hilt.</p><br/><p>With rapt attention, she pulled!</p><br/><p>The blade did not move an inch.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen let out a sigh of relief in her heart. The treasured blade\u2019s chosen owner wasn\u2019t her!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the cavern fell silent. Everybody glanced at each other, unable to say anything.</p><br/><p>What kind of situation was this?!</p><br/><p>The treasured blade didn\u2019t choose any owner! Both of the Li siblings failed to become the treasured blade\u2019s owner!</p><br/><p>It was deathly silent. There was only the sound of the treasured sword still vibrating.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu and Li Yuewen just stared blankly at the treasured blade at a loss. They had done everything they could and finally found the treasured sword, but now they could only look at it. Nobody else dared to say anything. Seeing the two\u2019s expressions, they all were silent. It seemed unsuitable to console them at this moment.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Claire felt that her foot had even started going to sleep. Then Claire said weakly, \u201cThen, is there a way to dig out the white jade platform and then bring back both the white jade platform and treasured sword back? Perhaps there\u2019s someone else in the Li clan the treasured sword will accept as its owner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu shook his head slowly, his eyes calm. \u201cIf this was possible, someone would have done that long ago. It can only be said that we siblings don\u2019t have enough strength and the treasured sword won\u2019t accept us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen was also listless.</p><br/><p>Instantly, an indescribably dismal mood descended. Nobody knew what to say.</p><br/><p>Seeing Li Yuewen\u2019s listless expression, Claire also started to feel uncomfortable. Although this woman was usually very fierce, there was no way for Claire to dislike her. She wanted to say something to console her, but she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Claire shifted around, her foot had started to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Claire extended her hand unconsciously, just wanting to rest on the sword for a moment.</p><br/><p>An abnormal \u201cbang\u201d sounded, suddenly breaking the silence in the cavern.</p><br/><p>Everybody\u2019s mouths were wide open seeing the scene before them, dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>Claire had fallen on the white jade platform and the ordinary looking treasured sword also fallen next to her too!</p><br/><p>Claire hurriedly got up. Seeing the sword next to her, she hastily picked it up and said frantically, \u201cI only wanted to lean on it for moment, I didn\u2019t mean to. I, I\u2019ll immediately stick it back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I only wanted to lean on it for moment, I didn\u2019t mean to. I, I\u2019ll immediately stick it back\u2026</p><br/><p>Echo, echo\u2026.</p><br/><p>It continued to echo endlessly.</p><br/><p>Holding the treasured sword, Claire\u2019s first reaction was to immediately stick it back.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Claire froze. Cold wind blew past behind her. Claire slowly looked down, stupefied seeing the treasured blade in her hand.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it that only Li clan descendents could pull it out? Was it that you needed that, what was it, resolute will and powerful strength to pull it out? Why was it that it fell over after she just pushed it lightly?</p><br/><p>Claire stood there stiffly, looked back robotically, and saw everybody\u2019s exceptional expressions. Especially Li Yuewen\u2019s, her wide eyes staring straight at the treasured blade in Claire\u2019s grip.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 but wasn\u2019t it that only people from the Li clan could pull it out? The sword has made a mistake. Sh, shouldn\u2019t I stick it back?\u201d Claire asked meekly, seeing Li Yuewen\u2019s oppressive gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe, the treasured sword actually recognized you as its owner!\u201d Summer stuttered, pointing at the sword. Her eyes were full of disbelief and amazement. Everybody else\u2019s minds were blank. They just stared vacantly at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll put it back right now\u2026\u201d Claire said weakly, looking extremely not at fault.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! You stinkin\u2019 brat!\u201d Li Yuewen abruptly grabbed Claire\u2019s collar, forcefully shaking her. \u201cWhat do you think my Li clan\u2019s treasured sword is? You want to stick it back? It actually chose you, chose you as its owner, is there some kind of mistake? What kind of destiny is this?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She was about to go crazy with happiness just thinking about it. She could not wait for tonight\u2019s great show!</p><br/><p>At this time, Claire was gathered with her family in the hall. Katherine was seated with Claire and Lashia each on one side of her. Lashia was happily clinging to Katherine\u2019s hand. Roger watched the joyful mother, feeling satisfaction. Katherine was finally saved. Roger\u2019s gaze shifted to Claire\u2019s face, sighing in his heart. The previous male chaser was now the most brightest star. Even the emperor had to be cautious. Her current strength was too awe inspiring. What was a Sorcerer? Everyone knew. Even though Claire had been rude, the emperor could only turn a blind eye.</p><br/><p>Emery also watched with a serene smile. Claire was actually a Sorcerer! Although happy for Claire, he was slightly sad. He now had no right to be Claire\u2019s master. But he understood very deeply that Claire would respect him forever. He felt his life was complete with such a disciple.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan sat at the highest seat, still worried in his heart. Although Claire had chosen the Hill clan and reached an almost impossible degree of strength, she still broke off relations with the Temple of Light in public. What would the Temple do? They could not do anything currently, but in the future?</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, you have been wronged these past few days.\u201d Claire clasped Katherine\u2019s hand tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Claire, it is you who suffered.\u201d Katherine shook her head, also clasping Claire\u2019s hand tightly. Her face was filled with deep regret and worry. \u201cToday you completely broke off relations with the Temple. I feared this situation the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, you are the person most important to me. Nothing else matters.\u201d Claire smiled faintly, speaking from the depths of her heart.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan sighed continuously. Finally, he said, \u201cContinue your conversation, I am going to go out for some peace and quiet to think of how to deal with our circumstances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, I\u2019m sorry, I caused you trouble,\u201d Claire apologized.</p><br/><p>From then on, the trouble would only increase. It was not just Claire, the entire Hill clan would have to face trouble. Although the Temple would not interfere in politics and face the Hill clan, Claire was a different case. To the Temple, Claire was a traitor who disobeyed the will of the goddess!</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolish child, what are you talking about?\u201d Duke Gordan laughed lovingly, then stood up. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll think of something no matter what we face. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, father.\u201d Roger and Katherine looked at Duke Gordan with gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Grandfather.\u201d Claire smiled, her heart moved.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan smiled kindly, nodding, then left with Emery and others to the study.</p><br/><p>The hall was warm, but the study was the complete opposite. Everyone had a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan sat before the study desk, his browns furrowed into knots. The situation had already developed to such a degree and it was too late to blame anyone. What he needed to do now was figure out how to protect Claire, how to face the Temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmery, Charles, what do you think?\u201d Duke Gordan continued to frowned. Charles was one of Duke Gordan\u2019s trusted subordinates, a warrior, and naturally, a powerful one.</p><br/><p>The two shared a glance, but no one said anything immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmery, speak first.\u201d Duke Gordan nodded towards Emery.</p><br/><p>Emery frowned before saying, \u201cYour grace, our opponent this time is like no other, the Temple of Light. No one has ever publically gone against the Temple of Light, and no one has survived after betraying them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d Duke Gordan frowned even more severely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we cannot win, then we will just hide. Let the Miss hide for some time.\u201d Emery said this true thoughts. He worried more for Claire\u2019s circumstances than anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCharles, what do you think?\u201d Duke Gordan looked at the person who stood calmly next to Emery.</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree with Emery. The balance is about to shatter, so letting the Miss hide is a good suggestion.\u201d Charles nodded. \u201cThe temple would not dare to give chase if the Miss left now, at her level of strength. But if she continues to stay, the Temple will think of ways to make life difficult for the Miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other way.\u201d Duke Gordan sighed, then nodded. \u201cEmery, go make the preparations to send Claire out the city tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your grace.\u201d Emery accepted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCharles, escort them for thirty li, then return. Emery, stay with Claire to Yowusali. The Temple of Light is weakest there.\u201d Duke Gordan was frustrated. With Claire\u2019s current strength, she would be the greatest asset of the Hill clan, but today\u2019s situation occurred. The Temple of Light could tolerate her existence, so what to do? Would she hide forever? At the moment, even Duke Gordan did not know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo prepare now.\u201d DUke Gordan ordered the two to withdraw. Once the two left, he walked to the window and stood there with his hands behind his back, sighing internally.</p><br/><p>The study was silent. Duke Gordan turned around agitatedly, but was met with a pair of profound eyes. Duke Gordan immediately backed away. There was someone actually able to sneak into Hill manor and appear behind him without him knowing. When he saw who it was more clearly, Duke Gordan became even more panicked.</p><br/><p>It was the pope!</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d It was the first time Duke Gordan was shaken. Was the Temple going to take their revenge so quickly? So publically?</p><br/><p>\u201cDuke Gordan, please do not panic. I came here to make a deal with you,\u201d the pope said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Duke Gordan watched him with a measured gaze. No one knew the true strength of the pope. Was the pope here to assassinate him? Duke Gordan immediately dismissed this. If he needed to be assassinated, did the pope himself have to come? There were so many powerful people of the Temple. And assassinating him would not be beneficial. The battle for the throne had already ended. The Temple would continue to act as the religion, while the Hill clan would continue as court counsel.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease instruct no one to enter.\u201d The pope\u2019s expression remained serious.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan frowned. He sensed no killing intent from the pope, so after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he ordered no one to enter. With a flick of his finger, the pope erected a magic barrier, making sure no one could hear them because they go down to business.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you holiness to come yourself, what is the matter?\u201d Duke Gordan continued to be cautious. Of course he would as they were previously enemies. Although the crown prince lost favor and the Temple of Light did not benefit, they did not lose their power. The position of the Temple would not budge and what happened today was like a play, where nothing that happened mattered. The crown prince could not make a return.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came here too make a deal. Of course, you will definitely be satisfied with what I give you.\u201d The pope had an unsettling smile.</p><br/><p>Seeing the pope\u2019s expression, Duke Gordan did not know why, but he felt a sense of expectation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

One is a fierce and uncute girl, the other is our gentle gentle strong Aunt Rui. How are they alike at all?\u201d Li Yuewen retorted, annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir gazes are the same, both so determined.\u201d Li Mingyu\u2019s soft words made Li Yuewen fall silent. The scene of Claire saying I will become strong and her resolute gaze flashed before Li Yuewen\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be waiting ten days?\u201d Li Yuewen asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, letting her go with us and train isn\u2019t bad either. Also, I want to see how Aunt Rui\u2019s child is like.\u201d Li Mingyu said insipidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Li Yuewen humphed, stopped talking, and then went forward.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu smiled and shook his head lightly, following from behind. He couldn\u2019t understand his little sister any better, always having a sharp tongue but soft heart, saying the opposite of what she really meant.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Claire rode the wind leopard to the Magicians\u2019 Guild to find Cliff, because as a Dark Magician, if Walter\u2019s aura wasn\u2019t hidden, then there was no way he could walk out in broad daylight. Also, that guy was someone on the Temple of Light\u2019s wanted list. Walter had been holed up in his room for the past few days, calling it \u2018closed cultivation\u2019 for regaining his power from before.</p><br/><p>Once Claire arrived before the Magicians\u2019 Guild, Jean was already there. Who knew how he had gotten there before her. Only one thing was sure: he hadn\u2019t stopped agonizing over not being by Claire\u2019s side the day she had gotten into danger in the early morning. Now, he followed Claire even more closely. (TL: Stalkers, take note.)</p><br/><p>As she was familiar with the way, Claire made her way easily to Cliff\u2019s laboratory. Just when she arrived, she heard the sounds of Cliff crying out strangely coming from within.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Claire was shocked and didn\u2019t bother knocking the door, charging directly inside, but she saw the room filled with dense smoke. Cliff was currently gesticulating wildly, trying to disperse the thick smoke.</p><br/><p>After getting rid of the smoke, Cliff smiled widely and greeted Claire. \u201cAiya. Claire, you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what are you doing?\u201d Claire asked in confusion, alarmed seeing the messy state of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, Lawrence, that old coot, told me to make some kind small crystal balls that can sense Dark aura.\u201d Cliff shook his head, frustrated. \u201cAfter a long time, I created some small crystal balls that could hide Dark aura, but not the other way around.\u201d Cliff pointed at the messy room, somewhat embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Once she heard this, Claire became happy.\u201cSmall crystal balls that can hide Dark aura?\u201d Truly, she was lucky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. These things are easy to make, but making them sense Dark aura is not easy.\u201d Cliff scratched his head, annoyed. He didn\u2019t know what Lawrence wanted to do. He had only said that some kind of Dark power was infiltrating slowly, eating away influential figures from the inside, but didn\u2019t explain clearly to Cliff what exactly was going on and just told him to create these difficult to make things. Would these be able to find the problem?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Master, are these it?\u201d Claire was looking at a small pile of clearly crystal balls on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, they\u2019re all useless. If you like them, you can take them as ornaments.\u201d Cliff looked at the experimental products, his head tilted, wondering about which step he had messed up on.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay, Master, thank you. I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d Claire took all the crystals on the table without a trace of politeness, about to leave.</p><br/><p>As Claire reached the door, Cliff remembered to ask, \u201cClaire, what were you looking for me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was nothing, I just wanted to see Master for moment and tell you to pay attention to your health.\u201d Claire gave Cliff a brilliant smile, then left.</p><br/><p>Cliff nodded happily, his heart warm. It turns out the always closed off Claire knew to care for her master.</p><br/><p>Claire returned to Camille\u2019s house and knocked on Walter\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>Walter\u2019s delicate and pretty face appeared. Seeing Claire, he was a bit confused. \u201cClaire, what is it so early in the morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan these hide your body\u2019s Dark aura?\u201d Claire fished out a small bag of crystals and handed it to Walter.</p><br/><p>Once Walter looked at it, his eyes widened. He looked at Claire incredulously. \u201cThese, these are perfect concealing crystals? Where did you get so many? Heavens, there\u2019s so many. Do you know how much this bag of crystals costs on the black market?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire frowned, about to snatch it back. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, then give it back. What are you wasting your breath for?\u201d But Claire sighed inwardly. As expected, the occupation of being a magician was very costly. Even the things that were used casually for experiments were so expensive. Then she sighed even more. Cliff really spent money like water.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want it, why wouldn\u2019t I? Now I can go out in the open.\u201d Walter quickly hugged the back closely, then looked up and said happily, \u201cClaire, you treated me so well, is it because you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, a miserable shout reverberated through the house, waking everybody up.</p><br/><p>When everybody looked, the saw Claire expressionlessly walk through the hallway while Walter was holding his head, crouching on the ground, moaning in pain.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Emery came to Camille\u2019s house with golden banknotes. Naturally, it was under Duke Gordan\u2019s orders that he came to bring Claire home.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d Claire looked at Emery, feeling very intimate. He who had done everything he could for her without asking for anything in return held a very important position her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, his grace and his lordship both hope you can return home quickly. Of course, the person who wants you back home the most is me.\u201d Emery laughed. Seeing Claire before him, he felt grateful. His beloved disciple seemed to have improved quite a bit. Soon, she was going to surpass him, her master.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we\u2019ll return home together after the auction.\u201d Clare looked at the smiling Emery. Naturally, she understood that he rarely smiled and only smiled sincerely before her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. His grace said that if you like anything, don\u2019t hesitate to notify me. He gave me a lot of money.\u201d Emery\u2019s voice was a bit pampering.</p><br/><p>Claire smiled without replying. The auction this time didn\u2019t really have any exceptional treasures. The most valuable item had already been stolen by Summer and in her hands.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the night auction didn\u2019t have anything that Claire took a liking to, but she bought a pair of elaborately decorated gloves for Qiao Chuxin to protect her hands when pulling the bow. This made the naive Qiao Chuxin\u2019s heart extremely touched and think that Claire was the best person in the world even more. But it made Summer angry and Walter even more disdainful. If this little devil was considered a good person, then everybody in the world was good!</p><br/><p>After the auction ended, the group returned to the Hill mansion boldly.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Duke Gordan welcomed them personally at the grand hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re back.\u201d Duke Gordan\u2019s gaze landed on the group of people behind Claire. Instantly, his eyes glinted. They were all unordinary people. Claire actually gathered so many powerful people beside her in such a short time. And none of them had walked in front of Claire, all following Claire closely from behind. One could tell that Claire was their leader. Duke Gordan felt a sliver of respect, but didn\u2019t show it. Instead, he welcomed them all warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you\u2019ve returned.\u201d At this moment, Marquis Roger, who had been standing to the side the whole time, finally greeted Claire reluctantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Yes, Father, I\u2019ve returned.\u201d Claire replied, also insipid.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026.\u201d Marquis Roger coughed quietly, then continued unnaturally, \u201cYour birthday is in ten days. At that time, your mother and second brother will also return. You eldest brother is still standing guard at the borders and has not way of returning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Claire said, then looked towards Duke Gordan and sai, \u201cGrandfather, my friends are all tired now. I want to first let them rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Duke Gordan agreed, nodding and smiling.</p><br/><p>Marquis Roger\u2019s expression changed slightly, but he didn\u2019t flare up under Duke Gordan\u2019s warning gaze.</p><br/><p>Only after Claire brought them away to rest and the grand hall had quieted down did Marquis Roger say angrily, \u201cFather, look at Claire\u2019s attitude, completely not treating me like a father. She even brought that mob of completely uneducated people back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger\u2026\u201d Duke Gordan started saying helplessly. \u201cWhen will you learn how to judge people? Do you think that the people following Claire are all uneducated? Who\u2019s to blame for Claire\u2019s attitude towards you? Sigh\u2026 Watch the people Claire brought back well. When the time comes, you\u2019ll take back your words.\u201d Duke Gordan sighed lightly, then walked away slowly, leaving a confused Roger behind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

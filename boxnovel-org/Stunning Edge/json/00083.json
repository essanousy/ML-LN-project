Leave the pearl with me, I\u2019ll study it. If you like anything, buy it.\u201d Claire pulled out a few golden banknotes and handed it to Summer.</p><br/><p>Summer happily accepted them and pulled Qiao Chuxin to buy things. Ben squeezed by, following from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, is something the matter?\u201d Claire wasn\u2019t the only one with sharp senses, Jean also felt something was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this pearl doesn\u2019t seem simple.\u201d Claire played around with the pearl in her hand and suddenly pretended that she almost dropped it. From the corner of her eye, she saw the two golden haired, blue eyed people became a little panicky.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot simple?\u201d Jean looked at the pearl in Claire\u2019s hand, but couldn\u2019t see what was unusual about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon.\u201d Claire watched the two young golden haired, blue eyed people approach speedily, making their way through the crowed. A sliver of a crafty smile appeared on her lips.</p><br/><p>After the blonde man had made his way to Claire, he greeted Claire politely. \u201cGood evening, pretty miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d Claire greeted back casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I may be so presumptuous to ask, miss, are you willing to part with pearl in your hand? We\u2019ll pay you no matter the price.\u201d Evidently, the blond man was anxious, saying these words the moment they had met.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pearl?\u201d Claire played with the pearl casually. She said indifferently, \u201cThe two of you really have foresight. This pearl is a unique one of a kind, a priceless treasure. To part with it, that\u2019s\u2026.that\u2019s hard to decide. And it doesn\u2019t seem suitable to talk about it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blonde woman\u2019s complexion darkened, glaring at Claire. Claire turned to face the woman and smiled without a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then mess, where do you want talk?\u201d The blonde man\u2019s gaze had never left the pearl in Claire\u2019s hand once.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked for so long, yet I still don\u2019t seem to know your names and origins.\u201d Claire said casually.</p><br/><p>The blonde woman seemed to want to say something, but was stopped with a look from the blonde man. Claire saw all this clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Li Mingyu and this is my little sister Li Yuewen.\u201d The blonde man introduced politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Claire. Pleased to meet you.\u201d Claire saw the nearby Li Yuewen\u2019s sharp gaze and laughed inwardly. The woman probably wanted to snatch away the pearl in her hand and leave now.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! Last name Li? Li Mingyu? Claire frowned, rapidly trying to remember the family name and his name. Once she thought of it, her expression changed. Someone from the Li clan! She never would have thought they would appear here. Out of the four great clans of Lagark, Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo\u2019s Feng clan and Shui clan were two of them. The Li clan of the person in front of her was one of them. Only, the Li clan had declined in the past few years. Recently, there were rumors that a new generation had rose and seemed to be trying to revive the Li clan, and Li Mingyu was their leader!</p><br/><p>She never would have thought that such an unremarkable looking pearl would attract the attention of such a person. She had already experienced the skills of the blonde woman. Then, as the elder brother, the blonde man\u2019s power was much higher than the woman\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s find a good place to talk.\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes flashed, a brilliant smile on her face. People who knew Claire well would know that she was scheming again.</p><br/><p>Claire called over Summer and them, then brought the Li siblings to Camille\u2019s home.</p><br/><p>Camille smiled like spring as he made tea for everybody. Claire completely ignored the the killing intent in Camille\u2019s eyes. She knew what it meant clearly: you damn, stinking brat, what do you think my place as, continuously bringing back people.</p><br/><p>\u201cNew leader of the Li clan, talk. What do want with this pearl?\u201d Claire gracefully raised the cup, smiling faintly.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu and Li Yuewen\u2019s expressions changed instantly. But Claire said first, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I trust everybody here. If I wanted to give you trouble, I wouldn\u2019t have brought you back here. Also, I\u2019m met miss Li twice before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you figure it out.\u201d Li Yuewen\u2019s complexion darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour gaze is very unique. Fierce, yet beautiful.\u201d Claire\u2019s reply made Li Yuewen freeze. It was the first time someone had described her gaze like that. But at least it sounded pretty good.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu glanced at the people in the room and twitched a bit. These people seemed to not care about them. The two girls were chatting quietly while looking at all the ornaments displayed on the table, sounding very cheerful. The black clothed man yawned, bored as he leaned on the sofa and watched the two girl\u2019s actions. A young man who looked like a knight stood at the side with his head lowered. The only normal looking person was the beautiful man who was currently placing pasties on the table carefully. Only Claire was paying attention to them!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Li people want to revive their clan and you are so eager to have the pearl in my hand. Are the two related? There\u2019s no way the leader of the new generation, Li Mingyu, would senselessly tour other countries and buy some treasure.\u201d Claire played with the pearl in her hands. The two Li sibling\u2019s stared intently at it. Meanwhile, the Azure Well in Li Mingyu\u2019s bag was vibrating more intensely.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Li Menyu replied solemnly after thinking about it for a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother!\u2019 Li Yuewen called anxiously, trying to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. She\u2019s that person\u2019s\u2026\u201d Li Mingyu didn\u2019t finish what he was about to say. Li Yuewen saw the look in his eyes and sighed, then nodded and didn\u2019t speak any more.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I hope we three can talk in private.\u201d Li Mingyu requested.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. Teacher, I\u2019ll be borrowing your study.\u201d Claire got up and said to Camille, who was arranging pastries. Then she led the two towards the study.</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s crushed the pastry in his hand, then looked up while smiling like a flower. \u201cAlright, no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jean followed from behind and guarded outside the study.</p><br/><p>Claire set up a magic barrier, then sat down. The Li siblings also sat down, the two\u2019s gazes never leaving the pearl in Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pearl in your hand is related to the revival of the Li clan!\u201d The next words Li Mingyu made Claire shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, the pearl in your hand is called the Azure pearl and was originally part of the Azure Ripple.\u201d Li Yuewen pulled out the bronzeware from his bag and presented it to Claire. Claire saw that sure enough, there was a cavity about the same size as the pearl in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Clare looked at the Azure Ripple in Li Mingyu\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Azure Ripple is only a guiding key. Once the Azure Pearl and the Azure Ripple are together, it will indicate where the treasure is. The day we find the treasure is the day the Li clan is revived.\u201d Li Mingyu slowly revealed his plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the treasure? It can revive a whole clan?\u201d Claire was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an artifact, sword\u2026..the Azure Ripple sword. After using much time and effort, our Li ancestors created the sword. When the Li clan was at it\u2019s peak, the sword was hidden so that later generations wouldn\u2019t continuously rely on such power and not progress. But now the Li clan declining, day after day. We need this artifact.\u201d Li Mingyu said truthfully, but it made Claire feel doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter telling me so much, aren\u2019t you afraid that I might try to steal your Azure Ripple then try to find the treasure myself?\u201d Claire said casually.</p><br/><p>Nearby, Liu Yuewen said disdainfully,\u201cYou don\u2019t have the power. I could take your life right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then you wouldn\u2019t be able to even think of leaving this place, not to mention find your artifact and revive your clan.\u201d Claire returned fire indifferently.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen glared at the indifferent Claire, gritting her teeth. This girl wasn\u2019t cute at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you find it, there\u2019s no use. The Azure Ripple sword can only be pulled out with enough strength and the blood of the Li clan. Only when the Azure Ripple Sword has accepted you can you pull it out. It requires willpower, unwavering determination, and someone from the Li clan to pull out the Azure Ripple Sword and use it.\u201d Li Mingyu said without hurry.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Claire became interested. \u201cDo all artifacts have intelligence? Can they choose their owner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, artifacts are unordinary.\u201d Li Mingyu explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can give the Azure Pearl to you, but I have one condition.\u201d Claire said slowly, stroking the pearl in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat condition?\u201d Li Yuewen asked immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go with you and see how the artifact is like. I\u2019ll train along the way.\u201d Claire said quietly, looking at the pearl in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrain? In truth, right now you\u2019re as weak as a little chick.\u201d The nearby Li Yuewen started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will become strong.\u201d Claire said, exceptionally serious. She looked up and stared straight at at Li Yuewen.</p><br/><p>The smile on Li Yuewen\u2019s face froze. Instantly, she was completely lost in Claire\u2019s determined gaze.</p><br/><p>Claire put away the pearl and said indifferently. \u201cAlso, you need to wait ten days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Li Yuewen frowned, displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday in ten days, the first time I\u2019m celebrating it. I don\u2019t like such occasions, but Grandfather has already invited many people. I can\u2019t just leave it behind.\u201d Claire said quietly, sounding somewhat helpless.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu and Li Yuewen glanced at each other and both saw a complex look in the other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Ten days isn\u2019t much. I hope that when the time comes, you\u2019ll respect your promise.\u201d Li Mingyu got up and said bluntly, \u201cTen days later, we\u2019ll be waiting for you at the east gate\u2019s biggest hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Claire nodded and also got up, \u201cI\u2019ll send you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending off the Li siblings, Claire returned to the main hall and saw Summer and Qiao Chuxin were still looking at the small ornaments and couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

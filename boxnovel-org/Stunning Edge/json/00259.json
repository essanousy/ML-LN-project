Fiery red hair fluttered in the wind. There were no ripples in those deep black eyes. Even when he saw the three people at the door, he didn\u2019t show any expression. His tall and straight body just stood there quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you \u2026\u201d Jonathan wanted to ask how the red-haired boy could safely pass through the area, but found his tongue in a knot. He could not speak clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, how could you be so fast?\u201d \u201cStill unharmed?!\u201d Lenny spoke smoothly, but not in a questioning tone.</p><br/><p>When Jonathan had asked that question, Dittos had immediately thought of a person. It was indeed this youth. However, it was much faster than he had expected.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything. She calmly walked past the three people and walked to the stairs behind them. She slowly sat down, closed her eyes and began to rest.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Qi Ao Shuang was behaving in such a manner, Lani\u2019s expression turned slightly cold as he said, \u201cI\u2019m asking you how did you pass through this area so quickly?\u201d Impossible! \u201cDid you cheat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were said with extreme rudeness. There was disbelief in Lenny\u2019s eyes, and a hint of jealousy. He was actually able to pass through this region so quickly! However, Qi Ao Shuang ignored him with a calm expression, continuing to sit there silently.</p><br/><p>When had Lenny ever received such contempt from others? He was furious and even wanted to take action. The first reason was to teach this arrogant guy a lesson. It was to test whether or not he was really cheating.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because you can\u2019t do it doesn\u2019t mean that others can\u2019t.\u201d You\u2019re so sick of jealousy. \u201d A weird voice sounded. Needless to say, this was Jonathan, the schadenfreude. He could speak such vicious words with ease. He didn\u2019t mind exposing any of Lenny\u2019s ugliness to Dittas.</p><br/><p>Lenny\u2019s face instantly swelled up to the point where it was almost the color of a pig\u2019s liver. His fists were clenched so hard that his knuckles turned white. This Jonathan had humiliated himself again and again. And in front of Dittos!</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on passing the second round of examinations.\u201d \u201cI hope you can pass the third round.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not open her eyes, only letting out a few words before continuing to meditate.</p><br/><p>The corner of Lenny\u2019s mouth twitched slightly, and he retracted the words he had just said, slowly releasing his fist. He only looked at Jonathan viciously, with unresolvable viciousness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked at this scene with a faint smile. He was silent, thinking about something.</p><br/><p>He sat down on the side and waited for the other people who passed the examination to come out through the iron door. Lenny saw a faint smile on Dittas\u2019 face, and his eyes were filled with gentleness. He slowly moved closer and sat beside Dittas.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked at the scene with a hint of mockery in his eyes. With a smile on his face, he walked over to Qi Aushuang and sat down beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s your name?\u201d My name is Jonathan. \u201cYou actually crossed that area so quickly. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s something special about it.\u201d Jonathan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not open her eyes, only saying these few words.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang? Jonathan was stunned. Why was this name so feminine? However, it could be said that this kid looked even more beautiful than a woman. In particular, the aura exuding from him was like ice, but also like water.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, which sect are you from?\u201d \u201cWhere are the other disciples of your sect?\u201d Jonathan continued to ask with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tian Dao Sect.\u201d After these three words, Qi Ao Shuang remained silent.</p><br/><p>Jonathan rolled his eyes, embarrassed. This kid had fiery red hair, but he was so cold. His words were as sharp as gold. Even more silent than Dittas.</p><br/><p>Jonathan saw that he could ask no more. Instead, he sat beside Qi Ao Shuang with his eyes closed, resting his mind.</p><br/><p>For a moment, the surroundings were silent.</p><br/><p>Just like that, the night passed by.</p><br/><p>The sun and the moon swapped places, and the day came down on this side of the land.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly opened her eyes, but she could feel that the noisy Jonathan was still sitting beside her.</p><br/><p>Below them, not far down the steps, Dittos and Lenny sat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittas, are you hungry?\u201d Do you want some of the stuff I brought? \u201d Lani\u2019s face, which had always been frosty, broke out in a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I have my own.\u201d Still expressionless, Dylan took out some food from his Space Ring and began to eat.</p><br/><p>Lani was a little embarrassed, but he still picked up the food and started eating. An item like the interspatial ring was rather rare, even in this world. Each of them seemed to have one person. The Star Academy was truly unfathomable.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang watched all of this indifferently, not saying anything as she prepared to take out her own food from her space ring. A hand appeared in front of him, and he handed him a piece of bread.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked towards the direction of the hand and saw Jonathan\u2019s smiling handsome face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat this in the morning.\u201d \u201cAnd this.\u201d Jonathan magically found fruit juice and milk in front of him and Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. She looked at Jonathan\u2019s eyes, but she could only see honesty in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not stand on ceremony as she accepted the bread from Jonathan. Jonathan withdrew his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Jonathan didn\u2019t wait for Qi Ao Shuang to react before snatch the bread back. Then his hand froze and a wave of heat came from his palm. The bread actually emitted a burst of fragrance and a faint heat.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows and took the bread from Jonathan. Jonathan was using fire magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilk or fruit juice?\u201d Then Jonathan pointed to the table in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay.\u201d \u201cJuice.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang almost blurted out the rosetea out of habit, immediately changing the juice on her mouth. Qi Ao Shuang received the fruit juice from Johansson, but her eyes darkened. Rose tea. The man who used to make rosetea for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that woman is funny?\u201d It was a joke to think that one of them was too much of a womanizer, that he had to spend all day with Dittas and keep other women away from Dittas. \u201cVery arrogant.\u201d Jonathan looked at Lenny, who was sitting below them, and said to Xiao Ao Shuang in a low voice, his tone full of mockery. At this time, Lenny was pouring a cup of water and handing it to Dittas, but Dittas didn\u2019t accept it. He took out the water bag himself. Lenny\u2019s hand holding the water paused awkwardly in the air, and only retracted after a while.</p><br/><p>Jonathan almost laughed out loud when he saw this. Seeing this, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face eased up a little. This Jonathan was such a rascal, he built his happiness on the pain of that woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know why I don\u2019t want to sit with them?\u201d Jonathan chewed on his bread and spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded slightly, showing that she understood. The woman\u2019s character did not match her appearance at all. From the very beginning to the questions she\u2019d asked about herself, she\u2019d been conceited and narrow-minded.</p><br/><p>Jonathan was a man who could not bear solitude. No one came out of the metal door during the day, and Jonathan continued to whisper in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s ear. All this nonsense. He explained everything regarding the chaosworld very clearly. Before this, Heaven Breaker had only told her some of the Star Academy\u2019s matters in a hurry, but this world didn\u2019t have the time to explain them in detail. Now, thanks to Jonathan\u2019s blessings, the chaosworld knew everything.</p><br/><p>In this world, there really weren\u2019t any races. There were demons, humans, demons, elves, etc. There is no such thing as a ruler. Four cities stood tall, and one of them was the sky-shattering Heavenly Treasures City. Upon hearing this name, Xiao Ao Shuang immediately understood the meaning behind it. The other three cities were Nine Heavens City, Jade City, and Hurricane City. And in this world, there were nine great sects and countless small sects. The Tian Dao Sect was one of the nine great sects. There were also areas that Jonathan did not know about. For example, the outer sea in the inner sea, which was said to be desolate. Because of the dangerous environment, no one bothered to investigate. Jonathan could not tell what was in the open sea.</p><br/><p>The Star Academy was a place where crouching tigers and hidden dragons. It was a place where the experts of this world cultivated even higher. Every twenty years, the city lords would send people from their own forces to join their own sects before coming to participate in the assessment in order to strengthen their own forces. On the surface, the sects and the cities had nothing to do with each other, but in fact, they were secretly involved. Those who could pass the Star Trial in the Heavenly Pagoda were not ordinary people. Even if it was just passing the first level of the trial, returning to one\u2019s own homeland was still respected and admired by others.</p><br/><p>After listening to all of this, Qi Ao Shuang was very clear in her heart, but she was also shocked by the power and power of the Heaven Shattering Sect. Back then, when he met Heaven Breaker, he was already stunned by his unfathomable strength. There was also the woman he had met at the core of the fire. She seemed to be rather afraid of Ah\u2019Bao after recognizing him. Heaven Breaker truly wasn\u2019t simple \u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, how boring \u2026\u201d Jonathan yawned, hugged his hands behind his head, and mumbled to himself, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what the grand elder is thinking, but he wants us to be his guides.\u201d In the past, it had always been someone else\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked an 8-star student to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiao Ao Shuang heard this, she was slightly startled. This meant that in the past, there had never been anyone with such a high level of strength that could be used as a guide, but this year was an exception. Was there a problem with this?</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, this is not something you and I should deal with. We\u2019ll do our part. \u201d The faint, cold voice of Dittas could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m too lazy to tell you, even if the sky collapses, you\u2019re still a wooden statue with a dead face!\u201d Jonathan spat.</p><br/><p>\u201cJonathan, mind your tone!\u201d When Lenny, that cold beauty, saw Jonathan talking like that, he frowned and was about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d You\u2019re Dittos\u2019s girlfriend? A wife? Or his mother? \u2019 Jonathan\u2019s strange words made Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes flash with a trace of laughter. This sunny and handsome youth was actually so venomous! Once again, he succeeded in making that cold and elegant female so angry that her eyes, ears, ears, ears, and mouth were all covered in smoke.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Lenny\u2019s reaction was annoying. Dittos was obviously a serious person, while Jonathan was a lively and carefree person. However, when Jonathan teased him, he didn\u2019t pay much attention to him. It was obvious that the two of them had a deep friendship. Lenny, on the other hand, wanted to understand, and scolded him with a superior attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Jonathan, don\u2019t think I\u2019m afraid of you! \u2019 Lenny\u2019s expression changed drastically. He stood up and glared at Jonathan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what a joke!\u201d You, third brother for ten thousand years, come ~ ~ With your peacock look, only those bumpkins would chase you around like a flower, in my eyes, you are nothing. Don\u2019t lecture people with your condescending tone. Do you even have the qualifications to teach me a lesson? \u201cWhich trial didn\u2019t you eat dust behind me?\u201d Jonathan\u2019s venomous tongue was fully displayed at this moment. He ignored Lenny\u2019s beautiful face and turned into the color of a pig\u2019s liver. Instead, he scratched his head innocently and said in confusion, \u201cDo you think you are qualified to teach me a lesson just because you are two years older than me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His last sentence almost made Lenny vomit blood. Lenny\u2019s fists under his sleeves were clenched to the point that his knuckles were white. Her beautiful eyes were so wide open that they almost popped out.</p><br/><p>Looking at Lenny who was so angry that he was about to spit out blood, Jonathan didn\u2019t stop. He still got angry and said, \u201cLenny, I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll definitely tell you out of good intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lenny was stunned, not knowing what Jonathan was going to say. Then Jonathan\u2019s next sentence made her brain explode in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWomen, I remind you out of goodwill, are apt to grow old when they get angry. You\u2019re old enough to die if you go on. \u201d Jonathan casually said with a beaming smile.</p><br/><p>This time, no matter how much Lani tried to restrain himself, he couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows and looked at Jonathan, who was smiling mischievously. Her eyes flashed with a strange light. This guy, how interesting!</p><br/><p>Lani let out a delicate shout and with a shake of her hand, a beautiful and luxurious magic staff appeared in her hand. Following which, Qi Ao Shuang felt a chill run down her spine.</p><br/><p>Water!</p><br/><p>Lenny uses water magic.</p><br/><p>The huge water spear formed a whirlpool in the air, and it rushed towards Jonathan with a whistling sound. Naturally, this attack also included Qi Ao Shuang, who was standing beside Jonathan. Clearly, Lenny had done it on purpose.</p><br/><p>Jonathan used fire magic.</p><br/><p>Water and fire were incompatible!</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s face turned cold. His hands moved, but he did not stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The silent Dickens finally spoke slowly.</p><br/><p>The huge water spear stopped in mid-air, and then disappeared abruptly.</p><br/><p>Dotans didn\u2019t even turn around, easily neutralizing Lenny\u2019s attack!</p><br/><p>This person \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang narrowed her eyes as she looked at the back of Dentance, deep in thought.</p><br/><p>Dittos slowly stood up and turned around, but his face was still as calm as before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How unexpected.\u201d Li Yuewen suddenly came back to her senses, smiling radiantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Claire said, a little displeased. This cousin of hers was so talented in many aspects yet completely incompetent at business.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you\u2019re formidable after all,\u201d Li Yuewen praised sincerely. The more she knew about this younger cousin of hers, the more impressed she was.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, has the weapons shop been opened yet? How about the clothing store? Has Camille selected anyone yet?\u201d Claire sat down simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s opened. Many people are paying attention. The first day it opened, there were many orders, all seeking the type of sword showcased at the donating convention. As for the clothing store, just as you instructed, we first sent a set of clothes for the princess and have changed the styles of the month accordingly,\u201d Li Yuewen reported. \u201cThe effects of showcasing at the convention are evident. Camille has also selected a few people who are currently engrossed in work.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Have those old foxes made any movements? Is there any chance of them resisting and fleeing to the Hua clan?\u201d Claire stroked her chin. Of course Claire had the insight to see the possibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Claire, although those old fools don\u2019t use their brains, they are extremely loyal to the clan and will never become traitors. And there has never been any traitors before either. This is the reason why they are so against your mother. Now\u2026\u201d Li Yuewen all sat down. Saying out of the corner of her mouth, \u201cNow they all treat you as a savior and want to approach you and help at the weapon and clothing shop. The old things all want to meet you and talk to you, but you have kept on preventing them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough to let them forge metal.\u201d Claire looked up into the night sky. \u201cCousin Yuewen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm?\u201d Li Yuewen turned to Claire. Unexpectedly, she saw a trace of grief in Claire\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Li Yuewen sensed something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will achieve all of Mother\u2019s dreams. Mother definitely would want to see the Li clan\u2019s revival. But if the Li clan is revived, Lagark\u2019s power will rise. Lagark and Amparkland\u2019s relation will become more and more strained\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Before Claire finished speaking, Li Yuewen interrupted her. \u201cLook at me, Claire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire turned. Facing Li Yuewen\u2019s serious face, she grew puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, even if you said you wanted to go back to the Hill clan, I would not stop you. I will not stop you from doing anything. Of course I hope for your happiness. If the day Lagark and Amparkland become enemies arrives, I will try my best to\u2026\u201d Before Li Yuewen finished speaking, Claire was already smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin Yuewen, I\u2019ve never regretted any of my decisions and I won\u2019t in the future. If that day truly arrives, nothing will matter. I will try to protect the people I care about the most. So, Cousin Yuewen, don\u2019t worry. I will become strong, strong enough to protect everyone.\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes glinted resolutely, her words powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have total faith you will do so.\u201d Li Yuewen stared unflinchingly at Claire. \u201cThe martial arts competition is in two days. Are you prepared? Has there been any changes with the Azure Ripple blade?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stupid sword?\u201d Claire retrieved the Azure Ripple blade from her interspatial ring and twirled it in the palm of her hand casually. \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed anything special about it. How useful is it supposed to be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Stupid sword? Li Yuewen\u2019s mouth twitched. The artifact crafted painstakingly through the Li clan\u2019s blood and sweat was being called a stupid sword?</p><br/><p>Then something strange happened.</p><br/><p>The sword started vibrating in Claire\u2019s hand, as if it were protesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you unsatisfied with my words? I\u2019ve never seen you do anything particularly outstanding.\u201d Claire gave the sword a hard flick, creating a melodious \u201cting\u201d sound.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen was surprised for a brief moment before she started smiling. The Azure Ripple blade had a will afterall, so this behavior could not be considered unusual. But in any case, the sword and Claire seemed like two stubborn little children, one flicking \u201cting\u201ds, the other vibrating more and more intensely.</p><br/><p>As the sword started vibrating more and more furiously, CLaire finally realized something was amiss. The Azure Ripple blade wasn\u2019t protesting, but warning!</p><br/><p>But what was it warning about?</p><br/><p>Claire stood up abruptly and looked into the vast night, frowning as she humphed. \u201cWho is it?\u201d A feeling of unease arose. Who could it be? Who was hiding? Unexpectedly, she couldn\u2019t sense their aura at all. If it weren\u2019t for the sword\u2019s vibrations, she would have been completely unable to sense there was someone hiding.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen\u2019s expression also changed. There was someone hiding in the area? If so, then their power was terrifying. She actually couldn\u2019t sense them at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhooooosh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An attack shot towards Claire with a long, drawn out sound of the air being slashed. Claire lept out of the way lithely. Turning around, she saw a person draped in black hovering in the air. The person\u2019s clothes was wrapped tightly about them. Claire could only feel a penetrating icy gaze. Li Yuewen\u2019s entire body tensed as she stared at the person floating in mid air. She knew that the person before them was powerful, extremely so. She wasn\u2019t their match at all.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Claire to regain her bearings, the person suddenly pounced, brandishing a sword. Claire parried with her own sword.</p><br/><p>With a clang, small sparks flew, melodious and sharp in the quiet night.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Li Yuewen pulled out her dagger, glowering at the person, secretly extremely worried. Their power was indiscernible. What was their purpose in attacking Claire? Were they from the Hua clan? Impossible. Claire had never revealed herself in public. There was no reason for them to assassinate Claire. The Hua clan had no way of knowing Claire had killed Hua Nantian either.</p><br/><p>Claire also had a heavy expression. The opponent\u2019s power had surpassed her anticipations.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want the Li clan to be destroyed, follow me,\u201d the person in black said, their voice muffled. They sheathed their sword, turned around, and flew off.</p><br/><p>Both Li Yuewen and Claire were able to discern from their voice that they were a woman. Although she purposefully deepened her voice, it was obvious she was a woman.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Claire sheathed her sword too. A pair of golden wings extended from her back and she followed after the figure.</p><br/><p>Seeing Claire chasing after the woman, Li Yuewen shouted with worry, \u201cClaire! You stop right there!\u201d but Claire and the woman disappeared into the night. Li Yuewen wanted to chase after them, but understood that it would be to no avail. She hurriedly descended to the lower floors to find Ben. Only Ben would be able to contend with that woman.</p><br/><p>Claire followed the woman closely, understanding one thing. The woman had no malicious intentions. If she wanted to do anything against her or the Li clan, she would have attacked just then. But she purposefully led her outside the city. Why?</p><br/><p>Outside of the city, cold wind blowing.</p><br/><p>The woman finally descended. Claire also stopped.</p><br/><p>Before Claire said anything, with a wave of the woman\u2019s hand, an enormous ice pillar brimming with wild energy shot forth. Although puzzled, Claire did not dare to be careless. With a wave of her hand too, she sent out a flame to parry the attack.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, shards of ice and sparks flew.</p><br/><p>In the air, the flames were extinguished, but a small part of the ice pillar remained intact, shooting at Claire. With another wave of her hand, Claire brandished her sword of flames, slashing through the remains of the ice pillar. The ice pillar instantly disintegrating and the air was filled with a fiery aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cOho?\u201d The woman exclaimed softly, as if surprised by Claire\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Claire was already in front of the woman, about to slash with her sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwish!\u201d With a wave of her hand, an ice sword appeared in the woman\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The two swords clashed in mid air.</p><br/><p>Ice and fire.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the ice sword entered into the flame sword. To be more accurate, it was about to cut Claire\u2019s flame sword in half.</p><br/><p>An inevitable difference in strength.</p><br/><p>Once again, Claire experienced that there were many hidden tigers and dragons in the world who simply chose not to display their strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah!\u201d Claire suddenly uttered in a low voice. Instantly, white flame arrows shot out of the flame sword aimed directly at the woman\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Shocked, the woman instantly applied more pressure, forcing Claire back, then erected an ice shield to block the white flame arrows.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s fingers were numb from the sudden increase in pressure, her hands shaking. She understand that the woman had originally not been serious, but was serious at that instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite flames\u2026\u201d The woman muttered. Suddenly, she emanated a terrifying aura.</p><br/><p>Sensing the abnormality in the ground, Claire\u2019s eyes widened. She shot up into the air. The next moment, a huge field of icicles appeared instantly from where she had been standing moments ago. The sharp icicles glinted viciously under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d the woman shouted. The field of icicles turned alive, spiraling towards Claire crazily.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression changed. \u201cBreak!\u201d Grasping the flame sword tightly, she slashed down fiercely. A golden flame dragon instantly appeared, roaring as it broke through the crazily attacking icicles.</p><br/><p>In that instant, golden light flashed, the sound of shattering in multitudes. Claire exploded with a fiery aura, the air so hot one\u2019s throat would be dry. The icicles were destroyed, glowing from the intense heat before they disintegrated.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

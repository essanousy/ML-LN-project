Because the commander of the Tempest Warriors Regiment was present, the assassination failed. The commander heavily injured the assassin but also suffered serious injuries.\u201d Jean said seriously, his eyes never leaving Claire\u2019s face, trying to read it. But Claire\u2019s expressionless face disappointed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould this have been a top secret?\u201d Claire asked indifferently.</p><br/><p>Jean didn\u2019t say anything but only slightly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you tell me?\u201d The corner of Claire\u2019s mouth lifted into a smirk. Even Gordan didn\u2019t tell her. Firstly, because he didn\u2019t want this matter of the second prince being attacked spreading, and secondly, because he didn\u2019t want Claire to be involved. But, Jean had told her plainly just now, what did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the Claire from before.\u201d Jean\u2019s low voice was certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Claire coldly laughed, and disdainfully lifted her head at Jean. \u201cJean Raymond, I am Claire Hill. The Claire Hill who was reborn. And the person you vowed to guard forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jean lowered his head, his left hand in a fist, heavily striking his chest once making the most formal warrior salutation. His eyes were free of confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow tell me, what was your purpose for letting me know all this?\u201d Although Claire already knew the answer, she still asked indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to see Miss\u2019s reaction.\u201d Jean didn\u2019t try to hide it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and Grandfather both support the second prince. Although Grandfather hasn\u2019t stated his official support, he sent you to secretly help the second prince. Besides being my warrior, what other jobs do you have?\u201d Claire looked mockingly at Jean\u2019s changing expression. Although the successor of the Royal family was supposed to be the crown prince, it seemed this wasn\u2019t really the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, your insight and perception has already surpassed Duke Gordan\u2019s.\u201d Jean\u2019s face and tone were unusually solemn and serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not need your flattering.\u201d Claire replied coldly, even though Jean\u2019s words were definitely not for flattering.</p><br/><p>There was a flash of awkwardness in Jean\u2019s eyes. Of course he knew what Claire wanted to know, but now was not the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I cannot tell my other job right now. I hope you understand that when it is necessary, I will definitely tell you everything. It\u2019s just that right now isn\u2019t the time.\u201d Jean solemnly promised.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then tell me when it\u2019s time.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t linger on this question. She now knew for sure that Jean\u2019s identity definitely wasn\u2019t as simple as it seemed.</p><br/><p>Jean felt incredibly complex as he looked at this young girl with clear eyes. This Miss was the one he pledged to guard for the rest of his life. She had given him surprises again and again. Inside her small body, it seemed like she had limitless power. She had incredible insight, mettle before death, grew at an incredible pace, and had a powerful background. He couldn\u2019t even imagine what heights she would grow to. If she was their enemy\u2026 It was good she was no other than Duke Gordan\u2019s precious granddaughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? Prepare a carriage in the afternoon, I want to go to the best jewelry store. I\u2019m going to first take my afternoon break now.\u201d Claire\u2019s ice cold voice brought Jean back to his senses.</p><br/><p>Jean nodded lightly in response. He understood Claire wanted to make a ring out of the magic beast core and give it to her mother. Looking at Claire\u2019s silhouette disappear at the door, Jean\u2019s feelings were extremely complex. He regretted, yes, he deeply regretted. He regretted not stepping forward bravely that night to protect Claire, now losing her trust.</p><br/><p>After closing the door, Claire lay on the bed and flipped over. Suddenly an annoying voice sounded in her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re too cold toward your guardian knight? I can feel that he is quite loyal towards you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you think I should do, face him while smiling and say, my dear knight, don\u2019t forget to prepare my horse carriage in the afternoon, I\u2019m going out.\u201d Claire answered in a ridiculing manner. Letting Jean stay by her side was already breaking her principle. One time disloyal, always useless. But in this world, she was still too insignificant.</p><br/><p>Walter shivered. He couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like for this little devil to whine. Even if the waterfalls flowed backwards and the skies fell down, this little devil would still not pretend to be cute. If this little devil did whine to someone, then that person would suffer a hundred, a thousand times more than falling into a bottomless hell!</p><br/><p>Walter quieted down. Even though he had no idea what happened between that knight and Claire, he could tell that Claire did not like that knight.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to sleep. One more word and I\u2019ll throw you into the pot for a hot bath.\u201d Such a casual threat already made Walter get rid of all thoughts of talking.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Claire and Jean left for the jewelry store in a carriage.</p><br/><p>The store\u2019s sign, simple but charming, illustrated the characteristic taste of this store. The antiquity of the sign showed that it had long been established.</p><br/><p>Once the carriage stopped, people came out of the store to welcome them. Everyone in the capital knew what a carriage with a rose symbol meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Claire, you haven\u2019t visited in a long time.\u201d The clerk that came out to welcome them had a big smile on his face, an absolutely sordid merchant. The man-crazy Claire Hill was a frequent customer of theirs, but she hadn\u2019t shown up in a long time.</p><br/><p>Claire just merely nodded her head and didn\u2019t speak. This made the clerk slightly uneasy. If it was before, Claire would be hastily asking about new collections. Her reaction today really is weird. But it doesn\u2019t matter, the clerk thought as he solicitously led Claire into the store. After Claire explained what she came for, the clerk led her towards the VIP room on the second floor. He would arrange for the jeweler to discuss the details with Claire. However, just upon reaching the top of the stairs, they met someone that surprised Jean greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d Jean said in a low voice, just about to salute.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for these courtesies. I\u2019m also currently a guest here.\u201d The prince curbed Jean\u2019s salute, smiling. His gaze fell on Claire, followed by astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d Claire slightly curtsied, without a single extra word. In her blurry memory, all Claire remembered of this Prince was him being handsome. And it certainly was true, this young man before her was like Nancy, both possessing handsome appearances. But, this man seemed more mature. The sharp light in his eyes were totally different from unruliness in Nancy\u2019s. One look and Claire knew that he was a calm and collected person.</p><br/><p>The crown prince, Euler, looked at Claire, a little shocked. Is that really the Claire who gave him the impression of being a man-chasing idiot? It\u2019s been so long since he last saw her, and now she gave him a totally different impression. That cold look in her eyes discouraged anyone who wanted to talk to her. She gave everyone a feeling of purity that couldn\u2019t be profaned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Miss Claire, then I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d Euler smiled and moved out of the way for her.</p><br/><p>Claire gracefully but unemotionally curtseyed, then left. Jean followed from behind.</p><br/><p>As Euler watched Claire\u2019s figure disappear, he frowned, puzzled, but didn\u2019t give it much thought and also left.</p><br/><p>Claire sat quietly in the VIP room. The scented tea on the table gave off waves of sweet fragrance. Jean stood behind her, pondering about something.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext week it\u2019s princess Maurice\u2019s birthday, and the crown prince came here to make a custom gift for his sister, nothing more.\u201d Claire\u2019s insipid sentence pointed out Jean\u2019s thoughts. At the same time, Claire became a little agitated. What should she give princess Maurice as a birthday gift?</p><br/><p>After choosing the custom jewelry design, Claire paid the deposit and the jeweler told her to come pick it up in three days. She then left the shop with Jean.</p><br/><p>At the door, Claire suddenly remembered her almost forgotten second master, Cliff the wizard sage. It was time to find him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the Magician Council.\u201d Claire quietly said to the coachman.</p><br/><p>The majestic entrance of the Magician Council was guarded by only two apprentice magicians.</p><br/><p>Although the two\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t be said as respectful, when they saw the neatly dressed Claire they were still polite. Because they were just apprentice magicians and not a true magician yet, they still couldn\u2019t treat a noble too haughtily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat business do you have, miss?\u201d One of the apprentice magicians politely asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Cliff.\u201d Claire emotionlessly replied.</p><br/><p>This made the apprentice magicians frown. You can\u2019t just meet Cliff, a wizard sage, whenever you wanted to. It was obvious that the girl before them was just from some noble family and had perhaps came only to satisfy her curiosity and gaze at the majestic Cliff in reverence. What they didn\u2019t notice was that the girl in front of them called Cliff\u2019s name directly and without the slightest trace of awe.</p><br/><p>Thinking everything through, the two apprentice magicians put on an impatient expression and decided to act on their own. \u201cMaster Cliff isn\u2019t here, he\u2019s traveling.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Claire not understand what the two were thinking and said casually, \u201cFine. Then when he finds out that you guys blocked me outside, bear the consequences yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two apprentice magicians paused, then glanced at each other. They felt the words of the girl in front of them was a bit strange. But if she really was Cliff\u2019s valued guest and they blocked her outside, then they would be finished. Nobody could endure Cliff\u2019s wrath.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019ll go report first.\u201d Finally, the more quick-witted apprentice magician out of the two ran in after saying this sentence.</p><br/><p>Claire also didn\u2019t speak and just quietly stood there.</p><br/><p>Behind her there was the sound of multiple footsteps, as if someone was coming.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d An extremely loathing voice suddenly sounded from behind Claire.</p><br/><p>The voice belonged to Lashia.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Claire didn\u2019t face Feng Yixuan\u2019s revenge, and so, Feng Yixuan disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange, why did that little freak return without taking revenge? Perhaps he had a large hemorrhoid?\u201d Walter was completely puzzled. He also rejoiced that at the time, he didn\u2019t say out loud that he swore that if the guy didn\u2019t come for his revenge, he would have the same last name as the little devil instead. Luckily, he didn\u2019t say it out loud. Fortunately, very fortunately, very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you mumbling about?\u201d Claire\u2019s cold voice suddenly sounded in Walter\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Walter almost cried out in surprise. It can\u2019t be, little devil can hear what he\u2019s thinking? It\u2019s not possible.</p><br/><p>Walter forgot that Claire could infer things based on his Spiritual waves. For example, just now Walter\u2019s Spiritual undulations were a bit \u201cvulgar.\u201d Naturally, this guy was definitely thinking of no good.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, nothing. I was thinking that you\u2019re about to go to school.\u201d Walter giggled.</p><br/><p>Claire coldly snorted. Of course Walter\u2019s words were not trustworthy at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still continuing today? Do you not feel pain? You do this everyday.\u201d Walter watched Claire\u2019s training clothes, and worried for Claire. She became riddled with scars sparring with that rigid faced knight, Jean.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat feels better, pain or death?\u201d Claire coldly asked.</p><br/><p>Walter shivered. That was something that didn\u2019t need to be mentioned. With death, everything is gone, not to mention pain.</p><br/><p>Claire picked up the sword and walked towards the back of the training field with Jean following from behind.</p><br/><p>It was another fierce training day. Walter yawned sleepily. In any case, he wasn\u2019t the person getting hurt, who cares about that little devil fighting.</p><br/><p>The sound of weapons resonated continuously. If it wasn\u2019t for the barrier Claire had put up around the training ground, who knows how many people would have been startled by this fierce battle.</p><br/><p>Walter looked at Claire\u2019s arm and body, both already wounded, blood already soaked through her clothes. Just thinking about it made him sweat. This little devil was too fierce, too vicious. She treated herself unordinarily harsh. That deep and cold gaze, cruel and wild expression, made one unable to watch.</p><br/><p>Jean frowned. Claire\u2019s attacks were completely different from the average warrior, crafty and ferocious, so even he, who was much stronger than Claire, had no choice but be careful when facing her.</p><br/><p>Claire withdrew and Dou Qi burst forth as she brandished the sword at Jean.</p><br/><p>Jean didn\u2019t dare to slack and prepared to block this one strike.</p><br/><p>Who would have known that in the next moment, something unimaginable happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp~~ chirp chirp!\u201d A furry and unknown being abruptly landed directly onto Claire\u2019s face! A speed so fast that the naked eye was completely unable to discern what it was. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say it was faster than the speed of light. That\u2019s why everybody was unable to react in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Jean was extraordinarily worried.</p><br/><p>Claire froze. This small unidentifiable figure, furry yet soft and warm, what was it? What kind of small animal was this? Wrong! Small animals were incapable of entering this barrier without them knowing. The Duke\u2019s castle had also not heard of this kind of small animal before!</p><br/><p>What was it?</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp~ Chirp chirp~\u201d The small furry guy carefully climbed on top of Claire\u2019s head, grabbing her hair tightly and not letting go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Claire frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt, seems, seems to be a small animal.\u201d Jean stared in shock when seeing this animal suddenly appear, staring blankly as it carefully climbed onto Claire\u2019s head, but didn\u2019t dare to go over and pull it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Claire extended her hand to grab the animal on her head. Who would have known that she couldn\u2019t pull it off and instead, the small animal kept its tight grasp on Claire\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>Walter looked in a daze and sized up the little animal who dared to give this authoritarian such a hard time. Furry little ears, furry head, furry paws, furry round body, black and round and big eyes rolling and turning, and a short small tail. It looked like small meatball! He had never seen this kind of small animal before. What was it? Although he didn\u2019t know what it was, Walter\u2019s heart had a feeling. This little guy was so cute! Yes, very, very cute! If as a man he thought it was very cute, then it was needless to say that this small animal would be \u2018lethal\u2019 to women.</p><br/><p>Right now the biggest problem was, such a cute thing had just climbed on top of Claire\u2019s, that little devil\u2019s, head!</p><br/><p>The combination of that little devil\u2019s cold expression and the small animal\u2019s cute shape were completely, absolutely and ironically, a most hilarious scene. He wanted to laugh, but he dared not to.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp~~\u201d That little animal looked down at Claire\u2019s blonde hair, and without any superfluous movements, slid down Claire\u2019s hair, all the way down to her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss! Careful!\u201d Jean was incomparably nervous. This suddenly appearing little animal looked harmless on the surface, but who could promise it didn\u2019t have any evil intentions. And it appeared in such a strange manner!</p><br/><p>Claire frowned. What on earth was this animal? She hadn\u2019t seen this in the Magic Beast Illustrated Handbook or the Shapeshifter Illustrated Handbook.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp~~\u201d Tight when Claire wanted to extend a hand to grab the small animal, her neck suddenly itched. The little guy was actually opening its mouth lightly licking the wound on Claire\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone thought this little magic beast was harmless, Claire felt a burst of dizziness, almost unable to stand, and immediately stabbed the sword into the ground to steady herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire?!\u201d Walter cried out loud nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Jean\u2019s heart panicked. What if that magic beast did something to Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me, let me rest a bit.\u201d Claire\u2019s gaze really was a bit hazy. Damn, a strong binding force actually rushed out of the wound that that little thing licked! Furthermore, it attacked like a squall of a storm. Even though her spiritual force was very strong, right now she found it bit hard to withstand. If it was an average person, they would have already spewed out blood from all their orifices and died.</p><br/><p>This small furball actually forced her into a contract! And it was a master-servant one.</p><br/><p>Although Claire thought about searching for a magic beast or finding a more powerful shapeshifter to contract and become her helper, she didn\u2019t think she would form a contract this way. Also, she didn\u2019t know what this thing was! Because a person could only have a single contract with a magic beast, she would have to cancel her contract before contracting another. Right now, Claire\u2019s first contract was just taken by this unknown little meatball!</p><br/><p>Walter and Jean both watched Claire, who stood there, nervously, motionless, their hearts extremely tense. But at the same time, both didn\u2019t dare to make or sound of move, fearing if making sounds or taking action would land Claire into a bigger predicament.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name, White Emperor.\u201d A solemn and dignified voice faintly came from the distance in Claire\u2019s mind, and then disappeared.</p><br/><p>White Emperor?!!</p><br/><p>Claire was dumbfounded. This sound, could it have come from this small hairball?</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be\u2026</p><br/><p>After who knows how long, Claire\u2019s finger finally twitched. At the same time, her body was already drenched with sweat. Resisting that powerful and supreme power just now had used up too much of her strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you\u2019re alright? Wonderful, you\u2019re alright.\u201d Walter called emotionally.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, what on earth happened?\u201d Jean frowned, looking at the little furball that crouched on Claire\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cI and it formed a contract, and it\u2019s actually a master-servant contract.\u201d Claire brought the small fur ball off her shoulder, and the small furball intimately licked the wound on Claire\u2019s hand. Claire didn\u2019t say out loud, this contracted beast that looked very cute and harmless had forcefully and one sidedly formed a contract!</p><br/><p>Jean and Walter stared dumbfoundedly. Formed a contract?! A master-servant contract?!</p><br/><p>Claire had her own magic beast?</p><br/><p>This little furry, meaty little guy? This cute, harmless, and useless small thing? It could be flicked off with a single finger.</p><br/><p>Also, if other people knew that the miraculous and famous battler Claire had such a cute and harmless little magic beast, then\u2026</p><br/><p>Walter convulsed, fantasizing. The domineering Claire, face full with such a cold expression, yelled loudly, shocking everybody, capturing the gaze of everyone. Then, slowly, a small furry furball climbed on top of her head, waving its furry paws, and chirped. Pft, haha~~~ too funny.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go ask Master what beast this is.\u201d Claire shook her head, still dizzy. She picked up White Emperor and went out of the barrier.</p><br/><p>Claire found Emery inside his laboratory.</p><br/><p>Emery\u2019s eyes widened as he sized up the small furball moving slowly in Claire\u2019s bosom for a long time. He waved his hand helplessly, unable to produce an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you should ask Master Cliff. He should know.\u201d Emery immediately thought of Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Claire nodded, still thinking internally about that short tempered old man who still seemed to be angry, angry that she learned Dou Qi and didn\u2019t tell him. This time when going back, she could also coax him while she was at it. White Emperor slipped out of Claire\u2019s bosom to crouch on her shoulder. This ball of fur was extremely adorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Claire, don\u2019t tell anyone that you and this small thing formed a contract.\u201d Emery told her solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Claire nodded, understanding Emery naturally had his own considerations.</p><br/><p>After changing clothes, Claire brought Jean out of the door onto the carriage, going to the Magician\u2019s Guild.</p><br/><p>After going out of the Duke\u2019s castle, the carriage passed through a few streets. Claire, who was originally recuperating with her eyes closed as she leaned on the wall of the carriage, suddenly opened her eyes and faced Jean\u2019s chilly expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like they are very impetuous. Miss is finally going out the gates. They have been waiting for this and are itching to take action.\u201d Jean sneered, his gaze completely ice-cold.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

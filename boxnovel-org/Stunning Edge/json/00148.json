The god of Darkness had arrived!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you give it a rest? Why do I have to appear so many times?\u201d The god of Darkness\u2019s icy voice carried a hint of anger. As the god of Darkness, appearing two times to help a human was extremely humiliating, so of course he was extremely displeased.</p><br/><p>The pressure was so strong the old man and Xi Shaoqi could not even lift their heads. The words of the god of Darkness left them completely stunned. What did he mean? Who was the god of Darkness talking to?</p><br/><p>But what happened next was even more shocking.</p><br/><p>The girl was able to move now and she humphed coldly. \u201cYou think I want you to? If it weren\u2019t for your followers using the power you gave them, would I need to call you out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man and Xi Shaoqi were utterly dumbfounded. They simply gaped and stared into the sea of darkness, unable to think. The girl was actually talking directly to the god of Darkness!</p><br/><p>Who was she?!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t she a believer of the Temple of Light? How was she able to summon the god of Darkness so easily?</p><br/><p>\u201cTell those pig headed servants of yours not to bother me!\u201d Claire waved offhandedly with annoyance.</p><br/><p>Everything was pitch black. Eerie, deathly silence.</p><br/><p>The old man and Xi Shaoqi gulped, becoming worried. They now understood the relationship between the girl and the god of Darkness was extraordinary. Judging by her tone of voice, the god of Darkness might even take back the power he had awarded them because of her!</p><br/><p>After the long pause, the gloomy voice of the god of Darkness finally sounded from within the heavy darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy followers, remember, from now on, do not touch her. Do all you can to protect her.\u201d There was still a trace of anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou hear that?\u201d Claire humphed scornfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, O\u2019 mighty god of Darkness,\u201d the old man and Xi Shaoqi answered respectfully and fearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse the power I have granted you wisely. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d The old man had a stifled grunt. The god of Darkness had done something to him.</p><br/><p>Before the old man could say anything, the darkness dissipated rapidly.</p><br/><p>The god of Darkness had left.</p><br/><p>Claire cracked her knuckles and stretched. The god of Darkness was extremely annoyed and didn\u2019t want to see her, which was why he had left as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>The old man and Xi Shaoqi watched the girl, who was standing relaxedly, a lazy expression on her face. They were unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, what are you staring for?\u201d Claire walked up to them, humphing. \u201cWhere is this place? Speak. Why did you teleport me here? Where are my other companions?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man still couldn\u2019t register what had happened. At the same time, something new appeared inside his mind. The god of Darkness had just granted him another power.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-who are you? Aren\u2019t you from the Tmple of Light? How are you able to summon our god of Darkness?\u201d Xi Shaoqi asked hurriedly. He felt like he was dreaming; everything that had happened was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Claire took a look at the anxious Xi Shaoqi, then humphed and didn\u2019t answer his question. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what your god of Darkness instructed to do? You all have to protect my safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi was taken aback, then remembered what the god of Darkness had said. He simply stared at Claire, unable to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer my questions. Where is this place? And where are my companions?\u201d Claire snapped. Xi Shaoqi was still in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is the outskirt of the Temple of Darkness, the Illusion Forest,\u201d the old man started to explain. \u201cWe\u2019re underground. We built the Temple of Darkness under this vast land.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so the god of Darkness has his own territory.\u201d Claire glanced around. The old, decaying forest actually had just a pretty name.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Illusion Forest was built with much time and energy. The trees give off an odorless gas that, once breathed on, conjures illusions. The illusions are specially made for believers of the Light,\u201d the old man responded differentially. After seeing Claire\u2019s casual interaction with their god, his attitude was markedly different.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no wonder I saw that stupid goddess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026 your other friends are scattered throughout this forest. But whether or not they can break free\u2026\u201d the old man continued hesitantly. But as members of the Temple of Light, they would most likely never make it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPractically no one has ever broken free from the illusions,\u201d Xi Shaoqi shrugged, ignoring the old man\u2019s warning gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecially for believers of the Light?\u201d Claire frowned, recalling the illusion she saw. Did the others see the same kind of illusion? \u201cWill the others see the goddess of Light ordering them to pray and such?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Those idiots worship the goddess so blindly, they usually are swallowed into the illusions and never come out,\u201d Xi Shaoqi spat scornfully. The old man almost fainted, angered to death by this disciple of his. The girl was definitely special and those people were her companions after all, but Shaoqi had practically condemned them to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so if they fall for the illusion, they\u2019ll never break free? And vice versa?\u201d Claire started the smile. Jean did not believe in the goddess and Leng Lingyun was not stupid either. That Divine Princess\u2026 Claire knew she would also make it out. In the depths of her eyes was malice, not the purity and elegance a true Divine Princess of the Temple of Light should have.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Xi Shaoqi didn\u2019t understand why the girl seemed to have stopped worrying.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Bring me away from this place and get me some flower tea, preferably rugosa rose tea. After my companions make their way out, guide them over. Old man, lead the way,\u201d Claire ordered without hesitation. Now, Claire felt having the god of Darkness on her side wasn\u2019t too bad.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi twitched his lip, not understanding where her confidence came from. How was she so sure her companions would break free of the illusions?</p><br/><p>\u201cOn of my companions is a warrior, brown haired, named Jean. Another has silver hair and violet eyes, Leng Lingyun. When they make their way out, bring them over. Thanks in advance, old man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the elder answered immediately without a second thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, what? Leng Lingyun? Isn\u2019t he the Divine Prince of the Temple of Light? Are you sure he can make it out?\u201d Xi Shaoqi asked in shock. He had thought the name sounded familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Claire replied indifferently, certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll start fighting the moment he sees us, how are we supposed to bring him over?\u201d Xi Shaoqi humphed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Then send them out after they break free. I\u2019ll wait for them at the exit.\u201d Even though Leng Lingyun was no true believer of the goddess of Light, if he met a believer of the god of Darkness, he would definitely fight.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi blinked, confused. He couldn\u2019t believe what he had just heard, that the Divine Prince of Light would be able to walk out of the Illusion Forest on his own. That meant the Divine Prince was going to profane the goddess of Light? How could that be?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Miss, I am a priest of the Temple of Darkness, Bill. May I ask, what is your name, Miss\u2026 ?\u201d The elder asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d she replied indifferently. \u201cFlower tea or rose tea, but old man, I want to drink rose tea.\u201d The elder started to sweat at her fixation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Miss Claire, please follow me.\u201d Bill started to guide her, his tone respectful.</p><br/><p>Claire followed and Xi Shaoqi hurried to catch up.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi approached Claire and asked quietly, \u201cHey, hey, Claire, I\u2019m Xi Shaoqi. How are you able to summon our god of Darkness so easily? Why does our god protect you? Aren\u2019t you a member of the Temple of Light?\u201d Li Shaoqi asked in a rush, acting very familiarly. Right now, curiosity was about to kill the cath. He desperately wanted to know how such an incredible situation had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am a member of the Temple of Light, but I never said I believed in that fake goddess,\u201d Claire replied with annoyance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xi Shaoqi was confused. Could normal people join the Temple of Light whenever they wanted to? Weren\u2019t all members completely brainwashed?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Claire was roped into the Temple of Light later in life, correct?\u201d Bill looked back and said meaningfully. \u201cThat fake goddess tries to rope in anyone who has a bit of talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master is much smarter than you.\u201d Claire\u2019s casual words made Xi Shaoqi\u2019s lip twitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Miss Claire, I too am curious as to how you can summon our god without any offerings.\u201d He had even benefited this time, but it was different. The new power came for free. Last time, they had used generous offerings and the power was intended to spread the influence of the god of Darkness too.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

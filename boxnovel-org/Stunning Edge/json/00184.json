With a flick of her finger, a tiny golden lotus appeared on the tip of her finger. Scarlet wisps swirled around the flower.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey will see whatever I want them to see.\u201d Qi Aoshuang withdrew her hand and the golden lotus dissipated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will give them an illusion?\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded lightly. It was basically true, except what she let the nine holy knights see was not an illusion, but her memories of that day!</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun remained silent, his head down. No one could see his expression.</p><br/><p>The nine knights still had not awakened, but everything they knew was being overturned. After a long time, they finally woke up. All of them collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cIllusion! Everything was an illusion! It was all an illusion crafted by that witch!\u201d Carter was sprawled on the ground, muttering to himself, his gaze unfocused. The scenario that had been replayed repeatedly in his mind must have been an illusion created by the witch!</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain\u2026\u201d the holy knights called out with difficulty.</p><br/><p>Carther turned around and met the gazes of his most trusted companions. He saw that they all had the same vacant look as he.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn illusion\u2026\u201d Carter spat out, but found it was the first time it had been so difficult to convince himself.</p><br/><p>Breaking off relations with the Temple of Light publically and risking it all in order to save her mother, then despicably killing her mother in order to repair relations with the Temple of Light\u2026</p><br/><p>How was that possible!</p><br/><p>Carter sat frozen in place, his heart unable to settle down. The scene that had replayed in his head multiple times had been so cruel, so bloody.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain, it was all an illusion! It was an illusion created by the witch!\u201d one of the holy knights bellowed frantically.</p><br/><p>Carter fell silent, his expression darkening. His pike lay to the side, untouched. Nearby, the bonfire continued to crackle.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t kill us in order to confuse us.\u201d Another holy knight raised a fist angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf her heart was truly faithful to the Temple, then why did she break off relations with the Temple of Light in front of so many people that day?\u201d Carter said slowly with difficulty. Something that had been deeply rooted in his heart for years started to sway for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe broke off relations with the Temple that day, then slaughtered her mother in order to display her loyalty to the Temple of Light\u2026\u201d One of the holy knights started off saying this angrily, but then his voice quieted and died down. His expression also changed. Who would believe such an excuse?</p><br/><p>\u201cSlaughtering her own mother to express goodwill towards the Temple, would the Temple accept this?\u201d Carter asked, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d another holy knight said angrily. \u201cThe Temple would never accept a bastard who would kill their own mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone knows this. Would that girl not know?\u201d Carter\u2019s hand was already starting to shake.</p><br/><p>The other holy knights\u2019 faces paled. Something deep within their hearts started to stir. Something that had remained upright, towering for years, was starting to rumble.</p><br/><p>One of the holy knights\u2019 eyes started to lose focus. He shook his head incredulously, muttering, \u201cNo\u2026 How could it be\u2026\u201d He wanted to convince himself, but found that he could not.</p><br/><p>Every person sat still, their gazes vacant. Wind blew and the bonfire crackled.</p><br/><p>Under the scorching sun, Qi Aoshuang and the others traveled slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, I still don\u2019t understand why you let those holy knights live. What if they chase after us again? Are you going to let them go again?\u201d Xi Shaoqi had never understood. He knew clearly, however, that Qi Aoshuang was definitely not a forgiving person. She was a vengeful person who was not to be provoked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t come,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Won\u2019t come? How is that possible? They are loyal fools of the Temple of Light!\u201d Xi Shaoqi almost jumped up. He thought the Miss was tricking him again.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaosi, on the other hand, frowned. It had already been five days, but the holy knights still hadn\u2019t come yet. With their speed, they should have caught up long ago, but it had been quiet the past few days. Why?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Is that Stone Forest?\u201d The scene before them suddenly caught Xi Shaoqi\u2019s attention. He stopped questioning Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>Before them were huge stone pillars that stood together like a forest. The craggy pillars seem to extend on forever. Many pillars were grotesquely shaped from wind and rain. Whenever the wind blew, an eerie sound would echo throughout the entire forest. Xi Shaoqi shuddered at the creepy scene. He was afraid of these kinds of things the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d Qi Aoshuang stared off into the distance, her gaze cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cA good place to ambush people.\u201d Feng Yixuan shaded his eyes with one hand and squinted into the distance. The complex, amalgamated stone pillars blocked much of their sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Qi Aoshuang dismounted and led her camel forward by the reins.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, Miss, young master Feng even said that it\u2019s a good place for an ambush. You\u2019re still going in?\u201d Xi Shaoqi\u2019s eyes were wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know who else is trying to kill me besides the Temple of Light,\u201d Qi Aoshuang replied lightly.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun did not say anything. They had already dismounted and were following Qi Aoshuang. Xi Shaoqi and Xi Shaosi shared a glance, then also dismounted. The party\u2019s figures disappeared into the forest.</p><br/><p>The grotesquely shaped stone pillars were a breathtaking sight to behold. Although they obstructed much of their sight, as long as they walked in one direction, they would be able to get out.</p><br/><p>In a hidden corner of Stone Forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, the target has entered the perimeter,\u201d someone said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you must help me get back my Rainbow Inkstone,\u201d another voice said, filled with resentment. Evidently, it was the bird nest hair guy who had trapped Qi Aoshuang and the others within the magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! You idiot, if not for your independent actions, would they have been able to take it?\u201d the first voice berated the bird nest hair guy.</p><br/><p>The bird nest hair guy shut up. It was indeed his fault for losing such an important treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeehee, the feast is about to start.\u201d The person the others called boss let out a strange laugh. His teeth clicked together, creating a <i>zeze</i> sound. His blue hair covered half his face. The uncovered half could be considered handsome, but his malevolent smile and sinister gaze left one uncomfortable. His covered half did not have any skin, only reddish flesh. His eyes and, with no lips, his teeth were exposed. He appeared extremely terrifying.</p><br/><p>With a slight wave of the boss\u2019s hand, a figure standing on the tallest pillar suddenly moved. From her elegant figure, you could tell she was a woman. She jumped nimbly from pillar to pillar, agile like a fairy, silently approaching Qi Aoshuang and the others.</p><br/><p>She stopped at what she thought was a safe distance away, then slowly reached for the bow from her back. Squinting, she took aim at the person leading at the front, Qi Aoshuang. Killing this girl was their only objective. They would be rewarded with generous riches.</p><br/><p>Her bow was an enchanted bow imbued with magic that shot out water arrows. She silently shot it at the black haired girl. In mid air, the originally single arrow became two, one after the other. This was her specialty, double arrow attack! Even if one knocked away the first arrow, the second arrow was right behind it! She couldn\u2019t even keep count of how many people had been killed by this attack.</p><br/><p>The female archer watched the magic arrow fly towards the black haired girl\u2019s chest, her lips curling into a smile. The arrows this enchanted bow shot were silent and only had a tiny magic undulation. Whenever the target noticed, it would be too late. After killing this girl, the boss would take care of the lackeys.</p><br/><p>However, the next moment, the female archer\u2019s smile froze.</p><br/><p>Just when the fierce magic arrow was about to hit the girl, it suddenly stopped in its tracks. What happened next almost frightened her stiff. The vicious arrow suddenly shot backwards in the exact path it had come.</p><br/><p>Third brother\u2019s Rainbow Inkstone?! This was the first thought that came to her mind. What was even more terrifying, the black haired girl calmly looked up towards her, then smiled coldly.</p><br/><p>She anticipated it all along? The thought flashed across the female archer\u2019s mind. She struggled slightly as she dodged the her own arrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn ambush!\u201d Xi Shaoqi called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Temple of Light?\u201d Feng Yixuan looked at Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Leng Lingyun shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen they\u2019re with that crazy guy.\u201d Feng Yixuan was certain.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes darkened. She sensed a faint anomaly underfoot.</p><br/><p>The next moment, a skeletal palm erupted from the ground. Gradually, skeletons crawled up from the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cNecromancer!\u201d Xi Shaoqi\u2019s face greened. He hated this kind of stuff the most, but why did he keep running into them recently! The camels started to stomp, wanting to run away. With a gentle wave of Leng Lingyun\u2019s hand, white light poured onto the camels. They quieted down and kneeled, nestling together.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was already on the offense. A translucent wind blade appeared in his hand. He threw it towards his right fiercely.</p><br/><p>The crackling sound of countless skeletons being fractured echoed in the forest.</p><br/><p>However, Feng Yixuan\u2019s target weren\u2019t these, but the person approaching!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

During that period of time, Qi Ao Shuang had already lost her sense of self, and many things had become passive and muddled. But it was different now. Right now, she was the one and only Qi Ao Shuang!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked with a cold look on her face. She didn\u2019t like hearing people say that about Camille. No one.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, God, Mother, is not a husband and wife, but two siblings.\u201d God raped the Mother to have the Camille you\u2019re thinking about, the one who was born of rape, and his mother tried to kill him as soon as he was born. He didn\u2019t get there. He ran. The Mother God cannot bear the perverted love of the Father God, so she must seal herself and disperse her power to die. \u201d Qing Hua\u2019s voice was as cold as ice, bone-chilling cold. Everyone was shocked when they heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t exist at all. No one welcomed him into the world. His existence is a disgrace. \u201d A cold sneer appeared on the corner of Qing Hua\u2019s mouth, but before Xiao Ao Shuang could retort, her face instantly turned cold, \u201cBut such a person, you will not just watch him die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes also shone with a cold light as she stared at the blue and white flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that he has been captured by the Father God, the Father God has drawn out all of his power to awaken the Mother. \u201cOnly I can save him.\u201d Blueflower smiled, but it was filled with a chilling intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d \u201cWhat price do I have to pay?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression did not change as she asked in a deep voice, but her tone was full of determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ao Shuang.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression darkened, and she did not hesitate to stop him. He knew the Goddess\u2019s personality too well. Every time, she would use the thing or person that others cared the most about to deal a fatal blow to the Goddess.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d A cold light flashed in Qing Hua\u2019s eyes, and with a flick of her sleeve, Leng Lingyun was immediately sent flying by a powerful force. She crashed into the big tree behind her before regaining her footing.</p><br/><p>With a poof, Leng Lingyun felt as if his internal organs were on fire and he coughed out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face sank. Looking at the injured Leng Lingyun crying out worriedly, she hurriedly ran forward to help Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d However, Leng Lingyun gave a low shout, and stopped Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s actions. He knew the goddess\u2019 personality very well, and if Xiao Aushuang came over to support him, it would only add fuel to the fire for the goddess.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stopped in her tracks and turned around to face the cold face of Qing Hua, glaring at this cold and powerful woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou woman!\u201d How could Feng Yixuan, with his fiery personality, endure such a cold and arrogant action? He roared and was about to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Leng Lingyun spoke out to stop him, but it was already too late.</p><br/><p>Qing Hua\u2019s expression instantly became extremely ugly to behold. She knitted her eyebrows, clenched her teeth and let out a cold snort. Then, she waved her hand towards Feng Yi Xuan in a hateful manner. In the next moment, Feng Yi Xuan was like a cannonball as he directly smashed towards the huge green tree. With a loud bang, Feng Yi Xuan directly broke the tree\u2019s middle. As for Feng Yi Xuan, he was still unconscious, vomiting blood.</p><br/><p>This time, Qi Ao Shuang did not try to run over to check on Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s injuries. She understood that the more intimate her attitude became with Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun, the angrier the goddess became.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d At this time, Xiao Ao Shuang was surprisingly calm as she asked each and every word clearly.</p><br/><p>While Lily clenched her teeth, Jin Yan patted her shoulder and shook his head, indicating that this matter wasn\u2019t something that they could interfere in. Dittos\u2019 eyes were cold, but he still stood to the side sensibly. It was obvious that he was beginning to understand the whole situation slowly, and Jonathan did not say a word either. He was also well aware that they were absolutely no match for that woman called Qinghua. If this woman wanted to, she could instantly kill everyone present.</p><br/><p>Blue Flower slightly raised her eyebrows, then she suddenly smiled. Her smile was peerlessly beautiful, and it was a bewitching and enchanting smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI helped you save that man. You took the initiative to disappear, completely disappearing.\u201d A cold voice suddenly rang out in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s pupils slightly constricted, but her face didn\u2019t show anything strange. She just stood there quietly, looking at the blue and white flower with a faint smile on her face. Blue Flowers raised her eyebrows, the corners of her mouth curving upwards. She did not say anything, but Qi Ao Shuang understood what was going on. Blueflower asked, whether she would agree or not.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun looked at the two of them nervously, trying to figure out something from their expressions, but she couldn\u2019t find anything out.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang sighed softly in her heart \u2026</p><br/><p>His life was for himself. She was Qi Ao Shuang, not a goddess, she was her! Would she be able to watch Camille die? Is that possible? Impossible. Camille was more important to her than she could have imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang opened her mouth and said one word in a low voice. The light word was firm and heavy.</p><br/><p>Qing Hua silently smiled, a charming smile gradually appearing on her face. Qi Ao Shuang turned around and walked towards Leng Lingyun and Feng Yi Xuan. She walked to the front and slowly squatted down to help the unconscious Feng Yi Xuan up. She turned to look at Leng Lingyun and asked in a low voice, \u201cLingyun, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you promise her?\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression was solemn and anxious. She did not answer Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s question, but asked with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Just promise me one thing I can do. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked down at the unconscious Feng Yi Xuan, wiped the blood from the corner of Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s mouth, then looked up at Leng Lingyun and said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething you can do?\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Leng Lingyun knew that with that person\u2019s personality, things would not be so simple. A strong sense of unease arose from the bottom of her heart, spreading further and further, almost filling Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. If we\u2019re late, that man is dead.\u201d Qing Hua\u2019s cold voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not even glance at Qing Hua. She continued to look down at Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s face. Feng Yi Xuan gradually regained his consciousness. He slowly opened his eyes and met Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s clear eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi Xuan \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked deeply at Feng Yi Xuan and gave a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan gradually came back to his senses and abruptly sat up. He grabbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder and looked her up and down nervously. \u201cYou, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang gently shook her head and smiled as she looked at Feng Yi Xuan. \u201cHow about you? Are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Even though Feng Yixuan was twitching in pain, he still grinned and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up, or you won\u2019t even see the ashes of that man!\u201d Seeing this scene unfold before her eyes, an indescribable fire burned in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang ignored the blue and white flowers and instead said these words to Feng Yi Xuan. He then turned around and looked at Dittos and Jonathan. With some hesitation, he asked, \u201cDo you two still want to follow me all the way here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dittos did not say anything. He merely took a step forward and expressed his attitude. Jonathan shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cYou saw it too. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I\u2019ll just follow this guy.\u201d If he gets hurt or anything, there\u2019s a man to carry him back. \u201d Dittos glanced at Jonathan coldly, but Jonathan rolled his eyes indifferently.</p><br/><p>Blueflower no longer said anything. Instead, she walked to the front by herself, heading towards the east. In that direction, she felt a powerful and pure force flowing. That place was undoubtedly the residence of the Goddess of the Father.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and the rest followed behind. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression was very calm, so calm that it caused the uneasiness in Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart to spread rapidly. Leng Lingyun slowly walked to Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s side, lowering her voice and saying: \u201cAo Shuang, what did you promise her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang only turned her head slightly, looking at the worried Leng Lingyun, and smiled faintly: \u201cIf it were you, I would still agree.\u201d After speaking, Xiao Ao Shuang no longer spoke to Leng Lingyun, and quickly followed behind her.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun stood on the spot, staring at the back of Qi Ao Shuang with a complicated feeling rising in her heart. Pain, emotion, pain, panic \u2026 He looked at Xiao Aushuang with eyes filled with pain and bewilderment, but gradually, his eyes became resolute. As if she made a difficult decision, Leng Lingyun bit her lip and frowned, but still resolutely took a step forward to follow.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan saw all of this. He was no fool. He understood that it was impossible for him to ask Qi Aushuang anything, so he decided to directly ask Leng Lingyun. As he approached Leng Lingyun, Feng Yixuan asked in a low voice, \u201cHey, Leng Lingyun, what exactly happened?\u201d What do you mean by \u2018I won\u2019t agree to it\u2019? What did Ao Shuang promise that witch? \u201cIt\u2019s serious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Feng Yixuan knew that something wasn\u2019t right, but he still couldn\u2019t understand the details.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun only glanced at Feng Yixuan for a moment before he spoke in a low voice, \u201cFeng Yixuan, if you dare to harm Ao Shuang, I will be the first to kill you.\u201d There was a fierce decisiveness and a trace of brutality in his tone, which stunned Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, Leng Lingyun followed without turning his head back, leaving Feng Yixuan stunned. He rubbed his head in confusion as he looked at the departing Leng Lingyun. He cursed in a low voice: \u201cYou lunatic, what did you say?\u201d Even if I hurt myself, I wouldn\u2019t hurt Auland. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you harm Ao Shuang, I will also kill you.\u201d Suddenly, the sinister voice of Dotans rang in Feng Yixuan\u2019s ears. Then, Dotans stepped past him and continued walking forward. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?!\u201d Feng Yixuan was a bit angry. He had tolerated such inexplicable words from this person, but this seemed to be an outsider. What was he trying to do by saying something like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the meaning of it. You\u2019ll understand it very soon.\u201d He continued to walk forward without paying attention to Feng Yixuan\u2019s words. At the same time, Jonathan passed by Feng Yixuan and faintly said, \u201cThat\u2019s the meaning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was completely stunned. Just what were these people trying to express? Unfathomable! As he watched Qi Ao Shuang disappear into the distance, Feng Yi Xuan came back to his senses and hurriedly chased after her. This time, Feng Yixuan fell silent along the way. He lowered his head, thinking about something.</p><br/><p>As they walked on, a beautiful palace appeared before everyone\u2019s eyes very quickly. This palace was grand and generous. It was all made of pure white ore, and it sparkled under the sunlight. All sorts of fresh flowers bloomed here at different times of the year. They fought for their splendor, but from far away, they could already smell the fragrance of the flowers.</p><br/><p>The cyan flowers approached the edges of the flowers, a disdainful sneer on their faces. They put their hands in the air, lowered their heads and closed their eyes, and white rays of light began to bloom on their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a barrier.\u201d Lily stared at the scene in front of her, her heart filled with terror. There was a barrier, but she couldn\u2019t feel it at all. Everyone else had different expressions. Some were shocked, some were shocked, and some looked completely calm. Leng Lingyun looked at this scene expressionlessly. In her eyes, this sort of Spirit Formation was nothing.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bang \u2013 \u2018a loud sound was heard, as if countless glass pieces had been shattered into pieces. It was so loud that it hurt one\u2019s eardrums.</p><br/><p>Under everyone\u2019s astonished gazes, a barrier appeared around the palace. Then, it began to shatter at a speed visible to the naked eye. It was as if it were a gorgeous and enchanting crystal, shining with a demonic light under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>The blue and white flowers began to walk towards the palace gates. After saving the Sin Child, everything came to an end. Red Lotus, White Lotus, you are mine. From the past until now, you are all mine. No one can take them away. Even if it was his other consciousness.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at the huge palace, and without any hesitation, she quickly chased after him. Leng Lingyun looked at the back of Qi Ao Shuang, she wanted to say something but stopped herself. She stood still for a long time, and finally, everyone walked in.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

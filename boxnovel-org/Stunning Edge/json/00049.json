My god! Don\u2019t tell me that abnormal guy wants to take advantage of this bad situation and wants to take revenge personally, not allowing you to die from someone else? This damnable freak, his age is so young but he\u2019s already this abnormal. Over, it\u2019s hopeless! Today, I\u2019m really finished.\u201d Walter started wailing, his spirits so sunken, he was about to collapse. Before the crisis had been resolved, a new problem had appeared.</p><br/><p>Claire silently watched Yixuan Feng who had suddenly appeared in front of her, but she wasn\u2019t frantic at all, because there was no killing intent in Yixuan Feng\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Claire also sighed. As expected, Yixuan Feng\u2019s assassination skills were exceptional, actually appearing this silently and killing off that necromancer. Meanwhile, she was restrained, still trying to think of a way to break freak of her constraints, and didn\u2019t really focus on details in the surroundings, so she didn\u2019t discover Yixuan Feng\u2019s arrival.</p><br/><p>Walter felt Claire wasn\u2019t panicked at all and became more alarmed. \u201cOh, Claire, now aren\u2019t you regretting, at the time you shouldn\u2019t have stepped on their back. Now we\u2019re in luck, I reckon they\u2019ve vowed to chase you to the ends of earth if it means they can kill you. Retribution has come, yes? It\u2019s come as expected?\u201d Walter cried, incomparably miserable.</p><br/><p>Claire watched the face of the handsome young man enlarge as he slowly approached her. Claire\u2019s heart suddenly tightened a bit. Why did she feel that guy\u2019s gaze was a bit strange? A bit passionate? A misperception?</p><br/><p>Walter was still shouting noisily.</p><br/><p>White Emperor crawled out from Claire\u2019s back. From when they were entered the dried up well, this guy had laid closely to Claire\u2019s back and didn\u2019t move. Now he crawled onto Claire\u2019s heard, grabbing Claire\u2019s hair, staring with his large, round eyes at Yixuan Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come back, my woman.\u201d Yixuan Feng approached Claire, lifted Claire\u2019s long hair gently, and kissed it.</p><br/><p>Claire became petrified. Walter was petrified to the point that he couldn\u2019t be any more rigid.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve come back, my woman.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve come back, my woman, I\u2019ve come back, my woman\u2026</p><br/><p>Echo, echo\u2026</p><br/><p>It echoed endlessly in Claire\u2019s and Walter\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Walter felt like a gale started blowing.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt everything in the world was fabricated, everything wasn\u2019t real.</p><br/><p>Everything was fake!!!</p><br/><p>Yes, everything was fake.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng watched Claire with rapt attention, and then frowned, a little unhappy as he said, \u201cOh damn, I can\u2019t undo this restraint!!! Which scum did this to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire was unable to speak, nor able to move. She only staring at Yixuan Feng. Her heart was incessantly confused. Why would Yixuan Feng appear here and save her? Didn\u2019t he go back to his country? Why he appear so timely here? And saying those kinds of shocking words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s first go back to the city.\u201d After saying this, Yixuan Feng reached out, preparing to carry Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes suddenly widened.</p><br/><p>Because behind Yixuan Feng in mid air, a person appeared soundlessly. The person wore a long and wide cloak, but Claire clearly saw their exposed hand already had no flesh! It was only skin and bones, their joints protruding out, nails sharp and slender. His deep eyes were completely filled with anger. That was because his gaze fell onto the corpse behind Yixuan Feng. That corpse had already slowly lost its warmth, and the blood all over the ground had already gradually congealed.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng felt Claire acting strange and abruptly turned around, facing the person floating in mid air.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damnable bastard!\u201d Floating in mid air, Benimo\u2019s anger had reached the skies. It was with much difficulty that he had taken a liking to someone and accepted them as a disciple to run errands as a servant, but today he had actually been killed by someone! And he was killed by such a weak fellow! He had been momentarily careless and a bit far away, and had actually not discovered a person had come close. His only disciple had been killed by an assassin silently!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng frowned slightly. Looking at the person floating in mid air, his expression slowly became serious, because he had felt that person\u2019s cultivation. He definitely wasn\u2019t that person\u2019s match! It was this person who had restrained Claire? No wonder he couldn\u2019t undo it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will cut off your flesh piece by piece and saturate your bones with strong acid. I won\u2019t let you die, and make you see yourself your body slowly being destroyed. In the end, your soul will be imprisoned for all eternity, and make you forever suffer.\u201d Benimo slowly said, viciously and sinisterly. With a slight wave of his hand, Yixuan Feng immediately was unable to move.</p><br/><p>Feeling the same as Claire, Yixuan Feng only felt the surrounding air all become exceptionally heavily, and like his throat was being choked, unable to make a sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst I\u2019ll finish you off, then I\u2019ll slowly enjoy him.\u201d Benimo eerily turned to look at Claire and said, then he released a ball of black death Qi.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes widened. That death Qi could turn someone immediately into bones!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng wanted to speak, wanted to curse at the freakish, damnable old man, but besides his eyes shooting out hatred yet also having a worried gaze, he wasn\u2019t able to do anything. Now Yixuan Feng detested he was so weak! Not only was he unable to protect himself, he couldn\u2019t even save Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh! I\u2019ll * his whole family. I still haven\u2019t gained a body yet! Now I\u2019m going to say goodbye to this world forever. He couldn\u2019t have used any other magic, but he\u2019s actually using decaying death Qi! This scum! Now it\u2019s over, not even dust will be left.\u201d Walter cursed with indignation, then his tone changed. \u201cClaire, truthfully\u2026 Truthfully\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng madly tried to use magic to overcome the his body\u2019s restraints, but like before, there wasn\u2019t any results. He looked helplessly at that ball of black death aura slowly approaching Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire frowned, not saying a word. She was sensing the current position of the small magic bird puppet. Soon, very soon, Master was about to arrive.</p><br/><p>It it was Master, he could definitely easily defeat this terrifying and dangerous person.</p><br/><p>Watching the black death Qi that approached her face, Claire\u2019s heart sunk.</p><br/><p>Was there enough time?</p><br/><p>It seemed like there wasn\u2019t enough\u2026</p><br/><p>Claire closed her eyes slowly, sighing lightly in her heart.</p><br/><p>Everything was settled\u2026</p><br/><p>It was at this time that White Emperor, who was laying on Claire\u2019s head, suddenly stood up, looked at the floating in mid air Benimo and called out, \u201cChirp chirp!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, something unexpected happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cChiiirp.\u201d With one sound, a ray of invisible, terrifying, overbearing power attacked Benimo, directly going through Benimo\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>In a flash, the black death Qi assembled next to Claire\u2019s face dispersed, and then disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Benimo\u2019s body viciously hit the big tree behind him. A clear-cut sound resonated. Nobody knew that with this one attack, all of the bones in Benimo\u2019s body had shattered into shards and all his organs shook into mincemeat. Blood splurted out of Benimo\u2019s mouth, and splashed out over and over and over\u2026</p><br/><p>It was like all of his blood had been spit out.</p><br/><p>Continuously spraying\u2026</p><br/><p>Still spraying\u2026</p><br/><p>Splurting that still hadn\u2019t stopped\u2026</p><br/><p>And then, he died.</p><br/><p>He really died.</p><br/><p>White Emperor instakilled Benimo.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, he had been instakilled like so. The person who had been ranked second most dangerous on the Magician Council\u2019s hit list had been instakilled like this. There wasn\u2019t even a struggle, wasn\u2019t even a cry. He didn\u2019t even have time to say goodbye to the world. He died so gorgeously.</p><br/><p>Claire slowly opened her eyes and stared blanking at the scene in front of her.</p><br/><p>A person floated in front of her.</p><br/><p>Hair like snow, eyes like the moon.</p><br/><p>Snow white clothes, without any color or designs. The snow-like hair lightly fluttered. His delicate and matchless face held a trace of disdain. He turned and stared at Claire.</p><br/><p>Those beautiful eyes were like a vortex, like it was able to attract someone in deeply.</p><br/><p>Claire started at the devastatingly handsome man who was so beautiful he could make one unable to breathe. Was this White Emperor\u2019s true body?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy contracter, grow up quickly.\u201d That solemn and dignified voice sounded again in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>A ray of white light flashed and the handsome white clothed young man disappeared. A furry ball of meat floated in mid air. \u201cChirp chirp -\u201d White Emperor weakly called out twice in a low voice, then closed his eyes and slowly dropped down.</p><br/><p>As Claire hurriedly reached out to catch, she was surprised to discover she could move. That stifling and oppressive feeling already disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp \u2013 \u201d White Emperor started snoring and fell asleep in Claire\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Yixuan Feng was also able to move. He walked over, frowning while looking at the little ball of meat in Claire\u2019s hand, and was incessantly surprised. Just then that flashy pretty boy was this meat ball? It was actually that showy. What kind of thing was this? Magic Beast? Shapeshifter? Phantom? It could actually transform into a human form?! And it could instakill someone he couldn\u2019t beat? It was too humiliating!</p><br/><p>Claire lightly stroked White Emperor, and carefully put White Emperor into the bag she was carrying, then turned to Yixuan Feng and said, \u201cThank you for saving me. Why did you appear here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProtecting my woman is my obligation. Ahahaha.\u201d Yixuan Feng opened his mouth and started madly laughing. After that, he felt a bit resentful. F*ck! In the end, it was actually that furball who did the rescuing! It really felt uncomfortable! This damned furball snatched the limelight!</p><br/><p>Claire frowned slightly. What was Yixuan Feng piping about? What did he mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be, this little guy is actually that supreme?\u201d Walter\u2019s incredulous voice sounded in Claire\u2019s mind. He was still relieved to be alive, patting his chest. \u201cAfter he had been defeated by you, he had actually fallen for you. Although I\u2019ve heard that there are some people in this world who are weird, I never thought I there would be a day I would see that. That said, Claire, what kind of thing is this? It\u2019s actually so powerful, it can transform into a human form? Now it\u2019s sleeping like the dead. Maybe it used up all of its power just now?\u201d Walter voiced out all of his ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you go back to your country?\u201d Claire ignored Walter and instead, she frowned looking at Yixuan Feng who was in front of her and doubtfully asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I just came back.\u201d Yixuan Feng immediately changed the topic from himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Claire, what is your magic beast? It actually can transform into a human form and instakill that f*cking awesome person. Now it turned back into a furball as it\u2019s sleeping. Can it not maintain its human form?\u201d Yixuan Feng glanced around guiltily. There\u2019s no way he would tell Claire how difficult it was to climb over the wall. Just as he climbed over, he actually met Wenmo Shui, that scum, who listened to his old Ma\u2019s command and guarding. And then~ naturally, he took revenge and then stealthily slipped out of the country\u2019s borders. Whenever he thought of Wenmo Shui frozen into a lump of ice over there, Yixuan Feng would secretly feel good. The best thing was, he effortlessly created a sharp icicle, sticking Wenmo Shui\u2019s lump of ice into the air. The sharp part of the icicle aimed at Wenmo Shui\u2019s anus. If Weno Shui\u2019s ice melted, hmph! That would be as perfect as flowers blooming. The two\u2019s power was always evenly matched. Every time they fought, it all depended on the circumstances. Who ever was in a better situation would be the one with the advantage. That day was their 701st battle and also the 351st time Yixuan Feng had won.</p><br/><p>After being silent for a little while, Claire insipidly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of Magic beast he is. When he transformed into a human form today, it was also the first time, I also didn\u2019t know. But, can you help me keep it it a secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, haha!\u201d Yixuan Feng happily said, then turned to look at Benimo, who had died not far away, underneath the tree, and said unhappily, \u201cWho is this? Now he\u2019s dead thoroughly, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a necromancer, the grand wizard Benimo, an extremely dangerous person.\u201d Claire solemnly said, looking at the already cold corpse and frowned.</p><br/><p>Damn his great grandfather! No wonder I couldn\u2019t undo his restraints, he\u2019s actually a necromancer. Yixuan Feng cursed in his heart. But how did Claire provoke a person this strong?</p><br/><p>It was at this time that there was finally some movements in the Darkness. Claire\u2019s magic puppet bird called out and flew out. Closely trailing from behind, Cliff pried a branch away with a crashing sound, looking worried as he appeared before Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Cliff anxiously rushed to Claire, and then vigilantly examined Claire. There\u2019s no wounds, not bad, not bad. Cliff let out a sigh of relief. It was then that he turned and glimpsed Yixuan Feng, who had been standing aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, red haired kid.\u201d Cliff still had an impression of Yixuan Feng, and blurted out straightforwardly, \u201cAren\u2019t you the red haired kid who got stepped on by my disciple that day? What are you doing here? Revenge? I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d After he said this, Cliff was about to make his move.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Claire blocked. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, Master, just then Yixuan feng saved me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Cliff widened his eyes and looked at Yixuan Feng with confusion, his gaze completely filled with distrust.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, it\u2019s true. This person was Benimo\u2019s disciple. Just then, when he wanted to harm me, he was killed by Yixuan Feng. The corpse over there is Benimo.\u201d Claire pointed at the corpse below the tree and said to Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Benimo?\u201d Cliff frowned, his expression changing slightly. Of course he know who Benimo was. That crafty and sly Benimo, they had never crossed paths before. His nose was even better than a dog\u2019s, every time he would hide far away. Now he had actually died? Who killed him? There was no way Claire could kill him with her strength right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho killed him? You?\u201d Cliff turned and looked at Yixuan Feng, then shook his head, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Claire, who killed Benimo?\u201d Cliff immediately asked Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire hesitated, thinking whether or not to tell the true facts and details of what had just happened.</p><br/><p>And then, in a flash, a mishap happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarker than Darkness, an existence more chaotic than primal chaos, my god, I sincerely\u2026\u201d A sinister and familiar voice suddenly sounded amidst the night. It was actually the dead Benimo\u2019s voice! This voice was currently hurriedly chanting a spell!</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick! Quickly block this voice!\u201d Walter suddenly cried out in fear. As a Dark magician, he knew better than anyone what this chant meant.</p><br/><p>Claire looked up at the sky, but where was anything appearing? The air fluttered, quiet.</p><br/><p>Cliff\u2019s expression also changed. He knew this ceremony was a summoning ceremony! Although Benimo had died, he used some kind method to enable his spirit to take a breath and not disappear immediately, summoning something to take revenge against the person who had just killed him.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng alertly watched the surroundings, preparing for action. He suddenly felt a flash of strong unease. This was an assassin\u2019s innate feeling, a frightening intuition. Yixuan Feng was a bit surprised because he had never felt this kind of feeling before, a feeling that made his hair stand on end.</p><br/><p>Cliff pulled out a wand and raised it, aiming somewhere at the sky and chanted. A ray of light directly attacked the air.</p><br/><p>A miserable cry mournfully sounded.</p><br/><p>But then there was insane laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s already over, haha, you group of ants, I will make you pay. Even if I turn to ashes, I will still make you pay. Hahahaha\u2026\u201d The crazy laugh slowly subsided, then disappeared. Evidently, Benimos soul had already been destroyed by Cliff. But everybody heard very clearly Benimo\u2019s insane last words.</p><br/><p>Benimo\u2019s soul had already been destroyed by Cliff, but Cliff was exceptionally serious. His eyes even flashed fear and unease.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, go quickly, quickly leave this place\u2026\u201d Cliff immediately made a sensible decision.</p><br/><p>But everything was over.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the surroundings darkened and the moon of the night sky disappeared. Darkness swooped over, and everything was engulfed by darkness, one by one. If you reached out your hand, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see your five fingers.</p><br/><p>Even though Claire and Yixuan Feng were proficient assassins and trained their eyes to be able to see in the dark, currently they couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><br/><p>They were unable to move. This time, the sudden attacking feeling was even more scary than Benimo restraining them just then, more unbearable.</p><br/><p>Cold sweat emerged from Cliff\u2019s forehead as his heart slowly sunk lower and lower.</p><br/><p>Right now Walter was exceptionally silent, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>But Claire could clearly feel Walter\u2019s spiritual undulations pulsing stronger than ever.</p><br/><p>The surroundings were completely engulfed by Darkness. Suddenly, a vortex appeared in front of the three, like it had ripped the night sky apart, and was gradually expanding more and more.</p><br/><p>A dim, blood-red light slowly emitted from the vortex.</p><br/><p>A never before felt pressure attacked out of nowhere, making them unable to breath, so oppressive their legs started to weaken.</p><br/><p>The cold sweat from Cliff\u2019s forehead already converged into a line, his underclothes already completely soaked from the cold sweat. On this continent there were few people as strong as him. As long as those people didn\u2019t join hands against him, then he could contend against them.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>There was no way for a human to contend against a god!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it? Who was it that disturbed my sleep? Where are the offerings?\u201d An oppressive and sinister voice slowly sounded from the blood-red vortex. Then an indescribably terrifying power pressed down again. That sinister voice made them shudder, made their souls shudder. It leaked out an incomparable power, a strength they had not way of contending with.</p><br/><p>Pfft~~\u201d Both Claire\u2019s and Yixuan Feng\u2019s Qi were smothered at the same time. Unable to bear this kind of tyrannical and terrifying pressure, they spit out blood.</p><br/><p>Cliff\u2019s complexion paled.</p><br/><p>Benimo had actually summoned the god of Darkness!!!</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t prepare any offering!</p><br/><p>The despicable and sinister Benimo had prepared to set them up, summoning the god of Darkness but not preparing any offerings. Then the god of Darkness would angrily crush them, so much that not even their ashes would be left behind. It wasn\u2019t just them, perhaps the Niya city behind them would also be sacrificed!</p><br/><p>God\u2019s pressure, this was a god\u2019s pressure!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng and Claire could not stand stably any more and fell to the floor with a plop. Cliff also wasn\u2019t able to to bear this terrifying pressure. His two feet trembled as he was about to kneel onto the ground.</p><br/><p>What was this? Yixuan Feng laid on the ground and hatefully looked at the figure amidst the blood-red light. What supreme person, fundamentally, it wasn\u2019t human!</p><br/><p>Claire frowned, but she wasn\u2019t able to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, goodbye forever. This is the god of Darkness we believe in. Benimo actually summoned him, but there isn\u2019t any offering. He will take out his anger on us, and destroy us so much that not even dregs will be left behind.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice right now was actually very serene. The god of Darkness was brutal, temperamental, and extremely greedy. Every time he is summoned needs a lot of time and energy to prepare a large amount of offerings. If the offerings don\u2019t satisfy the god of Darkness, the summoner would have brought destruction. That\u2019s why you can count the number of times the god of Darkness has been summoned on one hand. Walter knows that for several thousands of years, it has only happened a few times. Even for that time when a king summoned him, the offering was three thousand virgin souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a god?! It\u2019s a god from this world?</p><br/><p>Claire looked in amazement at the pair of slender and pitch-black eyes amidst the blood-red glow. That was the god of Darkness?</p><br/><p>Cliff started struggling. At least he had to let Claire safely escape. But he had no way of breaking away from this kind of dreadful pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho summoned me? Where are the offerings?\u201d The malicious voice sounded again in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not way to escape?\u201d Claire asked Walter in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no way humans can contend with a god.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice was unusually peaceful. Dying because of the god of death was completely fair.</p><br/><p>Then Walter didn\u2019t say any more and quieted down, peacefully welcoming the arrival of death.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn, the offering is here?\u201d Then, that dim and malicious voice said these words.</p><br/><p>Cliff was shocked, because he saw a ball of Dark red mist that revolved around Claire, moving up and down, like it was sizing up Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d That deep and evil voice was filled with satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m going to accept this offering. But who was it that summoned me? Was it you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, Cliff could move and talk. The god of Darkness removed the pressure on them. Yixuan Feng moved his limbs, alertly watching the Dark red mist circling around Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act without thinking, this is the god of Darkness.\u201d Cliff\u2019s warning sounded in Yixuan Feng\u2019s head. Yixuan Feng was incessantly shocked. Looking at the mass of mist he wasn\u2019t able to say a word. It was actually the god of Darkness! Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t a human. No wonder he was so insanely strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cVenerable god, the person who summoned you wasn\u2019t us, they have already passed away, and she also isn\u2019t the offering.\u201d Cliff cautiously and solemnly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that doesn\u2019t matter. More importantly, I\u2019m really satisfied with this offering. When the time comes, I\u2019ll be taking it.\u201d The deep and malicious voice said, completely ignoring the last words Cliff said.</p><br/><p>Cliff was shocked, still not understanding what those words meant. The Dark red mist flew onto Claire\u2019s hand and instantly disappeared. Then, the black, formless vortex also gradually disappeared, along with the Darkness. The forest from before appeared and the night sky\u2019s moon appeared once more.</p><br/><p>The god of Darkness had already left.</p><br/><p>It just left like that?</p><br/><p>Walter already forgot to reflect on it. The series of events that happened today already thoroughly made him dumbstruck. They were on the verge of death multiple times, but had safely passed them by.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Yixuan Feng couldn\u2019t help but grab Claire\u2019s hand with one swipe and start examining it. Before, that strange mass of Dark red mist disappeared onto Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the back of her hand, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>Cliff hurriedly rushed over. Looking at the back of Claire\u2019s hand, he was also shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of strange thing is this?\u201d Yixuan Feng angrily roared, looking at the back of Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>On the back of Claire\u2019s hand was a design of a circle of six black stars! It seemed like it had grown from Claire\u2019s skin, as if it was natural.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe god of Darkness\u2019s ma, mark\u2026\u201d Walter stuttered after seeing the pattern. \u201cI, I\u2019ve only heard of it, but I\u2019ve never encountered it before! Because it\u2019s only an ancient legend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Claire frowned, looking at the pattern on the back of her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe god of Darkness will, will mark what he thinks is his own treasure. The, the mark is this circling black six star design.\u201d Walter still hadn\u2019t untangled his tongue. The average magic formation was a circle of five stars, gold or silver. For Dark magic, it was a circle of five black stars. There were none that had six. But today, the legendary imprint had appeared on Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Walter didn\u2019t understand. Why was the god of Darkness so satisfied with Claire? Claire was just a little devil. There were many more people who were more evil than her, why did the god of Darkness take a liking to her? He couldn\u2019t understand, couldn\u2019t think it through.</p><br/><p>It was after a long time that Walter finally understood in a flash.</p><br/><p>Auxiliary mark? Claire\u2019s head was about to burst. What did the god of Darkness mean? It still wasn\u2019t the time yet, when the time comes he could come to take his offering? Was he going to take her life?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of weird thing is this!\u201d Yixuan Feng was extremely furious. You didn\u2019t even need to think to know this thing wasn\u2019t something good. Yixuan Feng used his finger to wipe the mark on the back of Claire\u2019s hand, but wasn\u2019t able to wipe it off.</p><br/><p>Cliff\u2019s face was as dark as ash.</p><br/><p>He also knew what this was. The god of Darkness had actually chosen Claire as an offering! Right now he wouldn\u2019t threaten Claire\u2019s life, but\u2026 But what about in the future?!</p><br/><p>There would definitely be a day when the god of Darkness would come to take Claire\u2019s life. He had no way of protecting Claire, no way of protecting his darling disciple.</p><br/><p>Hate! This was the first time Cliff hated that he didn\u2019t have enough. Wizard sage, he had already been a wizard sage for so many years, but had been stuck at a bottleneck the whole time, unable to break through into a sorcerer. If he advanced into a sorcerer, maybe there would be the possibility that he could be able to fight with the god of Darkness for a bit. That was only a possibility!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry. Perhaps the situation isn\u2019t that dire.\u201d Claire quietly said, taking back her hand from Yixuan Feng\u2019s piggy one. The moment Claire saw Cliff\u2019s expression, she understood her Master also knew what the mark\u2019s origin.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2026\u201d Cliff\u2019s gaze was filled with confliction.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I control my own fate.\u201d Claire suddenly gave a bright and confident smile.</p><br/><p>Cliff watched Claire\u2019s smile in a daze and suddenly, an incomparable resolute power welled up in his heart. That\u2019s right, the situation hadn\u2019t gone to that extent yet, why was he so pessimistic? He would definitely work hard to break through and become a sorcerer, definitely protect Claire.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng looked in confusion at the old man\u2019s expression mysteriously change, like an artist\u2019s palette changing color. Just then he was looking so emotional and serious, now he was in glowing spirits.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, Benimo\u2019s bone pagoda is still over there.\u201d Claire pointed into the distance at the white spire and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, who killed Benimo?\u201d Cliff suddenly thought of this problem.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t hide it again, and instead, told all the details.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s that little furball?\u201d Cliff exclaimed in surprise. \u201cLet me see, quickly let me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire pulled the still deeply sleeping White Emperor out of her bag and carefully held him to let Cliff examine them.</p><br/><p>Cliff stroked his chin and carefully examined. Under the moonlight, White Emperor\u2019s sleeping posture was charmingly innocent, his two furry paws hugging his head as he was in a deep sleep.</p><br/><p>Cliff lightly shook his head, still unable to know what on earth this little guy was. But he was sure this little thing was definitely unordinary! It could transform into a human form, so it definitely wasn\u2019t a magic beast, but a high class Shapeshifter or Phantom! But whether it was a Shapeshifter or a Phantom, he didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little guy, right now he doesn\u2019t have any magic undulations. Probably, he can only erupt in power occasionally, and then needs to rest for a while, and can\u2019t maintain its human form.\u201d Cliff analyzed while looking at White Emperor in Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould be.\u201d Claire nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cRed haired guy, how did you appear here?\u201d Cliff turned to Yixuan Feng and said as his train of thought suddenly skipped over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came back to find my woman, is that not allowed?!\u201d Yixuan Feng stuck out his chest and self-righteously said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Chasing after girls?\u201d Once Cliff heard that, his gaze became vulgar. He reached out and grabbed Yixuan Feng\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome, come, little bro, come over here and let\u2019s have a chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s mouth twitched. Looking at vulgar Cliff and Yixuan Feng with their arms around their shoulders chatting while walked towards the bone pagoda, she was speechless.</p><br/><p>Walter clicked his tongue. \u201cLooks like that little freak really suits that old perverted wolf\u2019s tastes.\u201d Walter disdainfully said. Then Walter\u2019s tone changed into worry. \u201cClaire, what are we going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire smiled faintly. Walter\u2019s use of the word we made Claire feel a tiny bit of warmth. She quietly said, \u201cEverything will turn out for the best. Don\u2019t worry, the situation will definitely be resolved. Before the god of darkness comes to find me, I will become strong. Do I seem like a naive person who will wait to be slaughtered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, you definitely aren\u2019t.\u201d Walter immediately nodded, but he was still worried. The opponent was a god, not a human, not some kind of ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Claire stroked the deeply sleeping White Emperor and then cautiously put him back into the bag.</p><br/><p>Cliff and Yixuan Feng plundered the bone pagoda until there was nothing left, then casually destroyed it. When the two people appeared in front of Claire again, their mood was already fairly good. Just watching it made Walter feel disdain.</p><br/><p>And like so, the situation was resolved.</p><br/><p>Niya city\u2019s epidemic was because of the Dark magician Benimo\u2019s doing, but to the brilliant and outstanding wizard sage Cliff, Benimo didn\u2019t count as much, and was killed by Cliff. Cliff\u2019s disciple, miss Claire Hill, and also Niya City\u2019s city lord, aptly discovered the evil Benimo\u2019s tracks and helped Sir Cliff extinguish them. From then on, the epidemic was gone.</p><br/><p>This version of the story spread everywhere in Niya city, from small alleys to big streets. Everybody was praising the city lord and sir Cliff, and of course, the Divine Prince, who had spent magic power to baptize them.</p><br/><p>In the garden, Claire looked at the Yixuan Feng who was sitting on the chair, leisurely drinking tea, and laughing and chatting with Cliff. Her mouth twitched, then straightforwardly asked, \u201cYou, what are you planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay by your side, protect you, create a relationship, then marry you at home.\u201d Yixuan Feng\u2019s words were straightforwardness itself. Hearing it, Cliff beamed with joy and continuously patting Yixuan Feng\u2019s shoulder and praised over and over.</p><br/><p>Looking at Yixuan Feng with his self-righteous expression and the vulgarly laughing Cliff, suddenly Claire felt cold sweat from the back of her head.</p><br/><p>These two were both people who didn\u2019t follow common sense, now that they were ganged up together, they were even more insensible. Amparkland\u2019s and Yixuan Feng\u2019s home country\u2019s relationship were extremely sensitive, and now Yixuan Feng actually wanted to stay here. No matter how you looked at it, it was improper. Would Yixuan Feng\u2019s family allow him to stay here in such danger?</p><br/><p>\u201cYixuan Feng, I\u2019m extremely grateful you saved me. Whenever you need me to help, I will definitely do my utmost to help, but you staying here doesn\u2019t seem proper.\u201d Claire said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will repay me?\u201d Yixuan Feng raised a brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides giving my heart to you.\u201d Naturally, Claire understood what this guy meant to say, immediately blocking the words Yixuan Feng was about to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen forget about it. Just owe me.\u201d Yixuan Feng scratched his hair, then thought for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s right, an outstanding, elegant, handsome, and confident person like me is a bit too eye-catching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy to deal with. Come, come, little guy, I\u2019ll do something. I can dye your hair, and also change your pupil color. This way nobody can recognize you. I\u2019ll change it to whatever you want me to.\u201d Cliff said while laughing.</p><br/><p>The two left with their arms around their shoulders without any shame.</p><br/><p>Claire was speechless. Whose Master was he? Was he helping her, or was he helping Yixuan Feng?</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng\u2019s originally red hair was dyed black, and his originally black eyes were dyed red. Now he wasn\u2019t so conspicuous. Then what made Claire helpless was that Yixuan Feng started to follow her around closely. He came whenever called, sticking to her to protect her, protecting his future wife.</p><br/><p>During the day today, the servants in the main hall were hurriedly bustling around.</p><br/><p>Claire sat on the chair looking at the pile of thank you gifts in the main hall and started to have a headache. How would she deal with these things?</p><br/><p>Also, how was she going to deal with the handsome black haired youth sitting beside he? This guy kept on staying by her, and kept on staring at her.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that the Divine Prince Lingyun Leng walked in. Behind him was the expressionless Jean. Sure enough, he was closely following Lingyun Leng to protect him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Prince, how is your body right now?\u201d Once Claire saw Lingyun Leng\u2019s arrive, she got up to greet him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMuch better. Miss Claire, congratulations, truly. The epidemic has been dealt with.\u201d Lingyun Leng smiled and said insipidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the influence of your highness and my Master, if it wasn\u2019t for you all, how could the the epidemic be so quickly controlled and dealt with?\u201d Claire thanked modestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this was all miss Claire\u2019s own hard work.\u201d Lingyun Leng also politely replied.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you tired? Tch! This damned pretty boy. Walter fidgeted and clicked his tongue. That smile was too fake, too fake. And little devil is truly an awesome person. To this kind of person, she could also give a fake smile.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng still sat indifferent, coldly looking at this so-called Divine Prince.</p><br/><p>Lingyun Leng\u2019s gaze fell onto Yixuan Feng. His eyes flashed with surprise, and then his expression went back to normal.</p><br/><p>The gaze of the two locked. Suddenly, the atmosphere suddenly became complex, but then it disappeared, gradually becoming calm.</p><br/><p>The next thing to do was restore Niya city\u2019s economy. Claire started pondering, thinking of the many things she had to do next.</p><br/><p>Then, Heath, the representative of Niya City, quickly walked in. After seeing Claire, he gave a slight bow, then said, \u201cReporting to the city lord, the Divine Princess has arrived\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Temple of Light\u2019s Divine Princess? The woman who rumors said was as beautiful and benevolent as an angel? She had a big influence on the masses, and was adored by many commoners, and was the dream lover of even more nobles. But these people could only think about it secretly. The noble and pure Divine Princess wasn\u2019t someone who could be profaned.</p><br/><p>What was this kind of noble person doing in the small Niya city?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t the Pope only send the Divine Prince to aide with containing the epidemic?</p><br/><p>Before Heath finished speaking, footsteps sounded at the door.</p><br/><p>A lovely figure appeared at the door\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She handed it to Cliff, \u201cDo you remember this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff suddenly lost his composure and stood up. He looked excitedly at the necklace, snatching it and asked urgently, \u201cWhere did you get this from? Why is it in your hands?\u201d Cliff was so excited that his entire body was trembling, and his face was flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a beautiful elf who told me that her heart would always belong to a man named Cliff, and that she would never get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff\u2019s hands trembled as he held the necklace. He sat down and stared at it in silence.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang waited quietly.</p><br/><p>The room was silent. Cliff\u2019s eyes were filled with sadness, as if he could see the distant past. After a while, two tears rolled out of his eyes and dripped onto the necklace in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMona\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff called out faintly, full of yearning and longing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, Mona misses you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff took a deep breath, \u201cHow is she doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is okay, except for the pain of love. I gave the three gifts you gave me as a souvenir to her. She was very happy when she heard that you did it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas she?\u201d Cliff\u2019s expression was extremely complicated, full of joy, worry, and sadness.</p><br/><p>The room fell silent once more.</p><br/><p>Cliff didn\u2019t saying anything, and Qi Aoshuang did not disturb him anymore.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Cliff looked up at Aoshuang, \u201cThank you, thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thanking me for? This is what I should do. Master, why are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh!\u201d \u201cCliff finally understood and his face darkened slightly, \u201cThis time, I know you\u2019ll be in a direct confrontation with the Radiant Temple. I also know that your strength is no longer what it used to be. I just want you to promise me one thing. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Xiao Aoshuang could not help but be puzzled as she looked at Cliff\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you meet Raul, I hope you will let him live. Even though he lied to me, making me lose my chance to rescue you, but he is my only friend after all. I don\u2019t want\u2026\u2026\u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you don\u2019t have to say that.\u201d Before Cliff could finish his words, Qi Aoshuang interrupted him, \u201cActually, Master Raul cares about you. He only cares about you because he doesn\u2019t want you to get involved in this. He doesn\u2019t want you to become enemies with the Radiant Temple, and doesn\u2019t want you to suffer any harm. I think he thought of the consequences before he lied to you. After all, he\u2019s the one who knows you best. However, he still chose to do so. You can see how sincere he is towards you!\u201d Qi Aoshuang said slowly.</p><br/><p>Cliff\u2019s expression was unsettled. Finally, he let out a long sigh, \u201cEven so, I still can\u2019t forgive him immediately. Let\u2019s just let time smooth things out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Master, I understand you. Don\u2019t worry, I will not let anyone harm Master Raul. You\u2019d better go rest now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff stood up, looking very tired. He nodded slightly and said, \u201cEn, you rest well, too. There are a lot of things you need to do. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, Master, don\u2019t worry. I will take care of it.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sent Cliff off.</p><br/><p>Two days later, the dragons went on a tour of Ragka under the guidance of Ben.</p><br/><p>The wind blew wildly, standing on the back of the Black Dragon, Qi Aoshuang stared ahead, her thoughts complex. Everything that had happened in the past appeared as if they happened just yesterday, the tragic death of Master Uri, the disappearance of his mother\u2026</p><br/><p>Black Feather and White Emperor stood quietly behind Qi Aoshuang, while the Treasure Cat hid in her arms. Leng Lingyun also stood at the back, looking at her silently.</p><br/><p>When a large group of dragons arrived at Ragka, it caused a huge sensation. However, the crowd didn\u2019t panic. Feng Yixuan and his group had already arranged everything beforehand. They naturally garnered the attention of the Radiant Temple. The huge dragons descended and rested around the capital of Ragka. The Black Dragon took human form and descended with the others, preparing to enter the city. Feng Yi Xuan and his group were already waiting outside to welcome them.</p><br/><p>The people of the Radiant Temple rushed over as fast as they could.</p><br/><p>The archbishop, who wore a white robe, appeared in front of everyone in a split-second, along with two Winged Angels and an Eight-winged Angel.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon King! You brought so many dragons into the human territory! What do you want? Have you forgotten the agreement between the Dragon God and our great Goddess of Light?\u201d The leading Eight-winged Angel shouted angrily at the Black Dragon.</p><br/><p>The response he got was a sharp and terrifying force. The powerful force directly struck his chest, and in an instant, the Eight-winged Angel hurriedly retreated a few steps back, spitting out a mouthful of blood. Two Winged angels behind him quickly moved to support him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2014!\u201d The Eight-winged Angel\u2019s face was pale white, and he stretched out his hand to point at the Black Dragon in disbelief. He could not believe that he would actually dare to openly attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are? A lowly angel dares to point fingers at me?!\u201d The Black Dragon let out an arrogant sneer and said disdainfully, \u201cRemember your identity, you\u2019re just one of the many lackeys by the side of the Goddess of Light. As for me, I am the noble Dragon King. Be careful when you talk to me. Otherwise, it would only make people laugh at the disrespect of the Goddess\u2019 men, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind the Black Dragon, the crowd burst into laughter. Qi Aoshuang also couldn\u2019t help but smile. The impulsive, simple-minded fellow no longer existed. Now he was a shrewd and shameless guy. Summer covered her mouth and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d After regaining his footing, the Eight-winged Angel was furious, but he still understood that he was no match for the Dragon King. After exhaling a long breath, his tone became extremely courteous, \u201cYour Majesty, may I ask why you are bringing the dragons here at this time? The Dragon God and the Goddess of Light had an agreement. The dragon race could not easily act against humans and their cities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you human?\u201d Ben sneered, \u201cYou aren\u2019t human at all, I only attacked you to teach you how to be courteous.\u201d When did I break the agreement? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. A birdman.\u201d Summer whispered. This nickname was taught by Qi Aoshuang. She thought it was appropriate indeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Lowly human, it\u2019s not up to you to talk here!\u201d The Winged-Angel behind the Eight-winged Angel let out an angry curse and was about to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d The Black Dragon let out a cold shout, and an even more terrifying force struck at the Winged Angel, causing it to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon King! Why are you doing this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang and the rest of the group were ready for the show.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen up, first of all, I didn\u2019t violate the agreement between the Dragon God and the Goddess of Light. Our dragon race has only come here for sightseeing. When have you ever seen our dragons attack a human or a human city? Instead, it is you who are truly untruthful. You said you are always the protectors of humanity. But you are treating them as ants. As for that bird man behind you, he insulted my fiancee, so I taught him a lesson. I could have taken his life.\u201d He held Summer in his arms</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned, including Qi Aoshuang and Shui Wenmo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I become your fiancee?\u201d Summer whispered, but did not break away from Ben\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d The Black Dragon laughed, making Summer even tighter.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang sighed in her heart, with both happiness and sorrow. He finally punctured this layer of paper, and from the reactions of Summer, it seemed that she did not hate the Black Dragon, perhaps she still liked him. However, he is a dragon while she is a human girl. Can they get married?</p><br/><p>Shui Wenmo\u2019s eyes were full of pain. He stared straight at Ben and Summer. His fists clenched tightly, his fingernails sinking deep into the flesh. Blood flowed through the gaps between his fingers, dripping onto the ground, but he did not feel any pain at all. Suddenly, a hand gently placed on his shoulder. Shui Wenmo turned around and saw Feng Yixuan\u2019s worried face. He lowered his head in silence and did not say another word. The love had already ended so suddenly without even a start.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

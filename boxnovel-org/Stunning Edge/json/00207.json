A strange feeling that she did not understand arose in her heart as she stared at him blankly.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun narrowed his eyes, not saying anything.</p><br/><p>Jean stood before them.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang lowered her head, silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I\u2019ve returned\u2026\u201d His voice was drawn out, as if filled with too many emotions. Jean knelt down on one knee, his right fist clenched before his left chest. It was the most formal knight bow.</p><br/><p>A thousand words could not contain the meaning of these words.</p><br/><p>Miss, I\u2019ve returned\u2026</p><br/><p>While Ben was spewing angry fire, they were silent.</p><br/><p>With her head lowered, Qi Aoshuang watched as he kneeled. Jean gave Qi Aoshuang a deep, long look.</p><br/><p>The two peered into each other\u2019s eyes silently. Neither moved nor spoke.</p><br/><p>Finally, Qi Aoshuang lowered her gaze.</p><br/><p>Jean silently watched her, still kneeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve returned\u2026\u201d Qi Aoshuang broke into a bright smile, her voice quiet and gentle.</p><br/><p>Jean slowly stood up. He stared profoundly at the person he had been chasing after all this time. Gradually, his handsome face also revealed a smile. He nodded. \u201cYes. Miss, I\u2019ve returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeep peep!\u201d</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather called out intimately, shooting out of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s cloak like little cannonballs into Jean\u2019s embrace. Of the people Qi Aoshuang was friends with, White Emperor and Black Feather like Jean the most. Now that they saw Jean, they were naturally excited.</p><br/><p>Before they finished their reunion, Ben was finished with his fight. They had all died a dog\u2019s death unjustly. They originally came after her, but before they could even get a glimpse of her, not to mention attack her, they were wiped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Jean, how did you find us?\u201d Ben smiled contently, rotating his shoulder relaxedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard what happened to Miss and had been searching for her ever since. Later, I heard that the Temple had stationed many people here, so I came. Because you were there, I predicted Miss would come to find you,\u201d Jean explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026 not bad! You\u2019re pretty smart. I remember you were one of the Hill clan\u2019s people. Have you not thought of returning with her head?\u201d Ben narrowed his eyes, his eyes glinting with an imperceivable cold light. If Jean\u2019s response was unsatisfactory in anyway, he would strike.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said long ago that the Miss is my religion. No matter what she has down, I will stand at her side. Even if everything the Temple of Light claims is true.\u201d Jean spoke faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Ben raised a brow, his eyes narrowed. \u201cYou really believe in your Miss? Although, right now, she is not a Miss any more. Her name is now Qi Aoshuang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Aoshuang?\u201d Jean paused slightly, murmuring the complex characters to himself, then looked at Qi Aoshuang resolutely. \u201cI believe in Miss, I always have. I don\u2019t need an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Jean\u2019s staunch gaze, Qi Aoshuang\u2019s heart warmed. Originally, Jean was one of Duke Gordon\u2019s people, but now, he chose to stand at her side unwaveringly\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d Qi Aoshuang said softly. It was all she could say.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that you mount?\u201d Suddenly, Ben shot a vicious glare at Vermillion, who was trembling slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jean nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t be such a bully.\u201d Qi Aoshuang knew that Ben hated dragons who accepted humans as masters. Although he could allow Qi Aoshuang to ride him, they were two different matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over here!\u201d Ben coldly ordered. Vermillion was still sprawled on the ground.</p><br/><p>She shuddered, her eyes flashing. Then, she transformed into a girl in red clothes and walked over shyly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just became an adult?\u201d Ben watched Vermillion with narrowed eyes. She watched his frightfully.</p><br/><p>Vermillion nodded, not daring to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what I am?\u201d Ben said coldly.</p><br/><p>Vermillion shook her head hesitantly. She knew that the young man with black hair before her was a dragon, a dragon many times more powerful than her, but she did not know who he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Ben, stop being so mean..\u201d Qi Aoshuang tried to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Dragon King. In the future, you will be our mount.\u201d Because Ben heard Qi Aoshuang speak, his tone softened a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Vermillion froze, staring at Ben, both terrified and amazed. Dragon King! The Dragon King was with that woman! Vermillion glanced at Jean, but saw that Jean\u2019s gaze had never left Qi Aoshuang. Her heart started to dim. Master forever only had that woman in his heart. Vermillion pouted, lowering her head. She said to Ben deferentially, \u201cYes, your highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVermillion has grown up outside of Dragon Valley. When I found her, she still had not hatched from her egg,\u201d Jean interceded.</p><br/><p>Ben frowned. Qi Aoshuang naturally understood what he meant, adding, \u201cSo Vermillion did not destroy the honor of the dragon clan when she became Jean\u2019s mount, understand, Ben? In the future, don\u2019t be so mean to her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Ben gritted his teeth and said reluctantly.</p><br/><p>Vermillion lowered her head, her eyes filled with unwillingness and humiliation. That woman was speaking up for her! Unacceptable! Unacceptable! But no one noticed this.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Jean, guess who this ugly man is.\u201d Ben was now smiling boyishly. He pointed at Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>But contrary to his expectations, Jean replied calmly, \u201cHis divine highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Ben curled his lip with dissatisfaction. This boring fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not the Divine Prince any more.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the princeling of the elves, Oscar,\u201d Ben introduced. \u201cOScar, this is Qi Aoshuang\u2019s knight, Jean.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two nodded in greeting without a word. Oscar did was not disrespectful now. The man before him had a dragon as a mount, but was this woman\u2019s knight! How many secrets did this woman have?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, where do we go to next? We should not stay here for long.\u201d Jean turned around, looking pointedly at the disastrous leftovers of Ben\u2019s fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were planning finding the goblins.\u201d Qi Aoshuang frowned at the dreary landscape. \u201cLet\u2019s first leave this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, why are you looking for the goblins?\u201d Jean did not understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want their deity relic. It is a part of the God Feather,\u201d Qi Aoshuang replied faintly. \u201cWith the Heaven Slayer, we can kill the goddess of Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand now.\u201d Jean nodded, then turned to Vermillion. \u201cVermillion, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Vermillion heard Qi Aoshuang\u2019s words, her heart tightened. Just as she was immersed in thought, Jean called her back to her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, where do we go?\u201d With a slight huff, Vermillion resumed her original form. A giant dragon appeared before them.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s leave this place,\u201d Jean said quietly. Everyone got onto Vermillion\u2019s back. When Qi Aoshuang got on, Vermillions eyes flashed darkly for a moment, but it disappeared as quickly as it came.</p><br/><p>After everyone got on, with a slight grunt, Vermillion took off into the open sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, what have you been doing all this time?\u201d Ben asked, his eyes narrowed. Suddenly, he laughed naughtily. \u201cYou are must stronger than before. How about we have a practice duel sometime?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to have forgotten how you almost accidentally killed Qi Aoshuang last time. Jean is stronger, but you are stronger too,\u201d Leng Lingyun suddenly said.</p><br/><p>Ben smiled embarrassedly. Indeed, last time, it was also a practice duel, but he had accidentally used his full strength.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled, not saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, do you know anything about Master Cliff or Walter?\u201d Ben stroked his chin. \u201cIf you were able to hear that Qi Aoshuang might be at Dragon Valley, did you hear anything about the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Cliff\u2026\u201d Jean\u2019s voice trailed to a stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Qi Aoshuang hurriedly turned around and asked. She could hear the hesitation in his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter we find a place to set up camp, I\u2019ll explain.\u201d Jean sighed, reaching down to pat Vermillion. \u201cVermillion, find a remote place in the woods to land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vermillion flapped her wings, flying rapidly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s face darkened. Master, how are you? Did something happen to you?</p><br/><p>As if he could read her mind, Jean said, \u201cMiss, please don\u2019t worry. Nothing bad happened to Master Cliff.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wind whistled past their ears. Though Jean said not to worry, Qi Aoshuang had a serious expression.</p><br/><p>When they finally landed, Qi Aoshuang asked immediately.</p><br/><p>Jean looked at Qi Aoshuang\u2019s anxious expression, then looked at Jean. He sighed. \u201cA few days before Madam Katherine\u2019s trial, Master Cliff left, so he never knew that you had returned. The reason why he had left hurriedly was because he heard you were in critical danger, so he left to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I had already secretly returned to the capital.\u201d Qi Aoshuang frowned. Feelings of restlessness and regret arose in her heart. If she had found Master earlier, they wouldn\u2019t have missed each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who informed Master Cliff you were in trouble was Master Lawrence.\u201d Jean saw that Leng Lingyun\u2019s always calm expression finally changed. Jean sighed again, this time in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster?!\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression became exceptionally unsightly. \u201cMaster tricked Master Cliff away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jean nodded. \u201cWhen Master Cliff realized what happened, he injured Master Lawrence heavily, then left alone. He swore he would find Miss. He also said to Master Lawrence, he would never see him again!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

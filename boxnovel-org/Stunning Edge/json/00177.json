Instantly, a squall appeared, an incorporeal, powerful force striking the men behind Long Sasi. The bandits cried out fearfully as all of them were sent flying with no exception and then heavily crashed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Long Sasi\u2019s smile froze. The bandits quickly crawled back up from the ground, serious expressions on their faces. They had not been wounded, but they knew that their opponents were only giving them a slight warning, not intending to actually injure them.</p><br/><p>Magician?! And they were so powerful?</p><br/><p>Long Sasi frowned, subconsciously licking his dry lips. He cautiously eyed the three. Who exactly were they?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you planning?\u201d Long Sasi asked cautiously. One thing was clear: they were definitely no match for the three.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo make you the master of the desert.\u201d The girl with black hair and eyes revealed a bewitching smile, so beautiful it was intoxicating.</p><br/><p>The master of the desert?!</p><br/><p>Long Sasi froze, staring fixedly at the mysterious girl, judging whether or not she was serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong Sasi, the sole son of the defeated prince, master of pen and sword, popular with the common folk, the only candidate for the future prince. The crown prince is despicable, definitely not someone who would be a fair and just ruler. You were his greatest obstacle to becoming king, so before you could become a prince, you were framed.\u201d The sweet voice was completely emotionless.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Who are you?\u201d Long Sasi\u2019s expression finally changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I am Qi Aoshuang.\u201d The black haired black eyed girl smiled as sweetly as a flower.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang, Qi Aoshuang\u2026 A rueful smile flashed in the girl\u2019s eyes. She never thought she would use this name. Yes, this name was Claire\u2019s true name!</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve in me, I will definitely make you the master of the desert.\u201d Qi Aoshuang\u2019s voice carried an ineffable, faint charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I believe in you?\u201d Although his heart had swayed seeing the strength of the person next to the girl, it was not enough to convince him.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s beautiful face revealed a dazzling smile. For some reason, Long Sasi\u2019s heart shuddered seeing this smile.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s gaze shifted to the vulgar person at Long Sasi\u2019s side. Suddenly, her eyes glinted.</p><br/><p>Something strange happened next.</p><br/><p>The vulgar man hopped giddily to face Long Sasi, his voice very enthusiastic. \u201cBoss, did you know I have been admiring you for a long time now? My love for you is as pure as the moonlight, and my heart shall forever be faithful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A few of Long Sasi\u2019s men were already unable to stand such a change, holding their stomachs as they puked. However, Long Sasi had a serious expression. The vulgar man had a clear gaze, his words spoken naturally, but! He knew better than anyone the preferences of the vulgar man. It was because of this that Long Sasi\u2019s expression had turned serious. High level spiritual control! It was actually high level spiritual control! He knew this malicious magic better than anyone else. He had been betrayed by his closest beloved this way! And then was accused by his closest comrades!</p><br/><p>Long Sasi looked up at the beautiful black haired girl, his voice cold. \u201cEnough. I believe you.\u201d His heart started to tremble. How did the girl know what happened to him so clearly? Who exactly was she?</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang withdrew the spiritual control, smiling faintly. \u201cApologies for bringing up unpleasant memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vulgar man looked blankly Long Sasi\u2019s calm face, then noticed the strange looks by the other men and became even more dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you choose me?\u201d Long Sasi\u2019s voice was low.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I need your popularity.\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled faintly. \u201cThe people of Youwusali all believe you were framed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Sasi did not respond, remaining silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you believe me, then find me at the weaponry shop of Clearspring Village.\u201d Qi Aoshuang lightly tug on the reins of her camel. The camel started to advance forward. Beside her, Leng Lingyun and Feng Yixuan followed her closely.</p><br/><p>Long Sasi\u2019s men shared glances. Unanimously, they moved out of the way to make a path for them.</p><br/><p>The three camels slowly advanced. Everyone watched their figures as they left, then looked back at Long Sasi, all waiting for Long Sasi\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>Long Sasi did not utter a word, his expression as placid as water as he watched the three leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang, do you think he will find us?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked in a hushed voice. It had been no easy task to find the person they were after in the desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A small smile surfaced on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Clearspring Village was the closest oasis to Youwusali\u2019s frontier. Although it was small, it was very important. Many people came here to replenish their supplies.</p><br/><p>Like many other travelers, the three arrived on camelback. The vendors on the side of the roads did not have the energy to call out to potential customers, leaning back and waiting for customers to come themselves. The few stone dwellings mostly had their doors shut tightly. Only a few shops were open. Everyone dressed similarly, a long cloak draped over their entire body.</p><br/><p>The three arrived at an ordinary looking stone dwelling. After tying up their camels, they went inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, you\u2019re back,\u201d a stocky woman greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded. \u201cTonight someone will come to find me. Bring them once they arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The stocky woman was one of the Temple of Darkness\u2019s people who had been sent to assist Qi Aoshuang. She was in charge of relations. Her name was Riya.</p><br/><p>The three walked up to a cupboard next to the wall. Qi Aoshuang reached out to open it, revealing a deep tunnel. With a snap of her finger, the entire tunnel was lit up with torch light. She headed in.</p><br/><p>After they entered, the cupboard closed, looking once more like an ordinary cupboard. Meanwhile, the three camels outside were led away.</p><br/><p>The end of the tunnel opened up to reveal an underground cavern. It was a long corridor with many rooms on either side. Straight ahead was the main hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Princess, you\u2019ve finally returned.\u201d Xi Shaoqi scowled.</p><br/><p>At the time, Leng Lingyun and Feng Yixuan had been shocked by Qi Aoshuang\u2019s identity, not knowing when she had become the Divine Princess of Darkness. Once Qi Aoshuang told them it was that time they had been trapped by the Temple of Darkness, Leng Lingyun immediately understood.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang slowly approached, her voice soft. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis holiness said if you didn\u2019t return any sooner, we would be punished. So many days passed, but you still did not return,\u201d Xi Shaoqi grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Princess.\u201d Xi Shaosi smiled and pulled up a chair for Qi Aoshuang, then poured her a cup of scented tea.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew how the old pope of Light had lost one of his feet. Twelve archbishops had even lost their lives! It was terribly exciting news. And at the core of it all was this girl! All followers of the Temple of Darkness were riled up, all believing Qi Aoshuang would lead them into a new era.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Princess, did you already find who you were looking for?\u201d Xi Shaosi poured tea for everyone else as well.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang took a sip of the tea with a slight nod. \u201cThey will be here tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have found everything you told us to look for.\u201d Xi Shaosi took out a map. Two spots were marked in red. \u201cThis is the stronghold of the dwarves, and this is the stronghold of the earth spirits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Qi Aoshuang stared at the map, musing.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi looked doubtfully at the map. Finally, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cDivine Princess, why are you looking for them? Dwarves are only good at metallurgy, whereas earth spirits are only good at digging. Furthermore, they never mingle with humans and hold a deep grudge towards humans. Why are you looking for them?\u201d Finding the two strongholds has used a lot of manpower. Some had even lost their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the goal of the Temple of Light?\u201d Qi Aoshuang asked instead of responding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could it be? To reap without sowing, brainwash others.\u201d Xi Shaoqi humphed. \u201cThe ignorant masses lose a fortune, yet act as if it is a matter of course. The Temple does any small act of kindness and it is heavily publicized.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it fair?\u201d Qi Aoshuang said profoundly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Xi Shaoqi exclaimed disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo thoroughly purge the brainwashing, do you think only killing the leader is enough?\u201d Qi Aoshuang stared at the two points on the map.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi froze. The Temple of Light had suffered great losses against Claire, but their prestige had been increased greatly. The Temple of Light had become the embodiment of justice to the people.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean to say!\u201d Xi Shaoqi clenched his fist, excited. Really? Was it really what he thought it was? Could the girl before him really do it?</p><br/><p>Power, money, status\u2026</p><br/><p>What humanity pursued\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYouwusali will become the first country of Darkness.\u201d Qi Aoshuang raised the teacup to her lips and sipped, smiling like a flower.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi\u2019s heart shook. He suddenly understood Qi Aoshuang\u2019s plan. Such an ambitious plan, something he could not imagine in his wildest dreams. If someone else said her words, he would have thought it was just a joke, but if this girl said it, it would become reality. Deep in his heart, he believed the girl would definitely be successful. She would definitely topple the Temple of Light!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

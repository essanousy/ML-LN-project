To make a breakthrough, Master had actually went to Devil Field and Sir Lawrence had wanted her to stop him. Devil Field. It wasn\u2019t a true realm with devils, but an extremely perilous region with unknown and dangerous creatures everywhere. The terrain was also hazardous with an eerie atmosphere. There was a terrifyingly strong barrier around Devil Field that was easy to enter through, but difficult to leave from. Rumors said that they were powerful creatures from the devil realm there and many powerful people who went there to train never made it out. Because Sir Lawrence failed to persuade Cliff, he could only write a letter to Claire to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, is the situation dire?\u201d Jean asked softly, seeing her serious expression.</p><br/><p>Claire opened the letter again to see the date on it. Cliff had already left a few days ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must go and stop Master, he is going to Devil Field!\u201d Claire gritted her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Jean\u2019s expression changed instantly. He was fully aware of what Devil Field was. Once, a powerful man from Amparkland tried to train there. The barrier was easy to enter, but afterwards, he never made his way out. It was rumored creatures from the devil realm had made their way there and the place was also forbidden for high experts. So many experts had entered and never returned, so Devil Field had become a forbidden topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been a few days since Master set off.\u201d Claire frowned worriedly. \u201cThe Devil Field is far from here. Even if I fly, it\u2019s impossible to sustain through the days and nights, I will run out of magic.\u201d Claire was now a little frustrated. Even if she persevered and flew without sleep, she would need time to replenish her magic, but it would waste time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, don\u2019t fret, I\u2019ll send you there as fast as possible,\u201d Jean said resolutely.</p><br/><p>Claire was a bit puzzled seeing how determined his expression and how certain his tone was. He was only a warrior and only knew Dou Qi. What did he mean by those words?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is so dire, I must give up on caring so much.\u201d Jean lifted the curtain of the carriage window and gazed outside, his face tranquil.</p><br/><p>What did he mean? Claire didn\u2019t understand what he was looking out the window for.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoachman, once we arrive at the woods, let us out and you can return,\u201d Jean instructed the coachman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The coachman agreed without question. With a crack of the whip, the carriage\u2019s speed increased.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, what are you planning?\u201d Claire couldn\u2019t help but ask seeing his solemn expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, it would take months to reach Devil Field by carriage from here. By the time we reached there, Master Cliff would have already entered Devil Field and it would be too late.\u201d Jean let the curtains down. He gazed at Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded. Indeed, she had known this. But what was Jean planning on?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I will send you to the outskirts of Devil Field within three days.\u201d Jean\u2019s eyes glinted with determination.</p><br/><p>Three days? Claire was shocked. How was that possible? Perhaps it would have been possible if Ben were there. Speed and endurance of dragons completely surpassed that of ordinary beasts. But at this crucial moment, Ben was in the middle of cultivating elsewhere. Did Jean have a ride with such speed? Wait a minute, all knights have mounts. What was Jean\u2019s mount? Claire searched through her memories, but realized that this piece of information was missing.</p><br/><p>The carriage was fast. After it entered an enclosure within the forest, it stopped. Jean and Claire left the carriage and the coachmen left as per instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, just what are you planning?\u201d Claire asked with confusion.</p><br/><p>Jean didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he faced the sky, his gaze intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer me! My contractor!\u201d Jean called out quietly. His eyes grew vacant.</p><br/><p>In that instant, a strange rune surfaced in his forehead. Claire recognized it to be a contract mark. He was summoning something, perhaps his mount?</p><br/><p>She pondered. As a knight, it was mandatory to have a mount. The mounts of the royal knights, the Griffin Squad, were naturally Griffins. Further down the ranks, there were war horses while some knights had unique magic beasts. Was Jean\u2019s mount a flying type? Is that why Jean said he would send her there in three days?</p><br/><p>It must be. Only a flying magic beast could send her to the outskirts in such a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>Claire raised her head towards the sky, waiting for Jean\u2019s summoned mount.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the sky darkened overhead. Claire watched dumbfoundedly as a giant creature circled overhead, completely shocked.</p><br/><p>She had guessed Jean\u2019s mount would be able to fly and indeed, she was right.</p><br/><p>But how was the beast so big? Why did it seem like a dragon?</p><br/><p>Because it was a dragon! Jean\u2019s mount was unexpectedly a dragon!</p><br/><p>(Author\u2019s note: Dragon knights are very rare, Amparkland only has two dragon knights in total, Lagark has two, with one being Beluke, and Jean is Amparkland\u2019s secret third dragon knight.)</p><br/><p>With a \u201cswoosh\u201d, the dragon descended before the two. Claire stared at the dragon fixedly, unable to come up with words to say.</p><br/><p>The dragon extended its neck, nuzzling Jean affectionately. Jean revealed a rare smile and reached out to stroke the dragon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cVermilion, let\u2019s go. Bring us to the outskirts of Devil Field.\u201d Jean guided Claire over by the hand.</p><br/><p>But the dragon puffed out cold air in a displeased manner, completely losing its previous affectionate air. It kept on snorting while glaring at Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire instantly understood. The dragon was rejecting her, not willing to let her to ride.</p><br/><p>\u201cVermilion!\u201d Jean warned coldly, his face darkening.</p><br/><p>The dragon whimpered, then lowered it head, its eyes dimming.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, this is my mount, Vermilion. She still doesn\u2019t know how to talk. In dragon years, she\u2019s still a baby, a little temperamental. But it\u2019s ok.\u201d Jean patted Vermillion on the head.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded. She understood why Vermilion protested. Mounts of knights were supposed to be exclusively for their contractors only, so naturally, she rejected Claire, who was not her knight.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Miss.\u201d Jean helped Claire mount onto the dragon, then seated himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Vermilion. I\u2019m sorry it will be arduous this time. Use all your strength to bring us to the outskirts of Devil Field.\u201d Jean patted the dragon. The dragon roared, then shot up, gliding swiftly into the sky.</p><br/><p>Wind whipped by her ears. Claire looked at Jean who was sitting in front of her, her mind full of thoughts. Jean had originally hidden his real strength and followed her. Then, she found out he was secretly helping the second prince under her grandfather\u2019s orders. Now, it turns out he was actually a dragon knight. There were only two known dragon knights out of all of Amparkland, mysterious and powerful. But as far as she knew, Jean was not one of them. That meant his identity as a dragon knight was secret! Jean. How many more secrets was he holding from her?</p><br/><p>Vermilion flew as fast as she could under Jean\u2019s urging, not stopping to rest for an entire day. Only at night did they land at a secluded area to rest. Vermilion was so tired, she just laid there, unmoving.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Vermilion was simply sprawled on the ground, unable to move an inch, Claire couldn\u2019t help but suggest, \u201cJean, isn\u2019t this too tiresome for a young dragon? Let her rest tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we continue flying tomorrow, we can reach Devil Field by late evening. We must stop Cliff from entering, or it\u2019ll be too late,\u201d Jean insisted.</p><br/><p>Claire turned to look at the exhausted Vermilion, then thought of the consequences of Devil Field and soon became conflicted. \u201cVermilion is still a young dragon. If she continues like such, she will overwork herself. What would happen then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. After a good night\u2019s rest and another day of flying, it\u2019ll be over.\u201d Remorse flashed in his eyes, but when he thought of the consequences of Devil Field, his eyes hardened.</p><br/><p>After the two ate, they went straight to sleep.</p><br/><p>Early morning the next day, Vermilion started flying again.</p><br/><p>Exhausted, Vermilion finally reached the outskirts of Devil Field at nightfall. Much to her surprise, Claire noticed the below, mountains and rivers stretched as far as the eye could see, however, such a vast area was covered by a barrier. As soon as she landed, Vermilion collapsed onto the ground. She still controlled herself enough as to not crush the two people who fell off her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cVermilion!\u201d Jean cried out worriedly.</p><br/><p>Claire had landed lightly just as Jean had. She stood to the side, watching Vermilion lie on the ground with a complex expression.</p><br/><p>Vermilion tried to raise her head desperately. She licked Jean\u2019s worried face with her tongue, trying to console him.</p><br/><p>Jean stroked Vermilion softly, eyes remorseful and tender.</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent, sighing in her heart, but not knowing what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, Cliff shouldn\u2019t have arrived yet.\u201d Jean stroked Vermilion\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Claire replied softly. She scanned the surroundings. They had landed at a valley with deep forests between two steep mountains that were so high, they disappeared into the horizon. This was an entrance to Devil Field?</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t see the end of the barrier. Who had created it? How powerful were they to be able to create such a field?</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, stay with Vermilion. I\u2019m going to explore the area,\u201d Claire turned around and instructed Jean.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, not matter what you do, don\u2019t enter the field,\u201d Jean cautioned solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d With a wave of her hand, golden fire wings extended from her back instantly. She flew up into the sky and started to scan the general vicinity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Few people carried out business at this time.</p><br/><p>The weaponry shop, however, was still lit.</p><br/><p>The owner leaned against a table drowsily.</p><br/><p>The door opened quietly. The owner slowly opened his eyes, then stood up.</p><br/><p>Without much to say, the owner put on his cloak and said quietly, \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Sasi frowned seeing the owner\u2019s actions. He recalled the girl\u2019s stunning, confident smile. She was that certain he would come?</p><br/><p>As the owner led the way, Long Sasi watched the owner\u2019s steps and was shocked. This ordinary looking owner had a sturdy foundation! Since when did such experts appear in Clearspring Village?</p><br/><p>The owner led Long Sasi to an ordinary stone dwelling. \u201cI am only responsible for bringing you here,\u201d he said dully, then left.</p><br/><p>The door opened and a stocky woman motioned for him to enter. \u201cIf you may.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Sasi hesitated only briefly before stepping in.</p><br/><p>He was unaware that this step was the first step towards the greatest shift in Youwusali\u2019s history!</p><br/><p>Long Sasi followed the stocky woman to a room with a cupboard. She pulled open the cupboard door. A gust of cold air blew flew into their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady is waiting for you down below.\u201d Riya motioned for him to enter.</p><br/><p>Without hesitating, he entered. Passing through the long corridor, he arrived at a brightly lit hall.</p><br/><p>A long table was set up in the middle of the hall. Sitting at the end of the table was the stunning girl. To her right sat a handsome young man with flame red hair watching him with narrowed eyes. To her left sat a handsome man with violet eyes and silver hair, his expression cold. Behind the girl stood two men with the same appearance, one holding a teapot, the other sizing him up with a curious tilt of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease sit.\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled.</p><br/><p>Long Sasi frowned slightly. Seeing this set up, the girl seemed to have predicted he would come. Who exactly was she? She had already investigated him thoroughly. Appearing before him in the desert was no coincidence. She had been looking for him!</p><br/><p>Long Sasi sat facing Qi Aoshuang. Xi Shaosi poured a cup of tea for Long Sasi.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnjoy the tea.\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled.</p><br/><p>Long Sasi sat down without sitting the tea. Instead, he asked seriously, \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo increase your fame, and then reveal your identity in the end. Your status shall be restored.\u201d Qi Aoshuang took another sip of tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Long Sasi frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything. Just eat well, play well, and sleep well.\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled at Long Sasi. Before he could speak, she continued, \u201cOf course, that is not possible. You will not agree. I will not agree either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Sasi\u2019s lip twitched. He suddenly felt her personality and appearance did not match.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi and Xi Shaosi shared a glance, both seeing sympathy in each other\u2019s gazes. Long Sasi would become another victim of their Divine Princess\u2019s bullying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you need to do now is lead your men to do chivalrous acts, save commoners through fire and water. However, you cannot leave your name. You must wear a red mask whenever you carry our your deeds.\u201d Qi Aoshuang set down her cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cChivalrous acts?\u201d Long Sasi was skeptical, not understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are other bandits besides you. You have always taken only a certain amount, only a third of the goods when you rob merchants. But other bandits are not the same. They kill all, steal all.\u201d Qi Aoshuang stroked her chin thoughtfully, a little confused. \u201cBut why did you want me? You have always stolen goods, not women.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Sasi revealed a trace of embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever, if you don\u2019t want to say, then you don\u2019t have to. In short, your next step is to appear in times of need.\u201d Because most of Youwusali was desert, it was hard for soldiers to travel. On the other hand, bandits were excellent on horseback. Whenever soldiers chased after bandits, at most they would eat dust, helplessly cursing after the bandits disappearing into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust that?\u201d Long Sasi frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s all you need to do for now. You will assume a different identity. In the end, when your identity is finally revealed, all eyes will be on you. The people who framed you will confess on their own in front of everyone.\u201d Qi Aoshuang lightly rapped the table. \u201cRemember, you all must wear red masks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wear red masks?\u201d Long Sasi finally understood what the girl was planning a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can choose a different color, so long as it differentiates you from other bandits. Try not to kill all the bandits at once. Release them secretly if you can,\u201d Qi Aoshuang instructed specifically.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Long Sasi was now even more confused.</p><br/><p>The next moment, he regretted asking this question.</p><br/><p>Faced with multiple disdainful gazes, Long Sasi suddenly felt stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course so they can continue to wreak havoc so you have more opportunities to show off.\u201d Xi Shaoqi rolled his eyes disdainfully. \u201cOtherwise, how else can you get famous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Sasi\u2019s lip twitched. These devious people! An exemplary case of how birds of a feather flock together!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you really clear my name?\u201d A trace of doubt flashed across his eyes. Although the men beside the girl were extremely powerful and the girl was able to spiritually control others, was it really possible? The ones who had framed him were the current emperor and empress\u2026 the woman he had once loved\u2026 now the empress.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could do it even right now, but it would not be as effective. So what if they framed you?\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled. \u201cHold back your first to strike harder in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Sasi froze. Hold back your first to strike harder in the future!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly are you?\u201d Long Sasi stood up, frowning as he stared fixedly at the girl.</p><br/><p>The black haired girl smiled, but did not answer.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood up, a wad of golden banknotes appearing in his hand. He handed it to Long Sasi. It was a small portion of the profit made when the Feng clan helped sell off the treasures Qi Aoshuang had gotten from Ben. Feng Yixuan had been greatly shocked, never expecting her to have so many rare treasures.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lon Sasi\u2019s expression darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jump to conclusions. It isn\u2019t for you to spend. Exchange them into gold coins. You will use them to help the commoners.\u201d Feng Yixuan spat out, looking down on the person before him.</p><br/><p>Long Sasi felt a wave of depression. It was the first time he had felt he wasn\u2019t smart enough.</p><br/><p>However, it was a good idea. Youwusali had always been poor, so using money to help others would quickly buy their loyalty.</p><br/><p>Once Long Sasi accepted the golden banknotes, he was shocked. Every banknote was worth ten thousand, so this wad of banknotes was a couple million gold!</p><br/><p>Long Sasi looked up to see Feng Yixuan\u2019s indifferent expression, then looked at Qi Aoshuang to see her cold expression.</p><br/><p>Who exactly were they?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo. Every month, send some of your men to the weaponry shop.\u201d Qi Aoshuang stood up, yawning.</p><br/><p>Long Sasi stared at the girl, unable to come up with words to say.</p><br/><p>Such a mysterious girl with unknown origins. He did not know any of her objectives. However, for some reason, his heart fully believed the girl would be able to fulfill his wish!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. If I run into trouble, I will come find you at the weaponry shop. I will leave now.\u201d Long Sasi put away the banknotes. He gave Qi Aoshuang a slight nod, then left.</p><br/><p>Late at night, Qi Aoshuang stood on the roof, silently watching the bright moon.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a thick mantle draped over her shoulders. She turned around abruptly to face Feng Yixuan\u2019s smiling face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked quietly. He also looked up at the moon.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang kept silent, then slowly responded. \u201cOnce Long Sasi faces the ones who betrayed him, will he be able to take the final step?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan paused, then smiled immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s his own fault for falling for someone who didn\u2019t deserve love. He was wrong at the start, so how can we be certain he will correct himself in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang paused, then whipped around, staring at Feng Yixuan intensely. Feng Yixuan continued to smile. \u201cTheir relationship cannot be called love. How can love be bought by money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang lowered her gaze, replying darkly, \u201cHumans\u2026 are simply like that. Always chasing after fame and fortune\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But before Qi Aoshuang could finished, Feng Yixuan interjected. \u201cBut I won\u2019t. I will never betray you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan pulled Claire by the shoulder to face him. \u201cAoshuang, even if the rest of the world turns its back on you, I will still remain at your side, protecting you with all my might.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang stared blankly at his resolute gaze, his determined expression. Suddenly, Qi Aoshuang didn\u2019t know what the say. Only, something was taking root in her heart, growing\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

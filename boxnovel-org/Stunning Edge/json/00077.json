Jean was carrying a dish, his expression lonely for some reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Claire said sourly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d It was only after Jean shut the door and put the pan onto the table that he sat down and stared at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething else?\u201d Claire asked, frowning slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I wanted to ask you, do you accept my loyalty?\u201d Currently, Jean\u2019s expression was exceptionally serious.</p><br/><p>Claire froze. What was that supposed to mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t accept, then I would have thrown you away long before, during the battle against the golden dragon.\u201d Claire said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Miss, why did you not tell me about your dangerous actions last night? I am your guardian knight; I don\u2019t want to share joy together, but to face hardships together. I hope you can share your worries, hope that when you are in danger, I can shield in front of you.\u201d Besides seriousness, Jean\u2019s expression had a faint hint of loneliness.</p><br/><p>In a flash, Claire wasn\u2019t able to say anything. She just stared at Jean\u2019s shining gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, if next time something like this happens where I can\u2019t help, please can you tell me once, okay?\u201d Jean implored, staring at Claire strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Claire looked at Jean\u2019s expression and couldn\u2019t help but say the word okay.</p><br/><p>After obtaining Claire\u2019s reply, a smile appeared on Jean\u2019s face. \u201cThen Miss should first eat and then rest.\u201d After saying these words, he got up, opened the door, and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, this man has improper thoughts about you, definitely. I dislike this guy, too tsundere, not showing anything on the outside.\u201d Golden Lotus\u2019s voice suddenly sounded, then said happily, \u201cAt least that Walter or something guy has disappeared. From now on, Ma is all mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL: Before people call me a weeabo, the meaning of it was \u201coutwardly cold or retiring but deep and passionate inside\u201d and that sound suuper awkward by itself. I\u2019m fairly sure this is the Chinese equivalent of tsundere, positive. Although I probably am a weeb seeing as I made the website name japanesemafialady\u2026)</p><br/><p>Claire: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus, don\u2019t sleep. I want to break through. Help me withstand the heavenly tribulation.\u201d Claire said after looking at the food on the table and eating some casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Right now?\u201d Golden Lotus answered immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019ll go out the city.\u201d Claire understood very deeply that she had to become strong as fast as possible. The Divine Princess, Liuxue Qing was actually able to detect her when she was invisible.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Golden Lotus was eager to try.</p><br/><p>Claire reached her hand out at White Emperor, who was beside the pillow. White Emperor chirped twice, pounced onto Claire\u2019s hand, and then while he was at it, crawled up to her shoulder and then her head.</p><br/><p>Claire was about to go out, but then thought of the promise she had just made with Jean. She then turned to knock on Jean\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>The door opened very quickly. Jean looked at Claire, who was standing at the door, and said, puzzled, \u201cMiss, is something the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out. I have something to do outside the city. It\u2019s nothing big. You don\u2019t need to come with me. I\u2019ll come back before noon.\u201d Claire said simply.</p><br/><p>Jean looked at Claire and asked suspiciously, \u201cWhat is it that Miss is going for? There won\u2019t be any danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no danger. I\u2019ll come back right after going out. You don\u2019t need to come with me. Watch after Summer and Black Dragon Ben. Make sure they don\u2019t cause trouble. It\u2019s just outside the city, what can possibly happen?\u201d Claire downplayed the situation.</p><br/><p>Jean hesitated and said, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there was danger, I would bring you.\u201d Claire blocked Jean with one sentence. \u201cI\u2019ll leave and return quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for Jean to reply, Claire brought White Emperor to the backyard, going out from the back door while riding the wind leopard. Jean silently watched Claire from behind, his eyes full of confliction.</p><br/><p>A golden blonde haired, green-eyed, beautiful girl rode a seventh grade magic beast running in the streets. Naturally, it aroused attention. It was just that right now it was early morning with few people in the streets, so it didn\u2019t cause a disturbance.</p><br/><p>A carriage traveled slowly on the street. When Claire rode the wind leopard, dashing past, the horses around the carriage all cried out in fear continuously, immediately starting to flare up. It was only after the coachman used up a lot of energy that they were calmed down. The person inside the carriage poked their head out angrily, but just as they thought about asking what was going on, they saw a familiar figure currently dashing out the city.</p><br/><p>It was Claire Hill! The eyes of the person inside the carriage instantly widened. It was really enemies on the same road. The person inside the carriage was none other than Alice Roman, the person who had formerly proposed a duel to Claire but lost horribly and also lost one of the Roman clan\u2019s heirlooms.</p><br/><p>Alice squinted, looking at Claire who was far away, and frowned deeply. What was a slut doing so early?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlice, what is it?\u201d A cold voice sounded from beside Alice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, I just saw my enemy go out of the city.\u201d Alice snorted.</p><br/><p>(TL: Using cousin because there\u2019s no way to convey the whole thing without sounding weird. In Chinese, the word means \u201colder male cousin via female line\u201d. Chinese filial piety\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is it the person who made you lose your magic sword?\u201d The cold voice had a hint of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Alice admitted begrudgingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Your cousin will let you vent some anger.\u201d The cold voice said.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Alice asked happily. If Cousin fought, then it would be a sure win. Cousin was a wizard! He had come from Lagark to here this time to visit home. It seemed like he had some business to discuss with Grandfather. With Cousin who was so strong fighting, how could that slut not be taught a lesson?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. She actually dared to bully our Alice. I\u2019ll make her pay the price.\u201d The indifferent voice held disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s someone from the Hill clan. If we teach them a lesson now, will it cause trouble for Grandfather?\u201d Alice bit her lip, somewhat wavering as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDead people can\u2019t talk.\u201d The indifferent voice was sinister and confident.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin, is this ok?\u201d Alice\u2019s face revealed a hint of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it not ok? Let\u2019s go. Tell the coachman to turn around and follow.\u201d The indifferent voice said maliciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Alice instructed the coachman to turn around, but an imperceptible trace of smile flashed from the depths from her eyes. She just knew with her cousin\u2019s personality this kind of decision would be made.</p><br/><p>Alice looked outside the city gate, snickering in her heart. Little slut, you won\u2019t be killed so easily.</p><br/><p>The carriage turned around, going outside the city speedily.</p><br/><p>Currently, Claire had already slowed her speed, looking for a suitable area, preparing for heavenly tribulation. She didn\u2019t know at the moment that a danger was approaching slowly.</p><br/><p>Claire went out of the city, heading to a secluded area right outside the city. She really didn\u2019t want the shocking scene of heavenly lightning being seen by other people.</p><br/><p>In the early hours of the morning, the whole forest was very quiet, some drops of dew on leaves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle leopard, wait for me over there.\u201d Claire patted the wind leopard\u2019s head, pointing to a nearby stone in front of them. Then, Claire brought down White Emperor from her head and put it on the wind leopard\u2019s head. \u201cWhite Emperor, you should also go over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wind leopard raised White Emperor up, walked over, laid on the big stone, and waited obediently.</p><br/><p>Claire found a dry and clean place, sat down in the lotus position, and extended out her spiritual sense, feeling the surroundings. The surroundings were calm, without any anomalies. It was only after Claire set up a barrier that she started to practice the golden lotus force, preparing to break through into the third level.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s whole body emitted a faint, golden light, the radiance growing stronger. Again, the mysterious realm appeared where she could sense everything in the surroundings clearly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an unrestrained Qi arose. Claire was a little astonished. Just as Golden Lotus said, the beginning levels harmonized magic elements and Dou Qi, very easy to break through. She remembered Golden Lotus saying before that if she didn\u2019t give birth to him, then she could only cultivate to the Treasured Lotus Style\u2019s tenth level, in other words, the equivalent of a Sorcerer\u2019s power. With this she could infer from what Golden Lotus said, that she could quickly cultivate to the seventh level, meant that it was also her level of magic right now, a wizard. So it was split up like this. Claire suddenly understood. Anyways, the second level of the Treasured Book of the Lotus could extend her consciousness to sense the environment; what kind of mysterious power would she get after breaking through into the third level?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the sky above her slowly darkened, black clouds quickly closing in.</p><br/><p>The heavenly tribulation was about to arrive.</p><br/><p>But Claire wasn\u2019t worried at all. In any case, Golden Lotus would block for her.</p><br/><p>Wind leopard, who was at the side, dug with his front claws a little fretfully and uneasily. Although it had gone through this kind of situation before, the strange situation in the sky made one\u2019s heart frightened.</p><br/><p>More and more black clouds gathered, amassing above Claire in a blink of an eye. Lightning rumbled amidst the layers of black clouds, a terrifying sight.</p><br/><p>Alice and her cousin both looked at the strange sight in the sky in shock. Lightning? Why would a mass of black clouds gather there, rumbling with lightning?</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, you can even take a nap right now. It\u2019ll be done in a bit.\u201d Golden Lotus said arrogantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho can sleep with such loud noise?\u201d Claire grumbled, looking at the black clouds that covered the sky densely. Again, she felt the hot and unbearable fiery sensation on her back. Claire knew another flower petal was blossoming.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t saying to exaggerate, I meant to make you, Ma, feel relieved, feel relieved.\u201d Golden Lotus added, still arrogantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI broke through the third level. Why can\u2019t I feel any anomalies?\u201d Claire reached out her hand and looked at her palm, not feeling anything unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa, in a bit when you meditate, you\u2019ll know.\u201d Golden Lotus said mysteriously, giving a cliffhanger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Claire was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it, I\u2019m so awesome, so how can your Spiritual level from cultivating be bad?\u201d Golden Lotus said arrogantly, then said disdainfully, \u201cWait for a moment, I\u2019ll finish eating the lightning first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire was bored to death, waiting for the sky\u2019s lightning to descend. Currently, she was wrapped up in a giant golden lotus.</p><br/><p>The rumbling of thunder resonated into the horizons with an indescribable pressure that made one frightened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

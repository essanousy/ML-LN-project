At this moment, he even wanted to escape immediately! Not to mention facing the previous Heavenly King, even the current Heavenly King had never felt such oppression!</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan opened his mouth slightly and stared blankly at Qi Ao Shuang. At this moment, Ao Shuang looked so unfamiliar and so \u2026 Beautiful? Yes, it appeared to be a soul-stirring beauty, as beautiful as the blossoming of a poisonous flower. Even if he knew that it was poisonous, he still wanted to pick it! What kind of strange feeling was this?</p><br/><p>Moon King and Mishus were also stunned, as if none of this had anything to do with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean shaking your head?\u201d asked Mezus, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means he doesn\u2019t know either.\u201d The Moon King answered for Feng Yixuan in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be? Their relationship \u2026\u201d \u201cHe actually doesn\u2019t know about it either \u2026.\u201d Mishus lowered his voice because he could tell from Feng Yixuan\u2019s expression that what the Moon King said seemed to be true. If even Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t know what was going on, then this question \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, the problem is solved.\u201d King Yue surveyed his surroundings, which were in complete chaos. There were sandpits of varying sizes everywhere. However, he knew that soon, strong winds would arrive and the sandpits would be filled up, returning to how they were before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, King Yong \u2026\u201d Mishus bit his lip and spat out a few words. Clearly, they understood what Rao Yu had said earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing Yong, we may have met with misfortune. Let\u2019s go find the other kings.\u201d If a new King of White and King Yong appeared, there would definitely be a sign. \u201cWe\u2019ll see when the time comes.\u201d Yue Wang said helplessly, with a hint of sadness in his tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if the other two generals also joined the Heavenly King.\u201d \u201cWe need to find the other Kings as soon as possible.\u201d \u201cIf the other Wang Luo meets the other two generals alone, the consequences will be unimaginable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Wang nodded, understanding in his heart that Yong Wang\u2019s death was probably caused by Rao Yu and Han Qu joining hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly King will definitely look for a new King White and King Yong!\u201d \u201cWe need to get there as soon as possible.\u201d He looked off into the distance. \u201cThere\u2019s no time to worry about anything else. I\u2019d better summon it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, two of the four generals have already left.\u201d King Yue nodded, then looked at the silent Feng Yi Xuan and the sleeping Qi Ao Shuang, before agreeing to Mi Shou\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>A dazzling white light appeared in the empty space in front of him, and a huge monster appeared. It looked almost identical to the mount Qi Ao Shuang was riding before, but it was much larger in size. It was the size of the previous ten, and its back was even wider and more flat.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on up.\u201d Mi Xiu was the first to fly up. Feng Yi Xuan grabbed Qi Ao Shuang by the toes and leapt up as well. King Yue followed behind.</p><br/><p>After everyone sat down, Mezus gently patted Monster on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the southwest to find the True King.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monster let out a long roar and then flew smoothly towards the southwest.</p><br/><p>The Moon King formed a barrier, enveloping everyone inside and blocking off the direct sunlight and sand. Feng Yi Xuan watched the sleeping Qi Ao Shuang without saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan, what do you think?\u201d King Yue suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Feng Yixuan only came back to his senses when he heard someone call his name. He turned to look at King Yue.</p><br/><p>Moon King looked at Qi Ao Shuang, then looked at Yi Xuan, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes darkened as he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I feel that it wasn\u2019t Ao Shuang herself who did it.\u201d But who else could it be? It was her just now, but it wasn\u2019t him. \u201cFeng Yixuan\u2019s heart is in chaos.\u201d I don\u2019t know either.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, these two completely different people, Qi Ao Shuang, should be her.\u201d Placing his hand on his chin, Moon King speculated, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that she has two personalities?\u201d \u201cThis kind of violent and bloodthirsty personality is hidden deep in the heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019ve never met such a person before.\u201d Mishus nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan frowned slightly. The words spoken by Moon King and Mishus made him feel very uncomfortable, but he couldn\u2019t find any other words to refute. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s abnormal behavior was indeed very bloody and terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s situation is somewhat different from those people.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s different. \u201d King Yue frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like \u2026\u201d Mezus looked up into the distance, sighing. \u201cThings seem to be getting more and more complicated.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

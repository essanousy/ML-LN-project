Each and every sick person was lying on the ground with low groans. The air inside the room was thick with the rotting smell. Even though they had already opened the window to ventilate, it was still extremely stinky.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Claire looked at the sick people lying on the ground and frowned. Although she asked this, Claire was very clear that regarding the Dark element, Walter was more qualified than anyone else here to say anything. He was a genius Dark magician afterall.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Walter\u2019s voice was a bit serious. \u201cBut this kind of malicious magic hasn\u2019t been used by anyone for a long time. Not only is this person a Dark magician, they\u2019re also a necromancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Claire was a bit surprised. Necromancers were exceptionally malicious. Although many people loathed Dark magicians and the Magician Council also sent people to eliminate them, every magician had right and duty to kill necromancers regardless of anything, because necromancers were truly too evil. They used human lives to develop their magic power.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a plague.\u201d Lingyun Leng\u2019s cold voice was heard by Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, little guy, not bad, you could actually tell this wasn\u2019t a plague.\u201d Cliff raised a brow and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch! Good my ass! Then you go and ask him if this isn\u2019t a plague, what is it specifically?\u201d Walter disdainfully clicked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, this is caused by a Dark magician, but as for the specifics, I do not know.\u201d Lingyun Leng modestly and honestly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s already not bad. You knowing that this wasn\u2019t a plague was already pretty good. Not even one of Niya City\u2019s magicians discovered it.\u201d Cliff complimented Lingyun Leng, but his last words were blaming the magicians of Niya City. Niya City also had a branch of the Magician Council.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis magic has already disappeared for a long time.\u201d Walter continued in Claire\u2019s mind, \u201cIt infects people with death aura, and then spreads throughout the entire body, slowly rotting until they die. The people will receive intense suffering. The necromancer will absorb the suffering of the ghosts of the people who died unfairly to expand their strength. But this is on a pretty big scale, actually making a move against a city.\u201d After saying this, Walter sighed.</p><br/><p>Just as Claire was shocked, Cliff also starting talking. \u201cIt\u2019s a necromancer, a hundred years ago I met one before.\u201d</p><br/><p>A hundred years? Claire was stunned. How old was Master this year?</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would meet one today, and actually in a city.\u201d Cliff sighed softly. \u201cThe only way to eliminate this so-called plague is to find that necromancer and completely extinguish him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man actually has some skills.\u201d Walter humphed. Even though he was in a very bad mood, internally, he accepted it. The wizard sage Cliff truly did have his awesome aspects.</p><br/><p>\u201cNecromancer!\u201d Lingyun Leng\u2019s expression changed. He knew better than anyone else what necromancer meant; death, the most painful death.</p><br/><p>They found the origin, but the whereabouts of the necromancer would be hard to find. They all hid in the most dark, most concealed place and then peeked at this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!!\u201d Suddenly, they heard a mournful cry followed by a deathly silence that was a bit restless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Cliff turned towards it.</p><br/><p>Claire became taciturn. Her gaze landed on the sick people closest to her. Their visible skin had already turned dark black and they were currently slowly rotting. They were receiving inhumane suffering. Just then, the mournful shrieks were from people who were unable to bear this suffering and committed suicide.</p><br/><p>Lingyun Leng slowly closed his eyes, already chanting a spell. Bright, white light was emitted from Lingyun Leng, forming into a huge shield that enveloped the infected people of the room. The gentle light shined on the infected people. Gradually, the groans subsided. But that pitch-black skin and rotting body weren\u2019t alleviated. It could only make people not feel the pain and wasn\u2019t able to heal them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use, little one, it can only lessen their pain, that\u2019s all. If you want to completely resolve it, you must find the original perpetrator.\u201d Cliff said, somewhat solemn.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lingyun Leng softly said, but didn\u2019t stop his actions.</p><br/><p>Claire turned and saw there was actually something somewhat ineffable in the depths of the violet eyes on Lingyun Leng\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>Strange\u2026Claire was a bit puzzled because the feeling that Lingyun Leng gave her was that he was a rigid person, indifferent to the bones. Also, Lingyun Leng definitely did not have that kind of sympathetic disposition. But right now, everything Lingyun Leng did completely contradicted what Claire knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, actually thinking of himself as a Divine Prince when he had his own personal reason to join the Temple of Light and become a healer.\u201d Looking at Walter made him unhappy, so he continued to throw shade.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat reason?\u201d Claire asked, confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has a younger sister who is physically weak and constantly sick, that\u2019s why he would join the Temple of Light and become a healer, and later, the Divine Prince. Right now his little sister is using medicine from the Temple of Light to extend her life, that\u2019s why he would work so strenuously for the Temple of Life.\u201d Walter disdainfully said, \u201cYou thought he really pities humans from the bottom of his heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash, Claire finally understood why with that kind of indifferent personality Leng Lingyun would become a healer. It turns out everything was for his little sister.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, now I\u2019ll be troubling you.\u201d Claire quietly said to Cliff, looking at the room that was completely filled with infected people.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Cliff understood what Claire meant. He thumped his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll immediately mobilize the magicians from this city\u2019s Magician Council to help investigate and find the tracks of that necromancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe opponent is no ordinary person, after they find it, make sure they definitely don\u2019t act blindly.\u201d Claire warned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll first go to the Magician Council.\u201d Cliff energetically walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, let\u2019s go, we\u2019ll also go look.\u201d Claire softly breathed out, glancing at the room filled completely with sick people.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jean followed Claire from behind, his head lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Prince, I\u2019ll be troubling you to take care of this side.\u201d Claire politely said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something I should do.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled lightly.</p><br/><p>Claire went out the door with Jean. She sighed quietly. She always felt stifled when interacting with Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>Niya City was desolate. The commoners all closed their doors tightly, not taking a single step outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter, do you have any method to block this Dark aura from expanding?\u201d Claire and Jean walked in the empty street, feeling many ill gazes shot from the cracks of doors or windows.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is, but it\u2019s very troublesome. Dark aura can\u2019t enter anything with Light aura. How would these commoners have a Light physique? Weak people who often get sick and women and children who are always weak are the first to get infected.\u201d Walter said bluntly.</p><br/><p>There are very few people with a Light physique so the people who haven\u2019t been infected yet are physically strong. If it continues like this, all the people in this city will be infected. The top priority was to find the necromancer.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there is a method to block the spreading.\u201d Walter started vulgarly smiled. \u201cWho here has the thickest Light aura?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course the answer was Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall that guy to baptise all the people here who haven\u2019t been infected yet and get each and every one to receive his Light aura. Haha, that way you can temporarily block it.\u201d Walter said, harboring ill intentions. Niya City still has that many people, haha, it\u2019ll tire this violet eyed silver haired pretty boy to death, ahaha. The more Walter thought about it, the happier he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will be his own decision. If he\u2019s willing to baptise, then naturally it will be good, but if he\u2019s not willing, we can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d Claire said insipidly.</p><br/><p>Claire and Jean patrolled the city, but weren\u2019t able to discover any anomalies.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you sense where the Dark aura is thickest?\u201d Claire asked and turned towards the overcast sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t feel anything for the time being.\u201d Walter honestly answered.</p><br/><p>Niya City was desolately peaceful, the streets lonely and empty.</p><br/><p>Once they went back to the castle, Leng Lingyun was already back, sitting in the main hall, resting.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Claire, you came back.\u201d Once Leng Lingyun saw Claire, he immediately got up. \u201cI was waiting for you, I have a request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Claire was a bit surprised. Leng Lingyun actually was asking for a request.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Miss Claire, use your status as the Castellan to summon all the people in the city to the gather in the public square. I discovered those Dark aura seem to hate Light aura very much, so I want to give them a baptism to make them not be infected with Dark aura any more.\u201d After Leng Lingyun said this kind of request, Claire was a bit stunned. She hadn\u2019t spoken yet but Leng Lingyun had already said this kind of request.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there are so many people in the city\u2026\u201d Claire was a bit hesitant. If it was really like what Walter said, then it was really possible that Leng Lingyun wouldn\u2019t sleep for a few days and nights.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pope sent me to assist you, you don\u2019t need to have any misgivings. I have the quickest method to block the Dark aura from spreading.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then I will immediately call people to do this.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t decline anymore. Before they found that necromancer, they couldn\u2019t let take anyone else\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWahaha, tire this pretty boy to death. Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah yeah~~\u201d Walter\u2019s schadenfreude voice sounded in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Claire expressionlessly reached into the bag and pinched the Spiritual stone, hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah~~~\u2014-\u201d Walter was like a machine that ran out of power, his yeah pitch stretching very long and then gradually lowered until there was no sound.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

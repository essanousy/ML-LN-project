She gently lifted her hand to catch Gutton\u2019s fist, but she didn\u2019t crush it. Instead, she grabbed the fist and slowly rolled it up. Gutton\u2019s hand was completely crippled. Terrifying screams filled the entire study. Gutton was twitching in pain. He could never have imagined that the person in front of him would treat him in such a cruel manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon, you demon \u2026\u201d Gutton was in so much pain that it was hard for him to say these words. His hatred for Qi Aoshuang deepened.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang laughed mockingly, \u201cYou are not the first one to say that about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gently waved her hand and shook Gutton off. Gutton\u2019s body viciously slammed into the wall behind him. Then, his entire body slowly slid down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hill Family, that was originally standing tall \u2026\u201d Gutton mumbled as he laid on the ground with dazed eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, this continent will no longer have the Hill Family.\u201d Without a trace of warmth in the depths of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes, she raised her hand and flicked her finger. The rose pattern on the wall suddenly burned and then melted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d \u201cGutton screamed like a madman and struggled to stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you are my match?\u201d Qi Aoshuang asked with a sneer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sinner! To make that our Hill Family would end up like this! You deserve to die. Even if you die a hundred or even a thousand times, ten thousand times wouldn\u2019t be enough to make up for the heinous crime you\u2019ve committed!\u201d Gutton suddenly roared with a ferocious look on his face. His face was completely distorted and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked at Gutton quietly. This person had been completely corrupted by fame and wealth, and no longer had any human feelings. Sad or ridiculous?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell! You slut of unknown origins!\u201d Gutton laughed crazily. Dazzling Dou Qi once again burst out from his body, and he ferociously smashed down with his hand.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was startled, and a sense of foreboding rose in her heart. This feeling was exactly the same as when he was ambushed by the people in the Radiant Temple! Instead of hitting her, Gutton hit the floor.</p><br/><p>The people outside were all waiting patiently, because in this place, there was probably no one who could hurt Qi Aoshuang. Thus, no one was worried about Qi Aoshuang going in alone to face Gutton.</p><br/><p>However, the next moment, everyone\u2019s faces turned pale \u2026</p><br/><p>A loud explosion resounded across the horizon. It was deafening! In front of them, the intense white light pierced so hard that it made it impossible for people to open their eyes. A violent blast of air rushed over and blew away everything in its surroundings. The debris of the building flew everywhere. At this moment, the White Emperor and Black Feather quickly opened their barrier, blocking this violent blast of air. Their vision was snow-white, and he could not see anything. A huge mushroom cloud rose into the sky.</p><br/><p>As the scene became clearer, everyone\u2019s hearts sank as they saw the scene in front of them.</p><br/><p>The enormous Hill Mansion had been razed to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s face was pale as he rushed forward. There was no one! There was no shadow of Ao Shuang!</p><br/><p>The faces of the White Emperor and Black Feather paled even more, because they had a contract with Qi Aoshuang. However, they could not sense the existence of Qi Aoshuang at all! What did this mean? They didn\u2019t dare to think about it or say anything. Impossible! How could this be possible?!</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun stared blankly at the ruins in front of her, his hands were trembling. How could this be? Could it be that they were the ones to intervene? Impossible! Since they wanted him to go with them and had already promised him, they wouldn\u2019t do anything to harm her! However, what was going on now?</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s pupils had already lost their focus. where is Miss?</p><br/><p>Rasiah rushed in like a madman, \u201cElder sister! Elder sister! Where are you? Elder sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was filled with fear and despair, a mocking voice came from the sky, \u201cAiyaya, it\u2019s really dangerous. If I was a bit late, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the cute Little Aoshuang.\u201d The White Emperor and Black Feather were finally able to relax a little, because they could sense the existence of Qi Aoshuang through the contract.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked up and saw Camil with a gentle smile on her face floating in the air with Qi Aoshuang in her arms. As for Qi Aoshuang, she had already fainted.</p><br/><p>Camil slowly descended, and everyone began to surround him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s all right.\u201d \u201cCamil is smiling with narrowed eyes.\u201d However, I never thought that this old fox Gutton would actually use a Magic Crystal Bomb. This thing has missed many years ago, yet he has it in stock. \u201d</p><br/><p>Rasiah looked at Camil in a daze. Wasn\u2019t Camil a scholar? Why did he suddenly appear here? Why fly? What was going on? A Magic Crystal Bomb? What was that?</p><br/><p>The rest of the group looked at the unconscious Qi Aoshuang with lingering fear. So it was a Magic Crystal Bomb, no wonder it had such destructive power. He didn\u2019t expect that old thing to have the urge to die together with Ao Shuang. Camil had appeared just in time to save Qi Aoshuang. This was not something an ordinary expert could do. Besides being worried for Qi Aoshuang, the crowd was also wondering who Camil was to actually be able to achieve such a feat.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She just fainted.\u201d Camil carried Qi Aoshuang as he said indifferently to the crowd, \u201cAlright, it\u2019s over.\u201d \u201cYou can do the aftermath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything seemed to be settled.</p><br/><p>Three days after the occupation, the Emperor of Ragka announced to the world that the Radiant Temple and Gutton, Hill had conspired with each other to frame Claire Hill. He revealed all of the crimes of the Radiant Temple, causing quite a bit of chaos. The Order Temple was established very quickly. Everything was being made up by the people of the Dark Temple. The Dark Temple became the Order Temple, slowly permeating human life. The Emperor of Ragka was wise. Three months later Ragka withdrew. This victory was all thanks to the dragon clan. The dragon clan had left. Amper Land was originally a powerful country. It wouldn\u2019t be willing to become a Servant of the Lost Country, so it was inevitable that it would retaliate. This war as an abuser is unjust. Rather than a country that is always afraid of being lost, it is better to have a subordinate state that can give the greatest benefit. Three months later, the royal family of Amper Land, Nancy Yardley, signed unequal treaties with Ragka and Uzzari, and they paid reparations to both countries, paying tribute to Ragka every year. For a long time afterward, Amper Land did not escape the fate of becoming a subordinate state of Ragka. It wasn\u2019t until a long time later that the situation changed.</p><br/><p>In the simple and elegant bedroom, on the pure white bed Qi Aoshuang lay with her eyes closed. She still hadn\u2019t woken up. They temporarily stayed in Camil\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qi Aoshuang felt like a lonely boat drifting in the vast ocean. It\u2019s over, it\u2019s all over\u2026</p><br/><p>There was a warm feeling on his forehead. What was it? Leng Lingyun stood silently in front of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s bed, looking deeply at Qi Aoshuang\u2019s peaceful face. Slowly, Leng Lingyun reached out her hand and gently touched Qi Aoshuang\u2019s forehead, face, nose, and lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, take care of yourself.\u201d Leng Lingyun slowly lowered his head and placed a gentle kiss on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s forehead. Leng Lingyun slowly stood up, his eyes filled with boundless longing. For the first time in a long time, he looked at his heart. So it turned out that Ao Shuang was already so important in his heart \u2026</p><br/><p>However, it was too late. Leng Lingyun smiled sadly and rubbed his right eye. A purple crystal appeared in his hand. As for Leng Lingyun\u2019s purple eye, it turned into nothingness! Leng Lingyun looked at the purple crystal in his hand. Without hesitation, he gently pressed the crystal against Qi Aoshuang\u2019s right earlobe. The purple crystal seemed to have a life of its own as it gently embedded itself into Qi Aoshuang\u2019s earlobe, turning it into a beautiful purple crystal earring. It shone with a bewitching light.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow generous of you!\u201d Suddenly, a mocking voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun turned to look at the source of the voice. Camil was leaning against the wall with a smile on his face. Camil had a Treasure Cat perched on his shoulder, but the Treasure Cat was strangely quiet. A pair of amber eyes flashed with a dim light, silently watching everything in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamil\u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun said these two words with a low voice and a complicated tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you release your seal? When did you remember all of this?\u201d Camil asked with a smile, squinting his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy seal has not been completely released.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled bitterly and said, \u201cI remembered it not long after I got to Ragka.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, have you finally remembered who you are?\u201d Camil casually stepped forward, looked at Leng Lingyun\u2019s empty right eye and smiled, \u201cAre you really going to give her half of this?\u201d Leng Lingyun did not say anything, but tacitly agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou remembered everything, so you decided to leave?\u201d Camil touches his pretty chin and smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy memory is broken, but I already know who I am.\u201d Leng Lingyun turned to look at Qi Aoshuang lying on the bed, his eyes filled with reluctance.</p><br/><p>Camil laughed softly. \u201cSo, you think your identity make you impossible to be with her. Why don\u2019t you let go of her and give her to Feng Yixuan instead? Give her to an ordinary human, a human who can give her happiness?\u201d Leng Lingyun was silent again.</p><br/><p>A glimmer flashed in Camil\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, a person dressed in black appeared in the room. He didn\u2019t look at Camil but knelt on one knee in front of Leng Lingyun. The cold voice didn\u2019t have a trace of warmth in it, \u201cking, we should leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back often when you have time.\u201d Camil says with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent!\u201d That man in black stood up and was about to attack Camil, but in the next moment, his entire body trembled, and he laid on the ground, not daring to get up.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay attention to the tone of your voice. I\u2019ll spare your life due to Xiao Yun today.\u201d Although Camil was smiling, his tone was extremely cold.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

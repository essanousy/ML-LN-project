His excessively cautious nature wouldn\u2019t let you continue to grow. That day, your fight scared that fat pig.\u201d Jean laughed quietly. It was unusual that words like these would come out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Claire sighed lightly. That day\u2019s victory was really a fluke. People like the pope probably understood why she won. That\u2019s why the pope didn\u2019t care at all. But that ambassador seemed to firmly believe that she really had that strength and power. Alas, just as expected\u2026 She felt a bit wronged.</p><br/><p>As Walter heard Claire\u2019s quiet sigh, he naturally understood what Claire was thinking and wanted to laugh again. But just like before, he didn\u2019t dare to.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it seems like you don\u2019t need to do anything.\u201d Claire squinted, sensing the activity outside. It was two groups of people, the group in the back had already targeting the somewhat impatient group in front. Claire immediately understood that it was definitely people sent by Grandfather to protect her. Grandfather had already anticipated this kind of situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so we should continue to go.\u201d Jean sensed the movements outside and smiled. Those people are waiting, waiting until they got to a secluded area to make to move. But, once they arrived at such a place, who knows who will attack who.</p><br/><p>And like so, the carriage proceeded uneventfully to the door of the Magic Guild. When the apprentice magician at the door saw who got off, he immediately came up and welcomed them. Claire Hill, this great name, resounded through the capital overnight.</p><br/><p>Claire and Jean were led by the apprentice magician to the huge magic elevator and went directly to Cliff\u2019s lab on the top floor. The apprentice magician bowed and then took the elevator back down.</p><br/><p>Claire knocked on the door. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d The clear voice of Cliff came from the inside with a little rage.</p><br/><p>Walter tried to hold in his laughter; this old man was really very childish. He was clearly inside, yet he still said he wasn\u2019t. It was very obvious he was still angry about the matter of Claire learning Dou Qi and not telling him. This was normal, for regardless if it was warriors learning magic or magicians learning Dou Qi, their master would definitely feel humiliated and furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I apologize. I will agree to any request you want.\u201d Claire said this sentence slowly and clearly, smiling lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d The next moment, the door was suddenly thrown open, and Cliff\u2019s grinning face popped out.</p><br/><p>Walter twitched. This little devil, oh yeah, little devil\u2026 She actually dared to say this kind of resolute words, then\u2026 Walter looked at Cliff somewhat sympathetically. The poor guy, he will definitely, absolutely be tricked! Completely, absolutely! He swore\uff01</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d Claire nodded and said assuredly, \u201cWhatever makes Master not angry. I am learning Dou Qi only for self-defense. If I\u2019m in an emergency situation and I don\u2019t have enough time to chant any spells, I can still escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff pursed his lips, pouting, and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI encountered an assassin on the way here. With my identity, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll often encounter such situations in the future, Master. Master\u2019s teaching of magic is the real deal. I only use Dou Qi to escape. Master, do I still have the heart to use spells when someone already pierced my chest?\u201d Claire took a breath, asking in a fake, pitiful way.</p><br/><p>Cliff grabbed his hair and bitterly rubbed. He said angrily, \u201cWho wants to kill you? If they dare to touch you, I will go place a forbidden spell on his entire family and blow them up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jean and Walter both twitched their mouths. Blow up a whole family with a forbidden spell? They were afraid that he would not blow up just a clan, but an entire city.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not angry anymore, Master?\u201d Claire laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do what you just promised, then I won\u2019t get angry.\u201d Cliff said after he moved out of the way to let them in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but only one request.\u201d There was an imperceivable flash of craftiness in Claire\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, one request, one request.\u201d Cliff\u2019s eyes fell on Claire\u2019s beautiful lace skirt, looking all over.</p><br/><p>Walter and Jean immediately understood what the old perverted wolf wanted to do. He wanted to do something he had never succeeded at: lifting Claire\u2019s skirt!!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, then\u2026 I want to lift your skirt, and you are not allowed to kick my face.\u201d Cliff said, embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d To Jean and Walter\u2019s astonishment, Claire actually agreed to the request.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Walter confirmed again with certainty, absolute certainty, that little devil was a little devil! Never mess with her, and don\u2019t try to take the slightest bit advantage of her.</p><br/><p>Cliff lifted Claire\u2019s skirt with great excitement, then Cliff\u2019s smile froze. Claire was wearing sturdy pants used for training!!! The pants were wrapped tightly around Claire\u2019s legs, completely airtight.</p><br/><p>Claire calmly pulled her skirt down, saying softly to a dumbfounded Cliff, \u201cMaster, I met your request. Are you not angry now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cliff face was ashen as his mouth twitched, \u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Walter had already flipped from laughing. As expected, this perverted old man would be tricked. But Claire, this little devil, was so clever, actually guessing beforehand accurately that Cliff would bring up this kind of shameless request and even thought of a countermeasure. Jean also stifled a laugh from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I wanted you to look at this.\u201d Claire took White Emperor out of her bosom. \u201cWhat kind of magic beast is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Cliff looked at the small furball in Claire\u2019s hands in amazement. \u201cSince when did you like this kind of cute pet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster doesn\u2019t recognize it?\u201d Claire was puzzled. If even the wizard sage Cliff didn\u2019t know, then there was really no way of knowing the identity of this little thing.</p><br/><p>Cliff frowned and looked seriously at the little thing in Claire\u2019s arms, peering at it over and over, and then shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen nor heard of it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire frowned slightly and looked down at White Emperor in her embrace. This little guy appeared in a strange manner, and his contract was contracted boldly and forcefully. No matter how she looked at it, she could only sense this little guy was just a cute small animal and didn\u2019t seemed like a magic beast powerful enough to force a contract.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire! When my experiments are done, you must come with me to cultivate and follow me closely.\u201d Cliff snorted, still feeling so wronged and cheated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, okay, but Master, you seem to have been doing these experiments for a long time?\u201d Claire asked, puzzled, and put the matter of White Emperor aside for the time being.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaterials are rare and hard to find.\u201d Cliff frowned and sighed, \u201cRight, since you came today, I\u2019ll teach you some spells while you are here. Remember it yourself.\u201d After Cliff finished speaking, he stretched out his hand, and just like that, a soft light entered Claire\u2019s mind and a few unfamiliar spells entered Claire\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. If there are no problems, you can leave now. Once I am finished on my end, I will go find you.\u201d Cliff said as he waved.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded, backing out of the room with White Emperor in her arms.</p><br/><p>The moment Claire got on her carriage in front of the entrance of the Magician Council, she saw another carriage stop. The emblem on the carriage was very distinct; it was the emblem of the Temple of Light.</p><br/><p>What was the Temple of Light doing here\uff1f</p><br/><p>Claire looked out the window and came to realization when she saw Lawrence exiting the carriage energetically. So it was Master\u2019s old friend. But usually, the Temple of Light and the Magician Council never interfered in each other\u2019s affairs and the two of them only fought in private to avoid attention. Why would Lawson appear here today?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, it\u2019s a bit strange.\u201d Jean also felt something was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf those hypocrites from the Temple of Light appear here boldly, does that mean it\u2019s almost the time for the prophecy?\u201d Walter\u2019s voice sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat prophecy?\u201d Claire asked quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust some stupid nonsense, a prophecy from a thousand years ago. Something about a double-black woman appearing, overturning the Light.\u201d Walter replied indifferently, \u201cThere has never been a woman with both black irises and black hair, so it\u2019s just nonsense. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go the the capital\u2019s library. I want to go see if there\u2019s any illustrated handbooks for beasts that I haven\u2019t read yet and what type of being this little creature really is.\u201d Claire looked down at the White Emperor who was currently lying quietly in her arms.</p><br/><p>The library of the capital, with large, tall white jade doors and a grand statue of a book in the entrance, symbolized wisdom.</p><br/><p>Claire had come here often before, but not for reading, and instead, to look for handsome men.</p><br/><p>When Claire\u2019s figure appeared in the library doorway, there was a small commotion. All the young girls and boys looked at her, gossiping quietly.</p><br/><p>The phrase Claire heard the most was \u201cMiracle Claire\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when did I have such a title?\u201d Claire frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom when you displayed both magic and Dou Qi and defeated that youth, the whole capital has been calling Miss Miracle Claire.\u201d Jean answered quietly. The sister of genius Lashia, Miracle Claire.</p><br/><p>Boring, Claire cursed in her heart and walked towards the miscellaneous section.</p><br/><p>A few unfriendly gazes followed Claire closely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

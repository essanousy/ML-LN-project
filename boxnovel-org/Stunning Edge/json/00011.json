Their eyes were full of loathing and disgust, not bothering to hide it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Claire, why hasn\u2019t Lashia come to the Institute these days?\u201d A noble lady who was Lashia\u2019s best friend asked in a low voice while suppressing her hate.</p><br/><p>Claire rose and coldly looked at the group of adolescents. She didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with them. Claire knew their intentions clearly. If it wasn\u2019t for Lashia, these people would have never talked to her.</p><br/><p>The group of people saw the cold look in her eyes and started to get nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Claire turned to leave, paying no attention to the group. Right now, she wanted to find a peaceful place to absorb the day\u2019s lesson, not waste time on responding to these senseless people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of attitude is that? You don\u2019t know? You\u2019re Lashia\u2019s older sister, how could you not know?\u201d The most impulsive boy of the group finally couldn\u2019t hold back and blurted out. Lashia had not appeared for many days. As one of Lashia\u2019s most faithful fans, he was naturally anxious to know.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t respond to their shouts and continued on her way. Talking to these conceited and foolish nobles was a complete waste of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop right there! What kind of attitude is that! You man-chaser.\u201d Finally that impulsive noble made some lousy word choices and spoke out rudely.</p><br/><p>The leading girl glared at the person who just spoke. Obviously, even if he was telling the truth, it was still very rude.</p><br/><p>Claire looked back a little and indifferently cast a gaze at them. Just this indifferent look made them feel so cold it was as if they were in an icehouse. That kind of icy coldness pierced through their bones, pierced through their soul and made them shiver. What kind of look was that, without any emotion. There was only coldness, cruelty, and bloodlust.</p><br/><p>The small crowd just stood there, stunned, their minds blank.</p><br/><p>Claire turned her head back around and kept on walking, leaving the people who were too stunned to move where they were.</p><br/><p>Not until when Claire disappeared from their eyesight, did the students come back to their senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho, who is she?\u201d The boy that was rude before opened his mouth nervously.</p><br/><p>The crowd kept silent. That definitely was the infamous man-crazy Claire, but why was she totally not like herself? So ruthless, so frightening.</p><br/><p>For one month, Lashia didn\u2019t show up. And one month later there was no school because of summer break. During this one month, Emery was astonished to find that he had totally no idea how much Claire had improved. Claire always brought him surprises.</p><br/><p>The Hill castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what do you plan on doing during the two months of summer break?\u201d Emery asked as he watched Claire play with five fireballs on her five fingers. To control so many fireballs at the same time with such precision would come to him as a shock if someone else did it. But for Claire it wasn\u2019t strange. In only a month, Claire had given him too many surprises.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I keep feeling like I\u2019m missing something, but I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d Claire extinguished the fireballs in her hand, a little distressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not be impatient, Claire, there\u2019s still much to learn. You can\u2019t learn everything in just a short period of time. Remember, never be impatient.\u201d Emery misunderstood Claire and thought that Claire wanted to learn more.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, teacher, I\u2019m not talking about this.\u201d Claire shook her head slightly. \u201cI have always kept teacher\u2019s words in my heart. Learning magic is a slow process and you can\u2019t be impatient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you talking about?\u201d Emery was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure either. It\u2019s just that a few times I seem to have grasped something, but the next moment it disappears.\u201d Claire said a bit troubled.</p><br/><p>Emery frowned, thinking. Since enrolling in school, Claire had not been tested again. Is she on the verge of a breakthrough?</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep feeling that magic is too simple and bare, but I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Claire said in a low tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe, perhaps\u2026\u2026\u201d Emery hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Teacher?\u201d It was Claire\u2019s turn to be confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe your mental power is strong enough to study that arcanum.\u201d Emery still hesitated to tell Claire to go search for that arcanum. It was dangerous to study Arcanum, because if your mental power was not strong enough, there would only be two outcomes: die slowly or die quickly!</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is it?\u201d Claire became interested.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you know that all magic has forms. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a magician or warrior, all their attacks are tangible. For magic, the longer the chant the more powerful the spell. At those times a warrior is needed to protect the magician. Of course, the Dou Qi of warriors also has forms.\u201d Emery cleared his throat and said seriously, \u201cBut there is a kind of attack that is invisible and very hard to detect and defend against.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Claire was even more interested.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Emery nodded, then added seriously, \u201cBut the learning risk is also higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is it?\u201d Claire urged.</p><br/><p>Emery didn\u2019t speak, but looked around, took out a magic wand and waved it lightly in the air. A light blue circle rippled out and covered the entire room. Claire knew that this magic hood blocked all magic so no one could eavesdrop.</p><br/><p>After finishing all these, Emery put away his wand and said in a low tone, \u201cMental Assault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire was dumbfounded. Mental Assault!</p><br/><p>\u201cAttacking a person\u2019s mind directly has no tangible form and no way to detect beforehand.\u201d Emery was very solemn. \u201cOf course, it doesn\u2019t affect those who are truly powerful, but to a normal person it is very effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the worst cases, it can directly turn someone into a vegetable, and in best cases, the user would be conversely swallowed by magic and seriously injured,\u201d Emery explained. \u201cOf course, this kind of Arcanum is looked down by many people because they can\u2019t grasp, use, or defend against this magic. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, teacher.\u201d A cold smile emerged from Claire\u2019s lips. \u201cHumans are always afraid of uncontrollable, foreign things. They then try to destroy them with all their might.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time Emery was dumbfounded. Such a philosophical thought came from this young girl who was only thirteen!</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, how would I be able to learn such an Arcanum? Tell me please!\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes were filled with excitement and challenge.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Emery nodded. He didn\u2019t think of Claire as a child now anymore, but as an adult. \u201cI once had a friend who learned the Arcanum, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t comprehend the essence. So\u2026 \u201d Emery\u2019s expression became heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, teacher, for reminding you of such a heartbreaking matter,\u201d Claire guiltily apologized.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Claire. I had urged him not to do so, but he didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Emery organized his emotions and continued on, \u201cHe hid the Arcanum in his secret chamber where he lives in seclusion, wishing I would go get it some day. But for me, I never want to touch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak, listening intently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will give you a map of his secluded retreat, it\u2019s right in the middle of Gale Gorge. Use the summer break to go develop your skills there. Real life combat always overrules theories. The magical Beasts at the mouth of Gale Gorge are all pretty low level, and you have Jean as a companion, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine. But remember, do not go deep into Gale Gorge. This, you must promise me, and only then will I give you the map.\u201d Emery spoke to Claire in a solemn tone.</p><br/><p>Claire felt very touched. She knew Emery had said this because he was worried for her.</p><br/><p>Only after Claire nodded and solemnly promised to Emery did he pull out a map from his bosom and give it to Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be careful. When you come across a dangerous situation that you are unable to cope with, get Jean to shield you and immediately use the Space Teleportation Scroll, okay?\u201d Emery warned again. Although he wouldn\u2019t admit Claire was his disciple, he still treated her as if she were his only disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely safely return,\u201d Claire replied while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Emery smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>When Claire suggested to use the summer break to go to Gale Gorge to train, Duke Gordan was extremely happy. The Hill family never had a pampered child! Only Katherine was really worried. Duke Gordan had to spend a lot of effort comforting her in order to make her concede. Claire\u2019s two older brothers weren\u2019t at home yet. One was still in his ligeance, and the other was in the imperial palace acting as the captain of the Griffin Squad. Her father was getting rid of problems at the frontier.</p><br/><p>Without any ceremony, Duke Gordan gave Claire enough money and sent her and Jean off riding their horses, keeping everything low key.</p><br/><p>So, on this refreshing morning, the two left on their horses. Nobody would believe that just outside the city gates, Claire would meet a person that would influence her greatly for the rest of her life.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

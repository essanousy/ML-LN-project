I\u2019m not interested in you, yet you said such words. You\u2019re going to laugh me to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d You\u2019re courting death! Am I that shallow of a person? In this world, who could understand men better than me? I\u2019ve read countless people. Do I not know whether they are men or women? You dare to say that any woman knows men better than I do, I will immediately jump into the river! \u201d Azana roared in anger, and there was a hint of pride in her tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jonathan touched his chin, narrowed his eyes, and looked around Arnie. Then he exclaimed, \u201cIndeed, the woman who knows men best is you. Some men don\u2019t even know as much about themselves as you do.\u201d \u201cWho told you to splash light everywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPah!\u201d \u201cAre you praising me or insulting me?\u201d Ashanina crossed her arms and pouted unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf.\u201d \u201cBut you said that Qi Ao Shuang is a woman, so funny.\u201d The corner of Jonathan\u2019s mouth twitched. There was a hint of disdain in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not explain clearly, I said that I suspect that the main body of Qi Ao Shuang is a woman.\u201d Ashanina put away her angry look and turned serious instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jonathan frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also know that there are some treasures that can change a person\u2019s gender. I thought it was the same thing at first, but I didn\u2019t think so. \u201cIf you want to know if she\u2019s a woman, you\u2019ll know when you take a look at the mirror.\u201d Ashanina\u2019s expression became more and more serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d You actually have a God Equipment like the True Knowledge Mirror? \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Jonathan went crazy at the name of the mirror. That was a divine artifact, a divine artifact that could see a person\u2019s true appearance. How could the witch have such a treasure?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s fake.\u201d Asana said lightly.</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s mouth twitched in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure about the mirror, but it\u2019s the best facet of imitation. It was a SemiGod Equipment. Although he couldn\u2019t completely see a person\u2019s true appearance, he could still take a general look at it. \u201cIn any case, Qi Ao Shuang is not a man.\u201d Ashanina pursed her lips and said angrily, \u201cThere are only a few men in this world who are unmoved by my actions.\u201d One was someone who had a crush on him, and the other was someone who couldn\u2019t see a woman in his eyes, such as Dittas, that pervert. The last one was a woman! \u201cQi Ao Shuang belongs to the first two?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jonathan stroked his chin and thought for a while. After a while, he looked at the fuming Arasana and said, \u201cWitch, Qi Ao Shuang is a loyal person. I am sure of this.\u201d I knew it the first time I saw him. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you think of him as your friend.\u201d Asana pouted, \u201cSo he treated women like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s very gentle with both Paulina and his senior apprentice-sister.\u201d So rule out the second possibility you\u2019re talking about. I really don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in anyone, sweetheart. Although he was good to both women, he kept his distance. \u201cIt definitely won\u2019t be that kind of feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat means neither the first nor the second is possible?\u201d That\u2019s the third kind. Just take a look at it in my mirror! \u201cNo matter what kind of treasure changes her gender, she won\u2019t be able to hide!\u201d Asana snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, you\u2019re narrow-minded!\u201d Isn\u2019t it just someone treating you coldly, do you have to do that? \u201cHow unbalanced!\u201d Jonathan could not calm himself no longer. Xiao Aushuang, was she a woman? Woman?! How is that possible? If Xiao Aushuang was really a woman \u2026</p><br/><p>Jonathan was absent-minded and did not pay any more attention to the noisy conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a woman, a woman.\u201d Jonathan, you depress! \u201cGive me the mirror, I want you to find a chance to see the real Qi Ao Shuang!\u201d Aranina shoved the mirror into Jonathan\u2019s hand, and only then did Jonathan come back to his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be a woman! It must be a woman! Otherwise, why would she turn a blind eye to me!?\u201d Asana said hatefully. She rolled her eyes and said to Jonathan, \u201cSmelly brat, remember to tell me the results as soon as you get it.\u201d I\u2019ll leave the mirror here for you, and return it to me when I\u2019m done. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll break your dog legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you have heart?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m your only brother.\u201d Jonathan howled, but kept the mirror tightly in his hand. Disapproving of the other party\u2019s words, he started to panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cPah!\u201d \u201cThis old lady has had nothing to do with your family for a long time. I\u2019ll be happy if you die!\u201d Asana spat, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bit of gentleness in her eyes. Although this only younger brother was a member of that family, he was the only relative she had to admit to.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk \u2026\u201d He was lying. \u201cThen go ahead. I\u2019ll find a chance to see it.\u201d Jonathan nodded, a little absent-minded.</p><br/><p>After Aranina left, Jonathan took out the mirror from his pocket and looked at himself in the mirror in a daze. He murmured, \u201cWoman?\u201d Could he be a woman? Will it? It can\u2019t be? \u201cOr is it possible?\u201d For a moment Jonathan did not know how he really felt. Shock, astonishment, anticipation, disbelief \u2026. Complex emotions almost completely submerged him. Holding the mirror in his hand, Jonathan\u2019s mind flew to the first time he saw Qi Ao Shuang. The youth with an indifferent expression calmly pushed open the door. This was the first time he had revealed a carefree smile to her, the first time he had revealed a helpless expression to her, the first time he had put his arm around her shoulder \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Wait!</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He remembered something.</p><br/><p>The first time he put his arm around Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder, the eyes of the guard beside Qi Ao Shuang were like torches, staring at his own hand on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder! That look was very unusual! It was perfectly normal for men to put their arms around each other! But why did the guard look that way? His eyes burned with desire to burn his hands. There was a problem! There was a problem! That guard likes men? Pah pah! Jonathan was disgusted by his conjecture. Then, there was another possibility!</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang, could she be a woman? Would it? If so, then.</p><br/><p>Jonathan stood there for a long time, his face unsettled. Finally, he put the mirror away and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s bedroom had already been changed. It was a single room. All of the 8-star students living on the ninth floor were in private dormitories with good environment. In between Jonathan and Dittos. When Qi Aushuang returned to her room, she had just finished showering and changing her clothes when there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe.\u201d Jonathan squeezed the mirror, his palms sweating.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang sat down and said to the door.</p><br/><p>Jonathan pushed the door open. He saw Qi Aushuang, who had just finished her shower. Her fiery red hair was loose on her shoulders. Droplets of water dripped down from her hair. Her misty eyes revealed her enchanting beauty. Jonathan was stunned, even forgetting his original purpose.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked as she rubbed her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that, that \u2026\u201d Jonathan pulled at the mirror in his hand, trying to figure out how to look at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a hurried knocking sound came from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d \u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d The voice outside the door was a voice they all knew. It\u2019s Parina!</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang stood up and went to open the door. Outside the door was Parina\u2019s anxious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, quick, quick \u2026\u201d \u201cMy brother, my brother \u2026\u201d Parina was gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cSpeak slowly.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang frowned slightly. Looking at the expression on her face, he knew that something had changed, and that it was definitely not a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother has entered the Heavenly Pagoda!\u201d It was the dean who let him in! What should he do? What should he do? \u201cBig brother is in danger!\u201d Parina lowered her voice anxiously as she spoke to Xiao Aushuang.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang frowned and immediately understood what the headmaster meant. Since Parina\u2019s brother had listened to her and stayed behind the entire time without cultivating, he was naturally unable to break through for the time being. The headmaster was worried, so he let him enter the Heavenly Pagoda, hoping that he could break through. However, if he couldn\u2019t break through, would he be able to make it out alive?</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Ao Shuang, please go in and see him.\u201d You are the only one I know who has the right to enter the Sky Tower at any time. \u201cI\u2019m so worried \u2026\u201d Parina\u2019s voice became choked with sobs.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, Parina, don\u2019t cry. I\u2019ll go now.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang reached out her hand and gently rubbed Parina\u2019s head, then nodded and promised, \u201cI will go in now, and I will definitely not let anything happen to him. I will definitely bring him out safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Aoshuang, thank you, wuu, thank you \u2026\u201d Parina wiped her eyes and smiled through her tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you go back first. I\u2019ll go in now.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang did not care about anything else. She gently pushed away Parina and quickly walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to be careful too!\u201d Parina worriedly reminded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice drifted over from afar.</p><br/><p>Jonathan watched Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back get farther and farther away. Then, he came back to his senses and chased after her.</p><br/><p>At this time, the door to Dittas\u2019 room opened. Dittas glanced at the teary-faced Perina, then looked at the two people in the corridor. Frowning slightly, he didn\u2019t say anything and quickly followed after them.</p><br/><p>Jonathan was in a hurry to catch up with her, holding the mirror in his hand and desperately trying to catch Qi Ao Shuang. However, he was unable to see her because she was running in front of him.</p><br/><p>Finally, at a bend, Jonathan looked into the mirror to see Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>In the mirror, a beautiful figure flashed by. Her beautiful black hair fluttered in the wind. Only her back, only her back!</p><br/><p>But this brief glimpse was enough.</p><br/><p>Jonathan stood there stupidly and did not take another step forward. He just stared at the mirror in his hand in a daze.</p><br/><p>Had he seen wrongly?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

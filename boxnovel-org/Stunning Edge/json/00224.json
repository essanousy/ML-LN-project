She stared at the window curtain while her thoughts flew far away.</p><br/><p>The vows she made that day were still fresh in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will come back, I will definitely come back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Radiant Temple, the Duke of Gutton, are you prepared for my return?</p><br/><p>Early next morning, a huge knock on the door woke Qi Aoshuang up. She almost jumped up from her bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang! Open the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang,! Get up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy apprentice, come out and let me take a good look at you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang quickly put on her clothes. The Treasure Cat was very dissatisfied. She stretched out her meaty front paws and pressed down on her fluffy ears, arched her body, stuck out her little butt and went back to sleep.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qi Aoshuang opened the door, the people outside rushed towards her. The first one was Qiao Chuxin, then Cliff, then Waldo. They pushed up, pressing her down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang, you\u2019re finally back.\u201d Qiao Chuxin hold her tightly, \u201cYou just disappeared without a word. I thought Camil kidnapped you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear Aoshuang, I found you, I finally found you.\u201d Cliff tore off Qiao Chuxin\u2019s hand and pushed Waldo aside. Qi Aoshuang hugged him and started howling. \u201cAoshuang, you suffered. Master will help you get it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Waldo stamped his feet in anger. There stood his Aoshuang, but the old fellow pushed him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I\u2019m fine, right?\u201d Only then did Qi Aoshuang come back to her senses. She patted Cliff\u2019s back to comfort him, but her heart was warm.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun and Jean stood at the door quietly, looking at Qi Aoshuang without saying anything. However, there was an indescribable emotion in their eyes. Oscar stood behind them, with his arms folded across his chest. It had only been 3 months since they last saw each other, but the girl\u2019s strength had increased and she seemed to have become even more beautiful. Dong Fenghou stood beside Oscar, still at a loss. Camil was at the very back, yawning. White Emperor and Black Feather hadn\u2019t woken up yet.</p><br/><p>The breakfast was a lively affair. When Qi Aoshuang introduced White Emperor and Black Feather, who had returned to their human form, everyone was extremely surprised. They could not believe these two super beauties were White Emperor and Black Feather! As the host, Rongzas was present as well. At this time, Rongzas was already the noble king of Uzzari. He wore luxurious clothing, a glittering crown on his head, and a gorgeous tattoo on his waist. His mannerism revealed his domineering and confident bearing. After dispersing the guards and maids, Rongzas and the others all took their seats.</p><br/><p>The long table was full of all sorts of things. Rongzas thanked Qi Aoshuang wholeheartedly, and toasted her with a cup of milk tea in stead of a cup of wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Qi, thank you for your strong support. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d He raised his glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of this belongs to Your Majesty.\u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled. Her tone was different from before. The person standing in front of her was no longer the Desert Whirlwind Rongzas, but the King of Uzzari!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need for that, Your Majesty. We still have many things to discuss after breakfast.\u201d Camil interrupted them with a smile.</p><br/><p>He smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, everyone gathered in the study room.</p><br/><p>Seated in front of his desk, Rongzas looked at Camil who was sitting next to him and said, \u201cPrime Minister, the intervention of the Radiant Temple will probably cause Ragka\u2019s army to waver?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Radiant Temple has not made an explicit decision to side with Amper Land, but once the battle begins, the Radiant Temple should not hesitate at all to choose him. We don\u2019t need to worry about their strength. With Aoshuang and the rest here, even Angels aren\u2019t our match.\u201d Camil said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is, the will of the people of Ragka,\u201d Rongzas said with a grave expression. \u201cYou also know that in our country, even if the forces of light are the least penetrated, they still make many civilians fear and revere them. You know better than I do how much effort you have put into changing this situation. Even now, that belief has not been completely removed from people\u2019s hearts. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Camil nodded, then continued calmly, \u201cThe Radiant Temple isn\u2019t something that can stand out in the hearts of the commoners. First, they did many fake good deeds on the surface, and second, they are powerful.\u201d In the hearts of many, the Radiant Temple was invincible. Camille took his time\uff0c\u201cWhat if we have more power to support us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rongzas frowned as he looked at Qi Aoshuang and her men. He said softly, \u201cI can\u2019t deny that Miss Qi and her people are very strong, but \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut not convincing enough.\u201d Camil spoke the rest of the words that Rongzas had to say.</p><br/><p>Even if Qi Aoshuang and her men were very strong, how much did the world know about them? In short, there was no deterrent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about this?\u201d Camil suddenly stood up and walked to the window. He abruptly pulled open the curtain, opened the window, looked at the sky and softly said, \u201cBen, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Aoshuang stood up in shock and looked out the window. Ben? Wasn\u2019t he captured by the Dragon God?</p><br/><p>Camil\u2019s words had just ended when a series of dragon roars could be heard from afar. It was as deafening as thunder.</p><br/><p>This morning, the capital of Uzzari was peaceful. People woke up and ate as they usually do every morning, then opened their doors to do business. However, deafening roars rang out one after another, and then the sky darkened.</p><br/><p>Rongzas stood up quickly and walked to the window. He almost sat down on the floor when he saw what was going on outside. As for the people outside the palace, they all directly sat down, gaping at the sky with their mouths wide open. Some people even fainted on the ground. Many people began to run for their lives, screaming. The entire city was in chaos!</p><br/><p>Dragons! Dragons are flying in the sky!</p><br/><p>Thousands of dragons!</p><br/><p>The huge dragons flapped their wings, creating gusts of wind that almost made people unable to open their eyes.</p><br/><p>The dragon with three heads flew at the front and let out a long roar as it circled above the palace.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang couldn\u2019t say a word. The scene in front of them was beyond everyone\u2019s imagination. The sky above the city was filled with dragons, which turned daylight into night.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what\u2019s going on?!\u201d Rongzax stammered.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the study room stood by the window, staring at the scene in front of them in shock, unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they strong enough? \u201d Camille asked with a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>Rongzas felt that his heart was beating incredibly fast, and his mind was completely blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cweren\u2019t Ben captured by the Dragon God?\u201d Jean asked doubtfully. Why were there so many dragons in front of him? They were probably the greater half of the race!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang did not understand what was going on. According to the Dragon God\u2019s tone, the dragon race could not interfere with the affairs of humans. Why were they here?</p><br/><p>The huge dragons circled above the city for a while before descending outside the city.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Black Dragon landed in the palace and returned to its human form. It broke through the window and arrived in front of Rongzas and Camil.</p><br/><p>Rongzas could no longer bear the thrill. He retreated in panic and crashed into the desk. He put his hand on his sword, but then he suddenly remembered how ridiculous his move was in front of the powerful dragons. He quickly put down the hand and tried to calm himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, hurry up and tell your civillians not to panic. We are just passing by, or perhaps it should be more accurate to say, we are here for a sightseeing tour. We won\u2019t do any harm to them. The Black Dragon looked at the crown on Rongzas\u2019s head and coldly said, \u201cNow, go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d cold sweat broke out on Rongzas\u2019s back. The pressure from the black-haired man in front of him almost made him unable to stand up.</p><br/><p>He hurried to open the door to deal with it.</p><br/><p>The Black Dragon looked at Camille, then at Qi Aoshuang, and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Qi Aoshuang was confused. \u201cAren\u2019t the dragons unable to intervene in this matter? The last time you \u2026\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Ben raised his hand to stop Qi Aoshuang\u2019s words, then he walked over to a chair and sat down, yawning as he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that we were going to intervene in this matter. Didn\u2019t you hear what I just said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Ben and his civillians are just passing by and enjoying the scenery.\u201d Camil, smiling like a spring breeze, turned and sat down.</p><br/><p>The people in the study room were all dumbfounded, and Rongzas stared at them when he heard what they were saying. Had the dragon clan really come for a sightseeing tour? How could this be possible!?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, come, come ~ ~\u201d Camil looked at Rongzas and waved him over.</p><br/><p>Rongzas walked over with a blank look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you said that with so many dragons here, you can let your civillians feel at ease, right?\u201d Camil smiled, but it was a dangerous smile.</p><br/><p>Rongzas nodded numbly, unable to say anything.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

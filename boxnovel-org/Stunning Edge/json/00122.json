Didn\u2019t you think there was something wrong with your son too and even sent people to examine him? Oh right, how is Feng Yixuan right now?\u201d the emperor asked casually. Only before this woman could the emperor be relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn brat, he went mad and tried to undo his seal and almost died, unconscious for three days and nights. But when I thought he was going to actually die and was preparing to cry at his funeral, he woke up.\u201d The fiery woman rolled her eyes, shrugging.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that how a mother should talk about her son?\u201d The emperor was a bit flabbergasted. From the way she spoke, she sounded almost like it was a pity her son didn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn brat deserves it! He\u2019s never tried to so hard for his own mother or protect me, but for a woman I\u2019ve never seen before, he was willing to risk his life to become strong, saying some bullsh*t that he was going to protect her.\u201d The fiery beauty gritted her teeth, not caring that she had cursed right in front of the emperor.</p><br/><p>You need someone to protect you? You, a t-rex woman of steel, people fleeing the moment they meet you, beasts dying at the sight of you, flowers not daring to bloom in your presence, need someone to protect you?! The heavens would personally thank you if you stopped being so harmful! The emperor blinked, naturally not daring to actually say these words out loud. And he would not mention that she was being jealous of her future daughter in law even more so.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. I\u2019m going back. Notify me when there\u2019s more news.\u201d The female t-rex yawned, preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. Also, tell young Feng there\u2019s never an end to making money, so make time to have a cup of tea and play chess with me tomorrow,\u201d the emperor added as Lisha* was about to leave. Young Feng was the emperor\u2019s nickname for Feng Yixuan\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>*Looked ahead to check, just as suspected, she is usually referred to by her full name. In China, close friends refer to each other by their first names only.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the female t-rex waved offhandedly, then left.</p><br/><p>The study\u2019s door shut once more. The emperor leaned back in his chair and his eyes landed on a small frame. Inside was a little painting with two young men smiling and a young girl in between smiling widely. Of the two young men, one was him and the other was Feng Yixuan\u2019s father. The girl in the middle was naturally the female t-rex. His thoughts wandering far away, the emperor suddenly thought of when his two good friends risked their lives to save him and thought of when the female t-rex planned each step to reach the throne and young Feng did all he could to help him win it. Had it already been ten years? Time flies fast. The emperor smiled gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d Claire sneezed loudly, then rubbed her nose. She frowned as she looked up at the round moon in the night sky. \u201cIs someone talking bad about me behind my back again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot talking bad about you, but showering you with compliments and presents!\u201d Li Yuewen suddenly appeared behind Claire like a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin Yuewen, are you a ghost? Not knocking on the door before entering\u2026\u201d Claire said, displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even close it, how could i knock on it?\u201d Li Yuewen retorted indignantly. \u201cWithin just one afternoon, we\u2019ve received so many flowers and gifts along with many invitations, those people change favor so quickly!\u201d Li Yuewen cursed disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get impatient. The person we\u2019re waiting for will definitely come.\u201d Claire smiled slyly, looking up towards the bright moon.</p><br/><p>But for the next three days, the crown prince did not come. Other aristocrats came, all with the purpose of seeing Claire, or to be more accurate, wanting to see the stunning beauty Claire had transformed into, Lan Ling, but were blocked by Li Yuewen. She only said that once it was her younger cousin\u2019s birthday, they would host a banquet and invite them all. Only after pestering Li Yuewen and being sure they would receive an invitation did the nobles leave reluctantly. Making Li Yuewen both amused and annoyed at the same time was that among them, not only were there young aristocrats, there were also some middle aged and old men without wives.</p><br/><p>Inside the study, Li Yuewen finally could not hold back and asked Claire, who was sitting at desk, \u201cClaire, why hasn\u2019t the crown prince come yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou yourself have said that the crown prince is unordinary. If he rushed over like those other lowly nobles, I would find it surprising. Don\u2019t worry, he will come soon,\u201d Claire replied casually. She was flipping through an account book. \u201cCousin Yuewen, there\u2019s something strange about about expenses. How come we\u2019ve only used half of what I expected?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh\u2026\u201d Li Yuewen smiled slyly. \u201cAfter the convention, the original price we had set for buying the store previously dropped by half.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s face fell. She immediately understood what was wrong. Since when was her cousin was competent in business?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen did they have any conditions?\u201d Claire twirled the fountain pen in her hand, her tone displeased. A feeling of unease arose in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe store is the Intymen clan\u2019s. They specialize in furniture and magic beast pelts. They hoped that they could send a set of their high class furniture.\u201d Li Yuewen said proudly. She had thought Claire would praise her, but Claire suddenly threw down the fountain pen and reprimanded her angrily, \u201cCousin Yuewen, do you know what a loss you\u2019ve made? And a large loss, no less!\u201d Claire felt a twinge of a headache coming on. Sure enough, the Li clan was incompetent at business.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? The Intymen clan gave us half off and even sent a set of high class furniture!\u201d Li Yuewen was completely baffled. This was clearly a great deal, why was Claire saying they had made losses?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Claire said helplessly. \u201cThat shop\u2019s original price was thirty thousand gold. Half off means a profit of fifteen thousand. But they gave us a set of furniture. If they advertise that the stunning Lan Ling used their furniture, what do you think will happen? Will the Intymen clan only profit fifteen thousand gold?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Claire finished speaking, Li Yuewen\u2019s expression had already changed. She finally realized that not only did she incur losses, but it was a huge loss! If they really did as Claire just said, then many people would buy their furniture. Would their profit be just fifteen thousand gold? Of course not. Perhaps it would even be more than 1.5 million?!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and set a contract with them. Make them send their best furniture and make sure we get five percent of the profits. Only then can they advertise that Lan Ling used their furniture.\u201d Claire starting flipping through the account book again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive percent of their profits? And what about paying for the store? Are we really going to ask for five percent of their stock and pay nothing?\u201d Li Yuewen looked at Claire strangely. Did Claire think they were idiots? She wanted five percent of the profits without doing anything?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go. Tell them that they can advertise every time. For example, if they start selling beds, they can advertise that it can help preserve your figure and that Lan Ling had been using their bed. If they don\u2019t agree, then say that we\u2019ve already discussed this with other merchant clans and that they will agree immediately,\u201d Claire said impatiently, continuing to flip through the account book.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewn looked at Claire doubtfully, wanting to say something, not willing to leave.</p><br/><p>Standing behind Claire, Camille persuaded Li Yuewen, \u201cMiss Li, just do what Claire just said. They will definitely agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Li Yuewen leave, albeit hesitantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, no wonder the Li clan declined to this state.\u201d Camille smiled widely as he poured another cup of flower tea for Claire, but his next words were piercing. \u201cCurrently, the most powerful members, Li Yuewen and Li Mingyu, are completely incompetent at business. The others aren\u2019t even worth mentioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire closed the account book and looked up at Camille, smiling. \u201cPerhaps not. Perhaps there are some people in the Li clan competent at business, but are simply currently suppressed by those elders and hasn\u2019t shown themselves yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Suddenly, an ominous premonition arose in his heart. Camille watched Claire cautiously. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that our wise and brilliant secondary commander can use his foresight to search for capable people and then develop them. Only our talented and unparalleled secondary commander can do this. Your brilliance is unmatched. My cousins aren\u2019t even a hundredth of what you are.\u201d Claire raised the cup to her lips gracefully and took a sip, her expression unchanging as she spoke. \u201cEven the flower tea you make is unique, incomparable.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few moments later, Jean, who was guarding at the door, saw Camille prancing out, looking like he was floating. Jean stared, blinking a few times. Yes, Camille was prancing! His bizarrely giddy expression seemed to be asking for a beating.</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu passed by the prancing Camille in the hallway and immediately stopped. He watched after Camille prancing away with confusion. Once he turned and saw Jean\u2019s mouth twitching slightly, he understood immediately. Claire must have used her usual method of persuading Camille again.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Li Mingyu called out as he walked into the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, Cousin Mingyu. Did that person come?\u201d Claire raised her head, taking another sip of the flower tea, then setting it aside. Next to her, Black Feather and White Emperor were fighting over a piece of chocolate cake. A pair of white and another pair of black claws were tugging the cake stubbornly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Li Mingyu asked with a bit of amazement. Based off of Claire\u2019s tone, she seemed to have known long ago that he was going to come today.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust think about it. It\u2019s about the right time.\u201d Claire rose up, smiling faintly. She pushed her chair in, about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out like this? Without transforming?\u201d Li Mingyu frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Claire smiled. \u201cBring the other sword to the main hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Mingyu was confused, but he still listened to Claire\u2019s command, also leaving to fetch the sword.</p><br/><p>In the main hall, the crown prince was sitting quietly, waiting. Many servants were busily moving gifts and flowers. The crown prince frowned. He didn\u2019t expect that after three days, the Li clan\u2019s residence would still be as bustling as a marketplace. But in any case, it seemed that the stunning woman, Lan Ling, had never shown herself.</p><br/><p>Just as the crown prince was pondering, there was the sound of footsteps at the entrance. When he raised his head, he saw Li Mingyu and a young girl walking over. Lan Ling still wasn\u2019t showing herself? The crown prince frowned. Lan Ling wouldn\u2019t even meet <em>him</em>?</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, your highness, the crown prince.\u201d Li Mingyu and Claire bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuke Li, she is?\u2026\u201d The crown prince could see the similarity between Claire and Lan Ling and already had a guess, but he still asked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

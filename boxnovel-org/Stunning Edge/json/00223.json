He found a pair of scissors and a comb in the drawer of the dresser, and was about to cut her overly long hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026\u201d Black Feather only said one word, but White Emperor lightly nudged him with his hand. Black Feather turned to look at White Emperor, who shook his head slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Black Feather understood what he meant and grunted unhappily. \u201cCamil, you know our power is sealed. Can you help us unseal it?\u201d \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Camil answered with a beaming smile, but he didn\u2019t turn back to look at White Emperor and Black Feather. Instead, he continued to gently help Qi Aoshuang straighten her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Then why don\u2019t you help us now?\u201d Black Feather asked angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me to.\u201d Camil said casually.</p><br/><p>Black Feather was so angry he almost spit out blood. If it wasn\u2019t for White Emperor stopping him, he would have charged at Camil to fight him to the death.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Palace of Uzzari, which is to say that Uzzari has now succeeded in the coup, and the king is Rongzas?\u201d \u201cQi Aoshuang hugged the Fortune Cat in her arms and asked softly,\u201d Have so many things happened in the past ten days that we\u2019ve been inside? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo many things have happened, Little Aoshuang, you guys have been inside for ten days, but It\u2019s already been three months here.\u201d Camille carefully combs Qi Aoshuang\u2019s hair, trimming it to the length of only knees.</p><br/><p>Three months! Qi Aoshuang turned to look at Camil in shock. It\u2019s been so long already?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, this place is still a little unrepaired. It\u2019s already autumn. \u201d Camil smiled and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s autumn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was speechless.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been almost a year \u2026.</p><br/><p>It had been almost a year since her birthday \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Aoshuang is growing up. What do you want for your tenth birthday?\u201d Camil combed Qi Aoshuang\u2019s hair and nodded his head in satisfaction. He had already completely ignored White Emperor and Black Feather in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Aoshuang was slightly stunned. She had never thought of such a thing before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the current situation like?!\u201d White Emperor spoke at this time in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like my design,\u201d Camil leaned gracefully on the dressing table, looking at the hair on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s head with a smile,\u201cAmper Land intends to declare war against Ragka. Uzzari will be allied with Ragka. The Radiant Temple is going to intervene, because Uzzari has already wiped out all of the Radiant Temple\u2019s forces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201d Black Feather grunted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMassacre.\u201d Camil\u2019s smile was like a spring breeze as he lightly spat out two words. \u201cAll you have to do is kill the high ranking members of the Radiant Temple, including, of course, those Angels with wings who fly around all day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Letting humans deal with the Winged Angels and the Eight-winged Angels is quite a loss!\u201d White Emperor nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys go rest first. Then we\u2019ll take action.\u201d Camil ran a comb through his blond hair, sighing, \u201cOh, my hair is still so smooth.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Emperor: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Black Feather: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Aoshuang slightly frowned, and suddenly said in a deep voice, \u201cIs there any news of my master? What about Summer? And the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master is currently sleeping in a bedroom in the palace waiting for your return. Before you came back, he was the fiercest one. He blew up one palace after another in Uzzari. Summer and Shui Wenmo are now in Ragka helping Feng Yixuan. Summer knew you were OK. The others, of course, were shining under my leadership. \u201cCamil lightly smooths his hair in front of his forehead and says narcissistically.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are they shinning under your leadership?\u201d Black Feather curled his lips and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe branches of the Radiant Temple have all disappeared in Uzzari. Our Order Temple has taken over.\u201d Camil reaches out a hand to rub Qi Aoshuang\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for them to believe in the God of Darkness all of a sudden, so I created a Temple of Order.\u201d It has the similar system with the Dark Temple, but people had to pay the same price to get whatever they wanted. Everything is equivalent. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Order Temple?\u201d White Emperor repeated in a low voice, \u201cVery true, this is much better than the Radiant Temple\u2019s verbal promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, don\u2019t you see who I am?\u201d Camille\u2019s handsome face broke into a triumphant smile.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked at Camil\u2019s smile and slightly opened her mouth, wanting to say something but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201d Oh, my! The Treasure Cat!\u201d Camil suddenly saw the cat sleeping in the arms of Qi Aoshuang and let out a cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Qi Aoshuang looked down at the lazy sleeping cat and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Good thing. Ha-ha\u201d Camille laughed, \u201cserve her well, and she will bring you good luck. Well, I\u2019ll have you taken to bed, and the supper will be brought to your rooms. We will celebrate your return tomorrow. Don\u2019t tell those guys for now, or you won\u2019t be able to rest tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in Uzzari?\u201d Black Feather frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrime Minister.\u201d Camil narrowed his eyes and smiled, \u201cRemember, in the future, call me Prime Minister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Black Feather: \u201d Just forget what I said. \u201d</p><br/><p>Camil said with a gentle smile, \u201cAlright, you can all go and rest. We\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Black Feather suddenly thought of a crucial question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Camil replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, since you have the ability to open the Space Gate and unseal our seal, does that mean you can resist the Eight-winged Angels or even higher ranked Angels? Why didn\u2019t you just kill them in the beginning? \u201c Black Feather frowned and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Camil rubbed his white and slender fingers in displeasure and said with slight disgust, \u201cThat\u2019s so crude and without any sense of beauty, how could I possibly do that kind of thing? What I like is the feeling of putting cold daggers on a person\u2019s neck. A boor like you will never be able to experience that extreme cold beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Black Feather\u2019s face turned green.</p><br/><p>Camille flicks his fingers at this moment, removing the barrier that surrounds the bedroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuard!\u201d Camil gracefully clapped his hands and a guard opened the door. When the he saw that there were three more people in the bedroom, he was stunned. When did they enter the Prime Minister\u2019s bedroom? They had never left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop looking. They are my friends. Take them down to rest. Give the young lady the best dinner. \u201d Camil looked at the dazed guard and ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, Prime Minister.\u201d The guard nodded respectfully. \u201cEveryone, please follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they arrived in front of the bedroom that was prepared for Qi Aoshuang, Black Feather was about to follow her. He then looked into her cold eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa-ha, I forgot.\u201d Black Feather smiled embarrassedly, then stepped back and stood beside White Emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Qi Aoshuang closed the door with a bang, feeling extremely unhappy. Although their IQ wasn\u2019t high, they shouldn\u2019t have forgotten who they were. What a huge loss! She had slept with these two fellows for so long!</p><br/><p>White Emperor narrowed his eyes at Black Feather, walking in front of him, \u201cShameless rogue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! Who are you talking about?\u201d Black Feather\u2019s face turned green again. \u201cYou think you are a good person? So what did you do with Aoshuang every night?\u201d He almost said it out loud, only then did he realize that something was wrong with his mouth and swallowed the latter words back down.</p><br/><p>Not long after Qi Aoshuang and the Treasure Cat took a bath together, dinner arrived. The Treasure Cat was indeed different from other kittens. She liked water very much, and cooperated with Aoshuang very well. From her front paws, back paws, until her tail, she let Qi Aoshuang wash her entire body with a look of enjoyment. In the end, Aoshuang dried her fur, then she hid in Aoshuang\u2019s arms and refused to come out.</p><br/><p>At dinner, the Treasure Car was indeed very picky, as Heaven Breaker had said. All the vegetables on the plate had been scraped aside with her front paws, and she only ate meat. After she finished all the meat, she wiped her paws on the white napkin and looked at Qi Ao shuang before looking at the fruit.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled and cut the fruit into small pieces. Only then did the cat start chewing with satisfaction. When she was full, she jumped on the bed, and slept on the exquisite mattress that Aoshuang prepared for her.</p><br/><p>All of these caused the maid who was waiting at the side to be completely stupefied. She had not seen such a cute, human little kitten. The maid slowly moved towards the bed. She really wanted to touch it. She slowly reached out her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Qi Aoshuang turned her head and shouted. It was too late.</p><br/><p>The Treasure Cat suddenly opened its eyes. Its amber eyes suddenly shot out a strange golden light. It instantly flipped over and let out a hissing roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh-!\u201d The maid cried out in fear. Her body was pushed back by a powerful force, and was about to heavily smash into the wall behind her.</p><br/><p>With a flick of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s finger, a soft barrier was formed behind the maid, catching her. The maid was still in shock as she looked at the Treasure Cat on the bed in fear. She breathed rapidly and her heart could not calm down.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang narrowed her eyes, her gaze instantly sinking as she said coldly: \u201cDon\u2019t you know what courtesy is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d The maid lowered her head in an apologetic manner. She was wrong to have touched someone\u2019s pet without the permission of her master. The maid was astonished. But what exactly was this pet? It was definitely not an ordinary kitten. Could it be a magical beast that looked like a kitten? Thinking of this, the maid became even more afraid. It was all his fault for being so rash. She had nearly lost her life. \u201cAlright, you may leave now.\u201d Qi Aoshuang turned around and walked to the bed. She gently hugged the Treasure Cat and caressed her small, furry head to comfort her. In her heart, she was surprised to see the Treasure Cat explode. It seemed that her strength was not as simple as searching for treasures.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He knew that whenever the little devil smiled like this, someone would pay. Walter felt a little sympathy for the people in the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour excellency, you have finally arrived. We have been waiting for a long time.\u201d From the middle of the hall, an elaborately dressed middle-aged man was walking over slowly. His face was abnormally white, his steps unstable, obviously a man who indulged in women and drinking. Although his words were polite, there wasn\u2019t a single trace of respect in them. In their eyes, this young girl was only a male-chaser, becoming the castellan only through the prominence of her family. So what if she was from the Hill clan? The emperor was far away currently. How could they not straighten out this young and inexperienced child? Threaten her first, then offer a few benefits. But they couldn\u2019t overdo it, because the master of the little girl was Sir Cliff. Fortunately Sir Cliff didn\u2019t come, or things would get a little tricky.</p><br/><p>Claire watched the middle-aged man walking towards her while smiling the whole time, making the middle-aged man happy internally. He was glad that the child was indeed easy to straighten out.</p><br/><p>But Claire saw the contempt in his eyes clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour excellency, your servant is Flinn Menda. The qualities your excellency exhibited during this plague\u2026 \u201d The middle-aged man called Flinn was the head of all the nobles in Niya. He put what he thought was a charming smile on his face, continuously praising. First flatter, then coerce, and finally, lay out conditions: this the way they usually did things.</p><br/><p>But soon, his charming smile froze on his face.</p><br/><p>Because Claire raised her hand quietly to stop what he was going to say.</p><br/><p>This was very rude behaviour.</p><br/><p>All the nobles in the hall were stunned. Although Claire was the castellan, she was only the lowest baron. And she made such a rude gesture? No castellan had ever dared to be so rude to them nobles.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes your excellency have something to say?\u201d Flinn asked, frowning, suppressing his anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone knows that the plague had just ended, and there are still a lot of matters to settle. I need help from you; I\u2019m sure that each and every one of you are kind-hearted and generous.\u201d Claire spoke, smiling at the doorway.</p><br/><p>When Claire gave such a speech, the expression on the faces of Flinn and the rest of the nobles changed. Claire\u2019s meaning was very clear: she would not let them increase the prices on goods.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour excellency\u2026 \u201dFlinn squeezed out a smile, wanting to say something.</p><br/><p>But Claire didn\u2019t even glance at him. Instead, she raised her head to speak to the crowd. \u201cI know that you invited me here today to prove your loyalty to the country. I\u2019m sure that you have already agreed to lower all daily supplies sold by the trade union by twenty percent to help the people of Niya city. Another thing: I will be soon be leaving on a trip with my master Cliff, and while I\u2019m gone, Heath will still take over my role as a castellan. I have faith that all of you will help Heath diligently, returning Niya to its prosperity.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Claire finished speaking, the whole hall boiled.</p><br/><p>The crowd was gossiping among themselves, and Flinn\u2019s expression was extremely ugly. He didn\u2019t think that this little girl would take the initiative, first giving them such a big responsibility, then saying her decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour excellency, you should also know that the founding of our trade union wasn\u2019t easy. During this plague, we also experienced serious losses\u2026 \u201d Flinn\u2019s face was green as he complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that the castellan\u2019s words have no authority? Is loyalty worth a penny? Are you trying to say that not only are you unwilling to lower prices, but you plan to increase the prices and make money out of the crisis? And exploit harshly the already poor and grievous people?\u201d Yixuan Feng now spoke fiercely, glaring and cursing at Flinn. He pointed at the elaborate decorations in the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what you call experiencing serious losses? Whoa, look at this crystal chandelier, market price five thousand gold coins. And this table set is from the Feng Family Trade Union, huh? At least two thousand gold coins. And this rug is a foreign import and costs at least eight thousand gold coins!\u201d</p><br/><p>Flinn opened his mouth wide, completely astonished. Who was this black haired red eyed youth? So rude and arrogant! The castellan also didn\u2019t do anything about it. And the prices he listed for each item were so precise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Who are you? Speaking so rudely!\u201d Flinn came back to his senses and started thundering. Although this black haired youth was dressed nicely, his language was rude and Flinn had not heard of any other nobles accompanying the castellan, so this youth probably didn\u2019t have any background. Perhaps, he could be the weak link in their party and Flinn might get a chance to correct his mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my assistant.\u201d Claire smiled and answered, for she knew that Yixuan Feng, that crazy boy, would definitely say, \u2018I\u2019m your castellan\u2019s future husband\u2019. Then Claire\u2019s expression became dark. She asked coldly, \u201cBut wasn\u2019t everything he said correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 \u201d Flinn answered absent-minded, then came back to his senses and shouted, \u201cAbsolutely not. Our loyalty to the country is open for everyone to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Baron Flinn, you have agreed to lower prices by twenty percent?\u201d Once again, Claire put on a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this, I agree, but the other trade unions\u2026 \u201d Flinn was riding on a tiger and unable to get off, so he pretended to be awkward. He looked at the other nobles in the hall and continued, \u201cYour excellency, as you have also seen, my family is richer and still able to maintain itself despite the losses suffered from the plague, but my colleagues\u2026 \u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if he lowered the prices. If need be, he could just close his shop and take his goods to his relatives\u2019 shops and still make a lot of money.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, your excellency, Baron Flinn is able to maintain, but it\u2019s hard for us.\u201d A fat man immediately walked over and interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could lose some weight.\u201d Wenmo Shui humphed coldly, extremely annoyed by looking at the parasites in the room. These people wanted to make money out of the crisis, but pretended to be so pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? You\u2019re interrupting my talk with the castellan.\u201d Once he heard Wenmo Shui jab at his sore spot, the fat man used this as an excuse to explode in anger.</p><br/><p>The hall became noisy as more people started blaming Wenmo Shui. There was finally a weak point on the castellan\u2019s side; how could they let it go? He was only a servant of the castellan. A lowly peasant being so rude to a noble would only end up hanged.</p><br/><p>But Wenmo Shui only humphed and looked indifferently to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour excellency, you also saw it. Your servant was so rude to me. A peasant insulted the authority of us nobles. I ask for you to punish him harshly! Hang him right now.\u201d The stupid fat man exclaimed indignantly, his spit flying everywhere.</p><br/><p>Claire glanced at Wenmo Shui and suddenly lowered her voice so that only they could hear. \u201cWenmo Shui, his spit flew onto your hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, Wenmo Shui\u2019s face became very red, an indication that he was about to fly into a rage.</p><br/><p>With a \u201cwhoosh\u201d, Wenmo Shui had pulled out his sword, his violet DouQi radiant. A magnificent ray of DouQi slashed towards that fat noble.</p><br/><p>A deep crack appeared on the red-carpeted floor, reaching all the way until the fat noble\u2019s feet. If it went forward just a tiny bit, the fat guy would probably be dead.</p><br/><p>The hall was deathly silent.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the scene in front of them, stunned.</p><br/><p>That handsome youth was actually a grand swordsman! And such a dangerous person too, using force for no reason at all! Without any respect to people or place! If he used just a bit more strength, that aristocrat would be dead!</p><br/><p>The fat man finally realized what happened and his fat legs started shaking uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026 \u201d The fat man couldn\u2019t even get a whole sentence out, only pointing at Wenmo Shui with a trembling finger. He was extremely afraid. Why is such a dangerous person with the castellan?</p><br/><p>The aristocratic women and girls who were attracted by Wenmo Shui before were now frightened, and they decided not to hook up with Wenmo Shui after the banquet as they planned to.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, hehe, I\u2019m so sorry. My guards are just like this, unable to control themselves when they see someone unrespectful towards me.\u201d Claire smiled like flower. \u201cAnd as for the hanging this nobleman here mentioned, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a little hard to do. No one in Niya is his match.\u201d Was there any sincerity in this apology? Was there? Was there? It was very obviously that not only wasn\u2019t there any sincerity, it was full of pleasure.</p><br/><p>The hall was deathly silent.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expression was ugly. Most people wanted to criticize her, but because of Claire\u2019s strong backing, Cliff, they couldn\u2019t say anything too harsh.</p><br/><p>Flinn knitted his brows tightly, thinking about how to get the upper hand back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, ahem~~ \u201d Suddenly, Claire straightened her expression and coughed slightly, and said pretentiously, \u201cWenmo Shui, how could you do that, treating this noble like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>When everyone heard that, their expressions became lighter. So the castellan still had to rebuke her guard on the surface.</p><br/><p>Flinn\u2019s face also relaxed a bit. So this little child wasn\u2019t too uncooperative and knew when to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d Wenmo Shui pouted and answered unwillingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s your fault. Next time you come across such a situation, don\u2019t give any mercy; just slice him into half.\u201d Claire\u2019s smile was brilliant and charming, but her words were dark.</p><br/><p>As soon as Claire finished speaking, the expressions of all the people in the hall changed greatly. Disbelief was in every eye. They couldn\u2019t believe that a pretty, sunny little girl would say something like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Wenmo Shui nodded and laughed evilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do that next time, I\u2019ll increase your wage.\u201d Claire\u2019s casual words were like tons of stones on the nobles\u2019 hearts. They were so casual, not caring about their status as aristocrats or their lives.</p><br/><p>Everyone stared at Claire. Right now, all they were thinking was how frightening Claire\u2019s smile looked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m very willing to do so.\u201d Hearing this, Wenmo Shui laughed gleefully. In truth, one gold coin per month was way too little.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about me, will I get wages if I kill him now?\u201d Yixuan Feng interrupted hurriedly. After all, he was working for free.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe next time. It\u2019ll depend on which one of you is faster.\u201d Claire replied insipidly.</p><br/><p>Jean watched this silently, a light flashing through his eyes as he looked at Claire.</p><br/><p>The casual conversation between the three infuriated and frightened the nobles in the hall. Nobody dared to interrupt. Even their families didn\u2019t have the power to defeat the grand swordsman.</p><br/><p>Flinn\u2019s gaze was furious. This little child was pushing it too far! Who did she think she was?! He would find a way to report to the emperor of her unrespectfulness and reckless attitude. Just wait and see!</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t end like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou all know that I\u2019m busy these days, so I won\u2019t stay long. I will tell the emperor of your sacrifice for Niya and your loyalty to the country and make sure he rewards you. Please enjoy your rewards. I\u2019m going to take my leave.\u201d Claire smiled gracefully, nodded towards the people, and then turned around and left.</p><br/><p>The beautiful men also turned around and followed behind Claire elegantly, leaving many red-faced nobles.</p><br/><p>And like so, they walked out the door. Jean handed Claire a jacket for protection from the sun. Claire put it on, and instead of getting on the carriage, she strolled around on the streets. Everything Claire needed was in the pockets of the jacket, including the still asleep White Emperor.</p><br/><p>Niya had finally returned to it\u2019s usual prosperity. Many people came up and greeted Clarie when they saw her, gratitude written all over their faces. At first they didn\u2019t trust her, but now they worshipped her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a little girl in a flower-print dress rushed up to Claire with a bouquet of flowers. She raised up the flowers and smiled. \u201cBig sister, this is for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the innocent smile of the little girl and was stunned. From the depths of her eyes was pure gratitude and happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister made Mother well again, so big sister is a good person.\u201d The little girl held up the flowers stubbornly, as if she wouldn\u2019t put them down if Claire didn\u2019t accept them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMary, what are you doing?\u201d The rebuking voice of an adult sounded in the distance and then a young man dressed like a commoner ran up hurriedly, his expression terrified. He looked at Claire and explained, \u201cYour excellency, I\u2019m sorry, the child is still young and disobedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile slowly appeared on Claire\u2019s face as she bent down and accepted the flowers from the little girl. She patted the little girl\u2019s head and said, \u201cThank you, the flowers are beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man was shocked. Born a noble, yet the castellan was so approachable?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister, you will always protect us, right?\u201d The little girl asked happily when she saw that Claire accepted the flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMary!\u201d The young man\u2019s expression changed, rebuking the little girl as he picked her up. He apologized immediately to Claire. \u201cYour excellency, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really sorry\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will. I will always protect everyone. Always.\u201d Claire smiled and looked at the little girl, promising.</p><br/><p>\u201cYay! Yeah!\u201d The little girl cheered, holding her father\u2019s neck and smiling.</p><br/><p>Claire smiled as she looked at the young man and said, \u201cNo need to be so cautious. Your child is very adorable. If there are any problems in the future, just go to the castle and find the proxy castellan. He will help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, castellan, thank you, castellan.\u201d The young man hastily thanked over and over.</p><br/><p>Walter asked wickedly, \u201cClaire, since when were you so kind?\u201d After Walter finished asking, he waited for Claire\u2019s life threatening pinch, but even after a long time, there was no response.</p><br/><p>Claire was silent, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>Kind?</p><br/><p>Really?</p><br/><p>Why was this word so ridiculous?</p><br/><p>Seeing Claire\u2019s silence, Walter started to become add more fuel. \u201cClaire, what kind of style are you doing today? Just then you were laughing, telling someone to kill someone and dismember their dead body, now you\u2019re adorably and kindly deceiving that man\u2019s little girl. Was it something you ate or drank\u2026\u201d Walter chattered on without end.</p><br/><p>Claire was silent. She went forward slowly, like she was pondering over something.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a small youngster walked over and brushed past them.</p><br/><p>Once Claire came back to her senses, she discovered that Walter\u2019s voice was going farther and farther away!</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, damn you, you idiot, I\u2019ve been stolen! Just then when that guy brushed past you guys, they stole from your bag! If you still don\u2019t quickly come over here and save me\u2026\u201d Walter furiously shouted.</p><br/><p>What?! Claire\u2019s expression changed. The youth who had just brushed past them? They actually stole from her. Claire promptly felt her bag and sure enough, found her wallet and the spiritual stone gone. White Emperor was still sleeping peacefully and everything else was still there. It was just that the money and the spiritual stone was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Claire?\u201d Yixuan Feng asked with a tilted head. He discovered that something was wrong with Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been stolen from.\u201d Claire said quietly.</p><br/><p>Everybody\u2019s expressions changed. They all subconsciously felt their bags. Only Wenmo Shui\u2019s expression was unperturbed, because he didn\u2019t have a wallet or anything else valuable.</p><br/><p>Jean\u2019s expression also changed. There was actually someone who could stealthily steal money from him!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng was so pissed his teeth ached. There was actually some blind guy who dared to steal from him! When he found that little thief, he would definitely beat him up so much that even his own mother wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him!</p><br/><p>Claire coldly turned to lead and said coldly, \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was just the wallet, then perhaps Claire really wouldn\u2019t have any method to capture that thief.</p><br/><p>Even though stealing anything was bad, how could a person be stolen?!</p><br/><p>Walter was actually stolen away!</p><br/><p>It was an outstanding robber. Very obviously, a very outstanding robber.</p><br/><p>Claire emotionlessly followed Walter\u2019s instructions, going past two streets, chasing all the way to a faraway alley. The alley was very secluded with no signs of life. At the very end, a door appeared at the right. Tottering on the verge of collapse over the door was a sign that indicated it was a hotel.</p><br/><p>Claire pushed the door open, a person asleep at the front desk. When they heard the sound of the door being open, they raised their head and saw Claire\u2019s group, preparing to say something. But Claire snapped her finger and a small fireball flew in front of the businessman. It swayed as it circled twice and then disappeared.</p><br/><p>The businessman\u2019s mouth opened wide, not a word coming out. Magician! A magician actually came to such a classless little inn like his!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone. No matter what sounds you hear in a moment, don\u2019t bother. We will compensate twice the amount for damages.\u201d Yixuan Feng was practically gnashing his teeth as he said these words hatefully.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t say a word and went straight upstairs.</p><br/><p>Walter was making a racket incessantly. \u201cClaire, how are you this stupid? Huh? I, a living person, was actually able to be stolen away. You didn\u2019t even notice when they touched your bag?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire had a dark expression the whole way as she went to the room Walter directed her to. Wasn\u2019t this first time she had been stolen from?</p><br/><p>\u201cWenmo Shui, you\u2019re in charge of the window. Jean, watch the door.\u201d Claire was really a bit angry. She had actually been stolen from without noticing!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know it was here?\u201d Yixuan Feng look doubtfully at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cI set up a spell on my wallet.\u201d Claire explained halfheartedly.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng immediately realized and fiercely kicked the door open. Wenmo Shui was like lightning as he raced to the window madly, blocking the escape route of the person inside. And Jean guarded at the doorway.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng smiled evilly, his fist tightened so much, there was the sound of cracked knuckles. If he didn\u2019t beat up the robber inside the room so much that their head would be filled with bruises, then he wouldn\u2019t be called Yixuan Feng.</p><br/><p>After the door was kicked open, sure enough, the first reaction of the person inside the room was to run towards the window, but the window was already guarded by Wenmo Shui. The door was also guarded by another warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere will you run?\u201d Yixuan started laughing evilly.</p><br/><p>Claire sized up the young robber in the room. Plain clothes, slim body, brown hair, long bangs that even blocked the brows. A pair of jet-black, large eyes watched them alertly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I give you the items, let me go.\u201d The young robber said immediately. Naturally, he understood the situation. Originally, they had thought they were fat sheep. Who would have thought they were all strong experts? It was a real miscalculation. The young robber quickly brought out all the wallets and put them on the table. Naturally, there was also Claire\u2019s spiritual stone. All the items were brought out, untouched.</p><br/><p>Claire was silent as she approached, grabbing her wallet and spiritual stone and putting it into her bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can let you go. Just wait for me to beat you up so much that nobody can recognize and then it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Yixuan Feng pushed up his sleeves, preparing to start.</p><br/><p>But Claire blocked Yixuan Feng and walked up to the young robber. The young robber faced Claire\u2019s eyes and stepped back, feeling a little uneasy. This woman gave him an indescribable pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Claire asked the thin and weak looking youngster.</p><br/><p>The youngster bit their lip, not saying anything.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Claire started laughing coldly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t respond, I\u2019ll let them strip you bare and then tie you up and send you to the prison. There won\u2019t even be a trial because I am this city\u2019s castellan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngster looked at the cold light in Claire\u2019s eyes, and their heart couldn\u2019t help trembling, saying quietly, \u201cI\u2019m called Summer Ai Luo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody in the room twitched their mouth when they heard Claire\u2019s threat. What kind of threat was this? Strip away their clothes? It was fine to just send them to prison, why strip them?</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, Summer. Talk. Why do you need to steal?\u201d Claire said insipidly. She pulled up a chair and sat down, then indicated at Jean to close the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a robber.\u201d Now Summer\u2019s voice didn\u2019t have any timidness. Instead, they stuck their chest out, speaking boldly. Their meaning was, I\u2019m a robber, it\u2019s proper for me to steal. But Claire noticed that when Summer said this, there was a trace of pride.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the other things you stole? Will you bring them out or will I let them search your body?\u201d Claire coldly stared at Summer as she said these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit, Claire, you want to do villainous things to another villain?\u201d Walter cried out in surprise.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t say anything, silent. Nonsense. They had all tasted this robber\u2019s skill; if the items he stole didn\u2019t have anything good, it would be strange. Also, the robber had been tightly pulling at the bag in their hand the whole time.</p><br/><p>Summer angrily look at Claire, gnashed their teeth, and handed over the bag in their hand in the end.</p><br/><p>Claire grabbed the bag with one swipe, not caring for formalities. Then she started looking inside. There were jewels, jewels, necklaces, etc., all unordinary items.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, do you like these? Go home with me. I\u2019ll give you as much as you want.\u201d Yixuan Feng crouched down, looking at Claire look through the items, laughing.</p><br/><p>But Claire didn\u2019t even look at those treasure left on the side. These were all useless items. In the very depths of the bag was a book. Claire was about to start flipping through, but the words on the cover caught her eye.</p><br/><p>It was Chinese! Really, truly Chinese!</p><br/><p>Treasured Lotus Style Cultivation.</p><br/><p>The four words in fangsong font were imprinted clearly on the front cover.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you steal this from?\u201d Claire asked while frowning at Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve stolen from so many people, how could I know which person this is from?\u201d Summer snorted, replying disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Well then, Yixuan Feng, strip him naked and tie him up, then take him away.\u201d Claire instructed insipidly and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk, I\u2019ll talk!\u201d Summer was alarmed incessantly, continuously waving hastily, saying, \u201cI stole this from another robber.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you don\u2019t understand the words on the cover?\u201d Claire asked while waving the book.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what kind of strange thing it was so I was preparing to throw it away.\u201d This time, Summer replied cooperatively.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak anymore and instead flipped through the book. With a rough skim, Claire\u2019s eyes actually widened.</p><br/><p>This was a rare cultivation book!</p><br/><p>\u201cBring him away.\u201d Claire put away the book and then lead the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, what do you mean. I already gave the items to you and you even took something you wanted, isn\u2019t it time for you to let me go?\u201d Summer angrily raised a fist. Summer had thought subconsciously that because he was so cooperative, after they were done, they would definitely let him go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I promise to let you go?\u201d Claire turned and gave a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Summer dared to be angry, but didn\u2019t dare to speak. He only stared hatefully at Claire.</p><br/><p>And just like this, in front of the three handsome men\u2019s suspicious gazes, Claire brought Summer back to the castle.</p><br/><p>Entering the room, Claire hinted at everyone to wait outside the door while she and the robber, Summer, have a one on one chat.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng felt so conflicted, his heart extremely disturbed. Perhaps Claire fell for this pretty boy? This pretty boy that could be easily blown away by a gust of wind?</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng felt so conflicted he almost scratched the walls. Wenmo Shui felt joy looking at Yixuan Feng\u2019s misfortune. Jean didn\u2019t have any expression on his face. There was only a sliver of suspicion in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Inside the study, Claire set up a magic barrier, preventing anyone from hearing their conversation. Only then did she sit down.</p><br/><p>Summer watched Claire hatefully. Right now he was the equivalent of a sheep waiting for slaughter. He couldn\u2019t fight and win against Claire and couldn\u2019t escape either. There were still three even stronger people guarding outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you want to do?\u201d Summer asked angrily. \u201cI\u2019m tell you, I stole that book from another robber. I don\u2019t know what the words on the cover mean either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to ask you about your relationship to this book.\u201d Claire smiled. She leaned back in her chair leisurely as she watched Summer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what on earth do you want to do?\u201d Summer asked furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you haven\u2019t really taken a liking to this pretty boy, right? Look at him, so skinny, like what? A gust of wind would knock him over. At least find a strong man who\u2019s able to suppress you.\u201d After saying the last bit, Walter felt regret. Sure enough, the next moment, the life threatening pinch came.</p><br/><p>\u201cSummer Ai Luo. Someone from the grand Ai Luo robber family. A self proclaimed robber, but you still haven\u2019t passed the clan\u2019s exam I\u2019m afraid, right?\u201d Claire tapped her fingers on the table indifferently, smiling gently.</p><br/><p>Summer froze, then watched Claire alertly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour exam is really harsh, it\u2019s actually stealing a dragon\u2019s tooth.\u201d Claire smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Summer blurted out, them came to his senses, quickly covering his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit too hard for a little girl to travel alone and single handedly steal a dragon\u2019s tooth?\u201d Claire propped up her chin, languidly looking at the people below as she said this sentence.</p><br/><p>Summer\u2019s expression immediately changed greatly, eyes wide as she* stared straight at Claire.</p><br/><p>(TL: All the previous male pronouns were male in the Chinese. At first I attempted to make them gender neutral but it sounded super awkward.)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to know how I figured it out?\u201d Claire smiled while looking at Summer.</p><br/><p>Summer was silent, but her eyes revealed anticipation. Of course she wanted to know. To this day, nobody had figured out she was female, so how did this girl figure it out the first time they had met?</p><br/><p>Claire smiled brightly, looked at Summer, and then stated quietly with her vermillion lips, \u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Summer\u2019s expression changed from anticipation to annoyance. If was to the point that she even had the impulse to rush up and beat this annoying person up, but she couldn\u2019t beat her. Sigh\u2026 Summer felt extremely conflicted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me? I will help you steal dragon teeth.\u201d Claire displayed a charming smile, persuading with a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cW, why would you say these kinds of words? What qualifications do you have to make me follow you?\u201d Summer snorted, speaking disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m stronger than you. Currently, I could beat you up so much that your whole face bruises until you agree. Second, the three men guarding outside are stronger than you and can also make your whole face bruise. Third, my Master, Cliff, can beat you up so much that even flowers wouldn\u2019t bloom in your presence and immediately wither.\u201d Claire elaborated indifferently. Then she said one last sentence. \u201cOf course, if you agree, then not only will we not beat you up, we\u2019ll help you successfully steal dragon teeth and let you pass your exam, let you become a true part of the Ai Luo clan, let you become the Ai Luo clan\u2019s pride.\u201d With one jab, Claire had completely grasped Summer\u2019s weakness. The Ai Luo clan was the world\u2019s largest and oldest robber clan, but becoming a true part of the Ai Luo clan required passing a test.</p><br/><p>Summer frowned, then relaxed, then frowned again, and then relaxed again. Of course she had heard of Cliff\u2019s name and knew what kind of person he was. It was just that she never thought today she would bump into Cliff\u2019s recently acquired disciple. She was Claire Hill!</p><br/><p>And like so, Summer knit her brows and then smoothed them out many times, so much that just by watching, Walter felt conflicted. Summer finally said slowly, \u201cWhat kind of price do I need to pay?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

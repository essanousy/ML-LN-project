If his expression wasn\u2019t so pale and unusual, along with his erratic gaze, he could count as a pretty boy. Right now, he was staring at Claire without the slightest restraint.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Do you have a problem?\u201d Lashia frowned looking at the youth and asked harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo beautiful misses, good morning.\u201d The pale youth bowed courteously and then gave a smile he thought to be enchanting.</p><br/><p>Lashia\u2019s mouth twitched. Watching the artificially friendly youth, she held back her impulse of wanting to spit.</p><br/><p>Claire frowned. This person\u2026 she had a slight impression of. It seemed like a person Claire had pestered before and chased after very hard. He was called something like Si something De, she forgot his name already. But Claire did indeed have an impression of this face that was as pale as a pig\u2019s butt.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Claire, I want to invite you to eat lunch with me. Would you give me the honor?\u201d Male pig smiled, filled with self-confidence. Keep in mind that before, Claire had constantly pestered him. Male pig\u2019s gaze kept on wantonly drifting to Claire. It was really out of his expectations that Claire, who had at the time been so ordinary and idiotic, would actually become so brilliant. The fight from before that made her famous and the duel on that day in the library both left a deep impression on him. He really didn\u2019t think, didn\u2019t think that that idiotic male-chaser would also have a day when she attracted attention. Her radiance really made it a bit hard for people\u2019s gazes move away. Truthfully, if he looked closely, she was very pretty, it was just that before, that idiocy and male-chasing tendency made people\u2019s stomach churn. But now, it was completely different.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot available.\u201d Claire coldly refused, watching that unbridled gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Male pig became extremely rigid. He completely didn\u2019t expect his invitation that he was full of confidence of would receive these two cold words in response. He estimated that even if Claire was now different from before, perhaps have some misgivings and not accept while jumping wildly in joy, she would still smile like a flower and accept. But now she would directly refuse like this and not give any face?! Was it some kind of ploy to win his heart? It was definitely that!</p><br/><p>Lashia frowned and said impatiently, \u201cDo you not understand the human language? Elder Sister\u2019s said she\u2019s not available.\u201d</p><br/><p>But male pig didn\u2019t care for Lashia\u2019s attitude; the arrogant Lashia was always like this. And really, Claire\u2019s sister had already said that; was she really going to continue on acting?</p><br/><p>\u201cI think miss Claire only feels it\u2019s too embarrassing to accept immediately. Miss Lashia, can you give us some space for privacy?\u201d Male pig\u2019s pale face revealed what he thought to be an enchanting smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo time.\u201d Claire insipidly said and then was about to go forward.</p><br/><p>Lashia coldly snorted, disdainfully glanced at that male pig, and then followed behind Claire, preparing to leave together.</p><br/><p>Male pig froze, then became a bit angry. That idiot, not even giving face! When would she stop acting?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Male pig raised his voice and said.</p><br/><p>Claire turned a deaf ear and just left.</p><br/><p>Male pig became a bit anxious, quickly chased and caught up and barred Claire\u2019s way. He started laughing coldly. \u201cStop acting, didn\u2019t you always long to be together with me?\u201d After he said this, male pig was about to grab Claire\u2019s hand. Male pig\u2019s eyes only saw the cold-faced Claire. This kind of Claire made his heart beat incessantly. Men are just this kind of creature; something easily obtainable would never be considered rare and vice versa.</p><br/><p>Claire watched that pervert reach over and slightly frowned.</p><br/><p>The next moment, an extremely tragic cry echoed from the forest into the skies, scaring all the birds in the forest to fly away.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s face was ice-cold as male pig grasped his own right wrist, incessantly bawling. The crisp cracking sound just now was so clear-cut! It snapped, it snapped, his wrist bone had snapped! Male pig\u2019s tears flew violently, and his nose nearly flew with them. He watched the cold-faced Claire fearfully. From when she had snapped off his wrist to now, she still hadn\u2019t changed her expression!</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot! My elder sister said she\u2019s not available! If you do that again, I\u2019ll snap off your other hand!\u201d Originally, Lashia had started gathering up her energy, preparing to attack with magic, but looks like it wasn\u2019t needed anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 Ah! Ah! My hand, ah!\u201d Male pig\u2019s tears were still flying violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still don\u2019t find a healer, your hand will be gone.\u201d Claire\u2019s quiet voice was as tranquil and clear as a death god.</p><br/><p>Male pig seemed like he had woken up from a dream as he ran out the forest panicking, hating that his parents had only given him two legs.</p><br/><p>Male pig was an example\u2026</p><br/><p>So afterwards, Claire\u2019s campus life went very smoothly, and never again was there a narcissistic so-called pretty boy that came to harass her.</p><br/><p>Just as Claire thought she could have a period of peace, something big happened.</p><br/><p>An epidemic broke out in Niya City, Claire\u2019s fiefdom!</p><br/><p>In the Hill castle\u2019s study.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan\u2019s serious face looked at the documents on the table, his brows already knit tight.</p><br/><p>Claire stood aside quietly, waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, this time the situation is extremely serious. The epidemic in Niya city is still expanding, furthermore, this time the epidemic arrived very strangely. The public is also a bit restless. Although I don\u2019t want to go there and take any risks, but as Niya city\u2019s city lord, you need to go. Do you understand?\u201d Duke Gordan\u2019s expression was a bit solemn and worried. Based on his desires, he would definitely not want Claire to go to that kind of dangerous place. If she was infected by the plague, then the consequences go without saying. But Claire was the city lord and a member of the Hill family.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, Grandfather. When do we go?\u201d Claire solemnly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back to your room and see this data. Tonight we go out. The Temple of Light also sent people to assist you. I hope you can control this epidemic. Disaster relief supplies will be sent from the capital tomorrow. You will first leave tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Grandfather, you don\u2019t need to worry. Nothing will happen to me.\u201d Claire consoled Duke Gordan after receiving the data.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be extremely, extremely careful and return safely, okay?\u201d Duke Gordan exhorted again worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Grandfather, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Claire revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that an enormous explosion sounded, which the two heard.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan abruptly got up, looking completely astonished, because the sound was from inside the castle grounds. It seemed to be Emery\u2019s house!</p><br/><p>Claire also looked doubtfully out the window and saw the rolling black smoke. It seemed like something had exploded. But Claire perceived intense magic undulations in the air. Evidently, this explosion was created by magic!</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, something bad has happened, something bad has happened! Cliff and Emery have started fighting. Cliff wants to kill Emery!\u201d The servant started to shout, not even knocking on the door before he pushing it open abruptly. Everyone knew that Emery was Duke Gordan\u2019s right hand man, and Cliff was a legend. No matter which of the two was harmed, small characters like them wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with or even think the consequences.</p><br/><p>What? Second master wants to kill first master?</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression changed. Without a word, she hurriedly rushed out of the study to Emery\u2019s house. Duke Gordan followed closely from behind.</p><br/><p>Emery was definitely not the wizard sage Cliff\u2019s match!</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Claire frowned, coldness flashing in her eyes. She had already given that sword to Jean and didn\u2019t really have control over it anymore. Also, she didn\u2019t have any interest in the rude girl\u2019s weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe Miss will win another magic sword.\u201d Jean\u2019s voice quietly sounded from behind Claire. His meaning was clear; Jean agreed to put his weapon at stake, and he firmly believed that Claire would definitely win.</p><br/><p>That sword was also a magic sword? Now Claire noticed the sword that Alice had stuck into the ground. Sure enough, there was a faint magic undulation. It was a good sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, Miss.\u201d Jean went up and handed Claire the sword from his waist. The opponent had a weapon, so naturally Claire couldn\u2019t be empty-handed. Claire accepted the sword and turned to look at Alice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood enough.\u201d Claire smiled brilliantly like a cherry blossom, nodding her head lightly. \u201cThen let\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Brat who doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them!\u201d Alice sneered, lifted up the sword from the ground, started to gather her energy, and prepared to instantly close in onto Claire and deliver a fatal blow. Secretly, she had already decided to beat this man-chaser up until she squirmed on the ground, make her lose all of the Hill clan\u2019s face, step high over her, and make Claire beg her for mercy in front of everyone here!</p><br/><p>\u201cGive that little vixen a Spiritual attack, making her immobile, and then kick her face, and then step on her back, and then shave off all her hair!\u201d Walter clamoured in Claire\u2019s mind. Walter also loathed this arrogant and brainless noble lady. Aristocrats truly overestimated themselves. The little devil was also an aristocrat, but she didn\u2019t seem to show it off that much.</p><br/><p>Claire kept silent. Without a word, she brandished the sword and directly dashed towards Alice. Exuberant at seeing this, Alice immediately raised her sword and rushed forward. Walter started howling, \u201cCrap! Little devil, aren\u2019t you the most devious person in the world? Why aren\u2019t you tricking this vixen today? Don\u2019t tell me you actually want to fight her head on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Alice was incessantly ecstatic. As expected, this idiotic man-chaser doesn\u2019t think at all, actually wanting to do close combat with her! Just relying on her strength as an advanced warrior to have close combat with her?! That really was a pipe dream!</p><br/><p>With a low grunt, teal Dou Qi burst out of Alice\u2019s entire body and she fiercely chopped towards Claire. She was confident that Claire would absolutely not be able to withstand this extremely powerful strike, and definitely be groveling on the ground by the power of her attack.</p><br/><p>But Claire didn\u2019t release any Dou Qi, directly facing the attack. Just as a smile appeared on Alice\u2019s face, Claire made a strange, nimble dodge and disappeared right in front of Alice. Instantly, Alice\u2019s pupils widened. What did it mean if the opponent disappeared right in front of a warrior? A warrior was best at fighting head on!</p><br/><p>The next moment, an ice-cold, hollow slash sound came from behind Alice. Instantly, Alice came back to her senses and brought her sword behind. The fierce, resonating sound of the clash of the swords made the back of Alice\u2019s head break out in sweat. If this attack hit her, then\u2026</p><br/><p>But what would shock her had only started. Claire\u2019s malicious, crafty, and unusual attacks made her extremely uncomfortable. How is this a battle? How is this a battle between warriors? This male-chaser was actually this malicious, her every attack was directed towards her vitals or a gap in her defense, making her weary and unable to cope. If it continued this way, Alice gradually wouldn\u2019t even have the strength to attack any more and only be able to defend.</p><br/><p>The high intensity and weariness from blocking the blows made Alice\u2019s physical strength rapidly drop. Because if she was careless just once, Claire\u2019s sword would hit her vitals.</p><br/><p>The more everyone who had circled around watched, the more shocked they were. Claire, that formerly idiotic male-chaser, what kind of sword skill was she using right now?! It was so eerie and nimble. The grand warrior Alice was forced to withdraw, panting for breath. The Dou Qi that had originally been radiating bright teal was now slowly fading. But!! From beginning to end, Claire hadn\u2019t even used Dou Qi, only simply using sword skills to attack!</p><br/><p>Jean squinted while watching the duel, also incessantly puzzled. The sword skill Claire used was very strong, very incredible. Claire personally said that she was using softness to conquer strength, using the power of the opponent to attack the opponent instead. Up until now, Jean was still unable to understand much. How on earth Claire learned this mysterious sword skill had always been a mystery.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Claire coldly snorted, green Dou Qi bursting out of her entire body, fiercely striking directly at Alice. Alice hurriedly raised her sword to block, but right now she was already unable to intercept this strike from Claire that had been brimming with power.</p><br/><p>After the weapons interlocked, there was a ringing sound, followed by the sound of a sword falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>Silence.</p><br/><p>The sword from Alice\u2019s hand had been struck flying and landed not far from the two. Claire\u2019s face was ice cold as she brandished her sword and pointed at Alice\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>A cold wind blew, lifting Claire\u2019s golden hair, shining like the sun.</p><br/><p>Alice\u2019s eyes were dead and ashen.</p><br/><p>The surroundings were silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo people from the Roman family are like this? Having no strength but still insisting on challenging?\u201d Lashia\u2019s cold voice came. This girl held onto grudges fiercely. She had remembered the words that Alice had said in the library a moment ago very clearly. Now she repeated the exact words back at Alice.</p><br/><p>Alice hatefully looked up towards Lashia, her eyes lighting up with unresigned, angry fire, but wasn\u2019t able to say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Claire picked up the sword that was formerly Alice\u2019s from the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, elder sister, isn\u2019t it too many if your knight uses two swords?\u201d Lashia said on purpose, giggling as she walked over, disdainfully looking at the powerless Alice who was kneeling on the ground.</p><br/><p>Walter clicked his tongue. That damnable peacock, calling out \u201celder sister\u201d now so intimately. Before, she had walked with her nose pointed at the sky! Jean raised his brow slightly but didn\u2019t say anything. It didn\u2019t need to be mentioned how much Lashia loathed Claire before. Now, this little girl\u2019s tone of voice had a faint hint of pride, pride for Claire. She really was a naive little girl. Once she decided on something she would believe in it no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can have it, you can give it to any warrior friend you like.\u201d After handing back Jean his sword, Claire looked at the other magic sword that was strangely shaped, and without a thought, gave it to Lashia.</p><br/><p>Alice\u2019s eyes widened, rigidly staring at the magic sword in Lashia\u2019s hands that was originally hers. That was one of the Roman family\u2019s heirlooms! Very precious! But now she actually lost it! How could she go back and explain? Her father and grandfather would definitely fly into a rage.</p><br/><p>Lashia happily waved the magic sword in her hand around. \u201cThanks, elder sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire smiled faintly, and turned back to walk towards the main entrance of the library. She still hadn\u2019t completely finished searching through illustrated handbooks. There was an impenetrable crowd but when Claire walked over, they let a path open. The conversations submerged Alice. Everyone\u2019s gaze followed Claire until she disappeared into the library\u2019s main gate.</p><br/><p>As an advanced warrior, Claire had defeated the grand warrior, Alice, and used Dou Qi only at the very end. Some people cried out in surprise at Claire\u2019s astonishing strength, while others were disdainful that Claire constantly dodged and wasted Alice\u2019s strength to win. But no matter what, Claire had won this duel and even won the magic sword heirloom of the Roman clan.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s name resounded in the capital again.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Lashia\u2019s current attitude to Claire was completely different. After she found out the reason why Claire had come to the library, she voluntarily tried to help Claire search through the illustrated handbooks. But after working for the whole afternoon, they still couldn\u2019t figure out what kind of magic beast White Emperor was.</p><br/><p>At dusk, Claire and Lashia returned home, but saw a luxurious carriage stopped at the doors. The insignia on the carriage was the Roman clan\u2019s insignia!</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that because that idiotic Alice couldn\u2019t beat Elder Sister, she came over here to tattle?\u201d Lashia said, looking at the carriage disdainfully. Now that little girl was so affectionate, calling her Elder Sister, completely forgetting how difficult she had made things for Claire. Walter rolled his eyes, sighing in his heart that as expected, women are the most fickle beings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Claire said, insipidly. That Alice\u2019s personality would never do this kind of idiotic thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go in and see for ourselves.\u201d Lashia took the lead, walking through the main gate.</p><br/><p>In the grand hall, Duke Gordan smiled, looking at another old man and discussing. Alice had her head down, standing silently aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Gordan, I\u2019m truly sorry. The two children were playing around with a gamble, but our family\u2019s child is also insensible, actually losing the Balrog flame magic sword. You also know that it is our clan\u2019s heirloom. Really, sigh\u2026\u201d That old man smiled, looking like he was very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>When Walter heard this, he couldn\u2019t contain himself. There\u2019s actually someone more shameless than me!!! Wait, no, Walter immediately added to himself, it should be said there\u2019s actually someone more shameless than the little devil!</p><br/><p>These words sounded even more appetizing than roasted chicken: two children playfully betting and losing a sword. So? So now he wanted to come and get the sword back?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

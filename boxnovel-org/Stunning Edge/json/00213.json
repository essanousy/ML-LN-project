The beasts for riding were a herd of elephants, with a pack of werewolves sitting on them. The one in the front was a werewolf in black clothes. On his shoulder was a prominent badge, and a golden tassel fluttered about. The werewolves were the vanguard of the Orc clan\u2019s army and they robust and fast-speed werewolves were also responsible for the patrol of the Orc clan.</p><br/><p>All the Orc man stopped right in front of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman beings, we know what you\u2019re coming for.\u201d Without waiting for Qi Aoshuang to speak, the leader of the werewolves spoke in rugged voice.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was slightly surprised. The other party knew what we come for? Could it be? Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression changed and his eyes sank. Could Chu Xing and Dong Fenghou have encountered danger?</p><br/><p>\u201cOur prophet told us to give this to you, and you will go away.\u201d The leader of the werewolves took out something in his arms and threw it to Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gazed at it, a crystal ball? After she held it, she looked at the exquisite crystal ball in her hand and was a little shocked. Is it the memory crystal?</p><br/><p>A prophet? Leng Lingyun was also shocked. The prophet was the most powerful of the Orc clan. Even the king of the Orc clan didn\u2019t have a high status as a prophet. The prophet can always help the Orc clan with his wisdom and his knowledge. Now it seemed that the prophet had predicted that their group would come?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease watch the record inside.\u201d The leader of the werewolves urged Qi Aoshuang and all the werewolves did not leave.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Aoshuang immediately injected the magic power into the crystal ball to see the recorded scenes inside. Her heart sank as she saw the blinding white wings appeared in the image. What was recorded inside was that the eight-winged angel had come here and taken the artifact that in the hands of the Orc clan. Without even the slightest bit of effort, the orcs didn\u2019t resist and handed the artifact to the eight-winged angel. After all, that thing didn\u2019t really help them much. If they resist, they will be wounded! Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression also turned dark. This meant that the Sky Slaughter Divine Feathers couldn\u2019t gather together any more. What they had done was in vain!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s face was as dark as water. She slowly raised her head to look at the leader of the wolves, \u201cthank you for your advice, but I wonder if I have friends here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you are the human beings here for the first time in years,\u201d he said. The Werewolf answered coldly. His eyes were clear without deception. He said loudly, \u201csince you have seen it now, can you leave now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was both elated and disappointed. Knowing that Qiao Chuxin and Dong Fenghou were alright, her heart settled down. It was dejected that the Sky Slaughter Divine Feathers could no longer gather together. What these orcs did was normal. They didn\u2019t want to interfere with the goddess of light, so they would naturally hand over the useless divine artifact.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks. We will leave now. \u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded towards the leader of the werewolf. His face was completely calm and collected.</p><br/><p>The werewolves didn\u2019t move at all. They watched as Qi Aoshuang\u2019s group turned around and left. Only after they disappeared did they turn around and run away.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s group returned to where were Judy and Jin Yan. When he saw them coming back so quickly, Jin Yan was shocked when he saw Qi Aoshuang\u2019s face. He stood up and looked nervously at the crowd: \u201cis that Qiao Chuxin and Dong Fenghou \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they have not been here yet.\u201d Leng Lingyun lightly shook his head and smiled wryly, \u201cBut the Orcs\u2019 divine artifact has been taken away by the angels.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan suddenly turned to look at Qi Aoshuang. Although his eyes were filled with disbelief, when he saw Qi Aoshuang\u2019s calm but somewhat dejected face, Jin Yan understood that what Leng Lingyun had said was true! So everything\u2019s in vain?</p><br/><p>\u201cMi\u2026miss \u2026\u201d Jin Yan struggled to speak.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang exhaled a long breath and turned to look at Jin Yan. She revealed a brilliant smile and said, \u201cNothing. Even if the divine artifacts couldn\u2019t gather together, there must be other ways. I want to increase my own strength and keep on increasing! \u201d Qi Aoshuang then sat down on his butt. \u201cWe will wait for Chuxin and the Dong Fenghou here. We will return to Uusari after they arrive. \u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan looked at Qi Aoshuang who was smiling brilliantly, a little bit stunned. He then came to himself. On his handsome face there was a smile as he lightly nodded, \u201cYes, miss.I will follow you all the time. \u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s originally worried heart relaxed a little at this moment. He looked at Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression and smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>Aosta raised his eyebrows slightly. He had thought that this girl would be despair and would always be depressed. He didn\u2019t expect that she could adjust so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAosta \u2026\u201d Suddenly, Qi Aoshuang\u2019s voice sounded in Aosta\u2019s ears. He turned around and looked at Qi Aoshuang with some surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is for you, the Sky Slaughter Divine Feathers can\u2019t gather together.\u201d The Sky Slaughter is back to you. \u201d Qi Aoshuang took out the Sky Slaughter Space Ring and handed it to Aosta.</p><br/><p>Aosta silently looked at the Sky Slaughter in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s hands, but he did not reach out to take it. If he took it, it meant that he should be back in the Elvish Forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou take it first, I don\u2019t have anywhere to put it. Even without the Sky Slaughter Divine Feather, you can still pull the goddess of light down? \u201d Aosta lied through his teeth. As prince of the elvish clan, how could he have no space to put the ring? He didn\u2019t want to leave like that, not wanting to leave this mysterious girl. He felt that as long as he stayed by her side, there would be many unimaginable things.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Qi Aoshuang\u2019s gaze turned cold, but her gaze was extremely firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll personally witness that day and I\u2019ll go back then and return me the Sky Slaughter.\u201d Without waiting for Qi Aoshuang to reply, Aosta left.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was slightly taken aback, but still,she withdrew the Sky Slaughter.</p><br/><p>Judy had been unconscious, and after five days here, Judy had woken up, and Qiao Chuxin and Dong Fenghou also arrived in haste.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot. Didn\u2019t you say you knew the way? So many unnecessary long ways!! \u201d Qiao Chuxin\u2019s angry voice came from ahead.</p><br/><p>The two figures got closer and closer. They rode together on a magical beast, while Qiao Chuxin, who was sitting in the back held the ear of Dong Fenghou, scolding .</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked at them as they got closer and smiled knowingly.</p><br/><p>Now you can go back to Uusari.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You go in first.\u201d \u201cEat something good tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow, alright.\u201d \u201cBut I want to play with Ao Shuang later.\u201d Ah\u2019Bao nodded his head in agreement and didn\u2019t forget to open the deal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, you can go in now.\u201d Heaven Breaker could only agree.</p><br/><p>After Ah\u2019Bao entered, Po turned around and looked at the two. The helpless and awkward smile on his face was no longer there. Instead, it was replaced with a calm and collected expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, not bad. You\u2019ve already passed the eighth level of the trial.\u201d Heaven Breaker smiled appreciatively at Qi Ao Shuang, then turned to Diantz. \u201cI wonder what business does the Star Academy have with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with official matters, I came here to accompany Xiao Aushuang to take a look.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Dittos replied indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Heaven Breaker was somewhat taken aback by these words. All this time, Dittas had always been the Star Academy\u2019s envoy and refused to be seen as a thousand miles away. He had never been polite or talked too much to the people of the four cities. To think that he would actually say such words today and accompany Qi Aushuang to take a look, and it wasn\u2019t official business at all? This was too strange. What about the cold, beautiful woman who had been with Dittas all this time? It seemed to be something called Lenny, how come there\u2019s no one there?</p><br/><p>Dittos ignored Heaven Breaker\u2019s questions and stood silently to the side.</p><br/><p>Heaven Breaker\u2019s attitude wasn\u2019t strange at all. Instead, he turned around and continued speaking to Qi Ao Shuang: \u201cAo Shuang, why are you with him?\u201d \u201cCould it be that you also \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, I am also the envoy this time.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded.</p><br/><p>The astonishment in Heaven Breaker\u2019s eyes grew even more intense. Qi Ao Shuang actually ranked among the top three of the 8-star students. So what\u2019s the rank? What about the other two? And Lenny and Jonathan?</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Heaven Breaker, where\u2019s Artis?\u201d I also want to thank him in person. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked toward the hall behind Heaven Breaker, but she didn\u2019t see Artis.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the inn, with the disciples of the Heaven\u2019s Path Sect. They will be here later.\u201d \u201cThere are also some disciples from the Celestial Sect who wish to represent our Heavenly Treasure City in this competition.\u201d Heaven Breaker looked at Qi Ao Shuang and asked, \u201cOh right, you came to find Artis?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I came to see you and ask if there\u2019s anything I can help you with.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thank you so much.\u201d Your current strength is indeed not weak. To be able to rise to such a level in such a short period of time, it is truly unbelievable. \u201cHowever, this time, I don\u2019t need you to do anything. I think we can take care of it ourselves.\u201d Heaven Breaker started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. If you need my help, feel free to speak up.\u201d It goes without saying that Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s gratitude towards Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao went without saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely, definitely.\u201d \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go in and have a seat. We\u2019ll have dinner here tonight.\u201d Heaven Breaker replied with a smile, but the glint in his eyes betrayed him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cHeaven Breaker, you actually don\u2019t want me to enter, right?\u201d When you saw Ah\u2019Bao throwing himself at me, you went crazy. Why would you want me to go in and have a good time with Ah\u2019Bao? \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang had mercilessly exposed Heaven Breaker\u2019s thoughts. In his heart, he couldn\u2019t help but secretly laugh. This guy was so unfathomable the first time he saw him, but this matter about Ah\u2019Bao was so childish and adorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, hehe, is that so?\u201d \u201cNo?\u201d Heaven Breaker laughed dryly as he laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I can\u2019t see through your thoughts.\u201d Just tell Po I have work to do. I said I\u2019d come to see her some other day. \u201d Xiao Aushuang laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, take care.\u201d This time, Heaven Breaker gave a straightforward answer.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang speechlessly rolled her eyes, turned around and looked at Dittos, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Dittens, don\u2019t talk to this guy who has no humanity to the people of the opposite sex.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dylan followed behind Qi Ao Shuang silently and left the east hall.</p><br/><p>Heaven Breaker watched Qi Ao Shuang leave with a smile. When Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s figure disappeared, he hurriedly turned around to leave. In his heart, he was naturally eager for Qi Ao Shuang to stay away from Ah\u2019Bao. What a joke, Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s situation was special right now. Although her soul was a woman, but her body was a real man. Just a moment ago, I wiped off so much oil from Ah\u2019Bao. Wuuuuu, how miserable. Now, he could take advantage of the situation to get back at them! Go back and carry your Po. Heaven Breaker hurried back.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Ao Shuang and Dentance left the Eastern Courtyard, Xiao Ao Shuang had a smile on his face, appearing to be in a good mood. \u201cThe lord of the Heavenly Treasure City will never be able to step into the Space Shattering Realm in this life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned to look at the calm Dittas.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is worried. His love is his greatest restraint. My mind is all on that woman. \u201d Dittos coldly said these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHur hur.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled, looked at Dotans and said, \u201cIf you have any ties, you can\u2019t step into the Space Shattering Realm. Do you think that makes sense?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not waiting for the expression on Dittas\u2019 face to change, Qi Ao Shuang continued, \u201cHe probably never thought of stepping into the Space Shattering Realm.\u201d Because he had achieved his goal in this life. He\u2019s doing fine, that\u2019s enough. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrog at the bottom of the well!\u201d Dittos frowned and said coldly, \u201cCould it be that you, too, only need to live a good life?\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t pursue the Space Shattering Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stopped after seeing the expression on his face. Dittos also stopped and frowned at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittas, although I don\u2019t agree with your methods of cultivation, I am heartless and heartless. However, I have a reason why I had to step into the Space Shattering Realm. Therefore, I will definitely step into the Space Shattering Realm. \u201cDefinitely!\u201d At this point, the smile on Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s face was gone, replaced by an unspeakable determination.</p><br/><p>For a long time, Dotans stared at Xiao Ao Shuang, but he didn\u2019t speak or move.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang also looked at Dittas in silence, but her eyes were filled with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, I believe you.\u201d \u201cYou and I will definitely both step into the Space Shattering Realm.\u201d A hint of a smile suddenly appeared on Dittas\u2019 handsome face, causing one\u2019s heart to ripple.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang smiled, and without saying anything else, she started walking forward. Dittos followed, a knowing smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Walking on the street, Qi Ao Shuang surveyed her surroundings. When the passersby saw their attire, they automatically let them pass. Just as Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s gaze stopped at a pharmacy, a familiar voice sounded in her ears, sounding exasperated, \u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d \u201cI finally caught you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang turned around and saw Parina, who was rushing towards him in a huff.</p><br/><p>A trace of gloominess flashed in Dentance\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI owe her a favor. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s over.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly said in a low voice. It was because she could see the dark glint in Dittas\u2019s eyes from the side. As Chang Kong had said, Ditanse was a very, very dangerous and cold person. For some reason, when Dittas saw a glint of gloom in Parina\u2019s eyes, a chill arose in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart. Parina was sometimes more willful, but she was generally a good person.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll head back first. You have to deal with it as soon as possible.\u201d Dittos expressionlessly spat out these words. However, the gloominess in her eyes had already disappeared, and the coldness in her heart had also vanished in an instant. Xiao Ao Shuang understood that what she said earlier was true. When Dittens heard that Qi Ao Shuang only felt that she owed Palina a favor, he didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang only replied faintly.</p><br/><p>When Parina arrived in front of Qi Ao Shuang, she stomped her feet and asked, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, why didn\u2019t you wait for me at the school gate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is there?\u201d I didn\u2019t see you at the door. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang lied without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Parina hopped in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll treat you to a meal and return the favor.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face was expressionless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stab you with my fork!\u201d Parina was so angry that she wanted to jump up again, \u201cYou bastard, I didn\u2019t come looking for you to ask you out for a meal.\u201d Besides, do you think you can repay my favor by treating me to a meal? I helped you save four people. You have to figure out that it\u2019s four people!</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to save that much. I only asked you to save Tanin.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d \u201cYou bastard!\u201d Parina was so angry that she opened her eyes wide and glared at Xiao Ao Shuang. She didn\u2019t understand what was wrong with her. Why was he always so easily angered by this fellow? \u201cI don\u2019t care. I helped you save four people that day.\u201d And that includes the Tarina you\u2019re trying to save. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A cry of surprise came from the side, and it was a familiar voice from Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang had a headache, what was going on today? One troublesome woman after another came to him. It was Tarina!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, are you the woman who saved us on the lake that day?\u201d \u201cYou, the day you put on your makeup?\u201d At some point, Tarina had stood beside them and was looking at Parina in astonishment.</p><br/><p>The corner of Parina\u2019s mouth twitched in displeasure. There were so many people on the street, yet she was so focused on making a ruckus with Xiao Ao Shuang that she didn\u2019t notice anyone approaching her. It was this annoying woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, so what?\u201d What\u2019s the matter with you ungrateful fellows? Get out of the way. \u201cIt\u2019s Qi Ao Shuang who owes me, not you.\u201d Parina crossed her arms in front of her chest and looked at Tarrina impatiently with slanted eyes. She was extremely dissatisfied with the way the woman in front of her looked at her every time she saw her. Her eyes were filled with love, and even a woman would know what she meant. Xiao Ao Shuang even told him to save this woman. Hmph, the relationship between the two must not be simple. How infuriating!</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister, why are you here?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the shocked face of Tanina and asked indifferently. Behind her was a woman who looked rather familiar. He seemed to have seen one of them during the examination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, the Tian Dao Sect, live at the inn right in front of us.\u201d \u201cSo \u2026\u201d Seeing the calm look on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face, Tanina\u2019s heart felt very complicated. The bitter woman who had saved them was Parina, one of the school beauties. Would she use this favor to blackmail Qi Ao Shuang into doing something that would put Qi Ao Shuang in a difficult position? If so \u2026! Tarina\u2019s fists were already clenched tightly. If that was the case, she definitely wouldn\u2019t agree. If only he had known earlier, he wouldn\u2019t have accepted Parina\u2019s help!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right in front?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a moment.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled and nodded, then turned to Talina and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go repay the favor of Parina. I\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d A smile immediately appeared on Talena\u2019s face, brimming with joy and anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang, I\u2019ve made up my mind! \u201cI\u2019ve thought it through. Why did you return the favor?!\u201d When she saw the two of them like this, her heart was filled with rage. She immediately blurted out these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked.</p><br/><p>Tarina\u2019s heart tightened. When she saw the smug look in Parina\u2019s eyes, she began to panic. This woman, what did she want to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is \u2026\u201d With a crafty smile, Parina reached out her hand and grabbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arm. She raised her chin and said loudly to Tanina, \u201cMy request is very simple. I want you to be my boyfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tarina\u2019s pupils suddenly contracted, but her heart felt as if it had been stabbed by needles. She blankly stared at the proud Perina. Boyfriend? She actually wanted to make Qi Ao Shuang her girlfriend?! Just because Xiao Ao Shuang asked her to help him, was that the price?</p><br/><p>No! How can this be! In this instant, the blood drained from her face, and her entire body began to tremble. Absolutely not!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d With a cold voice, Qi Ao Shuang expressionlessly pulled her arm out of Parina\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou promised to repay this favor, are you trying to be shameless?!\u201d When she saw him, she became anxious.</p><br/><p>Talina was stunned. Looking at the indifferent expression on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face and hearing the firm and cold tone of Qi Ao Shuang, her heart was instantly drowned in intense joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI meant to repay you back, but I didn\u2019t say I was going to do it this way.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face was cold and expressionless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if I insist on you returning my favor this way?!\u201d Parina was extremely angry that Qi Ao Shuang rejected her so bluntly. She was so angry that her face turned red. She stomped her feet and pressed on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you insist, then I won\u2019t be able to repay your favor. \u201cThere was only one result.\u201d A cold smile suddenly appeared on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face. Beautiful and deadly as a poppy, both Tarina and Parina were distraught.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t repay your favor, so \u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang leaned close to Parina, gently opening her thin lips and spitting out a sentence that made her expression change abruptly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

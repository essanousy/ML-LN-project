If you don\u2019t go now, that malefic person will awaken and return back to heaven and we\u2019ll be out of luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you slow poke. Hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>With white jade floors and topaz pillars, the magnificent Heaven Palace was currently filled with chaos. All the gods were frantic, all urging a fat immortal.</p><br/><p>Darkness surrounded her, and her body felt light.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m dead? She opened her eyes and looked up, but as before, it was dark.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she saw a burst of light.</p><br/><p>A bald, chubby, smiling face appeared. Behind his bald head was a soft, light halo ring. It looked extremely pure and sacred.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d She frowned at the bald person that suddenly appeared. If she died, then shouldn\u2019t Ox-Head and Horse-Face come and drag her before Yama?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy child, don\u2019t be skeptical. You are truly dead, and with the sins you committed in your lifetime, you should have been sent to the bottom of hell already.\u201d The halo above chubby bald person\u2019s head was very conspicuous and his smile very wide. It was as if he was the most benevolent elder in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gone to hell yet.\u201d She added insipidly, \u201cAlso, I\u2019m not your child. You are male, so you couldn\u2019t have given birth to a person like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chubby faced person started sweating, his expression becoming a little awkward. As expected, this nefarious person wouldn\u2019t be that easy to deal with. Even though she lost all her memories, she was still as big a pain to deal with. That was why the gods decided to draw sticks to decide which person to send to settle this issue, and he was the one who unfortunately drew it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, ahem~~\u201d The bald and chubby person coughed, straightened his face and said seriously, \u201cBased on your having a merciful soul and great talent, we have had a discussion and decided to give you a chance to atone for you sins. We will let you go to another world to continue to cultivate.\u201d</p><br/><p>What? A merciful soul? Great talent? What do they mean? What atoning for sins? Going to another world to continue cultivation? What and what?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, child. I hope you will live happily.\u201d The fat, bald faced person didn\u2019t waste any more words, and instead lightly waved his hand. A ray of light shot towards her, erasing her memories of their conversation as well.</p><br/><p>The next moment, she disappeared from where she had been standing. The chubby and bald person let out a long breath and wiped the sweat on his forehead. Immediately, many gods appeared around him. They all laughed vulgarly, patting his shoulder and praising him.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, now that trouble making being will be far from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite something, making up so many funny reasons and then just sent her away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good, I\u2019ll mark down this big merit for you.\u201d The person who said this was naturally the governor of heaven.</p><br/><p>But the bald and chubby faced person couldn\u2019t smile. Even though he did send her away, if one day that malefic person came back, the first to die would be him!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of? She\u2019ll need to cultivate for a long time before she can return, before her godhead can appear. That\u2019s something that won\u2019t happen for thousands of years.\u201d Someone immediately consoled him.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true. Hearing this, the bald and chubby person also started smiling vulgarly.</p><br/><p>Malefic being, in that world, you should pray for good luck. It\u2019s best if you don\u2019t remember anything, best if you never return.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

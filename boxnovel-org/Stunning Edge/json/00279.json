Qi Ao Shuang followed silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d You can\u2019t be so unkind, Dittos. Jonathan began to squawk.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two voices spoke in unison.</p><br/><p>It was Qi Ao Shuang who said that he was an idiot, and it was Dittos who said that he was retarded. Both of them were expressionless.</p><br/><p>Then they walked on together, ignoring the petrified Jonathan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, only you know my heart.\u201d The two of them walked side by side, and suddenly Dittos said the same thing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned. She turned to look at Dittas, but Dittas remained calm, as if what he said just now wasn\u2019t what he said. Xiao Ao Shuang smiled faintly and did not say anything. She understood that if she were a woman at this moment, then her words would sound ambiguous. But now that she was a man, she knew that Dittos was treating her as a brother and a friend. Qi Ao Shuang clearly understood why Diantz had said such a thing. Because she understood what Dittos meant.</p><br/><p>Jonathan caught up with him after a moment, scratched his head, and realized that he had misunderstood Dittas. Thus, he silently followed behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look at the Eternal Palace.\u201d \u201cThat is the place where the people of Nine Heavens City live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, look again?\u201d Those people walk with their noses up. \u201d Jonathan smirked. The Hall of Eternity was the residence of some of the stronger men under the command of the Nine Heavens City\u2019s Castellan. These people were similar to Guest Warriors. The amount of food and shelter they had was the last. Nine Heavens City would provide them with everything they needed for cultivation, and they would help them whenever they needed anything in the city. His position in the Nine Heavens City was quite high, so it was not an exaggeration to say that Jonathan could walk with his nose in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis meeting of the four cities will depend on them. \u201cSo go take a look, no other people from other cities can sneak in.\u201d Dittos said slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, what\u2019s so good about those old things?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to participate, but you want to participate in their turn to show off their might?\u201d Jonathan obviously didn\u2019t like them.</p><br/><p>Dittos did not speak again. Xiao Ao Shuang looked around curiously, and suddenly, the sky appeared, squatting on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder and looking at her surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Jonathan looked at the sky. \u201cYour pet?\u201d You still keep this furry little marten? To attract the attention of the ladies? \u201cYou are too vulgar.\u201d Jonathan sighed.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was speechless. The formation of the Long Space was not self-directed. It was this guy himself who wanted to become like this. Jonathan was right. The reason why the sky had become so adorable was to attract girls\u2019 attention. This little pervert.</p><br/><p>\u201cJi Ji!\u201d The sky waved its claws at Jonathan, seemingly dissatisfied. Of course he resented Jonathan\u2019s last words. What vulgarity? What nonsense are you talking about? This is called scheming.</p><br/><p>Dotans only glanced at the sky indifferently before retracting his gaze. After a quick glance at him, the swaggering and swaggering Sky was silenced. He quietly squatted on Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, this kid is a bit, a bit \u2026\u201d Vast Sky\u2019s voice suddenly sounded in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang secretly conversed with Chang in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy isn\u2019t easy to deal with.\u201d The sky muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see it when we were in the swamp?\u201d \u201cMomo also said that he\u2019s not someone to be trifled with.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang felt strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t meet his eyes at that time. \u201cThis man is very cold and dangerous.\u201d With a solemn expression, Chang Bai added, \u201cBe careful of him.\u201d There was a lingering fear in the air. For some reason, he felt like the man could see through him with just one glance. This kind of feeling was very, very bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang agreed. Dittos was indeed much stronger than he was, so it wasn\u2019t strange for Kong Zhangkong to come to this conclusion.</p><br/><p>Eternal Palace was in the deepest part of the City Lord\u2019s Mansion, in a secluded and elegant environment. It was divided into many small courtyards that were not connected to each other. These small courtyards were where the guest officials lived.</p><br/><p>The three of them arrived at the entrance of the huge building. There were two guards standing upright at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go in.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said softly, \u201cPerhaps in two months, I will join the Heavenly Treasure City in participating in the Tripod Conference.\u201d \u201cIf we go in now, we might cause trouble in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Dotans was about to say something, Qi Ao Shuang added, \u201cI know you don\u2019t mind.\u201d \u201cBut your sister and your brother-in-law, you have to consider them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dittos slightly frowned and finally did not say anything. Instead, he nodded slightly and replied, \u201cThen wait for me here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going, either. I don\u2019t want to see those old guys with their noses up in the air,\u201d Jonathan pursed his lips and stood beside Xiao Ao Shuang, urging Dotans, \u201cGo quickly, go check quickly, and then come back.\u201d I\u2019m waiting for you to take us to the best hotel in town. \u201d</p><br/><p>Dittos did not speak again. He nodded and walked in.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, let me tell you, which restaurant should be established? Tsk, tsk, it smells good \u2026\u201d Jonathan narrowed his eyes in satisfaction, as if recalling the delicacy.</p><br/><p>Just as Jonathan squinted his eyes to savor the aftertaste, he suddenly heard a tender voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jonathan!\u201d A young and tender voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s face changed and he looked behind him unnaturally. Qi Ao Shuang also turned to look at the source of the voice. It was a small child dressed in luxurious clothes, only five or six years old. Behind him were two maids dressed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the mayor\u2019s son, Keira. \u201cDamn it, calling me Dittos is uncle. Call me brother.\u201d The corner of Jonathan\u2019s mouth twitched, obviously dissatisfied with the title.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang laughed inside when she heard this. It was a funny name, really, and it brought Jonathan down a generation.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeira, why are you here?\u201d Jonathan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to see Uncle Dittos.\u201d Find him and go to Auntie Lenny\u2019s. \u201d Keira revealed a pure smile, then he turned his head to look at Xiao Ao Shuang and asked with a frown, \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t even greet me when you saw me?\u201d At such a young age, he already had such an air of superiority.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of your Uncle Dittos.\u201d You go back first, Keira. I\u2019ll tell Dittos to send him to you later. \u201d Jonathan obviously didn\u2019t like the arrogant kid, so he replied perfunctorily. A trace of disdain flashed in his eyes. It was probably Lenny\u2019s method to find Dittas and go to Lenny. This lousy kid, listening to that hen?</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d Keira lifted his head, narrowed his eyes and sized up Qi Ao Shuang, frowning as he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d How come I\u2019ve never seen you before? Still red hair. \u201d Keira bluntly said. I wanted to say that this red hair is very dazzling, very ugly. But Keira refrained from remembering her mother\u2019s usual teachings. However, Aunt Lenny\u2019s orders must be done. Give this redheaded guy a little embarrassment and take Uncle Dittancz over. These were all trivial, extremely simple!</p><br/><p>Looking at the bossy child in front of her, and the deep look in his eyes, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart started to feel complicated. This child, at such a young age, he already had such a character. What would happen when he grew up? Jonathan had made it clear that the child\u2019s attitude was still the same. It seems to have been instigated. And the one who instigated it was Lenny, I\u2019m afraid. Should he say that this child had a bad character, or that Lenny was too skillful? Or both? If this child were to inherit the City Lord\u2019s position, would it be a blessing or a disaster for the Nine Heavens City?</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d \u201cOkay, Keira, you go back first.\u201d Jonathan urged perfunctorily.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang?\u201d Why does it sound like a woman\u2019s name? There was a sneer on Keira\u2019s small face that didn\u2019t quite match his age.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang shot a faint glance at Keira, but didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, she turned her head toward the entrance of the Eternal Hall, waiting for Dittancz to appear.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeira, aren\u2019t you a bit of a Young Chieftain when you talk?\u201d You can either go in and find it yourself, or you can go back. \u201d Jonathan\u2019s face changed abruptly. He no longer replied perfunctorily but said those words coldly. At this moment, the venomous Jonathan choked Keira until his face turned red. The two maidservants also lowered their heads, not daring to say anything. Their young master was not a good man, but this Jonathan was more terrifying. Better to shut up.</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s words confirmed that Keira did not have the connotations of a young master.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go in myself.\u201d Keira\u2019s face reddened, but he didn\u2019t dare to do anything to Jonathan. He could only give an indignant glance at Ao Shuang\u2019s back before passing by the two of them and walking towards the entrance of the Eternal Palace. The two maids hurriedly followed after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, don\u2019t be so calculative with this spoiled child.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s Lenny\u2019s dead hen again.\u201d Jonathan turned and stood beside Qi Ao Shuang to console her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded, she naturally wouldn\u2019t mind a small child like this. He was just feeling sad for the Nine Heavens City Lord. How could such a descendant bear such a heavy responsibility? Being young was not an excuse, but children from large families usually had two different situations. A person of self-restraint, bearing, or hedonistic character. This is related to the upbringing of the family. It was clear that the child was spoiled and did not give him the correct instruction he deserved.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, let\u2019s not talk about this.\u201d Jonathan was bored.</p><br/><p>The two men were silent for a moment, then Dittens came out with Keira in his arms. Keira\u2019s mouth was very high and he seemed very unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, why don\u2019t you take me to Auntie Lenny\u2019s for fun?\u201d Keira pursed her lips and wrapped her arms around Dittas\u2019s neck, making her final effort in a coquettish way.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo yourself.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to walk, just let the maids carry you.\u201d Dittos put Keira down and touched his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d Keira stamped her foot and tried to say something else.</p><br/><p>Dickens turned to Jonathan and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Don\u2019t you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Jonathan nodded, not looking at Keira\u2019s exasperated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys, bring the young master back.\u201d \u201cGo,\u201d Dittins instructed the two maidservants.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The two maidservants did not dare to even breathe loudly and agreed.</p><br/><p>Dittos did not say anything else and walked out with Jonathan and Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d Keira called out from behind him, but Dittos didn\u2019t look back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, let\u2019s go.\u201d The maid spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>A trace of viciousness flashed across Keira\u2019s eyes. He suddenly turned around and crooked his finger at the maid behind him. \u201cYou, squat down.\u201d</p><br/><p>After ten years of surprise, he still obediently squatted down.</p><br/><p>\u201cPah!\u201d Keira viciously slapped the maid in the face. Even though the child\u2019s strength was not great and the beating was not painful, it was loud and clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, I am your master. When will it be your turn to take care of me?\u201d Keira\u2019s heart was filled with rage, and he directed all of his anger at the maid before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The maid lowered her head and responded in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo Aunt Lenny.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Keira narrowed his eyes in hatred and left huffily. The two maids hurriedly followed.</p><br/><p>At this time, the three of them had already left the Mayor\u2019s mansion and were walking on the street.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, Dittas, that child of Keira\u2019s is really undisciplined. To speak rudely, to cause trouble for Qi Ao Shuang. \u201cIt must have been Lenny who instigated it.\u201d Jonathan was still unhappy and started to be noisy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dittos asked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it is, he \u2026\u201d Jonathan explained everything Kira had said in detail. Finally, he curled his lips and said, \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why this child would listen to Lenny so much.\u201d Did Lenny please him that much? \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not speak, her face was calm, as if these things had nothing to do with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d After hearing Jonathan\u2019s words, Dittos gave a light grunt of acknowledgment and did not say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Why don\u2019t you say yes? What\u2019s wrong with letting it go on like this? Lenny the hen abetted your nephew, in case something irreparable should happen in the future? \u201d Jonathan whined, stating the power of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d \u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jonathan pursed his lips and looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cTonight, Half Forest.\u201d Dittos suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf forest, what are you doing there?\u201d It was a desolate place, and there were magical beasts roaming about as well. \u201cWhat are you doing there in the middle of the night?\u201d Jonathan wondered. Why did Dittos suddenly say this?</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf of the forest, the checkered cliff.\u201d \u201cCome on.\u201d Still, Dittos was terse and concise.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slightly frowned, but didn\u2019t say anything. What did Dittos mean by that? What do you want to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling intent.\u201d Vast Sky\u2019s voice suddenly sounded in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, he emitted killing intent. Although it was only a sliver, I felt it.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s very good at hiding his killing intent.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Chang Bai replied.</p><br/><p>Killing intent? When Dotans said that just now, he was filled with killing intent?!</p><br/><p>What did he want to do tonight?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If you allow it to heal, there will be no problem. But traveling further into the mountains is not suitable for your body. Your body cannot heal in this kind of environment.\u201d Naturally, Leng Lingyun knew how strong his treatment was.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, thank you for saving me again.\u201d Claire had a slight smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Before Leng Lingyun spoke, Camille stepped in, narrowing his eyes in an unsatisfied manner. \u201cYou seem to be thanking him, but shouldn\u2019t you thank me first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, yes, thank you, esteemed secondary commander. In this group only you such quick reflexes,only you have such quick hands.\u201d Claire smiled slightly while complementing Camille. Camille was in a state of bliss, happily smiling through closed eyes.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there was only one person whose face had paled. And that was Li Yuewen. Listening to others, her face had turned to a more uncomfortable color.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Elder Li Yuewen, you still haven\u2019t paid the price for hurting me yet,\u201d Claire suddenly said in a heavy tone.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen froze, her expression changing a little. She looked back, trembling, at the serious-faced Claire. Her heart wouldn\u2019t calm down.</p><br/><p>However, Li Mingyu had a calm demeanor. He knew that Claire wouldn\u2019t really blame Li Yuewen.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen head drooped as she said softly said in a low voice, \u201cYes, it\u2019s all my fault. My mistake harmed you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you almost stabbed me to death. If it weren\u2019t for Camille and Leng Lingyun, I would have died.\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was very cold.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen bit her lip very hard, biting so hard, it nearly bled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you have to pay the price.\u201d Claire\u2019s tone suddenly took a turn. She said steadfastly, \u201cI lost too much blood, my head is dizzy, you have to take care of me. Right now, I am still weak, so I cannot continue practicing. Let\u2019s go back now and after being fully rested, then I can go to your family\u2019s training ground to train. Also, don\u2019t pull any pranks in the middle of the night, let me have a nice sleep. My eye-bags are getting heavier.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, Claire\u2019s words came in a long and windy stream. Li Yuewen looked up, gaping at Claire. This was her payment?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You think I\u2019m too harsh?\u201d Claire frowned at Li Yuewen as she asked Li Yuewen.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Li Yuewen shook her head wildly like a string drum. \u201cOkay, okay, then tomorrow, let\u2019s return to our country. We\u2019ll slow down our pace, and I\u2019ll take care of you throughout the trip and stop pulling pranks on you in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeehee, you said so, so don\u2019t come in the night. I haven\u2019t slept properly recently at all.\u201d Claire yawned as she confirmed, satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll go back on my word?\u201d Li Yuewen raised her brow let out a humph while asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, haha, I am starving. After I eat something, I\u2019m going to go sleep.\u201d Claire shook her head in a satisfied manner.</p><br/><p>After she finished eating a few things, Claire went straight to the tent to sleep, disregarding everyone else. One black round ball and one white meat ball also followed her in, but the two little things both didn\u2019t sleep. They both crouched in front of Claire, starting at each other with wide eyes, not blinking. One wanted to bite Claire and set a contract while the other would not let them, so naturally, this deadlock arose.</p><br/><p>Early morning, sunshine glittering, dew drops still twinkling on tree leaves. All the magic beasts had been long gone. There were no traces of a fierce battle at all.</p><br/><p>With clear and refreshing autumn weather, a cozy, little carriage slowly left a small town. It was the town\u2019s best carriage which Jean bought at a high price. Qiao Chuxin rode the wind leopard forward at a slow pace. Everybody else walked on foot, following the carriage sluggishly. Claire had already changed back into female clothing and leaned snuggly into the backseat while Jean led the carriage forward. Only Claire was enjoying the carriage. One, because the carriage could only seat two people and no matter who got on, it didn\u2019t seem right. Two, Claire was enjoying it with no qualms, relaxing satisfyingly.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the young miss of a rich family traveling while a few mercenaries were hired for her protection.</p><br/><p>The journey was naturally very smooth. No robbers would blindly attack them. There was obviously a seventh grade magic beast and cold couchman actually a sword strapped to his body. Who would attack this kind of line up?</p><br/><p>And like so, they traveled for three days, arriving at the closest city, Fenghua city. This city was flourishing but also chaotic because it was the closest major city near Wandering Mountain. Many adventurers would come here and sell their gains from adventuring in Wandering Mountain: ores, magic cores, young magic beasts, valuable herbs\u2026. So the city was exceptionally bustling. However, the people who came here to sell their goods were all unordinary people. They were all people who had come out of Wandering Mountain alive, so naturally, they were all not simple. If there was a conflict of any sort, there was no way it could be resolved with a little chit chatting. The busiest place in the city was the public order office. Often, they would be running around until their legs gave out. Therefore, how prosperous and how chaotic the city was was directly proportional.</p><br/><p>Also, this city didn\u2019t require an entrance fee. Instead, there was a fee for leaving the city.</p><br/><p>And like so, Claire\u2019s group entered the city easily. The city was bustling with noise, all sorts of shops on the street: magic cores were sold, weapons, clothes\u2026 every shop had customers. There were many different people on the street. There were the local residents but also adventurers covered in dust. The city was built with layers of large rocks, including the city wall, houses, and the pavement on the street.</p><br/><p>Claire laid down inside the carriage, her eyes half closed, satisfied. Soon, their party would arrive at a clean inn in the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, we\u2019ve arrived.\u201d Jean stepped off, opened the door for Claire, and extended his hand.</p><br/><p>Claire naturally supported herself off the carriage with Jean\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, today we can finally wash a hot shower!\u201d Summer approached Claire happily and said while clasping Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmhm, last time we ended up not washing, but this time you will,\u201d Claire said to Summer, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, hurry, hurry.\u201d Summer pulled Claire\u2019s hand, dragging her to the inn\u2019s entrance. Everybody else followed closely from behind.</p><br/><p>Just as they arrived at the entrance, an unknown object flew out the inn\u2019s door. The object rolled around on the floor. After rolling around a few times, they arrived at Claire and Summer\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>Claire and Summer looked down to see that surprisingly, it was a person who had rolled to their feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! You group of thugs! You actually treat your leader like this!\u201d The person on the ground cursed as he gathered himself up. Looking up, he faced Claire and Summer. After he froze for a second, a smile appeared. He laughed, \u201cBeautiful Miss, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Summer asked as she frowned with annoyance seeing the burly man smile mischievously. Such a scoundrel was actually hitting on Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Miss\u2019s friend? I am Jackson, the leader of the seventeenth squad of the Iron Blood mercenary corps and also miss Claire\u2019s friend.\u201d The burly man called Jackson was surprisingly someone Claire and Jean had met long ago at Gale Gorge. He still remembered Claire clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Summer looked at the frivolous burly man doubtfully. This kind of guy was Claire\u2019s friend? Perhaps it was his own wishful thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Haha, Miss Claire, how have you been?\u201d Jackson said to Claire while smiling. Claire nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019re tired now,\u201d Claire said faintly. Right after Claire finished speaking, she went directly past the burly man with Summer through the door.</p><br/><p>Jackson scratched his head, smiling awkwardly. Suddenly, he spotted Jean. He immediately approached him, laughing heartily. \u201cBrother Jean, you\u2019re here too, haha, what a coincident. We actually bumped into each other here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jean said stiffly, not wasting any breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, where are you going?\u201d Jackson asked. He followed Jean from the side, curiousy watching the large group of people behind him. They passed to two, following Claire in the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo Lagark.\u201d Jean didn\u2019t want to reveal too much, so he only spoke tersely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Really? Wonderful, we\u2019re also planning on going to Lagark, why don\u2019t we go together? We have plenty of time so we can wait for you and go together. It\u2019s best to look after each other.\u201d Jackson smiled widely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you going to Lagark?\u201d Jean said casually. Whether or not they would go together would depend on Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo send a few things to the Feng clan\u2019s chamber of commerce.\u201d Jackson said with his mouth drawn back. \u201cThe Feng clan\u2019s chamber of commerce. You know, the wealthy family that everybody is jealous of.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Feng clan? Feng Yixuan\u2019s clan?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. So it\u2019s like that.\u201d Jean replied softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when will you all depart? Let\u2019s go together.\u201d Jackson asked while following Jean in the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that, I\u2019ll have to ask my commander and secondary commander,\u201d Jean replied carefully.</p><br/><p>Jackson immediately became curious and he asked, \u201cCommander? Secondary commander? You guys became a mercenary group? What kind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Bao mercenary corps.\u201d Jean, having a favorable impression of Jackson, replied patiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, congrats, you guys are now a mercenary group.\u201d Jackson congratulated them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jean replied softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jean, this meeting is such a good opportunity, let\u2019s got and drink something.\u201d Jackson elbowed Jean with a very relaxed voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Jean declined politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you are too polite. You guys just came, eat and rest first.\u201d Jackson smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jean nodded.</p><br/><p>The lobby of the hotel had tens of tables with a few people sitting small groups. When Yaks and Jean came in together, the table in the corner had people yelling and laughing out loud. They were the mercenaries under Jackson and also the ones who had thrown Jackson out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, Secondary Commander, they invited us to go on the journey with them tomorrow, how will we reply?\u201d Jean walked over while questioning Claire and Camille.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

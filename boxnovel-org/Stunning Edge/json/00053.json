The giant dragon was black from head to toe, his dark scales sparkling under the sunlight. As warriors, the first thing Jean and Wenmo Shui thought was that if those scales were used as guarding items, then they would basically be high level products. Behind him were two huge wings, the three heads with hateful expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lowly humans, come here to receive death.\u201d That huge black dragon furiously thundered, so much so that the leaves on the trees started to shake slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you an idiot? If we came whenever you told us to, that would be so embarrassing.\u201d Summer snorted at the giant dragon and made a face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damnable human scum, I\u2019ll shred you to pieces!\u201d The giant dragon roared, doing his utmost to twist his body, but still couldn\u2019t leave the place at all.</p><br/><p>Cliff looked at the giant dragon and his expression slightly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could someone from the royal dragon family be here? How could he be trapped here?\u201d Cliff thought out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? This guy is also a prince?\u201d Summer snorted and grimaced, looking at the battered and trapped giant dragon.</p><br/><p>Claire frowned looking at the incessantly angry black dragon, but she was thinking of other matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly crap, this is how a prince behaves?\u201d Wenmo Shui directly spit. Rough, vulgar, and ugly, this giant dragon was the dragon race\u2019s prince? Someone come and immediately knock him unconscious. He simply didn\u2019t believe this kind of guy was a prince of the dragon race. What he wanted the most right now was to be able to get rid of this giant dragon and peel of his scales for a guarding items. Armor, gloves, knee brace, aiya, thinking of it made his mouth water. If it also soaked in dragon blood, then the set of guarding tools would be to f*cking awesome.</p><br/><p>How was the dragon race\u2019s prince trapped here?</p><br/><p>The dragon\u2019s sense of honor was unusually strong. What they detested the most was those earth dragons and demi-dragons who had been reduced to being human\u2019s mounts, disgracing the dragons\u2019 honor. And as the dragon race\u2019s prince, he must have an unimaginable amount of ego.</p><br/><p>But right now he was trapped in this little ravine.</p><br/><p>The dragon race\u2019s prince!</p><br/><p>The dragon race\u2019s prince!!</p><br/><p>It was the dragon race\u2019s prince!</p><br/><p>The sentence echoed continuously in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s value wasn\u2019t something normal.</p><br/><p>Think about it, if a human received a dragon\u2019s help\u2026</p><br/><p>It looked like this guy had an unordinary amount of ego. If they gained his favor, he would do his utmost to repay them.</p><br/><p>But there was a prerequisite.</p><br/><p>With this guy\u2019s hysterical personality, if they saved him, he would definitely eat everybody here, not leaving even dregs behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is under a very strong imprisonment. His strength has been weakened so much that it\u2019s not even one tenths of his original strength, that\u2019s why the power those elemental balls could bind him.\u201d Cliff said while shaking his head, looking at the balls of light that ensnared the black dragon. \u201cThose power of those balls of light can maintain for at least two hundred years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, he will be trapped here for two hundred years?\u201d Claire looked at the black dragon who was still roaring from a distance, her voice not high or low as it spread, controlling her volume so that it was just enough for the black dragon to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must have committed an offense and trapped here as punishment.\u201d Yixuan Feng said while stroking his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cPah! Daddy me was set up! Shut your bird beak, what rubbish are you talking about!\u201d When the black dragon heard everybody\u2019s words, he started roaring more angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re really an idiot, actually being set up by someone.\u201d Claire snorted disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, an idiot! Idiot!\u201d Summer made a face at the black dragon.</p><br/><p>The black dragon became even more furious and roared, struggling with all his strength. \u201cI\u2019ll shred you guys into pieces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the second you said that! I\u2019m still standing here perfectly fine.\u201d Summer curled her lip, smiling complacently.</p><br/><p>The black dragon was practically about to be driven mad. His eyes were about to burn. Damnable human scum! Actually daring to act so out of line in front of him. Lowly ants! The black dragon wanted to struggle free from his restraints, but wasn\u2019t able to move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe trapped prince will miserably be trapped in this dark ravine for two hundred years, and then when the punishment is over, will arrive back at the Dragon Valley and discover that the dragon who trapped him will already be sitting on the throne and rightfully issues the order to kill him.\u201d Claire shrugged, saying these words with an indifferent expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really a poignant story.\u201d Yixuan Feng sighed.</p><br/><p>Everybody had on a incomparably grieved expression.</p><br/><p>Walter was laughing so hard his mouth was about to break.</p><br/><p>Claire, this bad person, actually getting happy from other people\u2019s misfortune. These group of bad people, each had on a remorseful expression, but the smile in their eyes could be covered up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnable humans, I\u2019ll slaughter you guys.\u201d As the black dragon\u2019s weak point had been touched, he became even more berserk. He roared with all his might, his three heads spitting out three magic elements, attacking at the ground before him. He could only attack to that distance.</p><br/><p>Claire suddenly changed the topic, turning to look at the black dragon and said, exceptionally solemn, \u201cThe noble dragon prince shouldn\u2019t be stuck in this dark place without sunlight for two hundred years. No, even if it\u2019s two days, it shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black dragon fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing continuously stuck in this kind of place would be really uncomfortable and it would be impossible to be happy. Even low level magic beasts can circle around and watch your highness from a distance, not to mention humans.\u201d Yixuan Feng sighed deeply. Yixuan Feng had interacted with Claire these past few days and already understood her very well. Whenever Claire had this kind of tone, she would have a plan. What he needed to do was add on to the situation. It would be fine if he just fanned the fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s not two days, not two months, not two years, but two hundred years.\u201d Summer, that girl, also added fuel to the fire.</p><br/><p>Silent, the black dragon had fallen silent.</p><br/><p>After a long time, the black dragon\u2019s gaze was finally not angry anymore. He said in a low voice, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint curve appeared from the corner of Claire\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of your teeth and three wishes. Fulfill three of my wishes under the condition that you can do it.\u201d Claire said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman, you\u2019re being greedy. One wish.\u201d The black dragon snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d Claire frowned and said with much difficulty, \u201cIt can\u2019t be any less. It\u2019s a trade of two hundred years for two wishes and one tooth, that\u2019s all.\u201d From the very beginning, Claire didn\u2019t think the black dragon would be generous. Naturally, she had to raise the price a little bit, then lower it later. It would already be very profitable to get one more than her expectation of one wish.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Human, do you have a method to remove these restraints?\u201d The black dragon said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Claire shrugged and replied straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>The moment she finished speaking, the black dragon started to roar furiously, \u201cLowly human, you actually dare to play around with me. I will make you pay the price!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black dragon roared angrily, flapping his two giant wings, stirring up a gale. Although he really wanted to rip apart the hateful human in front of him, he didn\u2019t have any way to move forward the whole time.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at you, so rude and impulsive. No wonder you were tricked and trapped.\u201d Claire said unhurriedly. \u201cJust because I can\u2019t undo it doesn\u2019t mean someone from our group can\u2019t undo it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black dragon stopped what he was doing, waiting and watching Claire.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was very strange.</p><br/><p>Walter twitched a bit. This little devil, could she be any more evil?</p><br/><p>Summer, on the other hand, was unconcerned. From the very start, she had already been slowly become accustomed to Claire\u2019s evilness. Now, on the contrary, she didn\u2019t feel Claire was so evil any more. This way of bullying actually seemed very fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman, you\u2019re very cunning. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Strangely, the black dragon wasn\u2019t angry, and instead, asked this question quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire Hill.\u201d Claire replied, feeling a bit strange in her heart. This fiery guy actually didn\u2019t get angry when she tricked him? Very strange, very unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I\u2019ll agree with your request, but I want a condition.\u201d The black dragon said quietly, rumbling like muffled thunder.</p><br/><p>Setting the initial price? This black dragon was actually this shameless?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you agree with my condition, then our deal will be met.\u201d The black dragon said in his muffled voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it and I\u2019ll consider it first.\u201d Of course Claire wouldn\u2019t agree to anything rashly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me stay with you, I want to learn humanity\u2019s despicable craftiness and shamelessness. You are an exceptionally worthy subject to study.\u201d The black dragon said, exceptionally conscientiously. \u201cI want to seize back what is mine. Perhaps what you said is right, I\u2019m too impulsive and that\u2019s why I was entrapped. I want to learn with you and then go back and face the person who trapped me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the black dragon\u2019s speech, Claire didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Was this complimenting her or sarcasm?</p><br/><p>But everyone behind Claire couldn\u2019t hold back, to the point that they all convulsed with laughter. As Cliff laughed, even his brows couldn\u2019t help rocking the whole time. Summer covered her stomach as she laughed heartily. Wenmo Shui was even more exaggerated, crouching on the ground, slapping the ground over and over, laughing so much he was about to have a spasm. Only Jean and Yixuan Feng could bear it a little, not laughing so exaggeratedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can, but we need to agree on three things. First, you cannot revert back to your true form whenever you want to; you can\u2019t transform back to your true form unless I allow it. Second, you need to control your fiery, impulsive nature. You can\u2019t attack humans whenever you want to and need my permission to do so. I haven\u2019t thought of the third one at this point, I\u2019ll say it when I think of it.\u201d Claire said to the black dragon after thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, no problem. Now can you help me undo these restrictions?\u201d The black dragon asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Claire turned to look at Cliff who was still bursting in laughter, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Ok, ok.\u201d Cliff stopped smiling with great difficulty, then fished out a crystal. He smacked his lips then turned to the black dragon, saying, \u201cVenerable prince. I, on the other hand, don\u2019t really believe your words, so this memory crystal will record me saving you. If you break your promise after I save you and kill us, then this memory stone will immediately send this recording to an old friend of mine and the matter of a venerable dragon biting the hand that feeds it will spread widely across the continent.\u201d The consequences didn\u2019t need to be described. Dragons had very large self-esteems as the strongest creatures. If the matter of a dragon betraying their benefactor was widely renowned by humans and they were looked down by lowly humans, then it would be their greatest humiliation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

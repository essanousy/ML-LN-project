Why do we need to make an innocent woman suffer?\u201d Leng Lingyun choked, about to go out of control.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun!\u201d Lawrence\u2019s tone changed, becoming more severe. \u201cIn all these years, have you been living in an illusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sentence was a severe blow to Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart. He froze instantly.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s lips curved into a derisive sneer. Yes, how could he have forgotten. The esteemed Temple of Light was in reality the most corrupt place in the world. How could he still hope for justice!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Lawrence\u2019s expression darkened. He understood that inside the study, the pope must have heard what had been said. In order to prevent Leng Lingyun from saying anything else that could bring them trouble, Leng Lingyun had to leave as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun followed Lawrence silently, his face lowered. No one could see his expression. The two walked towards the back of the temple.</p><br/><p>Now far from the front of the temple, the two stood silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eminence*, Lingyun.\u201d The Divine Princess appeared, greeting them with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>*I searched and this is how you address cardinals</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s you, Xueqing. How are you feeling?\u201d Lawrence forced out a smile. The Divine Princess had returned last expedition covered entirely in wounds. The Temple of Darkness had nearly cost her life. But of course as the Divine Princess, she had been able to fight her way through and returned to the Temple, resting ever since. If Claire knew about this, she would understand the Divine Princess did not truly believe in the goddess of Light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, your eminence, for your worry. I am already much better.\u201d Liu Xueqing smiled faintly. However, her gaze was on Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Lawrence nodded.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun remained silent, about to walk past Lawrence and leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun!\u201d Lawrence called, stopping Leng Lingyun in his tracks.</p><br/><p>But although Leng Lingyun stopped, he did not look back.</p><br/><p>Lawrence sighed. His heart heavy, he said, \u201cLingyun, I know of your relationship with Claire. However, this time is different. You cannot interfere in this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun whipped around. \u201cMaster, are we just going to watch as the situation develops? Do you think Claire will let it go once she returns?\u201d he said angrily. \u201cDo you think Cliff is just going to watch without doing anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business! I know my bounds!\u201d Lawrence\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything. Just stay quietly in the temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun bit his lip, about to say something, Lawrence frowned, also about to say something, but Liu Xueqing quietly said, \u201cLingyun, no one wants to see Claire hurt. I treat her like a younger sister and don\u2019t want her to be hurt either. But this time, it is relevant to the Temple\u2019s future.\u201d Seeing Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression darken, she finally could not help it. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t care about yourself, you must think of Xuanxuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun instantly froze, unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lingyun\u2019s dazed expression, Lawrence let out a long sigh. He walked over and patted Leng Lingyun on the shoulder. \u201cJust pretend you didn\u2019t know anything. I will ask the pope to assign you a mission. You should go elsewhere, the farther, the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing also sighed. She walked over and said gently, \u201cI will stay with you, Ling Yun. Let\u2019s go to a branch temple in another country together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun brushed off Lawrence\u2019s hand, his face cold. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything rash. You don\u2019t need to send me away.\u201d Leng Lingyun walked away, disappearing into the long hallway.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Liu Xueqing turned, about to chase after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXueqing, don\u2019t go. Let him be.\u201d Lawrence stopped her.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing paused in her steps. She gazed down the hallway, ecstatic in her heart. Xuanxuan would be her trump card forever! She was even looking forward to Claire\u2019s reappearance. Katherine would be hanged for sure. Even if the Hill clan interfered, Katherine would be banished at best, the equivalent of a death sentence. If that damn girl were here, she would definitely not allow such a thing to occur and interfere with the Temple, resulting in\u2026 The more Liu Xueqing thought about it, the more excited she became, but because Lawrence was there, she could only pretend to be worried and disheartened.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun quickly walked back to his personal courtyard. Immediately, he saw Leng Xuanxuan sitting on the edge of a alone, kicking her little feet boredly, waiting for his return. Thin frame, thin arms. Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart tightened. If not for the medicine the Temple of Light provided, Xuanxuan would have left this world long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother!\u201d Leng Xuanxuan lept to her feet happily, dashing straight towards him.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun squeezed out a faint smile. He crouched down and hugged Leng Xuanxuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuanxuan, have you been good?\u201d Leng Lingyun scooped her up and stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Leng Xuanxuan nodded enthusiastically. As she caught Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes, astonishment flashed across her face. She reached out and gently touched Leng Lingyun\u2019s face, her voice low as she said, \u201cBrother, do you have something on your mind? You\u2019re unhappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Xuanxuan, don\u2019t think too much. Remember to take your medicine on time, okay?\u201d Leng Lingyun forced on a smile and stroked Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>Leng Xuanxuan didn\u2019t say anything, only tilting her head. She gazed into Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes, then pulled Leng Lingyun\u2019s handsome face towards her. She asked seriously, \u201cBrother, you like that big sister, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Leng Lingyun froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister Claire, you like her, right?\u201d Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s serious expression did not match her young age.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child, do you even know what \u2018like\u2019 means? Don\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201d On the inside, Leng Lingyun was shocked, but he maintained his smile as he poked Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, of course I know.\u201d Leng Xuanxuan nodded seriously. She touched Leng Lingyun\u2019s face and said solemnly, \u201cBrother, do you really think the Divine Princess treats me well because she likes me? Does she think I don\u2019t know? She only treats me well because of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun was shocked. He stared fixedly at Leng Xuanxuan without a word. Since when was this child so perceptive?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Divine Princess likes you, but you don\u2019t like her. You like big sister Claire. This kind of like is different from brother liking me.\u201d Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s expression was exceptionally serious.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun stared at the little girl in his arms, unable to speak. Leng Xuanxuan was obedient and mature, but Leng Lingyun never expected her to say such things.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child, you are always brother\u2019s number one.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled and hugged Leng Xuanxuan more tightly. But even he could not understand the pain and complex emotions in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Leng Xuanxuan hugged Leng Lingyun\u2019s neck tightly, laying her head down on Leng Lingyun\u2019s shouldered. Quietly, she whispered, \u201cBrother, sorry. These past few years, for me, you had to suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child, don\u2019t say such foolish words.\u201d Leng Lingyun hugged Leng Xuanxuan and sighed. He was unaware of the glistening tears nor determination in Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The poison incident became a deadlock with no further progress.</p><br/><p>The Temple of Light could not prove the second prince ordered Katherine to poison the first prince and the Hill clan could not prove Katherine was innocent.</p><br/><p>And so, the situation turned into a stalemate.</p><br/><p>Today, Cliff and Lawrence hurriedly left the capital because the Temple\u2019s reliable intel hinted that Claire was in the country Swerther and appeared to be chased after. Cliff, not doubting his lifelong friend Lawrence, hurriedly made his way to the tiny country of Swerther to rescue Claire.</p><br/><p>Just two days after Cliff and Lawrence left, the poisoning incident had a new development.</p><br/><p>Katherine Hill herself admitted that she poisoned the crown prince on the second prince\u2019s orders! Tomorrow, she would be on trial publically!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be!\u201d Claire almost destroyed the table in Philip\u2019s room. She slapped it and hollered, \u201cHow is that possible! Where did you get this information? Who made it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone in the capital knows,\u201d Xi Shaoqi mumbled, feeling wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! I met Mother in secret. Mother would never do such a thing!\u201d Claire was both furious and worried. She almost lost her reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Princess, please calm down a little,\u201d Philips quickly tried to console her. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely something strange going on. Your mother would never do such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe could have been threatened,\u201d Xi Shaosi said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease calm down, divine princess, please calm down!\u201d Xi Shaoqi was afraid Claire might destroy the room. After Claire recovered, their jaws almost dropped to the floor. She was at the level of a wizard sage! So young, yet so talented. If they knew that Claire was hiding her strength and was already a sorcerer, who knew how shocked they would be.</p><br/><p>Claire slowly calmed down. She sat down to ponder. \u201cNo, she was not threatened. There is nothing to threaten her with,\u201d Claire calmly analyzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d Xi Shaoqi blinked. \u201cEither a threat or a bribe, but bribing her is impossible. You also said that there\u2019s nothing she can be threatened with, so why did you mother suddenly give such a statement?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

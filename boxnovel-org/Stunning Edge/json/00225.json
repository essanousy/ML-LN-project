She stared blankly at Camil, then looked at the Black Dragon, saying \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you were the one who came up with this idea?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Camille looked innocent and said, \u201cThis has nothing to do with me. Ben came to me on his own initiative.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes shifted to the Black Dragon, who squinted his eyes, looking dizzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho came up with the idea?\u201d Xiao Aoshuang frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe.\u201d Ben shook its head and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang walked closer to the Black Dragon and whispered in his ear: \u201cStop bullshitting, your IQ has not reached this level yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWa! You attacked me personally!\u201d The Black Dragon was even more aggrieved than Camil.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, who is it?\u201d Looking at the originally erratic eyes of the Black Dragon, and thinking of how the Dragon God had taken him away, and how he was now able to appear here, a thought emerged in her mind. Could it be that the Dragon God had come up with this idea? No way! Why did he do this?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, looks like you\u2019ve already guessed it. The old man said he liked you very much, and then, well, he didn\u2019t like that woman. However, we will still abide by the agreement and will not act against humans, nor will we act against human buildings. We are here for sightseeing. \u201cHalf of the dragons stay here, while the others go to Ragka for sightseeing.\u201d The Black Dragon laughed like a thief.</p><br/><p>How vicious! The Dragon God was a top-grade talent! Qi Aoshuang came to a conclusion. Just the momentum was enough to make people tremble. What need was there to move their hands? The Dragon God was too cunning. He could even name himself as a tourist. Letting the Dragon King lead a large dragon to guard Uzzari and Ragka was a disguised form of support! Such a terrifying deterrent had far exceeded the power of the Radiant Temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s much easier now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Camil smiles warmly and said, \u201cAoshuang, you and Ben go sightseeing in Ragka.\u201d Soon there would be a war, and Ragka and Amper Land would meet directly. Now, you can go and clear the forces of light in Ragka!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe no one will have any objections.\u201d Camil added with a smile.</p><br/><p>Cold sweat broke out on Rongzas\u2019s forehead. In his eyes, Camil\u2019s smile was the smile of a demon. His eyes slowly shifted to Qi Aoshuang, with his heart full of fear. Who exactly is this girl? Why were there so many people around her? Why was it that even such a powerful and terrifying power like the dragon race was standing behind her? He finally came to understand that the young lady before him had been persecuted by the Radiant Temple and Amper Land. Now, if they knew how things were going to turn out like this, would they feel regret?</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun, you and Aoshuang set off today. Are you clear what you are going to do?\u201d Camil asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Leng Lingyun said indifferently, \u201cThe secret records of the Radiant Temple, the records of the massacre of humans, I will write them out as soon as possible. You can take care of the rest when the time comes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have someone copy it and distribute it everywhere. You\u2019d better write down the time, the address and the reason.\u201d Camil nodded gently, with a smile as bright as a peach blossom. \u201cI wonder how they will feel when they see this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose fools wouldn\u2019t believe it at all.\u201d Waldo found a chance to fight Camil.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for them to believe. I only need them to suspect it. That\u2019s enough. \u201d Camil looked at Waldo with a smile and said, \u201cThis kind of psychological warfare will never be understood by a superficial person like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Waldo was so angry that his teeth itched. He stared at Camil with his hands trembling, but he was unable to utter a single word.</p><br/><p>There were only a few people who understood Camil\u2019s strategy. At this moment, Rongzas understood Camil\u2019s plan, and he was extremely shocked. Indeed, the golden-haired, blue-eyed man in front of him was probably the person in this room who was most proficient in politics! Xiao Aoshuang was also very surprised. That is the human nature and the dark side, Camil was actually able to grasp it so clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, do you know who the founder of the Xilan Continent is?\u201d Camil adjusted his smooth blond hair and asked.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes shifted to Jean\u2019s sword. The Sword of Death! It belonged to the founder of the Xilan Continent. Back in the Devil Domain, the young master led her to an enormous underground palace. Was that the emperor\u2019s palace? But why did Camil suddenly mention this? Jean subconsciously touched the sword he wore on his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I know. Emperor Leo\u2019s a true hero. He lives in the hearts of men forever. It is he who fight for the survival of humanity. It is he who has unified the entire continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, that\u2019s right. He\u2019s a true hero.\u201d Camil continued, \u201cHowever, do you know how he ended up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rongzas recognized Camille\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Emperor Leo, is the hero in everyone\u2019s heart. However, if they were to know that their hero was being persecuted endlessly by the Radiant Temple, would they still stand firmly on their side? \u201d Camil said as he walked to the side of the table and gracefully poured two cups of scented tea. He handed a cup to Qi Aoshuang before picking up the other and gently drank it \u2026</p><br/><p>Camil was in no hurry, but the people in that room were getting impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe palace of Emperor Leo vanished overnight, and so did he and the eight knights who had followed him. Who did this? The Radiant Temple. They wanted to develop their own forces, and Leo was the biggest obstacle. It just happened. Everything disappeared completely in one night.\u201d Camille sniffed his tea.</p><br/><p>As his words fell, everyone\u2019s faces changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, the legends are true. They disappeared overnight. \u201d The news was so shocking that he even forgot to ask Camil how he knew about it.</p><br/><p>Camil noded indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that the underground palace in the Devil Domain is really the palace of the Emperor Leo?\u201d Qi Aoshuang murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you have been there?\u201d Camil asked. Qi Aoshuang nodded. She had been there looking for Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Devil Domain?!\u201d Rongzas looked at Xiao Aoshuang in disbelief, hatred and resentment rising up in his heart. Emperor Leo was the one who ended the endless war and made the human race live a peaceful life. The later generations had speculated about many things about the mysterious disappearance of such a great hero, but no one could have guessed that the Radiant Temple was the black hand behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, how do you know all this?\u201d Rongzas looked at Camil. How many more secrets did this man in front of him have? Rongzas did not doubt Camil\u2019s words at all. In his eyes, there was nothing that Camil could not do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know how I know. Just let it out. \u201d Camil smiled, \u201cThe same plan, no need for people to believe. Just make them doubt it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang sank into deep thought. She had already confirmed the identity of those bones. That huge elegant palace, the sword in the palace, and those white bones. It sure was the palace of Emperor Leo. According to the style of the Radiant Temple, it was possible for them to do so. At that time, the royal power was like a mountain blocking the divine power.</p><br/><p>Finally, Camil had brought out all of these! Waldo patted his chest with some lingering fear. He\u2019s a terrible man. Waldo swallowed. Luckily, this person was on their side. If he is not, the consequences would be unimaginable. Everyone in the room had the same question in their minds. \u201cCamil, who was he? How many more secrets does he have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Shaosi will be responsible for the work in Ragka. Distribute the information that Leng Lingyun wrote down.\u201d Camil ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xi Shaosi nodded solemnly, \u201cI should make posters flying like snow, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, you are much smarter than your leader.\u201d Camil complimented him.</p><br/><p>Waldo almost broke his teeth. He was the head of both Xi Shaosi and Xi Shaoqi. Who else could Camil be compared to? Bastard! Camil! Remember this! Of course, these words could only roar in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, in order to prepare for this tense war, let\u2019s relax and give a dinner to welcome Aoshuang. We\u2019ll have a picnic today. \u201d Camil put down his cup and clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going for a picnic? It\u2019s a chaos outside.\u201d Waldo didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud. He mumbled under his breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to have a picnic outside, I won\u2019t object.\u201d A dangerous cold light shined from Camil\u2019s beautiful pupils, making Waldo shrink his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, just relax today! Sorry, I can\u2019t accompany you. There are too many things that I need to take care of.\u201d Rongzas said.</p><br/><p>Camil smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>After Rongzas left, Camil magically took out a Space Transfer Scroll.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Everyone was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over here, this scroll can transfer as many as 25 people.\u201d Camil beckoned to everyone. \u201cI can\u2019t leave her alone.\u201d Qi Aoshuang walked over with the Treasure Cat in her arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a picnic? Aren\u2019t you preparing something?\u201d Waldo asked, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re ready.\u201d \u201cCamil opened the scroll. An intense white light flashed and everyone in the room disappeared.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aoshuang opened her eyes, she saw a face that was so familiar that it couldn\u2019t be any more familiar.</p><br/><p>His handsome face was full of surprise, ecstasy, and excitement. It was Feng Yixuan! They were at the Wind Island now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I am honored for so many people to be bearing witness to the goddess\u2019s guidance.\u201d The pope\u2019s dignified voice sounded once more, successfully quieting everyone down and making them look his direction. Everybody\u2019s gaze concentrated intensely.</p><br/><p>Then, the pope turned around swiftly, staring straight at Claire and without a word. And like so, his gaze landed on Claire and didn\u2019t move away. The hall instantly silenced, all not understanding the scene before them. What was that supposed to mean? Was the goddess\u2019s guidance related to Claire? The pope was silent, his expression completely solemn. Duke Gordan started feeling nervous. Was the temple going to make a move against Claire? Strangling Claire before she even matured? It couldn\u2019t be. The hall was deathly silent, nobody dared to speak. They all watched everything silently, waiting for the pope\u2019s next action. Many people\u2019s hearts had jumped to their throats. Was the pope\u2019s action favorable to Claire or not?</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, with everybody present as witnesses, I sincerely invite Claire to be a member of the Temple of Light as a priest for the benefit of the people, for the country. This is the goddess\u2019s guidance. Also, this is the gift the goddess has bestowed upon Claire Hill. This is all the goddess\u2019s will, the goddess\u2019s favor.\u201d The pope\u2019s unhurried voice echoed in the hall, echoing in everyone\u2019s hearts, staying for a long time.</p><br/><p>The news was like a bolt out of the blue, shocking every single person senselessly. Instantly, the hall was so silent, you could hear their hearts beating. The goddess\u2019s will, the goddess\u2019s favor?! Claire had actually received such favor?! Why? Why?</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan\u2019s expression finally changed! The Temple of Light actually had made such a decision at this occasion! Publicly recruiting Claire under the the Temple of Light! And they had used such a dignified excuse. The goddess\u2019s gift? And the position of priest? He had never heard of such an abrupt awarding of position!</p><br/><p>The next moment, the main hall became extraordinarily noisy, the atmosphere so enthusiastic, the roof was going to blown off. Such a shocking scene happened and they couldn\u2019t believe it! Also, the pope had actually given the goddess\u2019s gift to Claire, the unique, one of a kind treasure that could give rebirth to another physical body? They had heard about it, but never seen it. Now, the pope had suddenly given it to Claire? Given it to a girl who had just turned fourteen?! And it was the goddess\u2019s will? Why would the goddess favor Claire so much?</p><br/><p>The intense gazes all landed on Claire, almost burning her. What exactly was so special about Claire that the goddess had given such favor?!</p><br/><p>Claire felt the burning gazes. Her expression didn\u2019t change, but her gaze was already dark.</p><br/><p>That old pope already figured out that she was the person who had stolen the goddess\u2019s gift! And now he actually came to trap her! She didn\u2019t understand why he was trying to recruit her, but she was sure of one thing: the old pope had already discovered that she was the person who had stolen the goddess\u2019s gift, and the box Lawrence was holding up high was definitely empty. This trick of his was pretty high level! Too high! Claire was about to explode. Never had she been conned by other people, but she had unexpectedly been ensnared before so many people and so righteously. Most importantly, there was no way at all for her to retort!</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing\u2019s complexion paled, staring blankly at the scene before her, completely unable to accept it. Didn\u2019t the pope come to expose the black clothed man\u2019s identity, then punish Claire afterwards? Why had the situation turned into this? Instead, Claire had advanced to a more brilliant position! While seen by everybody! Everybody\u2019s gazes and actions had already explained everything. Claire\u2019s brilliance had stunned everybody once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou holiness, this\u2026..\u201d Duke Gordan was attempting his last struggle. In an instant, his valuable granddaughter was going to become a member of the Temple of Light, how could he accept it? Royal authority and divine right had always had subtle relationships and never interfered with others, but now the pope had done this. What was his purpose?</p><br/><p>The pope turned to Duke Gordan and asked solemnly, \u201cYour grace, this is all with accordance to the goddess\u2019s guidance. Are you doubting the will of the goddess?\u201d After saying this everybody turned their attention towards Duke Gordan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, of course not. How could I doubt the goddess\u2019s will?\u201d Duke Gordan hurriedly waved, but internally, he was deeply worried. The situation had already developed far beyond his control and expectations. Was he just going to watch as Claire became part of the Temple of Light?</p><br/><p>The pope cleared his throat, then said, \u201cThen, please may everybody present bear witness.\u201d His voice had an infallible dignity.</p><br/><p>Panic flashed through Duke Gordan\u2019s eyes. He never would have thought the Temple of Light would make their move during such an occasion, completely catching him unaware. There was no way to stop it. In front of so many people, how could he openly disobey the will of the goddess? But what Duke Gordan didn\u2019t understand was why the Temple of Light would pay such a huge price and use such prestige to recruit Claire. Did they find out Claire\u2019s potential? If so, they would have discovered it long before the competition with Lagark and wouldn\u2019t have waited until now. Why exactly were they trying to recruit Claire? No matter how he thought about it, Duke Gordan couldn\u2019t understand, Now he only hoped that the banquet would end quickly, then think of a counterattack afterwards.</p><br/><p>The envious gazes all fixated on Claire, about to pierce through her body. Claire smiled faintly and slowly walked forward. She locked gazes with the pope, both of them understanding each other\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Under everyone\u2019s gazes, the pope gave the elaborate box to Claire along with the attire and badge of priests. Everybody\u2019s gazes were locked on the embroidered box her Claire\u2019s hands. The precious treasure was given away just like that? And now Claire\u2019s status was shocking: the Temple of Light\u2019s priest, the city lord of Niya city, the rising member of the Hill clan, and Cliff\u2019s disciple. With so many halos casted on her, how could she not be envied?</p><br/><p>After bending down slightly to receive the pope\u2019s baptism, Claire stood up and smiled brilliantly. \u201cYour holiness, with such a precious thing left with me, it would be hard to avoid robbery. I hope that your holiness can hold it for safekeeping for me?\u201d Claire wasn\u2019t stupid; the empty box was ticking time bomb. She knew, the pope knew, and the higher ups of the Temple of Light knew, but the Temple of Light had completely sealed off all information. Outsiders wouldn\u2019t know that the gift was already gone. Leaving it with Claire would naturally attract thieves and it would be best leaving it with the pope.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the pope understood. He nodded, smiled, and accepted it back. Seeing this, everybody in the hall sighed.</p><br/><p>With this banquet, Claire\u2019s fame was raised to another level. A fourteen year old girl had become favored by the goddess and held the position of priest! What an honor. A long time after, everybody who had attended the banquet still remembered, remembered the golden haired green eyed girl that seemed like the sun, radiating light, stunning everyone.</p><br/><p>Before the ruckus had calmed down, a chamberlain came from the entrance hurriedly to report, looking pale with fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you so flustered for!\u201d Currently, Duke Gordan was in a bad mood, so he berated the chamberlain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf, if your grace sees himself, he shall know.\u201d The chamberlain seemed to be somewhat excited.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan frowned as he walked out. Everybody else in the hall followed.</p><br/><p>Once everybody saw the line of carriages, they all froze. There were so many carriages, they couldn\u2019t see the end, and every carriage was filled roses, extremely dazzling and gorgeous. On the first carriage were a few, impressively large words: Claire, happy birthday.</p><br/><p>Who was this crazy?</p><br/><p>Everybody was once again stunned by the scene before them. Just then when the pope had appeared and announced the goddess\u2019 guidance, their hearts were almost unable to bear it, and now with such a spectacular sight, everybody felt their minds were about to break.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d Duke Gordan turned and called Claire, wanting to inquire what was going on. Only then did he discover that Claire, who had been following him by his side, had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>And like so, Claire silently disappeared from the birthday banquet. Disappearing along with her were Summer, Qiao Chuxin, Jean, Walter, and Ben.</p><br/><p>Outside of the east gate, a very ordinary yet of small stature girl was wearing clothes that couldn\u2019t be any more ordinary. On her back was an exquisite and small bow. Followed behind her were a group of people also wearing ordinary clothes. And so, their journey started.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Little Moon, why would you change your name to that?\u201d Summer stroked her chin, watching Claire, who was walking ahead over them, a little suspicious,. Then she turned and looked towards the beautiful man smiling like wind, squeezing out from the corner of her mouth, \u201cAlso, why did your teacher, Camille, also come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEach person has their own interests and hobbies.\u201d Claire said vaguely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I also have my interest. It\u2019s too boring in the capital, so I came with you guys to play.\u201d Camille smiling kindly, a shine flashing through his eyes. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m even your secondary commander. If you don\u2019t listen to me, I will punish you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last few incomparably gentle words echoed in everybody\u2019s mind. Clearly, it was extraordinarily gentle, but hearing it made their blood run cold. Will punish, will punish\u2026. The endless echo seemed like magic was making them hear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Bao Mercenary Corps?\u201d Summer was holding a sheet of paper, the credentials of registering as a mercenary group just now. \u201cWhy are we registering with this strange name? What a really strange name. Yuan Bao, Yuan Bao, what is Yuan Bao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire, who was pretending to be an ordinary archer, said faintly, \u201cThat\u2019s because of my interests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Summer was wordless. After she put away the credentials, she followed silently without speaking any more.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Who would have thought there would be someone like this from the Temple of Light?\u201d Xi Shaoqi muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t those idiots follow every single order of the goddess of Light? Even if they know it\u2019s an illusion, they still wouldn\u2019t insult her, but that girl killed her off with one strike and even said <i>those</i> kinds of words!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was cussing,\u201d Xi Shaosi said casually, certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019d she say?\u201d Xi Shaoqi started to get excited. It was rare for a holy member of the Temple of Light to curse, but he had no doubt what Xi Shaosi said was true. Xi Shaosi never read lips wrong.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaosi\u2019s eyes slitted. He replied slowly, \u201cShe said, how can the pure goddess of Light fuck another man and have a child.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xi Shaoqi\u2019s jaw dropped, his eyes filled with disbelief. Their master also stared at the girl in the crystal ball with astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the goddess of Light always refers to them as \u2018my child\u2019,\u201d Xi Shaosi shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahaha\u2026 haha\u2026 Right, that goddess sure is incredible. She has so many children, I wonder when she had the time to fuck so many men, haha, she\u2019s sure good at giving birth!\u201d Xi Shaoqi roared with laughter, not caring about his language at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. Go and get rid of her already,\u201d the old man waved offhandedly, motioning for them to go. His head hurt seeing the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes, Master, I\u2019ll massacre her.\u201d Xi Shaoqi grinned as he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back quickly,\u201d the old man warned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master. I alone am enough. Brother, you should continue watching, I\u2019ll be back in no time.\u201d Xi Shaosi dusted off his clothes and walked out delightfully.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Xi Shaosi watched the crystal ball quietly, his gaze fixed on Claire. Suddenly, he said, \u201cMaster, I think this time you need to go yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? For who? Was the Illusion Forest unable to stop them?\u201d The old man walked up and peered into the crystal ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that girl who\u2019s about to walk out of the Illusion Forest. I don\u2019t think she is simple and Shaoqi will not be her match.\u201d Xi Shaosi frowned. \u201cEven though she is from the Temple of Light, she does not revere the goddess of Light at all. However, the pope allows her to be a part of the Temple. That in itself is a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man frowned, then understood. \u201cUnless the girl was extraordinary enough for the Temple to rope her in later in her life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Xi Shaosi nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go and look. Shaoqi is still childish and rash,\u201d the old man nodded. Silently, he praised Xi Shaosi in his heart. This disciple of his was always so keen.</p><br/><p>At the edge of that Illusion Forest, Claire stood silently, eyeing the person before her. The young man was twenty or so and wearing a black robe, his blue eyes fixed on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl, come, let this big brother cherish* you.\u201d His first words were disgusting, his eyes smiling so much he looked like he needed a beating.</p><br/><p>*Word here means \u201churt\u201d but also means \u201clove dearly\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire shivered with disgust.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, little girl. I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d Xi Shaoqi grinned, whipping out his wand.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes slitted. From the Dark aura surrounding him, he was clearly a Dark magician. Although he smiled vulgarly, he could not hide his killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle*, let me \u2018cherish\u2019 you too.\u201d Claire laughed coldly, a large sword of flame materializing in her hand.</p><br/><p>*Uncle is like how you address an adult male stranger</p><br/><p>When he heard these words, Xi Shaoqi was so surprised, he stood there frozen. Just before he could process what was going on, broiling hot air blasted towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhh \u2013 \u201d Xi Shaoqi cried out, backing away hastily. He managed to dodge the deadly attack. The flame sword hissed as it struck and scorched the ground. It was a terrifying sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you dodging? Uncle, why aren\u2019t you letting me \u2018cherish\u2019 you?\u201d Claire mocked. Her lips curved into a smile.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi broke out in cold sweat, finally sizing up the girl before him seriously. She was a warrior! Both her strength and speed was above his!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll let you be the first to walk out of the Illusion For-\u201d Before Xi Shaoqi finished, his eyes widened and he backed away hastily once again.</p><br/><p>Of course Claire wouldn\u2019t give him the chance to speak or chant spells. Xi Shaoqi could only pitifully erect instantaneous barriers to block Claire\u2019s deadly attacks, but even then, every time Claire\u2019s sword struck a barrier, Xi Shaoqi would shudder in his heart. He was barely able to block each strike.</p><br/><p>He knew that if the battle dragged on, he would definitely lose! He never expected this weak looking little girl to actually be a warrior!</p><br/><p>No, wait! Xi Shaoqi\u2019s eyes widened. Could a warrior convert Douqi into molded flames? Impossible!</p><br/><p>In other words, this girl was double classed!</p><br/><p>A magician and a warrior!</p><br/><p>\u201cGetting distracted in battle is the equivalent of death, Uncle!\u201d Claire\u2019s said coldly right before Xi Shaoqi\u2019s last barrier was destroyed, sending him flying. His body struck a tree behind him brutally.</p><br/><p>His started to black out, wincing with pain.</p><br/><p>In front of the crystal ball, Xi Shaosi\u2019s eyes widened. He had underestimated the enemy too much! As expected, Shaoqi was too careless. Hopefully he would learn a lesson from this. Xi Shaosi sighed. Fortunately, Master had left too.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression was icy as she approached Xi Shaoqi, gripping the sword of flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, goodbye forever.\u201d A brilliant smile blossomed on Claire\u2019s face, stunning Xi Shaoqi. However, Claire then raised the sword of flames and stabbed towards his chest mercilessly.</p><br/><p>But right before the sword pierced Xi Shao, Claire\u2019s movement was stopped.</p><br/><p>Her body stiffened, the sword of flames still firmly in her grasp, yet unable to stab through him any more.</p><br/><p>Not feeling the excruciating pain he had expected, Xi Shaoqi opened his eyes slowly. The girl\u2019s expression was one of shock while she was frozen in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, didn\u2019t you say goodbye forever? Cough, cough\u2026\u201d Xi Shaoqi had started to laugh, but strained his wounds and started to cough instead. Of course he knew what had happened. His master was here to save him!</p><br/><p>The sword of flame slowly started to extinguish while her energy seemed to have been frozen. It was just like when they had sunk into the black magic formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cShaoqi, you underestimated your enemy too much. Remember this lesson,\u201d Claire heard an aged voice. An old man in black appeared behind her silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, haha, I\u2019m still fine. The power the god of Darkness granted you is so strong, haha, that magic formation is so useful.\u201d Xi Shaoqi smirked, but did not dare to laugh to much for fear of straining his wounds.</p><br/><p>Claire looked down. Sure enough, there was a black, five star magic formation below her. The old man that had appeared was definitely not simple, able to cast the magic formation without her notice.</p><br/><p>Wait! Claire frowned. The power the god of Darkness granted him?</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, this magic formation was taught to you by that bastard? The god of Darkness?\u201d Claire asked, her tone disdainful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl, a person who doesn\u2019t have long to live shouldn\u2019t waste their breath.\u201d Xi Shaoqi humphed coldly. His back ached with a searing pain. Thinking of how pitiful he was when he had underestimated her, he humphed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the god of Darkness someone you fake Light believers can blaspheme?\u201d the old man retorted angrily, frowning. The Temple of Light and the Temple of Darkness hated each other to the bone, afterall.</p><br/><p>Tch! Claire clicked her tongue disdainfully. She knew that that shameless god of Darkness would be paying attention to her at all times. There was no way he would watch her be killed! However, she never expected to fall into the hands of his believers.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye forever, little girl,\u201d Xi Shaoqi laughed coldly, then pulled out a dagger, about to stab Claire in the heart.</p><br/><p>But Claire\u2019s sudden cry stopped him in his tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod of Darkness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you bluffing for? Even if you started to worship the god of Darkness instead, we wouldn\u2019t let you you live!\u201d Xi Shaoqi humphed.</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent, curling her lip in disgust, waiting for the shameless bastard to appear.</p><br/><p>Xi Shaoqi raised his dagger up again, but suddenly, everything became dark!</p><br/><p>A pressure the old man was extremely familiar with appeared!</p><br/><p>The surroundings soon darkened to the point where they could not even see their hands.</p><br/><p>Sitting before the crystal ball, Xi Shaosi\u2019s expression also changed. The scene of Claire on the crystal ball became entirely black, nothing could be seen. He had experienced this kind of situation once, but he would remember it for the rest of his life!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the old man and Xi Shaoqi were stunned.</p><br/><p>This kind of pressure was something you only had to experience once to remember for the rest of your life!</p><br/><p>The god of Darkness was descending!</p><br/><p>Such darkness, such terrifying pressure! Only the god of Darkness could do such a thing!</p><br/><p>But!</p><br/><p>Why would the god of Darkness descend?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The door was still creaking on its hinges. Claire had arrived abruptly and left even quicker.</p><br/><p>After a while, Camille finally came back to his senses. \u201cClaire, you come right back! Pay for my door!\u201d he yelled after her painfully.</p><br/><p>But already far away, Claire could not hear him.</p><br/><p>She walked through the streets, gazing up at the clouds, feeling enlightened. All her vexation had disappeared. The fallen knight and the girl had already died and feeling sorry would not bring them back. Claire knew what to do now. She had almost forgotten her original goal: becoming strong. Who cares about the goddess of Light? If she could become strong enough to become a goddess, why couldn\u2019t Claire do that too?</p><br/><p>Claire let out a long breath, then started making her way to Hill manor.</p><br/><p>As soon as she entered, the guards at the entrance saluted her deferentially, then hurried in to announce her arrival.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s status was now different from before; she was now also a Reverend of the Temple of Light!</p><br/><p>The moment Claire entered the hall, Katherine and Lashia greeted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d Katherine beamed with a smile as she hurried over and clasped Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sis! You\u2019re finally back!\u201d Lashia ran over excitedly, playfully grabbing Claire\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Mother, Lashia.\u201d Claire smiled, her heart warm.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, you\u2019re so not fair! You did so many cool things behind our backs!\u201d Lashia tugged on her arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Claire looked at Lashia with confusion. Suddenly, she noticed that Katherine\u2019s hand was trembling slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill pretending!\u201d Lashia\u2019s words tumbled out as she said in a rush, \u201cYou fought for the Li clan at Lagark and defeated that Hua-something-something brilliantly! Making you famous! Grandfather knew about it a while back. Even the emperor is aware.\u201d Then she said regretfully, \u201cWhat a shame, I wasn\u2019t there to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire finally understood what Lashia was talking about. She smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was nothing. I decided to fight on their behalf when I became aware of Mother\u2019s relationship with them. In the end, it was only because the Feng and Shui clans forfeited that I was able to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Katherine\u2019s grip tightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I, I\u2026. Thank you.\u201d Katherine was so moved that although she did not know what to say, her heart was unusually warm. From the corner of her eye, something glimmered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, there\u2019s no need to say thank you. They are your family, so they are my family.\u201d Claire also gripped Katherine\u2019s hand tightly in response. Katherine was choked with emotions, sobbing, but smiling.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s father, Roger, had been standing next to the door at the side quietly the entire time, looking on. Katherine had made such a large sacrifice for him, and he had always felt guilt, but was unable to do anything for her. However, what he had always wanted to do had been fulfilled by Claire. As he watched the merry three, Roger\u2019s emotions were extremely ambivalent.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, Grandfather has still not returned yet. If he knew you were back, he would be so happy. Oh right, Second Brother will be back too today, yay! Tonight, we can all eat together!\u201d Lashia said happily.</p><br/><p>Second Brother? Claire paused. Only then did she remember that she seemed to have a second brother who was the captain of the Griffin Squad. She had seen him once at the student exchange competition and once at her birthday. She barely had any memories of him. The only impression she had of him was the cold and despising gaze he always gave her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Mother, how are you home today?\u201d Claire recalled that her mother was already the head lady in waiting of Princess Maurice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe heard you was coming back, so Mother specially asked for the day off!\u201d Lashia tilted her head and said playfully. \u201cAfter Jean returned and reported, Father sent servants to inform Mother and Grandfather.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Claire responded indifferently at the mention of her father.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, also, Lashia, where is little leopard? And Jean?\u201d Claire asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the rear courtyard. Elder sister, let\u2019s go and see your little leopard. I raised him well. That little fellow sure can eat! Every day he eats loads of fresh meat.\u201d Lashia pulled Claire by the arm impatiently, then winked playfully at Katherine. \u201cMother, elder sis and I will be in the rear courtyard. Call us when second brother is home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Katherine nodded lovingly, her eyes full of warmth. Seeing the two previously antagonistic sisters now so harmonious, of course she would feel this way.</p><br/><p>Lashia pulled Claire to the door, facing Roger who was full of conflicted emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Lashia greeted him, smiling.</p><br/><p>But Claire was completely cold, passing by Roger without even a single glance as she walked to the rear courtyard.</p><br/><p>Lashia revealed a somewhat embarrassed expression as she hurried after Claire.</p><br/><p>Roger slowly turned around, watching Claire as she left. After some time, he sighed. Who would have thought the most disappointing child would suddenly become the most brilliant of the family.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger\u2026\u201d Katherine\u2019s voice came softly from behind Roger.</p><br/><p>\u201cKatherine, I understand. I have no right to complain of Claire\u2019s attitude towards me. It was completely my fault.\u201d Roger turned to his wife, smiling bitterly.</p><br/><p>Katherine sighed gently. \u201cClaire is still young. Be patient, she will treat you differently in the end. After all, you had not cared for her nearly enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I owe her too much\u2026\u201d Roger let out a long sigh. He reached out and pulled Katherine into his embrace. \u201cAnd I owe you even more. I have made these years unhappy for you, and I have not seen you smile like this for so many years. It is Claire who allows you to smile like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI too did not expect Claire to go to Lagark and revive the Li clan.\u201d A brilliant smile emerged on Katherine\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Roger let out a long sigh, his expression complex.</p><br/><p>Claire was not a foolish male-chaser anymore, but a dazzling star.</p><br/><p>This was not expected by anyone, including him, her father.</p><br/><p>When Katherine sent servants to bring Claire to the hall, Claire did not expect what she would see next to be so complicated.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan had returned along with the second prince and princess Maurice. However, her \u201csecond brother\u201d, Eric, and the crown prince, Euler, had come together!</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the hall was exceptionally strange\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, your highnesses.\u201d Claire and Lashia curtsied.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d the three said at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Grandfather, second brother,\u201d Lashia happily called to Duke Gordan and Eric.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, I\u2019ve returned,\u201d Claire said to Duke Gordan quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Duke Gordan laughed. \u201cGood. Let\u2019s sit.\u201d He directed them towards some nearby seats.</p><br/><p>Claire did not give so much as a glance to Eric. This \u201csecond brother\u201d of her had left no impressions in her memory other than his continuously disdainful looks and haughtiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, when the his highness, the second prince, and her highness learned you had returned, they insisted on coming to visit, haha,\u201d Duke Gordan laughed. \u201cThey treat you so well.\u201d His mood was visibly good. \u201cAlso, my child, you made such great achievements in Lagark but didn\u2019t tell me! It was such a large surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire gave a slight nod to the second prince and princess. \u201cIt is my pleasure, your highnesses.\u201d The second prince and princess visiting her was reasonable, but why was the crown prince here too?</p><br/><p>Eric observed this younger sister of his, frowning slightly. It was try she had grown much stronger, but this entire time, she had never given him so much as a glance, as if he were a complete stranger. The crown prince, on the other hand, maintained a smile as he listened without a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, it\u2019s been some time since we last saw each other and you have grown strong again.\u201d Nancy smiled at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou flatter me, your highness. However, Master Cliff has broken through to the sorcerer stage,\u201d Claire announced. She did not want the attention to be focused on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Low exclamations reverberated throughout the hall, astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have we not heard of this?\u201d Roger asked, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2019s breakthrough has not been made public yet. He went to the Temple to find sir Lawrence the moment her returned.\u201d Claire had not even looked at Roger, her gaze focused on Duke Gordan instead. Roger\u2019s eyes flashed with slight embarrassment. Seeing this exchange, Eric\u2019s frown deepened.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? If this is true, then this is worthy of celebration! The empire\u2019s first sorcerer! I must report to his majesty as soon as possible.\u201d Duke Gordan was now not just happy, but delighted. A sorcerer, the only sorcerer in the entire continent, was his granddaughter\u2019s master! How could he not be excited?</p><br/><p>The grand hall soon became lively, the strange atmosphere from before gone. Everybody was discussing this topic. Lashia latched onto Claire\u2019s arm, asking this and that. Claire smiled, patiently relaying the events that had occurred, but of course, she hid a few things, such as the young master and the treasure.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Duke Gordon invited everyone to stay for a meal.</p><br/><p>The princes and princess praised the sumptuous meal, lavish with wine and delicacies.</p><br/><p>After lunch, no one had the intention of leaving, so Duke Gordan invited everyone to the greenhouse to enjoy the flowers and drink tea. Claire left using the excuse of checking on her mount. She leaned on a pillar in the rear courtyard, watching on as Duke Gordan led everyone in, sighing. What was the current status of the power struggle between the \u201ccrown\u201d prince and second prince? Grandfather had secretly sent Jean to assist the second prince. However, wasn\u2019t her second brother, Eric, too close to the crown prince? Was it okay that the clan was split?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

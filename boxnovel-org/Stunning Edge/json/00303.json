What he feared the most were Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s tears.</p><br/><p>Chapter 49 Terror! Dittos is in love?!</p><br/><p>Naturally, no one knew what was going on with Dittas. He sat cross-legged on the bed and stayed silent for the entire night.</p><br/><p>The person who had caused such a dilemma to fall into a comfortable sleep until dawn. At dawn, Qi Ao Shuang stretched her body and got out of bed. Jin Yan waited for the situation on Wynes\u2019 side to stabilize before returning on this day. After eating breakfast, Qi Ao Shuang told Jin Yan everything she knew, but Jin Yan wasn\u2019t too surprised. Because he had met that mysterious man in white earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Yan, I don\u2019t know why, but that person gave me a very familiar feeling.\u201d But I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know him. I\u2019ve never seen him. \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang rubbed her chin as she pondered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, do you feel the same?\u201d Jin Yan was a little surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, don\u2019t tell me you feel the same way?\u201d Upon hearing Jin Yan\u2019s words, Qi Ao Shuang was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, and he seems to treat Miss differently.\u201d It was only then that Jin Yan told the events of that night to Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang thought for a while, before saying: \u201cHe also said that he felt that I was familiar with him, and that he did not have any memory of me.\u201d I\u2019m beginning to wonder who he is. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, he is not hostile to Miss.\u201d \u201cAlso, young lady, we\u2019ll head to the ninth floor in a week. When we see him, everything will be clear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded, not saying anything else. At this time, Jonathan\u2019s voice called out from the distance, \u201cAo Shuang, Ao Shuang ~ ~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan frowned at Jonathan\u2019s displeased expression as he walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you guys talking about?\u201d Jonathan sat down between them and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come it has nothing to do with me?\u201d \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to the ninth floor in a week.\u201d Jonathan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang couldn\u2019t be bothered to waste her breath on Jonathan. Ever since this fellow found out her true identity, he had such a weird attitude towards her. He could think of a solution to this problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I let you take the risk alone!\u201d Jonathan blurted it out without thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s Jin Yan, and there\u2019s that person.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang glanced at Jonathan.</p><br/><p>The more Jin Yan heard, the more he felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Why was this Jonathan speaking to his young mistress so strangely?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Jin Yan.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang couldn\u2019t be bothered to waste words with Jonathan. She got up and called for Jin Yan to leave. Jonathan didn\u2019t care and followed her eagerly.</p><br/><p>A week passed in the blink of an eye. During this one week, Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s strength increased once again, and she could faintly feel that the bottleneck was not far away. In the course of this week, Qi thought for a moment, and only said a few understated words to Wynes, and blessed him and Bethany. Wynes was so confused that he did not know what exactly Qi Ao Shuang was up to. As for Parina, Ta Lina and Qi Ao Shuang, they thought for a while but still did not bid farewell to the two. Meanwhile, on Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s side, Qi Ao Shuang wrote a few letters outlining her thoughts and decisions. She similarly blessed Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao. At the end of the letter, there was a message: If fate wills it, we will meet again. Heaven Breaker began to laugh after reading the letter. What a fate! Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s decision did not mention anything to Ah\u2019Bao. He was afraid that Ah\u2019Bao would be hurt. What he feared the most were Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s tears.</p><br/><p>A week later, Jin Yan didn\u2019t enter the tower with Qi Ao Shuang, but dived into the tower instead. Jonathan naturally followed Qi Ao Shuang in. When Wei Aushuang and Jonathan entered, they were surprised to find that Dittas was already there. He stood silently at the entrance, as if he had been waiting there for a long time. When he saw Qi Ao Shuang, his body froze and his expression became unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early, Dittos.\u201d Jonathan yawned.</p><br/><p>Dittas only looked at Xiao Ao Shuang without saying anything. Qi Ao Shuang turned her face away and did not intend to talk to Dittas. She strode forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d However, Dittas grabbed Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arm and pulled her back.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was shocked by this unexpected force. After recovering her senses, she let go of Dittas\u2019 hand, frowned and said: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jonathan stared back at Dittos. Dittos hated physical contact, no matter who it was! But today, he actually took the initiative to pull Qi Ao Shuang away. It\u2019s over! Things have changed!</p><br/><p>Dittos remained silent as he looked at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face. After a long while, he finally said, \u201cRegardless of whether you are a man or a woman, you must travel with me on the road ahead.\u201d After saying that, he turned around and walked away without giving any reaction.</p><br/><p>Jonathan stood staring after him, his mouth twitching, and suddenly a ridiculous thought occurred to him: Dittas is in love. Dittos, who did not know what love was, was probably in love! It was just that this guy didn\u2019t know how to express his thoughts, so he used such an awkward method to express his thoughts. He was truly willing to die. It would be strange if others would accept this chase after a girl.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, when he turned around, he saw Qi Ao Shuang frowning and rubbing the hands of Dita Sloton, coldly snorting and saying something out of place. Jonathan shrugged, looking as if it was true. Jin Yan quickly appeared in the Sky Tower as the three of them headed up. This Heavenly Pagoda wasn\u2019t big or small, but it wasn\u2019t small either. Going up to the ninth floor took them four days. By the time he reached the entrance to the ninth floor, Brill was already there, waiting as he had been promised. He had also reached a bottleneck. Dittos quietly sat by the side.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked around but didn\u2019t see the man in white robes appear.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Qi Ao Shuang had arrived, Di Tan\u2019s eyes lit up. Just as he was about to stand up, Qi Ao Shuang sat down and said, \u201cHe\u2019s not here yet. Let\u2019s wait a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dittos\u2019 face slightly darkened. He did not say anything and continued to sit and wait.</p><br/><p>Not long after, a breeze blew past and the white-clothed man appeared before everyone without a sound. Upon seeing this, Xiao Ao Shuang revealed a smile as she went up to welcome him, \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The white robed man smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know your name yet.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly thought of this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know my name.\u201d The man in white answered helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll call you White Clothes.\u201d You always dress like that anyway. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied with a smile. For some reason, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart felt at peace with this man in white.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d White clothes, white clothes \u2026 After the man in white agreed, he repeated the words.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked at them, pursed his lips, rolled his eyes, and turned away. And Dittos was frowning slightly, not knowing what was going on with the discomfort in his heart. This was a feeling that he had never felt before. It was as if someone had snatched away some precious treasure of his. Empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go in.\u201d It\u2019s not too late to push someone who doesn\u2019t want to go in. \u201d The man in white turned around and said to the crowd behind him. When no one spoke, Jonathan rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing that no one was speaking, Bai Yi turned to nod at Qi Aushuang before heading into the light barrier, with Qi Ao Shuang following closely behind. The others filed in and got in.</p><br/><p>An intense white light blinded her, and when she opened her eyes, she felt a strange sensation beneath her feet. He lowered his head and saw that there was no support beneath his feet. Below him was the bottomless abyss. Just as Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body fell down, both her arms were grabbed by someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t focus solely on what you see in your eyes. This place we are in is a place of chaos, and our will can be controlled a little. We think what is here is what, and consciousness is figurative. \u201d The white robed man\u2019s voice rang out.</p><br/><p>After falling a distance, Embers and Brill immediately understood what was going on. They adjusted their body and gradually floated up.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at her arm. On one side was Dita Sla, and on the other was her white clothes. Jonathan scratched his head behind him. There was no place for him to pull. It was such a tragedy that he was too slow. His chance to show off had all been stolen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I know.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang immediately adjusted her body and floated in midair. Both Dittos and the man in white withdrew their hands.</p><br/><p>Everyone floated on the same line and looked ahead. Looking at the scene in front of her, Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. How could the ninth floor be as simple as a space? This place looked like the universe! The horizon was boundless and countless nebulae covered it. There were even some meteors floating in the air, moving at a speed that was difficult for the naked eye to detect. In fact! And a black hole!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I can pass through this region, I\u2019ll be able to reach another plane.\u201d \u201cBut to pass through here, one must break through the Space Shattering Realm.\u201d The white robed man\u2019s long hair fluttered gently in the wind. He looked forward and said softly, \u201cAt the end, there is a dazzling ring of light. That is the exit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful of the stones and the black swirl.\u201d At this moment, Dittos also opened his mouth in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang gazed into the distance and saw that the stone and the black whirlpool that Duttens spoke of were meteorites and black holes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, some of the stones seem to be very slow, but when you get closer, you find that they are very fast. Or some stone has a terrible suction, will suck the person over will never get rid of. And those black vortexes could devour people as well. \u201cThe devoured people have yet to see any coming out.\u201d The man in white explained in detail.</p><br/><p>Jonathan blinked as he stared at the scene in front of him. Looking at the white robed Dittos protecting both sides of Xiao Ao Shuang, he felt extremely displeased. Jin Yan\u2019s expression darkened slightly as he silently followed behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we want to safely pass through this area, we\u2019ll have to spend quite a bit of time. \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t get separated. Everyone, be careful.\u201d After saying that, Bai Yi turned to smile at Xiao Ao Shuang, \u201cCome, follow me.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang smiled back and nodded.</p><br/><p>The group then stepped into the vast danger zone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

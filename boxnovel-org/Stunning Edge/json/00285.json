If you die, there will be no need to repay the debt of gratitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Qi Ao Shuang said this, not only did Parina\u2019s face change, but even Ta Lina\u2019s face instantly paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you dare!\u201d Parina shouted in exasperation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, do you still insist on using this method to repay your favor?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang laughed out loud, looking at the flustered and exasperated look on Parina\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d You! \u201cYou!\u201d Parina was so angry that she almost vomited blood. Xiao Aushuang was actually making fun of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister, you can go back first. I\u2019ll come look for you right after I finish.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang turned around and nodded to the stunned Tanina.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, alright, alright.\u201d Only then did she come back to her senses. She hurriedly nodded and left with her junior sister.</p><br/><p>The two of them walked far away, and a low voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Sister, don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t think Senior Brother Qi Ao Shuang will like that unreasonable woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what nonsense are you spouting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking nonsense. \u201cYou are indeed fond of Shixiong Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you keep up the nonsense, I\u2019ll rip your mouth off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell the truth in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>The voices of the two gradually faded away. Parina glared angrily at the laughing Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, why are you laughing?!\u201d Parina said in a low, angry voice. This detestable Xiao Aushuang, how could he allow himself to be mocked by other girls? He actually rejected me without mercy in front of other women, and he even said something that would make anyone tremble with fear. What can\u2019t repay a favor and kill oneself. Damn it!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, tell me why you came looking for me.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang shook her head. She laughed as she looked at Parina who was about to go crazy. She knew what she was thinking. However, the bell in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart rang. It didn\u2019t seem wise for Tarina and Parina to treat themselves like this. He absolutely could not let it continue to develop. Pay her off quickly and you won\u2019t have anything to do with her anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to ask of you, and it\u2019s very important.\u201d Parina\u2019s face was grave and she no longer looked as angry as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d When Xiao Ao Shuang saw the serious expression on Parina\u2019s face, he also withdrew his smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me, this is not the place to speak.\u201d Parina turned her head and motioned for Ao Shuang to follow.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang had some doubts in her heart, but she still took a step forward to follow him.</p><br/><p>Parina led Qi Ao Shuang left and right, then turned again and finally entered an alley. At the end of the alley, she entered an unremarkable wooden door. Xiao Ao Shuang followed, and Parina quickly closed the door behind her. With a solemn expression, he brought Qi Ao Shuang inside.</p><br/><p>The house was small but neat. The wooden furniture was cleaned, and Qi Ao Shuang followed Parina up the wooden stairs to the second floor.</p><br/><p>Inside a small bedroom, Parina mysteriously locked the door. Xiao Ao Shuang was not in a hurry. She sat on the sofa and looked at Parina.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why aren\u2019t you nervous at all? Aren\u2019t you afraid of what I\u2019m going to do to you?\u201d Seeing how calm and composed Qi Ao Shuang looked, Parina could not help but feel angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it, what is it that needs to be said in such a place?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang surveyed her surroundings, this was a very ordinary house. What exactly is it that requires so much effort? It should be something that he doesn\u2019t want to attract attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cWait!\u201d Then, she formed a barrier around the room to ensure that their conversation was not being overheard. She sat down and glared at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows and smiled at Parina.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to investigate something for me. You\u2019re the only one who can find a way.\u201d Parina\u2019s expression changed. She said in an extremely solemn tone, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for Dittas and Jonathan to agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis must be done by one of the top three?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang guessed, but she couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly she wanted her to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Parina nodded, then said in a deep voice, \u201cAlthough I know it would be difficult for you to repay the favor you owe me, and perhaps even a little dangerous, I can\u2019t think of any other way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you know, forget it.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Parina teasingly, then she pretended to stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d \u201cWait.\u201d Parina scrambled to her feet, a pleading look on her face. \u201cI beg of you, please help me. Please help me.\u201d \u201cI owe you a favor, please!\u201d As she spoke, her eyes were filled with tears, and she was about to kneel down in front of Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was surprised. She hurriedly went up to help Parina up, frowned and asked in confusion, \u201cWhat exactly happened? Please explain it clearly first.\u201d I\u2019ll help you if I can. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, help me. If you don\u2019t help me, if my brother doesn\u2019t say so \u2026\u201d Parina\u2019s tears rolled down her face as she looked at Xiao Aoshuang with pleading eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, what exactly is going on?\u201d Looking at the expression on Parina\u2019s face, Xiao Ao Shuang knew that something big must have happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy family is a noble from Hurricane City. My father did not send my brother to Star Academy to study because he felt that with my brother\u2019s talent, he would be a hindrance to his progress on campus. Therefore, he had been cultivating by himself. He is a genius, a good son, and a good brother. \u201d With tears in her eyes, Parina began to explain, \u201cIt\u2019s not that you can only step into the Void Realm after passing the ninth level of the Star Heavenly Pagoda. Many people misunderstand and think that you can only enter the Star Academy. \u201cActually, it\u2019s only the Star Academy\u2019s Heavenly Pagoda that makes it easier for one to step into that realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang did not interrupt. She let go of Parina and returned to the sofa, quietly listening to her words. Her instincts told her that Parina seemed to know a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother is truly a rare genius in a thousand years. He\u2019s about to step into the Void Stage.\u201d A trace of pride appeared in Parina\u2019s eyes as she said this.</p><br/><p>Stepping into the Void Stage, isn\u2019t that a good thing? But why did Parina\u2019s next expression become more and more unsightly?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut someone from the Star Academy came looking for us. They asked big brother to go to the academy.\u201d Anger and fear appeared in Parina\u2019s eyes. She anxiously raised her head to look at Qi Ao Shuang and anxiously said, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, the big brother stepping into the Void realm has nothing to do with Star Academy, but the Star Academy actually came to find my big brother. Their attitude is abnormally strong, and they want my big brother to go to the Star Academy.\u201d \u201cBig brother is leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Star Academy wants to capture an expert in their hands?\u201d \u201cConvenient to continue controlling the world?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she tried to guess.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d It was said that those who stepped into the Void realm could go to another plane. He wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the world at all. It was rather difficult to descend from that plane, but it was said that it wasn\u2019t impossible. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of the Star Academy requesting my brother to go to the Academy at this time?\u201d Parina was excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it doesn\u2019t seem to make much sense to you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is the Star Academy so keen on whether or not someone has stepped into the Space Shattering Realm?\u201d Don\u2019t you find it strange? \u201d Parina clenched her teeth and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that the Star Academy\u2019s purpose is to nurture more Void Shattering experts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she thought back. It seemed that what Parina said was true. It seemed that the Stellar Tower\u2019s trial was specifically designed to nurture the elite experts of the Broken Space. In that case, what was the good of this academy?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, there were also people who were about to step into the Broken Void and were taken away by the Star Academy, and then there was no more news of them.\u201d The people from the academy said that those people had all stepped into the Space Shattering Realm and had gone to another plane. \u201cTherefore, we will never be able to see each other again.\u201d Parina\u2019s expression became more solemn and anxious. \u201cBut, Qi Ao Shuang, you better think carefully. Since you can automatically go to another plane once you step into the Void Fragmentation Realm, if you\u2019re not a member of the school, why did you come here to interfere?\u201d Take it and do what? \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with someone being with their family before they step into this realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what Parina said, Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s expression gradually became serious. She seemed to smell something unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Star Academy\u2019s way of doing things makes me very confused. So I\u2019ve been trying to find out why I went to this college. But I found nothing. I didn\u2019t find anything even in the Tower. Moreover, the number of times one could enter the Heavenly Tower was limited. One could only enter it during the trial. \u201cI don\u2019t have the means to reach the highest level, so I want you to help me.\u201d Parina said eagerly, her eyes pleading.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I can\u2019t reach the ninth floor right now.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned slightly. It was no wonder that Parina had disguised herself as a 2-star master teacher despite her 6-star strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you can enter and leave the Heavenly Pagoda at will. Moreover, you can reach the eighth level, so you are only a step away from the last level. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out something.\u201d Parina was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t agree, so she began to sob softly and beg, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, I beg of you, help me. I feel that this matter is definitely not simple, I feel that something will happen to my brother.\u201d \u201cI feel like big brother won\u2019t successfully step into the Space Shattering Realm. I feel like there\u2019s something wrong with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang frowned, deep in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, I beg you, my brother, I can\u2019t lose my brother.\u201d I didn\u2019t have a mother, and my father was busy with business and didn\u2019t have time to worry about me. My brother has been diligent in his cultivation, but he still spends a lot of time taking care of me and caring for me. I can\u2019t lose my brother. \u201d Parina\u2019s expression was bitter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, don\u2019t cry, I will help you investigate.\u201d Looking at the crying Parina, Xiao Ao Shuang felt sour in her heart. Because she remembered someone. The name had been in her heart for a long time \u2014 Catherine. That gentle woman, the woman who had used her life to protect her. Even knowing that her soul was no longer the same person, he had risked his life to protect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, but big brother is going to Star Academy tomorrow. What if I don\u2019t see big brother tomorrow?\u201d Parina\u2019s eyes were full of fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, tell your brother to not reach the Void Shattering Realm first. I believe that if there really is a problem with the Star Academy, he won\u2019t make a move on your brother until then.\u201d Give me some time, and I\u2019ll do my best to help you find out. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang also had an ominous feeling in her heart. Was there really a problem with the Star Academy? If that was true, then wasn\u2019t that their goal as well? Because at this moment, Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly remembered what the dean said when she saw the dean. If Parina\u2019s guess was true, not only her, but Dittos was their target as well, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m really scared.\u201d I feel that the Star Academy really has a lot of problems. Back then, the student who had reached 8-star on his first attempt at the examination had fallen out with the academy, and he had even nearly destroyed the Heavenly Pagoda. According to the rumors, the student was actually capable of passing the ninth floor. In other words, he could actually reach the Space Shattering Realm! But why did he do such a strange thing? And for what reason did the Star Academy keep those who were about to step into the Broken Void in their academy? \u201cI\u2019m not guessing. I\u2019m sure that nothing good will happen!\u201d Parina\u2019s body trembled slightly, and her face turned pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, Parina, your brother is all right.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll find out as soon as possible.\u201d Xiao Aushuang furrowed her brow and said solemnly, \u201cIf that\u2019s true, then this is not just about your brother and you, but about too many people, and I am one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at him with her eyes wide open in fear, \u201cCould it be \u2026 could it be that you are also stepping into the Void Shattering dimension?\u201d \u201cNo, no, Qi Ao Shuang, no!\u201d She rushed forward and hugged Qi Ao Shuang, tears streaming down her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get excited, Parina.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang hurriedly tried to push away Parina, but Parina was in a state of excitement and held onto her tightly. She refused to let go. Xiao Aushuang could only coax her, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, I will not let this happen.\u201d I swear I won\u2019t. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t reached the strength you said I would.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t step into the void \u2026\u201d Parina sobbed.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang sighed softly, not saying anything else.</p><br/><p>The room fell silent, save for the soft sobs of Parina. After a long time, Parina finally stopped crying, and Xiao Ao Shuang comforted her once again. Only then did Parina gradually recover, and she embarrassedly let go of her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d \u201cRemember to go back and tell your big brother to slow down his cultivation and not step into the Space Shattering Realm so quickly.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will listen to you.\u201d Parina nodded like a chicken pecking rice. In the end, he gave his brother\u2019s appearance and name to Qi Ao Shuang, and gave her a necklace made of gems to prove her identity.</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>On the street, Qi Ao Shuang watched Parina leave, his heart in chaos.</p><br/><p>What do you want to do? Would he secretly follow Parina\u2019s brother back to the academy tomorrow? So what do we do here?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, you, don\u2019t take risks. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous. Give me some time to resolve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Ao Shuang was feeling restless in her heart, a clear and bright voice that she seemed to have heard before reached her ears. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s pupils dilated. She had heard this voice before.</p><br/><p>It was the voice he had heard on the eighth floor, the voice of the person who had prevented him from advancing to the ninth floor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But no one has ever seen it, and there is no basis for it. \u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Matthews casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this sea is beautiful.\u201d Lily laid down on her stomach and looked down. She even had the urge to use her secret technique to see if there were real God Beasts down there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow far is the Wings King\u2019s castle?\u201d King Yue asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep going in this direction. It won\u2019t be very far.\u201d Lily looked up and pointed ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange, there\u2019s the smell of blood \u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan suddenly frowned and said in a deep voice, \u201cThe smell of wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s face sank. They all knew that Feng Yixuan was sensitive to wind. If Feng Yixuan said so, then it must be true.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d \u201cThe Wings King is in danger!\u201d Duke Yue suddenly realized and angrily shouted, \u201cQuick!\u201d We must get there at once! \u201cIt must be the Heavenly King\u2019s men who came to find us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did the Heavenly King\u2019s men find this place?\u201d Mishus\u2019 face was extremely ugly to behold. He urged the mount beneath him to increase its speed.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cRight now, I hope that the Wings King is fine.\u201d The new King of White and King Yong had already been found by the Heavenly King. If the Wings King was killed at this time, then the new Winged King would not know when to find it. If the Heavenly King were to find it first, things would become even more troublesome.</p><br/><p>Everyone was burning with anxiety as they desperately rushed forward. Gradually, an exquisite castle appeared in the clouds before them, and the smell of blood grew thicker and thicker. From a distance, the castle looked like a garden in the sky. Green plants covered most of the area, and there was a fountain in the middle. However, Lily, with her bright eyes, exclaimed, \u201cBlood! There\u2019s blood in the pool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s heart sank. It seemed like something had happened over here.</p><br/><p>As he was about to land, the sounds of intense fighting came from inside the castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick!\u201d Moon King and Mishus quickly dismounted from their mounts and rushed into the castle. The others followed closely behind. Along the way, he saw quite a few corpses. The majority of them were actually cut in half, and fresh blood flowed out. His methods were cruel. Not only were the guards killed, there were also many unarmed maids in white clothes!</p><br/><p>\u201cToo cruel!\u201d Bastard! \u201cWhat a bastard!\u201d Lily looked at the terrible scene, her heart full of anger, gritting her teeth as she rushed forward.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan coldly glared at him, but didn\u2019t say anything after seeing all this.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Feng Yi Xuan walked at the back. Qi Ao Shuang slightly frowned, but she still seemed to be absent-minded.</p><br/><p>The deafening sound of fighting was heard. When the group rushed into the hall, the interior was a mess. The walls were broken, and the blood on the ground had dried and solidified. Looking up, there were four people confronting each other in twos and threes.</p><br/><p>Seeing one of them, Xiao Ao Shuang cried out involuntarily, \u201cWhite clothes!\u201d And beside the white robes, there was a bloodstain of blood. This stubborn woman was obviously the Winged King they were looking for.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d The two people who had been confronting the Winged King and the white-robed man already had the upper hand, but when they saw the arrival of the Moon King and Mishus, they decisively let out a low shout and prepared to retreat. These two were the other two generals beside the Heavenly King.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d Yue Wang shouted to stop him. Mishus and Jin Yan rushed forward to meet the other general.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoom!\u201d A loud sound rang out as the two sides engaged in a fierce battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai \u2026\u201d Lingyun, how are you? \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang ran over, looking at the bloodstained white robe as she asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun?\u201d The man in white looked at Qi Ao Shuang doubtfully.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was momentarily stunned, realizing that the person in front of her was still in white clothes, and he was Leng Lingyun, who had yet to recover her memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun.\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes darkened slightly as he looked at the man in white and said in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re Leng Lingyun. It\u2019s just that you haven\u2019t recovered your memories yet.\u201d Feng Yixuan had already learned of Leng Lingyun\u2019s change from Qi Ao Shuang. Feng Yixuan stared coldly at the white robe in front of him. He knew that this was the true appearance of Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>The white robe was slightly startled. Blood suddenly seeped out from the corner of his mouth. It was obvious that his injuries were not light.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi, y-are you alright?\u201d The pale Wings King was not lightly injured, but her beautiful face was full of worry. Her eyes were full of love as she looked at the white clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, how are you?\u201d The man in white smiled and reached out to support the Winged King.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys go and rest first.\u201d The war here will be over soon. \u201d Feng Yixuan frowned as he watched the intimate actions of the two. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him. If there was a relationship between the Winged King and Leng Lingyun, this should be a good thing for him. But why he felt a wave of uneasiness that he did not understand himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDance, come here.\u201d Bai Yixue coughed softly, supporting the Winged King to sit down. Dancing must be the true name of the Wings King.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at the scene in front of her, but she couldn\u2019t say anything. An indescribable feeling welled up in his heart. At this moment, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s vision dimmed. She raised her head and met Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s gaze. Feng Yi Xuan stood in front of Qi Ao Shuang, preventing her from seeing the scene before her. He said in a low voice, \u201cLook over there, it\u2019s almost over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was a little enlightened, turning around to look ahead, only then did she see that Lily had already been married into the fight. Lily\u2019s weapon was a whip, the very whip that had been taken from her waist. Although the two generals were not ordinary, when the four faced off against two, coupled with the fact that they had expended too much energy fighting the Winged King and Bai Yi earlier, they were quickly at a disadvantage. It was already too late for her to escape, and she did not persist for long. It didn\u2019t take long for Moon King and Mishus to capture one each.</p><br/><p>\u201cLangdon, how did you know about this place?\u201d Duke Yue felt fear in his heart. If they had been a bit late, it would have been too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, pah!\u201d \u201cYou have people from the distant clan, can\u2019t we use them to probe?\u201d That general named Random was stopped by King Yue, making him unable to move. Although his body was exhausted, he looked at Lily and spat with bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d \u201cHow could my race help traitors like you!\u201d Lily screamed and glared at Random.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people are all idiots.\u201d \u201cCapturing all of the children and arguing over the use of secret skills.\u201d Random laughed out loud and said mockingly, \u201cBut it\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve lost patience, so when I get the news, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d \u201cYou should be thankful to me. Right now, you are the only descendant of your clan, and your worth has increased by countless folds!\u201d After saying that, Random laughed sinisterly.</p><br/><p>Lily suddenly felt all the blood in her body solidify. Of course, she understood the meaning behind these last two sentences of Random\u2019s. The Far Eye had been exterminated! She was the only one of the Far Eye!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, go die!\u201d \u201cGo to hell!\u201d With an explosive shout, Lily whipped at Random\u2019s head, and cut Random into two halves from his head to his waist. Blood spattered everywhere, staining the floor red. Relieved, Lily continued to whip Random\u2019s body, sending blood flying in all directions. \u201cBastard!\u201d \u201cBeast, animal!\u201d Lily cursed at the top of her lungs, but tears kept coming out of her eyes. She cried helplessly, flailing the whip in her hand. The mood of the other people were abnormally heavy. All of a sudden, all the clan members were wiped out, leaving only Lily behind. Anyone who called out to him would not be able to control his emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, Lily!\u201d Seeing that Lili was about to collapse, Jin Yan stepped forward and grabbed her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go, big brother Jin Yan. I want to tear him into a thousand pieces!\u201d Lily cried and struggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLily, now that he\u2019s dead, you\u2019ll only dirty your hands.\u201d Jin Yan patiently tried to persuade her, but couldn\u2019t bear to see the helpless crying Lily in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Jin Yan \u2026\u201d The whip in Lily\u2019s hand powerlessly fell to the ground. She turned around and threw herself into Jin Yan\u2019s embrace, crying loudly. \u201cElder brother Jin Yan, I\u2019m so stupid. I should have thought that the Heavenly King would go find my clansmen.\u201d I\u2019m so stupid. \u201cWuuuuuu, grandpa, dad and the others are all dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yan could only gently pat Lily\u2019s back, silently comforting her. Everyone\u2019s hearts were heavy.</p><br/><p>Another general was temporarily detained. The danger was temporarily lifted, and the Wings King ordered his remaining subordinates to clean the castle. Under the superior medical skills of the Wings King, the wounds of the Wings King and the White Robe were also controlled. Lily fell into a deep slumber from crying. Jin Yan carried her into the guest room to rest, accompanying her by the side. After everything was settled, the Wings King sat on top of the main hall and solemnly said, \u201cThe Heavenly King previously sent someone to persuade him, but I didn\u2019t agree.\u201d \u201cMy original intention was not to interfere. I didn\u2019t expect him to act so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe tried to dissuade you because your medical skills are excellent. He wanted to subdue you, so he wasn\u2019t that courteous to the other kings.\u201d King Yue said with a cold snort.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved. \u201cI just want to go back with the white clothes and never do anything else.\u201d \u201c\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026\u201d After saying this, the Wings King turned to look at Bai Yi with a gentle gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d Mishus asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, I want to ask what White Clothes mean.\u201d Wings King gave a soft smile to Bai Yi, \u201cBai Yi, what do you think we should do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white robed man\u2019s face grew cold as he spoke with a heavy gaze, \u201cI think that we can only end this matter after fighting the Heavenly King.\u201d The man in white didn\u2019t even look at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d \u201cThe Heavenly King won\u2019t let us go.\u201d Wings King said in a deep voice, \u201cThen, Moon King, tell me about the situation you are currently in control of.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Moon King, Misius and the Winged King began their intense discussion. Qi Ao Shuang stood aside in silence, deep in thought. Feng Yixuan was silent as well. His face was grave, and it was unknown what he was thinking.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

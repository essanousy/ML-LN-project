Qi Ao Shuang did not move, nor did the creature walk away. It floated in the swamp, staring at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Have you never seen a beauty before? \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen a handsome guy before?\u201d Although Qi Ao Shuang was thinking hard, she still could not think of a way to safely cross the swamp. Seeing the strange creature still looking at her, she could not help but shout out angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu gu ~ ~ Gu gu ~\u201d the monster snorted at Qi Ao Shuang, but it didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of bird language?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she looked at this dangerous fellow, keeping her guard up. How could someone who was able to live comfortably under such terrifying conditions be an easy opponent? Just the size of that bizarre head and that terrifying mouth was enough to make one\u2019s hair stand on end.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaw Haw?\u201d At this time, the sky suddenly jumped out from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body, jumping directly in front of the monster and letting out two chirps.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoo, coo ~ ~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaw Haw?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu gu!\u201d \u201cGu gu gu gu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi \u2026\u201d \u201cHiss, hiss ~ ~\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were chattering away in a language that Qi Ao Shuang did not understand. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, with a loud crashing sound, the monster actually jumped up and splashed water all over the place. The ground and the nearby floating rocks all made a corrosive sizzling sound. The places where the water had splashed were all corroded, causing people to shudder in fear. And the monster made gurgling sounds and was jumping around. He seemed to be happy?</p><br/><p>Haw Haw! \u201cJiu \u2014\u201d The sky seemed to be angry as it bounced around. It seemed like it was scolding him?</p><br/><p>\u201cGoo \u2026\u201d What made Qi Ao Shuang shocked was that the monster was actually like a child who had done something wrong, obediently swimming over, floating beside the swamp, staring at the sky with its beady eyes.</p><br/><p>What confused Qi Ao Shuang the most was that her soybean-sized eyes seemed to have a pitiful look in them, as if she was begging for forgiveness.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang ~ ~\u201d The vast sky leaped back to Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Xiao Aushuang looked at the sky curiously, \u201cYou can understand that guy\u2019s words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Momo. Do you want to pass through this place?\u201d With him leading the way, it would soon be smooth sailing. All you have to do is pay for the road. \u201d The sky looked like a ruffian as he laughed mischievously.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang! And then he felt a little urge to spurt it out.</p><br/><p>Hairy? This strange creature had a name, but it was still the same. What a tangled name! And he even wanted money for it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWhat money?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang felt that her tongue was a little tangled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSimple. Momo said that the meat you threw earlier was delicious, so I\u2019ll order some more.\u201d Then I told him, you can make it better. \u201cHe said that not only can he let you pass, he can also help you pass safely.\u201d With a smug look, Chang Kong added, \u201cMomo is the local tyrant, this is his territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang twitched her mouth, unable to say anything. This place, how had the people of the past passed through? Qi Ao Shuang did not care about whether she would pass this test or not. What she cared about was the reward for passing the trial!</p><br/><p>It was said that those who passed the eighth level of the trial could cultivate in a secret place. Where could they comprehend the power faster to reach the realm of breaking through the void? Even for this reward, Qi Ao Shuang had to think of a way to pass through this level!</p><br/><p>\u201cCoo, coo, coo ~ ~\u201d Momo began to cry out again, and the more she cried out, the more frantic she became.</p><br/><p>At the side, Zhangkong translated competently, \u201cHuman, just get me something delicious.\u201d I\u2019ve never had a full stomach, and the meat is super bad. Give me something good to eat, and I can get you through here safely. \u201cYou know, even if those people pass through here the fastest, it\u2019ll still take a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was sweating cold sweat. The super tough meat that Momo mentioned was probably the kind of people that came to participate in the trial and wanted to pass through here. The human meat certainly wasn\u2019t tasty, let alone raw!</p><br/><p>The first time Momo ate pork, she naturally felt that it tasted much better than the human meat. In addition, if there was a Wind Origin ability that understood his words, that would be even better.</p><br/><p>A few black lines appeared on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s forehead. So there was such a way to get through this dangerous place. Bribe Momo! If those people from before knew of this method, they wouldn\u2019t have to hold their grudges anymore. However, even so, how many people would be so bored as to throw pork at Momo, and who would be so coincidental that they had the elemental energy to communicate with Momo? Qi Ao Shuang was the first person in history to have these two conditions.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoast meat?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Mao Mao\u2019s bean-sized eyes and stared at her, her scalp tingling. She then took out all the tools for roasted meat, and took out a few pieces of fresh, fat meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu gu!\u201d \u201cGu gu!\u201d Momo was so excited that she started to flop around in the swamp. Finally, she laid her huge and ugly head against the edge of the swamp, staring at the things in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hands with her small eyes. With a \u2018gurgle\u2019, the sky turned around and chattered to Momo.</p><br/><p>\u201cMomo is swallowing her saliva.\u201d Only then did Chang explain to Qi Aushuang what that \u2018gurgle\u2019 meant. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was speechless. She sped up her actions, roasted a piece of meat and threw it at the fur on the shore. A few pieces of meat had disappeared just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhangkong, this, this fur, where did it go to swallow the meat?\u201d \u201cSo small \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe made his own space, temporarily swallowing it in the space in his mouth, then he can spit it out and eat it.\u201d The sky explained.</p><br/><p>So awesome? Xiao Ao Shuang was speechless. This habit of hers was just like a hamster\u2019s. However, this fella was actually able to create space in his body. What kind of creature was this?</p><br/><p>After roasting almost all of the fresh meat in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s Spatial Ring, Momo closed her eyes in satisfaction and smacked her lips in satisfaction. Then he swam left and right, blinking at Qi Aushuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMomo said she can lead the way now.\u201d The sky jumped onto Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded and said to Mao Mao, \u201cI will be troubling you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu gu!\u201d Gugu ~ ~ Gugu ~ ~ \u201cThe fur man began to growl.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already paid for the trip, no need to thank me.\u201d Vast sky was a competent interpreter.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a soft sound could be heard from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoo, goo, goo \u2026\u201d Momo suddenly began to croak softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming.\u201d The words flew back into Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was confused, turning around, who is it?</p><br/><p>Gradually, the soft sound got closer and closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you?!\u201d A sharp voice sounded, filled with doubt. The one who spoke was Lani. At this moment, her face was filled with disbelief. She was frowning as she looked at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Beside Lenny was the calm Dittas. It was just that Lenny looked a little tired, while Dittens seemed to be in good spirits. From this, one could tell the difference in strength between the two. Clearly, Lenny had put in a lot of effort to pass that level, while Dittins had easily passed.</p><br/><p>But Jonathan didn\u2019t seem to be with them?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lenny stared at Qi Ao Shuang and asked impolitely.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang did not pay any attention to Lani. She only glanced at the two indifferently before turning around and returning to her seat.</p><br/><p>Lani held his breath. This red-haired kid would embarrass her every time, and he never looked straight at her. As expected, none of the people who were close to Jonathan were good people! Well, both of them are uneducated bastards.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being rude, I\u2019m asking you a question.\u201d Lani was still uncomfortable, but he forced himself to say these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound polite when you ask questions. It\u2019s normal if others don\u2019t answer.\u201d At this moment, Dittas spoke indifferently. However, his gaze fell on Qi Ao Shuang. He wasn\u2019t surprised at all that this youth was able to arrive here. At the beginning, the aura exuded from the youth\u2019s body made him feel that the youth was not simple at all. And here he was. Judging from his relaxed expression, he had either arrived here very early or lived a very easy life.</p><br/><p>After hearing Stens\u2019 words, Lani felt a sense of fear. Only then did he remember that he had indeed lost his composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I was only surprised. That\u2019s why I asked with some impatience.\u201d Lenny quickly explained, afraid that he would leave a bad impression in Dittas\u2019s mind. In addition to his nervousness, he also harbored a grudge against Xiao Ao Shuang. This red-haired kid was the same as Jonathan. He had the ability to make himself lose his composure.</p><br/><p>No wonder Lenny was so angry. In this academy, which man would ignore Lenny\u2019s questions? Those admirers would always say whatever they know, even if they weren\u2019t admirers they would still give them some face. Jonathan was the only one who mocked and ridiculed her. His attitude toward her was driving her crazy. He just ignored her!</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang did not say anything, only quietly sitting there waiting. She wanted to see how the two of them would manage to survive this perilous swamp.</p><br/><p>At this time, the voice of Dylan didn\u2019t have the slightest ripple to it. It wasn\u2019t directed at Qi Ao Shuang, but at Lani.</p><br/><p>\u201cLenny, you can\u2019t always rely on me. This time, you have to rely on your own strength to get through.\u201d Dittos\u2019 voice was calm, without the slightest ripple of emotion.</p><br/><p>These words were spoken with a light tone, and only then did Qi Ao Shuang realize what had happened. So it turned out that this Lenny had only managed to pass through the eighth floor by relying on Dittos. If all the students who passed the eighth level had to participate in the competition, then what was the point of Lenny getting third place? Could it be that the other students who passed were all male students and all of them had been given to her?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s guess was correct! It was true! The other boys were all being merciful to Lenny, but Jonathan was the only one. That was why Lenny was Jonathan\u2019s Third Brother in ten thousand years! Lenny\u2019s strength was only at the peak of the Seven Stars, not yet at the 8-star level.</p><br/><p>A trace of disdain flashed across Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes. She looked down on Lani, and even more so at those people who made Lani participate in the competition.</p><br/><p>So what if she was pretty? Beautiful enough to do as she pleases? He was truly speechless!</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, Lenny\u2019s face naturally turned pale. He shouted in fear, \u201cDittas, you can\u2019t do this. If you don\u2019t bring me there, I will descend to the seventh star!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

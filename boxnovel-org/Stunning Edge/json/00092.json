That\u2019s a good idea. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not a summoner nor a druid. I am a man as clean as the wind.\u201d Camille regretted resentfully. \u201cSo I can\u2019t understand those crude sea beasts\u2019 language.\u201d</p><br/><p>Summoner? Druid? A thought flashed through her mind. If they had somebody who could communicate with the sea beasts, then the situation would be resolved easily. However, currently, the people of Placid Waters were nervously running or hiding. How could anyone with that ability be in this chaotic and dangerous place? What exactly were the sea beasts looking for?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still can\u2019t think of a method, then the people from the Temple of Light are going to come. Haha, Reverand Hill, how are you, venerable one, here? Please return with us to the temple.\u201d Camille\u2019s gentle voice carried a trace of weird feeling that couldn\u2019t be described. This guy had actually started talking in the manner of the people from the Temple of Light. With those words coming out of his mouth, it was completely sarcastic.</p><br/><p>Claire rolled her eyes. It wasn\u2019t like it was her who wanted the title of bishop, but that old fox, the pope, who had forced it onto her before so many people\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also want to quickly fix the problem so we can continue our journey!\u201d Claire said unhappily, then got out all the magic puppets that Emery had given her from her bag. There was a bird, a mouse, and a fish. One could fly in the sky, the other ran on land, and the last one swam underwater. Everything had been covered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse these to scout?\u201d Camille was a little interested seeing the puppets Claire had gotten out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded. Next, she infused magic into the magic puppets in her hands, then fished out a small crystal ball to view. The crystal ball split into three levels with three different viewpoints showing everything that the puppets had just seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little interesting.\u201d Camille stroked his chin, a brow raised.</p><br/><p>But Claire didn\u2019t hold any high hopes. It was probably going to be difficult to find what the sea beasts were looking for. Perhaps it was because some kind of treasure the sea beasts cared about was snatched away by humans that they were so crazy.</p><br/><p>Camille squinted at the crystal ball without a word.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the bottom area of the crystal ball changed. In a dark and damp place, a pair of eyes filled with hope flashed by, followed by the bottom area turning back into how it originally looked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Camille\u2019s keen senses caught the abnormality.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe magic power ran out, so the magic puppet is returning the way it came.\u201d Claire\u2019s expression changed slightly. Just then she had read those eyes clearly. The owner of the eyes discovered the magic puppet and wanted to send some information.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich magic puppet was it?\u201d Camille was smiling as elegantly as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe land mouse. That person was underground.\u201d Claire frowned, pondering. Was it related? Was it related to the person who had just appeared within the crystal ball?</p><br/><p>\u201cNormally, all city lord castles have dungeons underneath.\u201d Camille said faintly. After seeing Claire\u2019s gaze shift to look towards him, he immediately shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to help you scout for information, that place is filthy and moist. Also, you don\u2019t have the time to deal with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if the it\u2019s related to the sea beasts\u2019 attack?\u201d Claire said quietly, looking at Camille.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould that coincidence actually happen?\u201d Camille turned and said halfheartedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Come and see with me, assassin king. Only someone with your skills can take up such a responsibility.\u201d Claire said quietly. Camille immediately followed, smiling beautifully. \u201cOh, commander, please continue to praise me. Let\u2019s go scout out what exactly is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour beauty is unmatched, your keen senses make me gasp in admiration, your graceful bearing\u2026\u201d Claire quietly said, expressionless as she continued to walk forward. Camille smiled, pleased, following closely from behind.</p><br/><p>The two disappeared silently into the night.</p><br/><p>Claire sighed. Camille who smiled brightly the entire day was actually the person most suitable to live within the darkness. The darkness was actually Camille\u2019s world, his dominion. Bizarrely, it was clearly the first time Camille had come here, but he silently brought Claire with ease and almost routinely down to the dungeon, as if he had been there before.</p><br/><p>The dark and moist dungeon smelled moldy, without any signs of human life. Then was the person in the crystal ball a prisoner that they hadn\u2019t had enough time to evacuate? Without knowing exactly when the sea beasts were going to break through and submerge the city, normally, they would still evacuate all major criminals. Then was the person abandoned such a sinful criminal that it didn\u2019t matter if they lived or died?</p><br/><p>Whether the dungeon door was open wide or half closed, it was clear to see that there wasn\u2019t anybody within the mess inside. The end of the corridor led to the very last prison cell. Camille stopped, turned to Claire, and nodded, indicating there was someone inside. Naturally, Claire had also sensed a weak aura from within.</p><br/><p>Camille pulled out a dagger and used it to push open the filthy prison door. The scene before the two\u2019s eyes made them freeze.</p><br/><p>An almost completely naked young man was tied up there with only a piece of cloth hiding his more important spot. His mouth was stuffed by a piece of cloth, his beautiful, jet black, long hair reached his feet, and haggard yet jade like complexion revealed a stunning, enchanting person. Such a stunningly beautiful enchanting young man! Seeing Claire and Camille, the young man\u2019s eyes flashed eagerly, starting to whimper and struggle, but he was helpless as his limbs were tied up tightly.</p><br/><p>Camille clicked his tongue and shook his head without any indication that that he was going to help untie him.</p><br/><p>Claire approached and pulled out the cloth in the enchanting young man\u2019s mouth, quietly saying, \u201cWho are you? Why were you imprisoned here?\u201d</p><br/><p>But the young man\u2019s first sentence, or to be more accurate, first few phrases, made Claire freeze.</p><br/><p>\u201cSummoner, hungry, scheme, the city lord\u2019s younger sister, boy toy, didn\u2019t, imprisoned\u2026\u201d The young man said phrases one after another weakly.</p><br/><p>Claire suddenly looked at the enchanting young man. It couldn\u2019t be, he was actually a summoner? In other words, there was hope for the crazy sea beasts to settle down? Claire tried to confirm. \u201cYou\u2019re a summoner?\u201d But what were those continuous phrases supposed to mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a summoner, but because he is so beautiful, the city lord\u2019s sister took a liking to him. By chance, he was hungry at the time, so he was poisoned in a scheme to capture him. They threatened him to become a boy toy, but he didn\u2019t agree, so they he was imprisoned in this dark dungeon.\u201d Camille fluently connected the young man\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Claire blinked. She looked at the smiling Camille, then looked at the young man whose eyes were now lit up, understanding that Camille had completely understood what the young man meant to say accurately.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, this is the first time I\u2019ve found that you are a multitalented scholar.\u201d Claire said seriously. Then she looked at the young man. \u201cCan you communicate with the sea beasts? All the sea beasts outside the city are attacking the harbor. You can communicate with them, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey, save me, destroy this.\u201d The young man said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sea beasts wanted to save you, so they destroyed the city.\u201d Camille elegantly and gently straightened his bangs, subconsciously interpreting the young man\u2019s phrases. Only after he finished speaking did Camille realize what he had said. Camille stared wide eyed at the enchanting young man incredulously. The sea beasts were all summoned by this weak young man?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you summoned all the sea beasts? Without any chanting or items, only using your spiritual power to call?\u201d Claire wasn\u2019t amazed. Instead, she frowned, looking doubtfully at the man before her. If this was true, then the young man\u2019s couldn\u2019t be described as simply \u2018strong\u2019, but terrifying. The young man had such terrifying power, but was currently so pitiful. How could anyone believe it? Unless the young man was as stupid as a pig. Thinking of this, Claire suddenly trembled. The enchanting young man really was as stupid as a pig! A person who had been poisoned just because he was hungry, how smart could he be?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe city lord doesn\u2019t seem like a person who would allow his little sister to do something so shady.\u201d Claire stroked her chin, pondering, with no indications of untying the young man. The young writhed around, grunting one word over and over: hungry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. The city lord didn\u2019t know about it. After this guy summoned all the sea beasts he could after he woke up to escape, they had already ran away. The people who had kidnapped him didn\u2019t dare to let him go, not had the time. Of course they would hope he died. As the city lord\u2019s little sister, kidnapping a boy is definitely dishonorable.\u201d Camille quickly explained his conjecture.</p><br/><p>Claire saw joy in the young man\u2019s eyes again. Perhaps the young man already saw Camille as a close friend by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name.\u201d Claire looked at the enchanting young man before her, still with no indications of untying him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Fenghou.\u201d The enchanting young man blinked his eyes, watching Claire blankly, then said, \u201cHungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire finally realized that the terrifyingly powerful summoner was unordinarily deficient when talking! And the young man\u2019s eyes were crystal clear. Who did he remind him of? Claire tried to remember. That\u2019s right! He was a little similar to Qiao Chuxin! They both felt pure, like they hadn\u2019t experienced the world yet. Claire felt like the young man had also just left some kind of deep mountain or forest for the first time, but he had been unlucky and before he could make a name for himself, he had been captured and turned into this pitiful state.</p><br/><p>\u201cHungry, hungry, hungry, hungry\u2026\u201d Dong Fenghou stared at Claire and only said this word.</p><br/><p>Claire watched Dong Fenghou, a cold light flashing through her eyes, not saying anything for a while.</p><br/><p>Camille yawned. He knew that Yuan Bao Mercenary Corps was about to have another pitiful person for Claire to order around.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

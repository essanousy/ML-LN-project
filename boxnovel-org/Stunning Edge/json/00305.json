And these people weren\u2019t weak at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is here too.\u201d The man in white frowned slightly and said calmly, \u201cLet\u2019s go first and destroy the formation.\u201d I owe Valentine a favor. I don\u2019t want to fight them here. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t seem to be planning to let us go.\u201d Jonathan shrugged. \u201cThey must be coming for us. What do they want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActivate a magical formation, capture us, and then report to the person behind them.\u201d The man in white answered simply, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll destroy those magical formations before them.\u201d \u201cNow that we have so many people, destroying that magical formation should be an easy task.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person behind them \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slowly stood up, murmuring to herself. For some reason, she suddenly thought of what Jing Feng had said. The wind seemed to know who was behind these people. Although he didn\u2019t say it out loud, it didn\u2019t matter. Soon, he would find out who it was himself.</p><br/><p>After speaking, Bai Yi stood up and took the lead in flying ahead. Everyone followed closely behind him. At this time, the voice of Chang Kong sounded out in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind, \u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d You lied to me so bitterly! You\u2019re a woman, and, and. Zhangkong\u2019s voice rose up. \u201cShe\u2019s also a great beauty! Waaaah! I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019m in a great beauty\u2019s body.\u201d These words were so ambiguous.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled, and she started to secretly chat with Chang Kong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who allowed me to break through and not let me advance?\u201d \u201cYou actually didn\u2019t tell me you were a beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone. My life and death are all yours. Don\u2019t even think about leaving me behind.\u201d \u201cAlso, Qi Ao Shuang, I have my own form now. Hehe, this young master is in the spotlight now, a super handsome brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, congratulations.\u201d However, Qi Ao Shuang only said a few words before following Bai Yi and the others and flying forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, when you see what I look like, don\u2019t fall in love with me.\u201d Vile laughter filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d After Xiao Ao Shuang reprimanded him, Chang Bai shut his mouth and did not say anything else.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of Bai Yi, the group of people flew straight into the middle. As for Qi Ao Shuang, she could also feel a few people approaching from the other direction. The two sides finally met face to face.</p><br/><p>The dean paused when he saw the elders standing behind him, he smiled at Qi Ao Shuang and said, \u201cCongratulations, you have finally stepped into the Space Shattering Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need to pretend anymore.\u201d \u201cEveryone knows that once one steps into the Void Shattering Realm, one will be forcefully pulled from the gravity of the upper plane to that plane.\u201d \u201cHowever, this area is really not bad. It can allow people to stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Dittos, Qi Ao Shuang, Jonathan, Brill, don\u2019t listen to his nonsense. We will send you to that plane.\u201d The dean said amiably with a smile, while his hands were already moving behind his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis excuse of yours is really far-fetched.\u201d Jonathan said snappily, \u201cSince you\u2019ve already broken through, why do you need to send it out?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid the place you\u2019re sending us to isn\u2019t as simple as that plane, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed going to that plane, but it should be the designated place, right?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the dean and said in a testing manner.</p><br/><p>The dean\u2019s expression changed slightly, but his hands behind his back formed an even more complicated hand gesture. Valentine, who had lost his arm, kept his head down, not moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure enough, who is the person behind you?\u201d The purpose of your Star Academy is to gather experts and present them to the people behind you? \u201cWhat\u2019s his purpose?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked a series of questions.</p><br/><p>The dean smiled and said slowly, \u201cIf you want to know, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll be scared out of your wits.\u201d The dean smiled, but was actually stalling for time. For he saw that Valentine hesitated again at this moment, and did not move. Was the new method that their master had taught them a waste of time?</p><br/><p>\u201cValentine, if you continue to hesitate, can you afford the consequences? Have you forgotten what I said? Even if you don\u2019t want to go back, even if you are willing to bear the pain your master has given you, it doesn\u2019t mean that we are willing to! Master sending you here was a mistake! \u201cHow long will you wait before you make up for your mistake?!\u201d The dean\u2019s face darkened as he spoke to Valentine in a private voice. Valentine\u2019s face changed again and again, but he was unwilling to make a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cValentine!\u201d The dean could no longer be bothered about anything else as he shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen!\u201d Valentine finally shouted, pain flashing between his eyebrows. In an instant, his entire body burst out with light, then he turned into a huge net of light, enveloping all of them. At this moment, the dean and the other elders made a final hand gesture with their hands, and rays of light shot out from their hands to enclose the net of light, turning it into a ball of light and enveloping Qi Aushuang and the others within.</p><br/><p>This huge change didn\u2019t even leave Bai Yixue\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>One person, if he said no, then he was gone. Moreover, he had transformed into the net of light that enveloped them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeckham.\u201d \u201cOh, no, you\u2019re not the real Beckham. We don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d Only then did the dean move his hand forward. That blinding light beam was emitted from the palm of his right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Valentine?\u201d The expression on Bai Yixue\u2019s face grew uglier as he asked word by word, his tone burning with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDead, as you can see. Oh, it was a complete disappearance. No, he just turned his body and soul into this net. With his last remaining value, he did his last best for his master. \u201cBakam, did you think we would activate this formation to capture you?\u201d The abbot laughed disdainfully, casually explaining Valentine\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven beasts are inferior!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s actually doing the same for his own people!\u201d Bai Yixue\u2019s calm face gradually turned angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen he let you go, he had already committed the most heinous of sins, and now he is only doing it to atone for his sins!\u201d And I have to tell you, every time you attack this web, you hit Valentine, your benefactor. \u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting?\u201d The dean\u2019s handsome face gradually turned malevolent.</p><br/><p>Bai Yixue clenched his fists tightly and no longer spoke.</p><br/><p>With a cold expression on his face, Dylan started to attack the net of light that trapped them without saying a word. However, something surprising happened. The force of Dittos\u2019 attack on the web of light was like a small stone thrown into the ocean; there was no reaction at all. It seemed to have been absorbed?</p><br/><p>Dittos frowned slightly as if he was thinking of something. Jonathan did not believe it and did it himself, but the same thing happened. All the power had been absorbed, and this sphere of light seemed to be growing stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeckham, you\u2019re naive. Since we didn\u2019t capture you with a formation last time, do you think we\u2019ll still take the risk? You don\u2019t have to struggle anymore. In this world, no one can break free. In that plane, there weren\u2019t many people who could do anything to it. \u201cBecause it was given to me by that person, haha \u2026\u201d The dean laughed heartily, then looked at Xiao Ao Shuang and Dittos and laughed, \u201cThe two of you are indeed outstanding.\u201d This time, we can finally go home. \u201cJust the two of you will be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face sank as she asked in a cold voice. Who exactly was that person? Why is the dean so sure?</p><br/><p>Brill used all his strength to attack the surrounding net of light, but to no avail. With a punch from Jin Yan, the light net slightly caved in and immediately returned to its original state. The curvature of the cave was hard to see with the naked eye. Jonathan spared no effort in bombarding the net. Dittos calmed down and did not make another move.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201d You are about to vanish into nothingness and no longer exist. And it seems you shouldn\u2019t say that, either, but you should go back to the original. \u201cAlright, stop wasting your energy.\u201d The dean laughed proudly. What a joke! If these people in front of him could break through their master\u2019s net of light, it would be easier for them to convince him that the entire world was going to be destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on!\u201d Bai Yixue shouted angrily, and a blinding white light burst out from his body. He could no longer be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless. I advise you not to waste it \u2026\u201d Before the dean could finish his words, he was stunned. He was shocked to discover that the light on his white clothes was gradually turning purple. No, it was not right. A purple light gradually fused with the light on the white robe, causing the light on the white robe to turn purple. The dean turned to look at the source of the purple light in shock. The elders behind him were also extremely surprised. Everyone in the glowing net also cast their gazes towards the source of the purple light. They were shocked to see that it was actually from the earlobe of Qi Ao Shuang. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched the purple light shoot out from his earlobe, growing bigger and bigger, becoming more and more dazzling.</p><br/><p>It was the crystal earring that Leng Lingyun had given him! It was also Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes that were filled with her power! But why did he resonate with the power of the white robes now? Why is that? Jin Yan\u2019s expression changed abruptly as he looked at the white robes shrouded in purple light. He then looked at the dazzling earrings of Qi Ao Shuang. Something seemed to be clear in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d \u201cSpatial Distortion!\u201d The dean\u2019s face instantly turned extremely ugly to behold. He could clearly feel that the space within the light net was violently surging, as if it was about to tear apart. \u201cDon\u2019t let them escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was too late.</p><br/><p>The earrings on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s earlobes flew out automatically, flying straight into her body. Following that, the glowing net was completely submerged by a dazzling purple light. When the light disappeared, everyone in the light net had disappeared!</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

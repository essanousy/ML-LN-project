Camille smiled as he put the Sky Slaughter away, his eyes restored to the original blue color.</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s wrist flashed and the Sky Slaughter suddenly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy beloved toys, how can I let others destroy it recklessly?\u201d Camille\u2019s lips curled up in a sinister smile, and he looked at the messy bed of Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>Camille stood silently for a few seconds, then went up to tidy the bed for Qi Aoshuang \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang felt the world spin at this moment. The surroundings were all gray, and she could feel nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp chirp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHo ho!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two familiar sounds brought Qi Aoshuang back to earth . She subconsciously reached out and grasped the claws of the two little things in her hand.</p><br/><p>At last there was a light in front of them, and then it grew brighter.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang went out of the light, and finally, her feet finally landed. Land! \u2018 Before she could look around, she suddenly felt that the touch in her hands was a bit strange.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang squeezed her hands, then frowned and looked down at her hands. She realized that she was holding a large hand.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked up numbly and looked to the left. Her hair was like snow, her eyes were like the moon. An immaculate smile was imperceptibly beautiful.</p><br/><p>A human-shaped white emperor!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked to the right again: her hair was like ink, and her eyes were like stars. The corners of his mouth were with a charming smile as he stared at Qi Aoshuang decisively.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a human Black Feather!</p><br/><p>And one of their hands was now in her hands.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang quickly withdrew her hand and was astonished. \u201cWhy do you guys turn back to human form?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a special world,\u201d she said. White Emperor looked around and softly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, it\u2019s filled with power. Hazhou, Black Feather stretched his waist and narrowed his beautiful eyes as he said contentedly, \u201cIf I don\u2019t move, my bones will rust!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Qi Aoshuang looked at the surroundings and asked in astonishment.</p><br/><p>The air was very fresh and full of green, endless fields, and a range of hills and bottoms of the floor. The large flowers were abnormally fragrant, and the grass in the distance was half a person tall.</p><br/><p>The air is exceptionally fresh, and the front is full of verdant hills. The flowers are particularly fragrant, and the grass was so half-person high in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chaotic world.\u201d The White Emperor raised his head and looked at the sky! \u201d</p><br/><p>Chaotic world? Qi Aoshuang raised her head and stared in the direction that White Emperor was pointing at. The sun was in the sky, while the other half had a bright moon. The world seemed to be divided into two parts. One was a bright world, and the other side was darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cNight and day co-exist here,\u201d the Black Feather smiled sinisterly as he lowered his head to the side of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s ear. \u201cThis world has all sorts of races. It\u2019s full of power, and that\u2019s how we get back to the human shape. Humans are very dangerous here. Oh, you need to stay close to me. Don\u2019t let the demons eat you. \u201d Black Feather laughed softly. The hot air was blown beside Qi Aoshuang\u2019s ear, and he suddenly moved closer to him, ready to kiss Qi Aoshuang\u2019s ear. Qi Aoshuang did not notice Black Feather\u2019s intent. It did not mean that the White Emperor didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>The White Emperor had a cold expression on his face, and his eyes had no ripples. His actions were not vague. With a light flick of his finger, a small bolt of lightning struck black feather\u2019s head. With a snap, the Black Feather was caught off guard by the attack. The dark hair was scorched.</p><br/><p>Black Feather twitched his mouth and prepared to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to attract others?\u201d The White Emperor said coldly.</p><br/><p>Black Feather glanced at the Qi Aoshuang and finally suppressed the rage in his heart. If they met a stronger one from this world, even in their heyday, they could only barely escape. It would be best to leave this place as soon as that annoying Camille said that they should leave after they help Aoshuang get to the core of fire. Thinking up to this point, Black Feather suddenly frowned and asked seriously, \u201cAoshuang, who exactly is Camille?\u201d Qi Aoshuang was stunned. What kind of place was this place? She had seen the strength of the human-shaped White Emperor and Black Feather. But now that they had regained their human form, they were so careful. The creatures in this world were even more powerful? Chaotic world? Why hadn\u2019t she heard it before?</p><br/><p>After hearing Black Feather\u2019s question, the White Emperor turned his head to look at Qi Aoshuang. His eyes also had a serious look. Camille said the Sky Slaughter was the key to the open the Spatial Realm, and it could be used more easily. What was his identity?!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned and said, \u201cI \u2026 I don\u2019t know. At first he was just a scholar, and he surpassed the number one scholar in the imperial city. Later, I knew he was a killer and a very powerful killer. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know all that. \u201cBlack Feather continued to say,\u201d this guy seemed very strong. How unpleasant. \u201d Black Feather rolled his eyes and mumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter we get the core of fire, we will go and ask him.\u201d The White Emperor\u2019s words were concise. \u201d Let\u2019s find the core of fire and return immediately. This place isn\u2019t something that we can stay for long. \u201d The White Emperor frowned slightly. If they were to in full time, it would be better. At present, they were not in their heyday and they were with Aoshuang. If they encountered any problems, they would really be unable to retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat boy made me feel bad.\u201d Black Feather said.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang remained silent. In her mind was the color in Camille\u2019s eyes which changed when she saw his last sight. Camille\u2019s eyes were originally blue, but in the end, one became black, one was red. Was he really just a human?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Aoshuang, go to the valley to the west as soon as possible. Camille said the core of fire should be there. \u201d The White Emperor spoke in a low tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded and was about to take a step forward when a young voice sounded out in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s mind. \u201cMom, Mom!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Golden Lotus?!\u201d Qi Aoshuang stopped his steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this place? Why is it so powerful? Haha, what a great place. I can exchange the form of a person here! \u201d At this moment, the Golden Lotus suddenly woke up. She turned into a beautiful boy in front of Qi Aoshuang and the other two. The young boy was only three to four years old with a jade eyeball, blonde hair and eyebrows. His clothes was also golden which was elegant. Then, he stretched out his hand and grabbed Qi Aoshuang\u2019s shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, hug me.\u201d The little boy grinned, his cherubic smile even more charming.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus?\u201d Qi Aoshuang yelled out tentatively. The voice belonged to Golden Lotus, but the appearance was not like \u2026 The Golden Lotus\u2019s tone seemed at least a teenager. But it was a chubby cute and tender child.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s me. I want to hug you.\u201d Golden Lotus chuckled, stretching out his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little wolf.\u201d In the next moment, the small body of Golden Lotus was picked up by Black Feather, \u201cyou little wolf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! I\u2026 Golden Lotus\u2019s face turned red as she snorted coldly. Before she could even finish her words, a tender voice sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of my husband!\u201d . What? Everyone\u2019s eyes were wide open as they stared at the little girl in white clothes. This little girl looked no more than five years old. She wore a snow-white dress, and her chubby cheeks were full of anger. She looked at Black Feather, her big eyes were full of anger, her red lips curled up. And it\u2019s a very beautiful little kid.</p><br/><p>Hubby? Black Feather looked at the little girl in surprise, who had suddenly appeared. He turned around and looked at the Golden Lotus in his hands. The Golden Lotus just now was still showing off its strength, but now it hung its head and pretended to not exist.</p><br/><p>\u2018Your husband? \u2018 This one? \u201cBlack Feather was so shocked that his mouth opened wide. When did the kids become so precocious. One who knew how to take advantage of the situation, and one was addressing hubby?</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense, my husband is not him, is it you?\u201d The little girl clenched her fist in anger as she raised her hand up.</p><br/><p>Black Feather: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Li Yan?\u201d Qi Aoshuang had seen this little girl before. She was the treasure that had trapped them in the small town of the desert. In the end, she became her treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen Nanny\u2026\u201d Who knew that the little girl would actually bow down to Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>Phew!!! Everyone sprayed out their spittle.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang let out a cold look, and the corner of Black Feather\u2019s mouth twitched nonstop. Even White Emperor, who had a straight face, slightly twitched his mouth.</p><br/><p>I met\u2026 Grandma, \u2026 Oh!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang suddenly felt that her brain was a little suspicious. It seemed like this child should call her master?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scream. I, I haven\u2019t promised to marry you yet.\u201d Golden Lotus raised her head and snapped her claws, blowing cold air.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll marry you.\u201d The girl in white grinned, revealing her snow-white teeth.She was so cute.</p><br/><p>Black Feather let go of his hand. Golden Lotus didn\u2019t even react because she was still in shock and sat down straightly on the ground. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my arse.The little girl went up to knead for Golden Lotus.</p><br/><p>Golden Lotus was frightened as it circled the three of them, and the little girl followed him. One hiding, one chasing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that not only will we be able to recover our human form in this world, so do they.\u201d White Emperor said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Black Feather looked down at the two little kids who were spinning around them, grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m going to run first. I can\u2019t stand her anymore.\u201d After saying that, a golden light flashed and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma, Liu Li will go first. \u201cThe little girl hurriedly stomped her feet as well, and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gulped and looked up at the sky. She couldn\u2019t help exclaiming that this world was really crazy \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s hurry. \u201cWhite Emperor frowned slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded, and the three of them quickly walked west.</p><br/><p>The place they were was a hillside, with half-person tall grass growing on the hillside. The tall grass will swing in the wind. Black Feather walked in front and opened the road. Below the hill was a dense forest, and out of the forest was ranges of mountains while the western valley was their destination.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m curious. Why does Camille know about the core of fire in the west valley?\u201d Black Feather said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, he\u2019s not human,\u201d said White Emperor coldly. No matter what, it seemed like he wouldn\u2019t do harm to Aoshuang at the moment. Let\u2019s find the core of the fire to help Aoshuang and gain a high level of strength. \u201d</p><br/><p>Black Feather was silent as he walked more quickly ahead. Qi Aoshuang walked in the middle while White Emperor followed behind him. The three of them walked down the hill and into the thick woods.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was no killing intent or hidden attackers. The magician inside served the Hill family so he was loyal. It was normal for magicians to make strange sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt broke.\u201d Claire only said two words while looking at the crystal shards scattered on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it broke,\u201d The middle aged man replied, still recovering from his shock.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak another word, and instead, she waited for the man to recover. After a while, the middle aged man finally came to his senses and slowly reached in his robe and grasped for an object. This time he brought out a larger crystal ball and said, \u201cOne more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like before, the crystal ball exploded, and just like before, the middle aged man\u2019s jaw was about to fall off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Claire asked quietly. She understood that magic supplies were valuable and that the crystal balls were not cheap.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no need, Miss.\u201d Shock first filled the middle aged man\u2019s eyes, then ecstasy. He even wanted to accept her as his disciple right away. Magic was always, of course, a magician\u2019s greatest asset, so they wouldn\u2019t teach just anyone. Yet, they don\u2019t wish to take their knowledge to the grave either. A way to transfer this knowledge would be to teach a disciple that they were satisfied with. Because talented candidates were so rare, there were even situations where magicians fought over prodigious disciples. Although the Sunrise Institute taught both Dou Qi and magic, it only taught the basics. At most, you could become a primary magician or primary warrior. If you wanted to go beyond that, you had to find a mentor. Only by becoming the disciple of a mentor could you gain more exquisite schooling. And this young girl was no less talented than the prodigy Lashia \u2013 no, maybe even better!</p><br/><p>Although he really wanted to take her as his disciple, he knew that this was only his own fantasy. Not only did he need her to agree, he also needed Duke Gordan\u2019s approval. He was only a ** mage and not yet qualified to be the mentor of this girl in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, young Miss, please wait.\u201d The middle aged man had calmed down and then remembered he had to report to Duke Gordan first. \u201cMiss, I\u2019ll first teach you how to sense the elements and then how to meditate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about these small specks of light around me?\u201d Claire pointed at the air.</p><br/><p>The middle aged man was astonished. \u201cMiss, you already can Sense the elements?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis book was very detailed. I already finished it last night.\u201d Claire took out the book that taught the basics of magic.</p><br/><p>The middle aged man was shocked speechless. Finished yesterday?! She just started learning magic yesterday? But she could already sense the elements?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen does Miss know the next step?\u201d The middle aged man asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cCapturing the magical elements, and letting them enter the body to store. But it seems very hard. After capturing ten thousand, only one thousand stayed in my body.\u201d Claire said a little bitterly.</p><br/><p>Plop. The middle aged man fell to the floor and stared wordlessly at Claire. Capturing ten thousand and storing one thousand!! And she\u2019s not satisfied? Does she not know that when someone first meditates, it\u2019s not bad to store ten after capturing ten thousand!? Lashia was called a genius because in her first Meditation, she captured ten thousand and stored one hundred. This already shocked many people in the capital. But this girl in front of him performed ten times better! Oh my god, how on Earth!</p><br/><p>A long time passed before the middle aged man was able to crawl up and warn her, \u201cMiss, you must not tell anyone what happened today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Of course Claire understood that the person before her had already thought it over. It seemed like her performance for the test had been over the top. She more than understood a tall tree attracts the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, Miss, I\u2019ll teach you the very basic Primary fire spells. Tell me when you are able to master them.\u201d The middle aged man couldn\u2019t wait to report to the Duke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fireball is the most basic technique. You must direct the elements inside your body to converge to a single point, and then chant the spell to let them erupt.\u201d The middle aged man took pains to be thorough. \u201cBut Miss, you must remember there are no shortcuts in magic. You must take one step at a time and follow the path firmly. No matter how talented you are, wanting immediate results will only be detrimental to yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, thank you teacher.\u201d Claire saw the sincerity clearly in the middle aged man\u2019s eyes. She bowed solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Miss, I don\u2019t have the qualifications to be your teacher.\u201d The middle aged man repeatedly waved his hand no.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou taught me, therefore you are my teacher. Whether you or anyone else admits it or not, as of this moment, you have become my teacher,\u201d Claire sincerely said. \u201cBeing my teacher one day means being my teacher forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words almost moved the middle aged man to tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I don\u2019t qualify as your teacher. With your aptitude, even the most powerful magician of Amparkland wouldn\u2019t be enough. But I, Emery, hereby swear to teach you absolutely everything I know with all my heart.\u201d The magician, Emery, emotionally made this oath. He foresaw that the young girl before him would shine brightly in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, teacher.\u201d Claire bowed solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, you can keep on practicing here, I will go report to the Duke. Remember, you must not tell anyone what happened today,\u201d Emery warned Claire once again. If people knew of this talent, who knew whether it would be a blessing or curse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire promised, nodding.</p><br/><p>When Emery walked out the door, the guard there, Jean was a bit flabbergasted. This dead faced magician never reacted to anything, but today his face was actually red and he seemed very emotional. What is happening?!</p><br/><p>After Emery found Gordan in the military hall and finished his report in secret, Gordan initial reaction was shock.\u201cWhat did you say? Are you sure?\u201d Then, he went happy beyond reason. If Lashia was a genius rarely seen in a hundred years, then Claire was a prodigy rarely seen in a millennium. This is a gift from the heavens to the Hill family! After feeling delighted, Gordan immediately understood why Emery personally came to report this in secret. Because of the Temple of Light! If the Temple of Light found out about Claire\u2019s talent, they would definitely think of every possibly way to recruit her to become one of them. She would then be brainwashed and become loyal to the Temple of Light. The relationship between the Temple of Light and the Royal family was subtle and delicate. The Hill clan absolutely could not let this future power join the Temple of Light. Gordan did not want his own granddaughter to be used against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grace, every word is true.\u201d Emery nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, Emery, you did very well.\u201d Gordan happily patted Emery\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBefore Claire matures, this matter must not be spoken to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Emery nodded.</p><br/><p>Gordan stroked his chin thoughtfully, pondered for a while, and then made a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmery, you may go for now.\u201d Gordan finally came back to his senses and laughed while saying, \u201cI will send men to replace the crystal balls that Claire broke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no, you shouldn\u2019t joke around, your grace.\u201d Emery waved his hand no, embarassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you can go now. Tell Claire to wait for me in my study when I return at night.\u201d Gordan was clearly in a good mood, and patted Emery on the shoulder while laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make sure you get rewarded fairly.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the east side of the capital in a magnificent building, a few people sat around a conference table made of white jade in a long and quiet room. Sitting at the head of the table was a kindly old man dressed in a white robe. Gold embroidery on the edges of the robe indicated that he was a member of the Temple of Light and also of high status too.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow has it been coming along, any new findings??\u201d The old man frowned slightly as he asked a person sitting close by. The person was in a white robe and with a beautiful womanly figure and had soft, straight, green hair that was so long it touched the floor. Her facial features were so fine they could make people gasp in admiration, but her eyes had no irises. Both of her entire eyes were ghostly white. Very strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy holiness, there\u2019s been no progress.\u201d The strange green haired woman shook her head no.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come? You are the most powerful clairvoyant, but you can\u2019t find the person that the deity is looking for?\u201d A person across the table asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not trying, but I can\u2019t seem to read the natal chart of the person.\u201d The strange green haired woman said with bitterness. It was first time her horoscope didn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, stop arguing.\u201d The pope sighed quietly. \u201cThe person that that deity is looking for must be unusual. We only need to send a decree to bring all the noteworthy people in the country here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody agreed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

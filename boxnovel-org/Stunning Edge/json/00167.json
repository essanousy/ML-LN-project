Everyone watched Claire\u2019s movements with rapt attention. Even the emperor watched closely, frowning.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Claire to break the mind control. Just as the pope thought this, someone behind the pope cried out, then starting coughing up blood. He lay convulsing on the ground, the whites of his eyes showing. Clearly, it was a spiritual backlash.</p><br/><p>The resulting cacophony nearly blew off the roof!</p><br/><p>The pope finally could not maintain his expression. She actually was able to break the mind control! Exactly how strong was Claire? How powerful was her spiritual power? Sorcerer? No! Impossible! She was not even fifteen yet, how could she be as powerful as a sorcerer?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth can be plainly seen. The first prince planned on framing the second prince. I\u2019m sure even without me saying this, your highness will surely get to the bottom of this.\u201d Claire eyed the emperor coldly, her every word forceful.</p><br/><p>Met with Claire\u2019s gaze, for some reason, the emperor felt a cold chill run down his spine. Her gaze was so chilling, so frightening!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Katherine rubbed her temples, still subconscious. She looked around with bewilderment. \u201cI feel like I just had a very strange dream. I could not control my actions nor words.\u201d Katherine frowned, piecing together what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, mother. Soon, we can go home.\u201d Claire smiled gently.</p><br/><p>The situation was out of control.</p><br/><p>Everything that happened right before their eyes was simply too shocking. The first prince paled. The situation was heavily not in his favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d The prime minister shouted, attempting to maintain order.</p><br/><p>But the hall could not be constrained. The situation had already reached such a degree, how would it end?</p><br/><p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s strange eyes had been on Claire the whole time. Suddenly, her heart tightened. She closed her eyes and opened them abruptly, then started to tremble.</p><br/><p>Yesterday\u2019s premonition was about this?</p><br/><p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s heart shook, she was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>The pope sensed L\u2019Or\u00e9al was strange. L\u2019Or\u00e9al had never had such a reaction before, there must be something very abnormal occurring.</p><br/><p>\u201cL\u2019Or\u00e9al?\u201d The pope turned to her and said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, if I did not see wrong, that girl will\u2026\u201d L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s voice became lower and lower until in the end, she was using magic to speak so that only the pope could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re sure?!\u201d The pope\u2019s expression was more terrified than ever, his eyes filled with horror.</p><br/><p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al nodded with difficulty, her eyes also filled with terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung highness, the Temple urgent matters to attend to, I must leave now.\u201d The pope stood up hastily and left, not waiting for the emperor to respond. L\u2019Or\u00e9al and the rest followed closely. Liu Xueqing was surprised, not knowing what had happened, but also followed closely. Leng Lingyun gazed at Claire for a while before also leaving.</p><br/><p>So now everyone of the temple had left.</p><br/><p>The crown prince was unusually calm. He looked at Eric, who was lying in his embrace, his eyes serene.</p><br/><p>Everything was lost.</p><br/><p>The highest seat was not meant for him\u2026</p><br/><p>The abrupt departure of the Temple left everyone confused. What exactly happened that would make the people of the Temple leave so hurriedly?</p><br/><p>Were they going to give up on the crown prince so readily?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe decision will be made another day. Court adjourned! Katherine Hill will be released temporarily,\u201d the prime minister announced the emperor\u2019s orders, then left hurriedly. Everything that had happened was completely out of his expectations. No one understood what the Temple\u2019s sudden change in attitude meant.</p><br/><p>The entire hall was in chaos.</p><br/><p>Some were happy. Some were worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, let\u2019s go home.\u201d Claire smiled and held Katherine by the hand, about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Duke Gordan approached them, his expression complex, happy, but also worried. He was happy that they had won the battle and that Claire was powerful to a terrifying degree. He was worried about the consequences of Claire leaving the Temple. Even though Claire was very powerful now, the strength of the Temple was unfathomable.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, you\u2019re so strong. You\u2019re really powerful.\u201d Lashia was still young, so she did not think as much. All she knew was that her sister had just been glorious and successfully saved their mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, thank you\u2026\u201d Roger said, his emotions conflicting.</p><br/><p>Claire smiled faintly. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you, I just did it for mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you, you still\u2026\u201d No one could understand how Katherine felt currently. Claire had left the Temple of Light for her sake. Tears glistened in her eyes. She grabbed Claire\u2019s hand tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk when we return home.\u201d Duke Gordan said quietly.</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded. Indeed, this was place was not suitable to talk in.</p><br/><p>The second prince Nancy and princess Maurice remained where they stood, watching Claire from a distance, they gazes complex, sorrowful, yet joyful. But they could not say a word. They did not have the right to talk to Claire again.</p><br/><p>Everyone made way for the Hill clan to pass through, silent. They all knew that the Hill clan would once again shine brightly. However, quite a few people were worried for the pretty girl. She was originally the venerated priest of the Temple of Light, her prospects bright, but today, she broke ties with the Temple of Light for her family. What would the future bring?</p><br/><p>The main temple of the Temple of Light</p><br/><p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al knelt before a statue of the goddess piously, as quiet as a stone.</p><br/><p>No one was around. The pope and everyone else waited outside. L\u2019Or\u00e9al was currently listening to will of the goddess.</p><br/><p>An ominous feeling arose in Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart, but he did not quite know why.</p><br/><p>After quite some time, there was the faint sound of someone falling in the main altar. Everyone hurriedly rushed in to discover L\u2019Or\u00e9al was lying on the ground, completely exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cL\u2019Or\u00e9al!\u201d The pope called out anxiously. He supported L\u2019Or\u00e9al up.</p><br/><p>L\u2019Or\u00e9al slowly opened her eyes, appearing extremely weary. Every time she listened to the words of the goddess, she would be fatigued. L\u2019Or\u00e9al looked at the pope, about to open her mouth to speak, yet she could not say a word. Instead, she used magic to communicate, her voice soft, yet clear in the pope\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>Kill Claire no matter the cost.</p><br/><p>And destroy her soul!</p><br/><p>After L\u2019Or\u00e9al finished telling the pope this, she closed her eyes tiredly.</p><br/><p>The pope ordered someone to escort L\u2019Or\u00e9al back to her room, then walked to his study, his expression serious. Killing and destroying Claire\u2019s soul would take much preparations due to her unordinary background and strength. Fortunately, at least her master, Cliff, was not in the capital currently and would not return for some time.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun had seen the pope\u2019s serious expression and how tired L\u2019Or\u00e9al appeared. He frowned, wondering what they had said to each other, what the goddess had ordered. Was it related to what occurred today?</p><br/><p>The pope\u2019s later actions left him even more confused, his heart unsettled.</p><br/><p>The cardinal was summoned along with Divine Princess</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing, but the pope did not summon him.</p><br/><p>What occurred in the afternoon left Leng Lingyun even more shocked. The cardinals of all the branch temples throughout the continent had been gathered, all of them with solemn expressions. They had all come using teleportation formations, but they were never used unless for emergencies because each time because they used up too many resources every time they were activated. But all twelve cardinal were now here. What exactly had happened? Was this the orders of the goddess?</p><br/><p>In the hall, Leng Lingyun ran across the pope, who had a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness,\u201d Leng Lingyun called out to the hurriedly leaving pope.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun, I am leaving now for business. You can temporarily watch over the Temple,\u201d the pope said sincerely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour holiness, what is it?\u201d Leng Lingyun did not know why, but his heart had remained feeling unease.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not need to know. I will tell you once everything is settled.\u201d The pope hurriedly left after these words. Of course he would not tell Leng Lingyun. He was well aware of the relationship between Leng Lingyun and Claire. He could not let Leng Lingyun intervene, nor let the Temple lose such a strong support.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun watched the pope\u2019s figure as it disappeared into the distance, frowning deep in thought.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Leng Lingyun heard a soft voice. \u201cLingyun.\u201d His eyes flashed with distaste. It was Liu Xueqing!</p><br/><p>He turned around, ignoring her, about to leave to the back area of the temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun, let\u2019s go see Xuanxuan together. I heard a servant say Xuanxuan was coughing last night.\u201d Liu Xueqing\u2019s voice was full of worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Xuanxuan is fine.\u201d Leng Lingyun continued to face away from Liu Xueqing, passing by her to, going towards the back area.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing wanted to say something, but Leng Lingyun was already far away, evidently not willing to speak with her.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing was left standing all by her lonesome. Watching Leng Lingyun\u2019s disappearing figure, she gritted her teeth. Leng Lingyun treated her this way all because of that slut Claire. If she hadn\u2019t appeared, Xuanxuan would still favor her. Leng Lingyun\u2019s gaze would not have shifted away from her! It was all because of Claire that Leng Lingyun had changed! Humph! That slut had even stolen the spotlight at the trial. But it was still fine, because tonight, the slut would drop from heaven to hell. No only was she going to be killed, her soul was also going to be destroyed!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How could I not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat time, I thought you were stupid.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang finally couldn\u2019t hold back her laughter, \u201cHow could you just be fooled by that single sentence of mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you say.\u201d How well you said it. He thinks that I\u2019m handsome and is captivated by me. \u201d Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s mouth twitched as he looked at Qi Ao Shuang with resentment. \u201cAnd then he cheated my pure heart. He\u2019s too crafty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou deserve it.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled. It had been a long time since she had relaxed like this. Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly felt like she had not laughed like this for a long time. Only Feng Yi Xuan could make her laugh so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, I still like the way you smile.\u201d Feng Yixuan suddenly said these words softly. His eyes were filled with a pained look. The young girl in front of him had always been through so many trials and tribulations, constantly moving forward, walking on the path of thorns. It was as if there was a hand pushing at his back. Wait! A flash of light suddenly flashed through Feng Yixuan\u2019s mind, and his face became abnormally solemn. Camille pushed it? It used to make sense, but now? Behind Karim now was an unknown and even more terrifying force.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d And should you tell me something I don\u2019t know? \u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the uncertain face of Feng Yi Xuan and asked in a puzzled tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Feng Yixuan smiled. He didn\u2019t intend to voice his doubts. Instead, he changed the subject. \u201cDo you know about the bloodline display?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was even more confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Enemy went to Ceylon a long time ago, where he had an affair with a beautiful human woman. Strictly speaking, this woman should be the ancestor of our Feng Clan. \u201cHowever, the child she gave birth to did not possess any special abilities. After a few generations, a handsome, valiant, and peerlessly popular child appeared \u2026\u201d As he spoke, he was interrupted by Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop flattering yourself and continue.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang glanced at Feng Yi Xuan and snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Feng Yixuan chuckled. \u201cYes, that person is me.\u201d Then the Enemy appeared, and he said it was my father, and my reaction was to send him flying with a punch. He was glad, instead, to bring me back to the Devil by force. I only found out after my transformation that I had indeed inherited his bloodline, which was the demon race. As for that little lass, Ladya, she was the one with the pure blood of the Demons. \u201cNaturally, he wouldn\u2019t accept me, but after being beaten by me a few times, he submitted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang listened attentively. In her mind, she imagined the cool appearance of the young master being beaten up by Feng Yi Xuan. What kind of scene would that be? It must have been wonderful. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s guess was correct. It was more than brilliant. At that time, it was truly like the wailing of ghosts and the howling of wolves. It was world-shaking, and anyone who saw it would be overjoyed. The tyrant of the Young Chieftain was infamous in the Devil Realm, but no one dared to touch her. Other than the Infernal King, the others were no match for her. They were often beaten to the point of death, and they even threatened not to go to the Infernal King to complain. Otherwise, the next fight would be even worse. When Feng Yixuan showed up and beat her up, everyone applauded and cheered. At that time the Devil was every day like a festival.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the Infernal King saw that he was glad he was going to pass the throne to me.\u201d Feng Yixuan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a demon king.\u201d I immediately refused. However, at this time, a servant in the Devil world said that I had been cursed. A girl with dark eyes appeared, and everything would be turned upside down. In order to avoid this situation, he threw me back into the human world and washed away all my memories. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurse?\u201d \u201cBlack hair and black eyes?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was stunned, \u201cWhat \u2026 what kind of curse is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My soul was originally red, but there was a trace of black gas in it. In the end, when the Enemy found out about you, he thought you were my nemesis. \u201cIf I want to kill you, I \u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned, his face somewhat gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you promised him that you would never meet me as the Infernal King.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang understood what was going on. She also understood that Feng Yi Xuan appeared in the Demon World to fulfill her wish to protect the Mortal Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh * t, this old man, I\u2019m still not fine.\u201d Feng Yixuan angrily said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you almost died because of me.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face also turned dark, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t Lingyun \u2026\u201d We may really never see each other again. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, speak of it!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s face changed. \u201cHow annoying. I owe that damn human face a favor again. Furthermore, it\u2019s such a huge favor!\u201d It was fine if he owed others, but why did he owe his love rival? How can I endure this? If he asks me to quit, why \u2014! \u2019 Feng Yixuan went berserk, grabbing onto his hair and causing a ruckus.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang could not help but smile. The Feng Yi Xuan in front of him was the real him. He who always had a sorrowful look between his brows simply wasn\u2019t suitable for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t quit!\u201d \u201cThis dead face, I will repay his favor!\u201d Feng Yi Xuan scratched his head and said worriedly, \u201cBut where is he now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t know either.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s smile disappeared from her face as she said solemnly, \u201cActually, I have seen him before \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang told Feng Yi Xuan everything that had happened after she separated from Feng Yi Xuan, causing him to sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe man in white is Leng Lingyun?\u201d And now I don\u2019t know where to go. \u201d Feng Yixuan frowned. \u201cHow are the two of them?\u201d Jin Yan was persistent. This fellow was too loyal to you to actually chase so far away. Is he interested in you, too? \u201cShouldn\u2019t I secretly take him \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang glanced at Feng Yi Xuan with a cold gaze. Feng Yi Xuan immediately shut his mouth and realized that he had said too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is that I don\u2019t know where they are now. \u201cI asked Mishus to help me find them, but only your news told me that there was a rebellion in this world.\u201d \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that they will scatter in the space and time currents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery likely.\u201d Feng Yixuan echoed in a low voice, but in his heart, he was saying: Charge! Charge far away! Don\u2019t come back! Jin Yan was as far away as possible, but it was a dead face. He could just wait for him to return the favor and kick the time and space current away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you now.\u201d Suddenly, Qi Ao Shuang gently turned her head and looked at Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s face, smiling like a flower. Qi Ao Shuang had already made up her mind. However, this decision would have to wait until he found Leng Lingyun. She knew very well that Feng Yixuan was good to her. She had seen all the things Leng Lingyun had done for her.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was dumbfounded. He pursed his lips slightly. \u201cAo Shuang, I \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan you slut pervert, go to hell!\u201d Look at my flying legs! How dare you touch my woman! The sky exploded with a shout and appeared above Feng Yixuan\u2019s head. He raised his leg and was about to kick Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cVast sky, you\u2019re courting death!\u201d He\u2019s one of my father\u2019s candidates. You dare to touch him! \u201d The golden lotus appeared at the right time and grabbed the sky by the tail, lifting the sky upside down to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Lotus, you blind man!\u201d Didn\u2019t you see that I am handsome and extraordinary? \u201cLook at this Feng Yi Xuan. His hair is red like a monkey\u2019s ass, what\u2019s so good about him?\u201d Unconvinced, he roared at the golden lotus.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you, you have four legs and hair all over your body. You also want to touch my mother?\u201d The golden lotuses grabbed the sky with their hands and shook it with all their might, causing the sky to howl.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait, once I transform into a human, I will be invincible.\u201d Long air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it when the time comes.\u201d Maybe my mom had a baby then. You can think about it if she\u2019s a girl. \u201d Jin Lian grabbed the tail of the man in the sky, threw him into the air, carried him on her back, then said to Feng Yi Xuan and Qi Ao Shuang with a smile, \u201cYou two continue, sorry for bothering you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Qi Ao Shuang didn\u2019t regain their senses for a long time. It was only when Golden Lotus\u2019s figure disappeared from their sight that they finally regained their senses. Feng Yixuan giggled. Golden Lotus\u2019s words about being one of the candidates for his father\u2019s position made him extremely happy. Goldlotus had admitted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll go rest first.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang stood up and smiled at Feng Yi Xuan, \u201cYi Xuan, it\u2019s good to have you all the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was stunned for a moment, then he grinned. He stood up and followed behind Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>As Qi Ao Shuang walked in front of him, her vision suddenly blurred. Everything that was originally silver in front of her turned a fiery red color. It was a shocking sight to behold. The fire that filled the sky crazily raged. The sky was fiery red, and the earth was also fiery red.</p><br/><p>Something gleamed softly in the blazing fire. Then, what was it?</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s vision went black, and she fell down just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang!\u201d Feng Yi Xuan, who was walking behind them, was greatly shocked. He hurriedly rushed forward to support Qi Ao Shuang, but she had already lost consciousness and was frowning deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrescent Moon, Moon King!\u201d \u201cGet out of here.\u201d Seeing Qi Ao Shuang like this, Feng Yi Xuan panicked. He picked Qi Ao Shuang up and rushed into the castle, yelling even louder.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d You\u2019re courting death! \u201cYou said you weren\u2019t allowed to call me that!\u201d King Yue\u2019s eyes were misty as he walked out of the side hall and yelled unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, come over and take a look. What\u2019s wrong with Ao Shuang?\u201d Feng Yixuan didn\u2019t care about anything else as he roared at the Moon King.</p><br/><p>Only then did King Yue look at Qi Ao Shuang who was in Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s arms. At this moment, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes were tightly shut. Her brows were furrowed, as if she was enduring some immense pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer body temperature!\u201d It was getting higher and higher! What\u2019s going on? \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s going to burn up!\u201d Feng Yi Xuan anxiously asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cKing Yue, come and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, King Yue woke up from his drunken stupor. His expression turned grave as he walked forward and touched Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s forehead with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan was burning with anxiety.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

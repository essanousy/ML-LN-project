The clothes that were close to her body outlined her beautiful curves.</p><br/><p>The towering chest seemed to be able to grasp onto a slender waist, a round and plump buttocks, and plump and round thighs.</p><br/><p>Every single one of them caused one\u2019s blood to spurt out. The woman could stand there and draw attention to herself. She didn\u2019t need to do anything, didn\u2019t need to say anything.</p><br/><p>The pretty face, so seductive to the bone, was striking. That pair of large, flying phoenix eyes did not deliberately look at anyone, but with a slight glance, everyone felt as if she was trying to discharge her energy towards you.</p><br/><p>The thin little mouth was sexy. People couldn\u2019t help but want to get intimate with him. Beside her were a few other youths who were laughing. They were dressed extravagantly.</p><br/><p>During the daytime, they had to wear their school uniforms, but during the evenings and weekends, the school didn\u2019t have any rules.</p><br/><p>This street had everything. Those who can do business here are not simple people. The Stellar Academy had gathered all of the experts of the chaosworld. How could any ordinary person possibly open a shop here?</p><br/><p>The best restaurant was a restaurant called Star\u2019s Joy, which was said to have been opened by a relative of one of the academy\u2019s elders. Here, people who came in to dine gave the boss some face.</p><br/><p>Here, there was no such thing as an identity. As long as you have money, you can enjoy it. The restaurant on the fifth floor naturally consumed the dishes according to the floor level. The most luxurious place was the fifth floor. The hotel\u2019s decorations were magnificent, and the main hall in the middle was even more magnificent. Countless precious ores were used for lighting and decoration. The big round staircase was spotless and the floor was shiny. The sofas in the hall were upholstered in soft velvet. This place was indeed not a place that ordinary people could come to.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of the waiter, Xiao Ao Shuang and Wynes headed to the fifth floor and asked for a private room. After all, it was the first time he came to such a luxurious place.</p><br/><p>The waiter courteously walked in front. After reaching the fifth floor, he politely asked, \u201cMay I ask which private room you two would like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied plainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis way, please.\u201d The waiter smiled and sat in an inviting position, about to lead them inside.</p><br/><p>However, when Xiao Ao Shuang followed him, she suddenly realized that Wynes was not following after her. She turned around and saw Wynes standing there in a daze, staring down below.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang stopped in confusion. She looked down Wynes\u2019 eyes and saw a lady slowly walking up the stairs like a crowd of stars embracing the moon. That woman was so beautiful that it made people sigh in admiration. As for his stature, it was even better, even more exaggerated.</p><br/><p>The woman wore a dark red tight-fitting dress. The clothes that were close to her body outlined her beautiful curves. The towering chest seemed to be able to grasp onto a slender waist, a round and plump buttocks, and plump and round thighs. Every single one of them caused one\u2019s blood to spurt out. The woman could stand there and draw attention to herself. She didn\u2019t need to do anything, didn\u2019t need to say anything. The pretty face, so seductive to the bone, was striking.

The thin little mouth was sexy. People couldn\u2019t help but want to get intimate with him. Beside her were a few other youths who were laughing. They were dressed extravagantly. During the daytime, they had to wear their school uniforms, but during the evenings and weekends, the school didn\u2019t have any rules.</p><br/><p>A few well-dressed youngsters surrounded the young girl like they were stars that surrounded the moon as they walked towards the fifth floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cYou know him?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the sexy lady, then at Wynes, who was still lost in thought.</p><br/><p>Wynes didn\u2019t seem to hear what Qi Ao Shuang said and continued staring at the sexy and pretty girl.</p><br/><p>The girl seemed to sense Wynes\u2019 gaze. When she saw that Wynes was wearing an unremarkable school uniform with no fancy accessories, her eyes flashed with ridicule and disdain. She then shifted her gaze away.</p><br/><p>Wynes came back to his senses, rubbing his nose embarrassedly before turning to Qi Aushuang and saying, \u201cQi Aushuang, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that man?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang and Wynes turned around and left. Qi Ao Shuang asked them on the way.</p><br/><p>Wynes, on the other hand, had a self-mocking smile on his face as he said in a low voice, \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d I know her, but she doesn\u2019t know me. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the school beauties of the academy, Bethany.\u201d When Wynes said this, a hint of emotion flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ah? Bethany? Wasn\u2019t he the one who nearly made him become Dou\u2019e\u2019s second generation? Qi Ao Shuang was stunned. She sighed in her heart as she recalled the appearance and figure of the woman from before. [It\u2019s a rare thing in this world!] For such a woman, her existence was a dazzling halo. Ashlin was really poisonous. The flower protectors by Bethany\u2019s side seemed to be a bunch of brainless fans. If they really did start a fight, he would definitely find it hard to argue with them. Thinking of this, Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes became cold. Ashlin, don\u2019t try to provoke yourself any more. If there had been one, it wouldn\u2019t have been a tooth loss.</p><br/><p>In the private room, Qi Ao Shuang ordered some dishes and then ordered some sweet wine. After returning the menu to the waiter, he turned around to find that Wynes was still in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWynes, you don\u2019t like Bethany, do you?\u201d Suddenly, Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s words startled Wynes so much that he almost jumped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you, don\u2019t talk nonsense, I, I don\u2019t have it.\u201d Wynes waved his hands, but his face was red.</p><br/><p>It was self-confessed without fighting!</p><br/><p>The corner of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mouth twitched, she never thought that this thin and weak silent fella would actually like hot and sexy women like that, she really couldn\u2019t tell. Wynes was such a sullen man. Heavy tastes, heavy tastes ~ ~</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d She was the daughter of the Jade City\u2019s City Governor. \u201cI, I don\u2019t even dare to think about it.\u201d When Wynes said this, there was a flash of unreadable sadness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTch!\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Wynes with disdain. This fellow, although he said he did not dare to think about it, he had actually thought about it countless times. Otherwise, he would have been looking and looking.</p><br/><p>Wynes saw the look of disdain on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face. He let out a long sigh and tried to explain something, but nothing came out.</p><br/><p>After a while, the door was gently knocked on, and exquisite dishes began to be served.</p><br/><p>One of the dishes, Brightmoon Heart, was a small red dot in the middle of a snow-white circle. The style was simple, but the taste was not bad. While Xiao Ao Shuang was tasting the dish, Wynes saw that the dish called Brightmoon Heart did not move at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dish\u2026\u201d Wynes looked at the dish, but could not bring himself to finish. He just stared at the dish in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d Hsiao Hsuo \u2013 shuang sensed the strangeness of Wynes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dish reminds me of when I was young.\u201d I liked a kind of pastry when I was a kid, that\u2019s all. \u201cWhite, red in the middle.\u201d Wynes smiled embarrassedly and said softly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned. Wynes once mentioned his ancestry. He was an illegitimate child. In this world, illegitimate children are despised. The pastry, I\u2019m afraid, was a rare memory of Wynes\u2019s youth.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang paused for a moment before turning around and ordering the waiter to serve some more of this dish. Since the ingredients had to be fresh, there were only five more dishes left. The waiter then turned around to explain.</p><br/><p>Wynes waved his hand hastily, \u201cDon\u2019t waste it, Qi Ao Shuang. Thank you for your kind intentions.\u201d \u201cBut there\u2019s no need to waste it like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can pack it back.\u201d However, Qi Ao Shuang replied with a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Wynes smiled bitterly and continued to nag at the dish, but his eyes did not leave it. His eyes gradually became gentle, as if he could see into the distant past through that dish. Qi Ao Shuang did not disturb him, but continued eating silently.</p><br/><p>At this time, there was a ruckus outside the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come there\u2019s no more of this dish, Brightmoon Heart?\u201d \u201cHow do you do business in a restaurant like this?\u201d The voice outside the door seemed annoyed.</p><br/><p>Then came the voice of the waiter apologizing and explaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would be so annoying to actually light up the remaining Brightmoon.\u201d How do you do business? \u201cDon\u2019t you know that Miss Bethany always comes to order this dish?\u201d The furious voice was not suppressed by the waiter\u2019s explanation. Instead, it asked in an even more furious tone.</p><br/><p>His voice travelled to the private room where Xiao Ao Shuang and the rest were. When Wynes heard these words, his body trembled. He raised his head and looked outside. His lips trembled slightly, but he could not say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang thought in her heart, this Wynes is not normal for one night. He hasn\u2019t been normal since that Bethany showed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho ordered it?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s negotiate and make way.\u201d The other voice was also a little angry, but it was not as irritable as the previous one.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the waiter had pointed out the location of the private room, and soon, footsteps could be heard coming from that direction. There was a knock at the half-open door, and Wynes almost jumped.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, have the two of you finished counting the hearts of Mingyue?\u201d The youth that stood at the door lightly pushed it open and asked politely.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded and said lightly: \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, can you two give us a share?\u201d I am very grateful. My friend was very fond of that dish. \u201d Although the youth was dressed extravagantly, he didn\u2019t use money to oppress others. He could tell that even though Qi Ao Shuang was wearing a school uniform, the noble aura radiating from her was not something that ordinary commoners could possess. Moreover, the two purple earrings on his ears shone with an extraordinary luster. It was obvious that they were not ordinary. This kind of person wouldn\u2019t be short on money. If he used money to pressure others, it would only be counterproductive. On the other hand, there was a thin and weak looking person who looked like a commoner. I don\u2019t know how these two very different people got together.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang frowned slightly, but before she could say anything, Wynes stood up and said excitedly, \u201cYes, is it because Bethany likes this dish?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngster at the door gave Wynes a dissatisfied look, then let out a cold snort. \u201cIt\u2019s because Miss Bethany likes it.\u201d He looked at Wynes with disdain and annoyance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, then let\u2019s have one.\u201d Wynes seemed to realize his mistake and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d The corner of the youth\u2019s mouth curved into a mocking smile. He turned around and was about to leave, but then muttered in a low voice, \u201cA toad wants to eat swan meat, why don\u2019t you look at your own character?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not loud, but Wynes heard it. Wynes\u2019 face turned pale. His eyes dimmed. He bit his lips and couldn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>Just as the youth was about to leave, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s cold voice came from behind him, \u201cWait!\u201d Who said I agreed to transfer it to you? \u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, the expression of Wynes and the young man at the door changed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

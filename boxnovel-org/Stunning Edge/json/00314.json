Her eyelashes that were like small brushes were trembling slightly. At this moment, she saw a strange scene.</p><br/><p>The flames in the sky were so hot that it was almost impossible to breathe. The flames were like the flames of hell, sweeping through everything. Everywhere he went, everything vanished into thin air. It was a type of anger that overflowed into the heavens. What had caused such anger? Whose anger was this?</p><br/><p>Something very important has been lost, what is it.</p><br/><p>An indescribable sadness slowly filled Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s heart. Losing something important, what is it? His heart was empty, sorrowful, angry \u2026</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stared blankly at Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face. The corners of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes began to slowly leak out crystalline tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d What do you see? \u201cWake up, I will be by your side, I will always be by your side.\u201d Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s heart ached so much that he tightly gripped Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand. It was as if he could feel the indescribable sadness. Just what did Xiao Aushuang see that would make her act like this?</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stayed by the bed, holding Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand and maintaining this posture for the rest of the night.</p><br/><p>In the early morning, Qi Ao Shuang finally opened her eyes, her hands gently moving. Feng Yi Xuan immediately felt it and hurriedly raised his head to look at Qi Ao Shuang. He slowly turned his head to look at the worried Feng Yi Xuan and gently opened his mouth. \u201cYi Xuan, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d His tone was filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, it\u2019s good as long as you\u2019re awake.\u201d Feng Yixuan finally breathed a sigh of relief. Then, after a moment of hesitation, he asked softly, \u201cYou, don\u2019t you remember what happened before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s face changed slightly. After thinking for a moment, he told Qi Ao Shuang everything that had happened yesterday.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Xiao Ao Shuang was also stunned. He then furrowed his brows, deep in thought. Did his actions earlier have anything to do with what he had just seen? Or was it related to him?</p><br/><p>Seeing Qi Ao Shuang like this, Feng Yi Xuan was a little worried. He tried to console her, \u201cAo Shuang, don\u2019t think about it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. No matter what, I will stay by your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang turned to look at Feng Yi Xuan and revealed a smile, \u201cYes, Yi Xuan, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still feel any discomfort?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it feels good.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. You rest first, I\u2019ll go prepare breakfast for you. What do you want to eat?\u201d Feng Yixuan also smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoast meat.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang pursed her lips into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating so greasy in the early morning?\u201d Although Feng Yixuan said so, he didn\u2019t have any intention of objecting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to eat it. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve eaten your roast meat.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan revealed a knowing smile. His eyes were light with satisfaction. He stood up, turned around, and left to prepare breakfast. Xiao Ao Shuang slowly sat up, looking out the window in silence.</p><br/><p>This space, without night or day, was always shrouded in a silvery white light. The title of \u2018Moon King\u2019 probably had something to do with this. Qi Ao Shuang slowly got off the bed and walked to the window, gazing at the calm lake in the distance. Lightly closing her eyes, Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows. She didn\u2019t feel wrong, there were indeed changes in her body. In the depths of his soul, there seemed to be a force that was slowly gushing out. Although it was very subtle, it actually existed. Like a seed, but also like a small whirlpool. at an abnormally slow rate. What was that?</p><br/><p>No matter what it was, one thing was certain, it had something to do with what had happened and what he had seen.</p><br/><p>Leaning lightly on the windowsill, Qi Aoshuang\u2019s thoughts flew far away. She remembered things from a long, long time ago, things from before she came to this world. At that time, he was still living in a bustling place, a society filled with impetuous people. He had nothing to live for, and after he easily ended his life, he saw a suspicious fatty. Could this be the so-called Daoist Immortals? He would never have believed such a ridiculous thing. However, after coming to this world, he realized that there were many things that people did not know about the existence of real things, including gods. In that case, in the world he had lived in before, there must also be a God. Otherwise, why are there so many phenomena that science cannot explain today?</p><br/><p>Forget it, forget it. It\u2019s over. Leng Lingyun, Camil, Jin Yan \u2026 When can we find them?</p><br/><p>At this time, there was a knock on the door, interrupting Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s train of thoughts. Qi Ao Shuang turned her head and said, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened and Feng Yixuan walked in front. In his hands was a huge plate with roast meat, fruits, bread and scented tea. Behind them were King Yue and Mishus. They no longer looked as dizzy as they had last night, but had serious expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoon King, Mishus?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat first. We\u2019ll talk while we eat.\u201d King Yue said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan placed the plate on the table, picked up a knife and fork, and began cutting the roast meat into slices for Qi Ao Shuang. He picked it up and placed it in the bread before handing it over to Qi Ao Shuang. Qi Ao Shuang took the meat and smiled at Feng Yi Xuan. Feng Yi Xuan grinned foolishly and forgot to cut the roast meat for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, do you feel any discomfort in your body?\u201d King Yue asked with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang took a bite of the bread and shook her head.</p><br/><p>Moon King and Mishus looked at each other, doubt in their eyes. Could it be that Qi Ao Shuang is not the future White King?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan asked after seeing the strange expressions on the two\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, we\u2019re just a little suspicious of the possibility that Qi Ao Shuang might be the future White King.\u201d Mezus\u2019s face was serious, too.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Feng Yi Xuan opened his mouth wide and then turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang said lightly: \u201cWhat basis do you have to say that?\u201d For some reason, Qi Ao Shuang had a feeling that she was definitely not the \u2018White King\u2019 they spoke of.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any proof. We\u2019re just guessing, guessing from the strange phenomenon that happened to you yesterday.\u201d King Yue explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will definitely not be the White King you all speak of.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so sure?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure,\u201d he said. What if you are the White King?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason. I just feel it.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang took a sip of her flowery tea and said, \u201cYou guys should have something to say after coming here, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>King Yue\u2019s eyebrows rose, and then he said in a deep voice, \u201cWe are preparing to leave. We will go find the other kings and reunite with them to undo the Shura\u2019s seal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to stay here or go with us and ask for your advice?\u201d It must have been dangerous on the way. The Heavenly King\u2019s men should be searching for us everywhere. \u201d Mishus said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even defeat the Heavenly King\u2019s subordinates?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked at the two with disdain in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them said at the same time with flushed faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s dangerous?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang pouted, \u201cThen let\u2019s get on the road.\u201d Besides, I have to find my lost friends. \u201d</p><br/><p>Moon King and Mishus looked at each other and nodded, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, if you don\u2019t feel any discomfort, then we\u2019ll set off after lunch and rest.\u201d But one thing they didn\u2019t say. They were the four generals next to the previous Heavenly King, and their strength was no less than theirs. As for whether or not these four generals had joined the current Heavenly King after the death of the previous Heavenly King, they did not know either. If the four generals were to submit to the current King, then the matter would be very troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Qi Ao Shuang agreed. She looked at the Moon King and Mishus and smiled, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after Moon King and Misius left did Feng Yixuan speak. \u201cAo Shuang, what do you think happened to Camil?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess there are only two people who can make Camille in such a sorry state. No, maybe only one.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang narrowed her eyes, biting the fork in her hands as she said, \u201cBecause there is still one more who is sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean the Father God and the Mother God?!\u201d No, a god? This was because the Goddess had been in a deep slumber the entire time. Feng Yixuan was shocked. He was unaware that the roast meat on his fork had fallen onto his plate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang jabbed a fruit with her fork, frowning, and said: \u201cCamil seems to be omnipotent. In my impression, this fellow\u2019s power has exceeded everything I know.\u201d \u201cOnly the Father would have the power to deal with him.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s tone gradually became worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, why would Father want to deal with Camil?\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s face sank as he asked with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the question!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang bit down on the fruit and stared at Feng Yi Xuan. Her eyes became sharper and sharper. Her eyebrows were knitted tighter and tighter. Even Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s heart was in his throat.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Ao Shuang swallowed the fruit and answered straightforwardly, \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi Xuan instantly let out a sigh. He was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, about the Star Academy.\u201d Xiao Aushuang continued eating the fruits and taunting him, \u201cI\u2019m starting to suspect that it was some king in this world who did it. After hearing about the White King, I suspect that it was the White King who did it.\u201d \u201cPerhaps the White King will absorb the power of those people to strengthen himself, and then overthrow the Heavenly King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable explanation. Now that you put it like that, I also think it was King Bai who did it.\u201d Feng Yixuan agreed and nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I always feel that things aren\u2019t so simple.\u201d Xiao Aushuang shook her head, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why.\u201d \u201cOnly when we see the previous King White will we know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Feng Yixuan nodded, but he frowned as he began to think.</p><br/><p>After eating breakfast, the group of four departed. They were once again in the vast desert, surrounded by the yellow sand that filled the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going next?\u201d Feng Yixuan frowned as he looked at the raging sand.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo find King Yong.\u201d Just as King Yue finished speaking, his expression abruptly changed because he felt that there was something wrong with his surroundings. Mezus\u2019s face changed as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to look for him, because we will immediately send you to meet him.\u201d A rough voice filled with a wild laughter suddenly sounded beside the four\u2019s ears.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

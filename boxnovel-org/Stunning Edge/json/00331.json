Qi Ao Shuang was stunned, her consciousness clearing up a little at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike fire?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d There was a hint of surprise in Qinghua\u2019s cold voice. However, there was some hesitation in Yi Xuan\u2019s angry eyes. \u201cYou, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. He looked up at Qing Hua with bloodshot eyes. Gritting his teeth, he enunciated each word clearly, \u201cI said, tell you to stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qinghua\u2019s face turned cold, her eyes narrowed, and she said solemnly: \u201cYou have recovered your memory, but you still want me to stop?\u201d Are you and Ru Bing the same? \u201cThey all care so much about that substitute?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a substitute. She\u2019s her. \u201cShe\u2019s Ao Shuang, no one can take her place, and she\u2019s not your replacement!\u201d Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s body slowly began to move with difficulty. He slowly walked toward the blue and white flower. With an exceptionally firm voice, he said, \u201cI love her. Do you understand?\u201d \u201cI love Ao Shuang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d You can only love me, you are all mine! \u201d Qing Hua shouted in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what love is. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had possession, just possession.\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s voice was low and deep, but there was an irresistible magic to it. \u201cLike fire!\u201d What nonsense are you talking about! \u201cI love you all, don\u2019t you understand that I love you all so much that I would burn all living things to ashes if you disappeared!\u201d Azureflower retorted angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, love is the only thing. What you have for us is not love, we exist only as an object for you. You only possess us, and we do not love you. It\u2019s just a respect for the master. \u201d Feng Yixuan slowly said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you understand why we disappeared back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Hua was stunned as she stared blankly at Feng Yi Xuan.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Luckily, even though Feng Yixuan had recovered some of his memories, he still hadn\u2019t changed his mind. However, Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart sank again. What would Feng Yixuan do when he said those words and objected to her? What would her personality do \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not love at all. I, don\u2019t love you, I love the frost. Her strength, her frailty, her smile, all of it touched my heart, and she was the only one in it. No one can replace her. \u201d Feng Yixuan clenched his fists and said coldly, \u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to stop. Return her to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not love. You said that I don\u2019t love you all \u2026\u201d Qinghua muttered to herself first. Suddenly, her face changed. She looked at Feng Yi Xuan and sneered. \u201cReturn it to you?\u201d Haha, return it to you? Do you think I\u2019ll let her live again? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn it to me!\u201d Feng Yixuan was in a hurry to attack her heart. He raised his hand and released a blazing flame towards the blue and white flower.</p><br/><p>Qinghua was stunned. She didn\u2019t even dodge, instead standing there blankly, accepting this wave of attacks from Feng Yixuan. The ball of fiery flames hit onto Qing Hua\u2019s body, but didn\u2019t cause any damage. However, Qing Hua stared blankly at the enraged Feng Yi Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually attacked me?\u201d Qinghua stared at Feng Yixuan in a daze, her eyes filled with shock and disbelief. She mumbled, \u201cYou actually dared to attack me for her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s heart sank as she sensed that something was wrong with Qinghua\u2019s emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha-ha ha-ha ha\u2026\u201d \u201cYou actually attacked me for a substitute!\u201d After laughing, he suddenly looked at Feng Yixuan, and his eyes revealed a vicious glint. With pain and anger, he shouted in a stern voice, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then die! Go accompany her!\u201d Die together! It would disappear forever! Go to hell! \u201cGo to hell!\u201d Blue Flower\u2019s face turned malevolent. Both of his hands that had gone out of control were clasped in front of his chest. He released countless sharp ice cones, and they were sharp as they shot towards Feng Yi Xuan.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan drew a circle in the air with his right hand, then a huge round flame shield appeared in the air. Feng Yixuan abruptly pushed the round flame shield forward. The ice awl collided with the round flame shield, and after a series of ear-piercing sizzling sounds, the sharp ice awl pierced through Feng Yixuan\u2019s body without any suspense. Blood gushed out and instantly dyed Feng Yixuan\u2019s clothes red. Blood seeped out of the corner of Feng Yixuan\u2019s mouth, but he did not care about that. Instead, he revealed a smile of relief.</p><br/><p>Blueflower was first startled, her eyes flashing with an unbearable light. She opened her mouth to say something, but what Feng Yixuan said next made her even more angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, but dying is better than staying by your side.\u201d In a sense, I\u2019ll be in the same world as her. \u201d Feng Yi Xuan sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike fire!\u201d It\u2019s not as simple as dying. I will make you and her completely disappear! \u201cCompletely and utterly gone!\u201d The rage of the azure flower was unstoppable like the eruption of a volcano. \u201cThis \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun was shocked and wanted to stop him, but her throat felt like it was being strangled, and she couldn\u2019t utter a single word. \u201cThis \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026 this is \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s face was filled with a mocking sneer. Deep within his eyes was a deep sadness. Ao Shuang, has Ao Shuang disappeared just like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d The cyan flower was infuriated, her entire body was emitting a bone-piercing cold air, and the cold air quickly spread out with her as the center, and then it quickly materialized with a naked eye, completely condensing into the skating ice cones that covered the sky and earth. The crashing sound of the ground exploding could be heard as the ground froze, and countless ice cones shot up into the sky. The surrounding flowers were instantly frozen and withered. The air in the entire world seemed as if it was frozen. It was bone-chilling cold. These attacks circled around Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop \u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun struggled to say the two words. He knew that she had already lost control of herself. If this continued, not only would they be killed, even the entire world would be destroyed. The only ones he could avoid were her and him.</p><br/><p>At this time, how could Qing Hua still listen to Leng Lingyun\u2019s words? She frantically unleashed her power. A deep sense of betrayal almost completely engulfed her mind, and it was like a heart wrenching pain. The thought in her heart crazily occupied her thoughts. It was that her fiery temper had betrayed her, completely and utterly betrayed her.</p><br/><p>Behind them, the magnificent palace began to shake as well. Soon, the god father came running out with the female god in his arms. With a darkened face, he yelled at Qing Hua, \u201cStop right there! This is not a place for you to behave atrociously.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, how could the blue and white flowers still listen? The cold aura surrounding their bodies grew even more intense, rapidly spreading out and solidifying the surrounding air.</p><br/><p>His father extended his hand and released a streak of white light, attacking the blue and white flowers. However, the white light completely dissipated before it could even approach the body of the blue and white flowers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless\u2026\u201d A look of despair slowly appeared in Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes. There was no one here who could be her match in rage. At this moment, the world and everyone in it would be completely destroyed.</p><br/><p>The god frowned and looked down at the pale face of the goddess in his arms, but did not move away. If she left this place with the Goddess, the Goddess might not even be able to hold on for a moment.</p><br/><p>Was he really going to die here today? Thinking up to here, his father reached out his hand to gently touch the Mother God\u2019s face. At this moment, his heart calmed down instead. Holding the Mother God, he slowly sat down on the palace steps and looked at the scene before him indifferently. He had set up an Astral Academy in the chaosworld, and had his subordinates search for those who possessed almost pure energy in order to absorb their energy and maintain it for the Goddess. Now, it seemed as though he didn\u2019t need to worry about anything at all. It might be a good thing to disappear with her, and it might be better to be free.</p><br/><p>The god slowly closed his eyes and hugged the person in his arms tighter. His heart was calm as he waited for death.</p><br/><p>Her lips were black, and she felt as if her blood was frozen. The others also felt the same way. Jonathan\u2019s body was stiff from the cold as he looked at Dittos in front of him, trembling. Dittos tried to free himself from these, but it was useless. Just when everyone was almost unable to hold on any longer, the situation suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou broke our agreement \u2026</p><br/><p>Just when the surrounding people had reached midnight, a soft voice with a hint of anger suddenly sounded.</p><br/><p>This voice was something that everyone was familiar with.</p><br/><p>It was Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang?!\u201d Feng Yixuan exclaimed in a low tone of joy. He widened his eyes to look at the blue and white flowers in front of him, but he still couldn\u2019t see Ao Shuang\u2019s figure. He couldn\u2019t help but ask in panic, \u201cAo Shuang, you, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn woman!\u201d Go to hell! \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, things wouldn\u2019t have progressed to this stage!\u201d The cyan flower roared in rage, extending its hand and patting its chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who broke the agreement was you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s soft voice sounded faintly, and in the next instant, a scorching heat burst out from her body. The surrounding snow and ice melted in an instant, and the bone-piercing feeling vanished in an instant. Everyone was free to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, when did you have such power?\u201d Qinghua looked at the scene in front of her with both shock and anger, and asked subconsciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice was soft and low \u2026</p><br/><p>Slowly, a pained expression appeared on Qing Hua\u2019s face. She hugged her head with all her might as she cried out in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Jin Yan, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Lily anxiously approached Jin Yan as she asked in a terrified voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, it seems like she\u2019s going to leave her body.\u201d Jin Yan was extremely nervous as he watched the reaction of Qing Hua without taking his eyes off her. He hoped that his guess was correct, and that it would succeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The blue and white flower faced the sky and issued a long and agonizing cry.</p><br/><p>The next moment, under everyone\u2019s astonished and delighted gazes, Qi Ao Shuang appeared once again. She stood silently in front of Qing Hua, looking at her coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, I never thought that you could be this strong.\u201d A mocking sneer appeared on Qing Hua\u2019s face. After stabilizing her body, she looked at Qi Ao Shuang with disdain. Even though Qi Ao Shuang was strong to this extent, she still wouldn\u2019t place her in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Even though I can\u2019t defeat you right now, I can still do it by heavily injuring you and sending you back to the former world.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled faintly, speaking slowly in her heart, even at the cost of sacrificing my life.</p><br/><p>Qinghua\u2019s face darkened, and she said coldly: \u201cWith just you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, just me.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said in a soft voice, but there was a hint of resolution in her tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, stop.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no point in continuing like this.\u201d At this time, Leng Lingyun spoke softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou love this woman, too, don\u2019t you, like ice?\u201d Qing Hua turned her head to look at Leng Lingyun\u2019s face. A tyrannical glint gradually appeared in her eyes, widening \u2026</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun did not say anything. She remained silent, but she had already tacitly accepted.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, very good, hahahaha, very good!\u201d You\u2019ve all betrayed me! Today, I will let you know the fate of those who betrayed me! \u201cI will grind your bones and scatter your ashes!\u201d The beautiful face of Qing Hua gradually became distorted and sinister. She laughed out loud in despair and rage as she vented the emotions in her heart. Her world seemed to collapse at this moment.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s heart sank when they saw how crazy Qing Hua was. The auras surrounding her all started to become chaotic, and gradually, they all started to go crazy. Everyone understood that what Qinghua said earlier was not a joke.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face turned solemn, instantly raising all her power to the max. She knew that this strike would determine everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any of you anymore. All of you, go die!\u201d Qing Hua roared in rage, raising her hands up high as she frantically gathered all her power into her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, don\u2019t!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s face was so gloomy that it seemed as if water would drip out of it. Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart sank to the bottom.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

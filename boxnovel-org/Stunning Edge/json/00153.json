The one who fought on behalf of the Li clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bren froze. Clei? Claire! That young man wasn\u2019t a young man, but a young woman! Now everything made sense. No wonder a fourth grade magic beast would cower before her. The memory of Claire defeating Hua Yilin was still fresh in his memory. Only fourteen years old, yet already so powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you can go. Claire won\u2019t take it to heart. To her, it was as easy as lifting her hand. You don\u2019t need to stress over it.\u201d An Lisha knew that this subordinate of hers always took things seriously and was probably in the middle of fretting over how to repay Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Madam An.\u201d Bren\u2019s heart shook. He bid farewell and then withdrew.</p><br/><p>When Bren returned home, he saw his son conversing happily with his two daughters. When they saw him, they stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Carter greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarter, how are you home?\u201d Bren was surprised to suddenly see his son return. If he remembered correctly, his son\u2019s break still hadn\u2019t arrived yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI returned for some business. Home happened to be along the way.\u201d Carter\u2019s handsome face smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so.\u201d Bren gazed at his son with content. Carter had become more mature. Although Carter, having joined the Hidden Sect, was unable to become an official, if something happened to his family, he would definitely return to help. \u201cYour strength must have increased quite a bit again.\u201d Bren smiled and patted his son\u2019s shoulder. Suddenly, a strange thought appeared in his mind. Between his talented son and Claire, who would come out on top? Both were fire attributed magicians.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany people are stronger than me still. I must continue to work hard.\u201d Carter\u2019s expression sharpened. \u201cFather, I heard on your way back, you were in danger, but you were saved by a young man?\u201d Jessica and Mayla had already informed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, not a young man, but a young woman.\u201d Bren laughed. \u201cIt was the one who defeated Hua Yilin, Claire Hill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Carter was confused. He had never heard her name before.</p><br/><p>However, Jessica and Mayla started exclaiming delightfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, is that true? It was really her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was really her? Father, how could she be here? What a pity, I didn\u2019t even get to speak to her!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fierce battle that day had left a deep impression in the two girls. That girl had stunned everyone present that day.</p><br/><p>Carter was a bit confused seeing how excited his little sisters were. He had never seen them idolize someone else besides him so much before.</p><br/><p>\u201cCarter, I still have a memory crystal recording of that battle. You should take a look. Perhaps it will help your cultivation. She is also a fire attributed magician. However, her flame is golden.\u201d Bren was unaware of the lasting impact his actions would have.</p><br/><p>Once Carter finished watching the memory crystal, his expression became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, can you give me this memory crystal?\u201d Carter\u2019s gaze had not left the girl in the magic crystal. He continuously infused magic, replaying the recording over and over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, take it.\u201d Bren completely understood why his son requested this. Although his son was very affectionate towards his family members, he was in actuality very arrogant, looking down on everyone. The originally undefeatable Hua Yilin secretly battled with Carter in the past. No one knew what the results were, however Hua Yilin never appeared before Carter again. Later on, Carter was selected by the Hidden Sect and from then on, started on his path of cultivation.</p><br/><p>Carter put away the crystal and stood up. \u201cFather, I must go now. I have very serious business this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bren nodded. He understood the ways of the the Hidden Sect. \u201cGo. Be careful now, take care of yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Carter\u2019s heart was unable to calm down. The girl in the memory crystal was so entrancing, so stunning he felt his soul shake. The moment her lotuses blossomed, it felt as if time had stopped. Golden colored flames, what kinds of flames were those? Carter\u2019s heart throbbed. His hands clenched into fists, loosened, then clenched tightly again.</p><br/><p>He wanted to meet her and have a match!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Claire had already reached the mysterious island. What she saw made her shocked, but she did not see Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>The small cabin from before was missing. The entire island was in disarray. Wood chunks were scattered everywhere. The beds, dishes, tables and the like were all over the place. It looked as is the island had gone through a natural disaster.</p><br/><p>Currently, the old man, senior Astral Feng, had his back facing her, hammering away. His hair was like a chicken\u2019s nest. Was this how a powerful expert was supposed to look like?</p><br/><p>The old man cursed under his breath. \u201cThat damn brat, he dared to wreck my place like this? Watch it kid, I better give you a lesson for your own good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s lip twitched.</p><br/><p>This mess was created by Feng Yixuan?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Astral Feng\u2026\u201d Claire called out weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The old man whipped his head around. From his expression, you could plainly see he was not in a good mood and that bothering him was a bad idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Claire glanced around at the carnage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? That damn brat broke through the ninth level and leveled this place to the ground.\u201d The old man waved his hammer in the air angrily, seething.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Claire eyed the half crazed old man. Why was it that although he was throwing a fit, he seemed a little happy?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, so I kicked him into the Land of Rebirth*. There, powerful people are aplenty. I\u2019ll be damned if they don\u2019t beat him half to death.\u201d The old man laughed heartily, his hands at his hips.</p><br/><p>*Literal means \u201crefine with fire space\u201d. Anyone have any better ideas, comment down below, I\u2019m at a loss T_T</p><br/><p>\u201cLand of Rebirth? What kind of place is that?\u201d It was the first time she had heard of it before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a very dangerous place, dangerous yet also enticing. It is also a good place to cultivate. I and Si Konglin, that old fox, met there. There, it is a survival of the fittest.\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes closed, as if he were reminiscing about the past.</p><br/><p>Such a place existed? How come she had never heard of it before?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have I never heard or read about it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, little girl, of course you wouldn\u2019t know. You cannot enter that world without reaching a certain level of strength. That world is completely different from this one. Everything is based on strength and power.\u201d The old man sat down. He set aside the hammer and looked at Claire. \u201cLittle girl, what did you come here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I have been thoroughly stuck at the eighth level of the Treasured Lotus Style, so I came here to ask for senior\u2019s advice\u2026\u201d Claire bit her lip, revealing her true goal.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know the fastest way to become strong?\u201d The old man\u2019s expression sharpened.</p><br/><p>Claire remained silent. She stared at the senior.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fastest way is to continuously fight against people even stronger than you. Only on the brink of death can you trigger your true potential,\u201d the old man said simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you die,\u201d the old man said plainly, as if it were obvious. Claire fell silent. What kind of a method was this?</p><br/><p>But Claire thought back to when she had faced Hua Yiling. It was at that moment, so close to death, when she suddenly instantaneously comprehended the eighth level of the Treasured Lotus Style.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damn brat had also reached a bottleneck, so I sent them there. Whether or not he can return depends on himself.\u201d The old man yawned, finally revealing the true reason why he had sent Feng Yixuan away. He looked at Claire, his head crooked. \u201cYou have also reached a bottleneck. Will you go? I cannot give you any pointers for the Treasured Lotus Style because it was invented by that old fox. I don\u2019t know about his current whereabouts either, in any case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Claire did not waver at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, not bad, little girl!\u201d The old man stood up, laughing heartily. \u201cI\u2019ll send you now. That fellow hasn\u2019t been there for long, so you two should be able to meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without further ado, the old man quickly constructed a magic formation on the ground with numerous ores from his interspatial ring. An eight star magic formation!</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful when you\u2019re there. If you two want to return, you must reach the highest mountain peak. There is a teleportation formation there, but reaching there is not easy. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll understand.\u201d The old man started to activate the magic formation. White light glowed, becoming brighter and brighter.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d She stepped into the center of the formation. The white light enveloped Claire\u2019s body, and then she disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya~ya, I wasted so many ores again,\u201d the old man cried out, looking at the used up ores on the ground. Able to power teleportation spells, the ores were priceless, not something money could buy. Of course, the Temple of Light owned some as well, but they were only used in times of emergency. However, although they were so precious, the senior was able to use them quite readily.</p><br/><p>The old man sad down. He looked around at the mess. Quietly, he murmured, \u201cI believe the two of you can definitely return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire only felt the sensation of floating before everything went black. When she could see again, her surroundings were completely different. She was in the middle of a lush forest. But before she could look at her surroundings more closely, a yell caught her attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cStinkin\u2019 brat, not knowing what\u2019s good for you. Me taking a fancy of you is lucky for you!\u201d an unknown voice cried, piercing and full of anger.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the replying voice was quite familiar\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It only took them half a day to arrive. The moment he entered the town, there was a hubbub of people, as if there was a huge commotion. The wide streets were filled with customers from all kinds of shops. Jewelry stores, weapons stores, protective gear stores, pet stores, and clothing stores were all full of people. All sorts of major powers were arriving here one after another.</p><br/><p>As Jonathan had said, although this place was nominally a small town, it was not inferior to the city. The Heavenly Treasure City and the Nine Heavens City that Qi Ao Shuang had seen were incomparable to the White Cloud Town. In this world, the greatest ruler was still the Star Academy. The only difference was that the four great cities were in the light while the Star Academy was in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, we don\u2019t need to do anything. We just wear these clothes and wander around this place. We need to mediate the conflicts here and there.\u201d In any case, the major powers will give us some face just because of our status. \u201d Jonathan opened the curtain and looked outside, absent-mindedly explaining to Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the mayors and their subordinates are staying at the Stellar Hotel. The sects would find their own residences. We can do everything within our power, and the three of us will be staying at the Stellar Hotel. After settling down, you can move around freely. When something happens, it\u2019s just a matter of time. Meet in the hall the day before the convention begins. \u201d Dylan patiently explained to Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>There will inevitably be a conflict between the four cities and the sects. Naturally, the mission of Qi Ao Shuang and the other two was to resolve these conflicts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded. The carriage drove down the street and stopped in front of a tall, imposing building. At the entrance of the magnificent building stood a huge stone board. On top of the stone board, there were a few words engraved deeply: Stars Hotel. The simple and unadorned stone board did not match the tall and dazzling hotel at all. It looked very strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stone tablet was carved by the founder of the Star Academy. That person had disappeared after the creation of the Star Academy. \u201cThe Principal and the Elders also never mentioned his matter. They only said that he was a very powerful person and that he was the role model for everyone.\u201d Jonathan looked at Qi Ao Shuang and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how it is.\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied casually. A hint of doubt arose in his heart. The Star Academy didn\u2019t seem to be as simple as it seemed on the surface. Now it seemed to be the true ruler of the world. But there were too many mysteries. The founders of the academy were actually not allowed to know who their students were. Also, why did the student who had reached the eighth level during his first attempt attack the school\u2019s forces? He even tried to destroy the Star Heavenly Pagoda. In the end, the school sealed off the news. What was all this about?</p><br/><p>The three of them entered the hotel and were immediately greeted respectfully by someone. When the others in the hall saw the three of them, their gazes changed. Respect, fear, disdain, provocation\u2026 The ones who were disdainful and provoking were naturally the guest elders of the various city lords. As the pinnacle of power within the chaosworld, the Star Academy naturally caused quite a few people to feel unsatisfied. Although those people had unfriendly eyes, they still did not move forward. After all, this was the Star Academy\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>The waiter led the three of them to their living quarters. It was a small suite with an elegant environment. There were three luxurious rooms. Each bedroom has a separate bathroom, outside the living room, dining room and so on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, you can go now.\u201d Dittos waved the waiter down.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The waiter replied respectfully and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, I still want my room.\u201d cried Jonathan, hopping toward the bedroom on the far right.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang and Dotans looked at each other speechlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest first. Someone will bring you lunch later.\u201d After saying that to Qi Aoshuang, Ditanas walked to the leftmost bedroom, leaving behind the one in the middle.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded and entered the middle bedroom.</p><br/><p>Looking around at the luxurious surroundings, Qi Ao Shuang walked over to the bed and laid down on it, wondering if Heaven Breaker and Ah\u2019Bao had also come. He planned to ask whether the people from Heavenly Treasure City had arrived after lunch.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, someone delivered a sumptuous lunch at noon on time.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to eat, time to eat.\u201d Jonathan was sitting in the dining room, shouting at the door of the bedroom. After yelling, he impatiently picked up his knife and fork to enjoy himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe quadrennial Tripod Gathering requires us to participate in it every time. It is all so that we can see for ourselves if there are any powerful people who can be enlightened.\u201d \u201cHowever, it\u2019s been so long, why haven\u2019t I received any inspirations?\u201d Jonathan chewed on the food in his mouth and said unhappily, \u201cWhat a waste of time. This is such a good time. It\u2019s so nice to go out and have some fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the people from Heavenly Treasure City arrived yet?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang ignored Jonathan\u2019s complaints and instead asked the question that she had always cared about.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should be here. If they are here, they should be staying in the east hall.\u201d \u201cThey were first in the last Tripod Meeting, so they should be staying in the east hall.\u201d Jonathan narrowed his eyes, timidly enjoying the delicious food while indifferently answering Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d \u201cGot it, thank you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood time, don\u2019t waste it. I\u2019ve finished eating. I\u2019m going out to find my spring.\u201d Jonathan wiped his mouth gracefully, stood up, and became the sunny boy again.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan in amusement. In fact, he was quite envious of Jonathan\u2019s attitude towards life. Enjoy, eat, drink, and have fun without a care in the world. However, that was not what she was looking for. At least not yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Dittos suddenly spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Jonathan almost jumped up when he heard Dittens\u2019s words. He abruptly turned around and looked at him in disbelief. Then he grinned and said with gratification, \u201cHaha, Dittas, have you finally figured it out?\u201d \u201cAre you finally ready to enjoy life with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Dittos slowly raised his head and looked at Jonathan, who was chuckling happily. He said lightly, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Jonathan\u2019s face froze. Looking at the expressionless Dietz, the corner of his mouth twitched and he left with a grunt.</p><br/><p>Looking at Jonathan\u2019s embarrassed expression, Qi Ao Shuang couldn\u2019t help smiling. Jonathan really was a clown. He felt relaxed with such a person.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, if you have something to do, you don\u2019t have to go with me.\u201d I can go myself. \u201d Qi Ao Shuang said with a smile as she looked at Dittos.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go after the meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, thank you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded with a smile.</p><br/><p>The east hall was in a mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, meow, no.\u201d A voice full of impatience.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Bao, wear another one.\u201d Ah\u2019Bao, wear another one. Another voice was full of flattery.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qi Ao Shuang stepped through the door of the east hall, she saw a beautiful woman wearing a thin dress jumping around the courtyard with an angry look on her face. She was chasing after Heaven Breaker, who had an anxious look on her face. At this moment, Heaven Breaker no longer had the feeling of the peerless master Qi Ao Shuang had when she first met him. That way of trying to curry favor with her had broadened Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s horizons. The peerless beauty was wearing a dress, and her voluptuous body made one\u2019s blood boil. It was just a dress, but the weather seemed just right. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t expose any sensitive areas. Why would Heaven Breaker allow her to wear a coat?</p><br/><p>What was he doing?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stared at the scene in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow!\u201d Ao Shuang, save me. Heaven Breaker is so hateful! When the beautiful lady saw Qi Ao Shuang enter, she threw herself into Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arms, refusing to leave.</p><br/><p>Dittens frowned slightly as he watched the scene unfold before him, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Bao?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang tentatively called out Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s name. Heavens, this voluptuous, first-rate girl was actually that little Ah\u2019Bao? Is there a mistake? This appearance did not match Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s simple-minded personality at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow, meow, it\u2019s me.\u201d Ao Shuang, Heaven Breaker is such a nuisance. They don\u2019t like to dress, let them wear it, I do. \u201cBut Heaven Breaker still wants me to wear it again. It\u2019s so hot, I don\u2019t want it!\u201d Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s head was shaking like a rattle drum, then it hung on top of Xiao Ao Shuang like an octopus, refusing to come down.</p><br/><p>The corner of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mouth twitched as she looked at Heaven Breaker\u2019s helpless and embarrassed face, then looked at Po who had his head buried deep in her arms. She didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven Breaker, you, you\u2019re too stingy.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Heaven Breaker with disdain, as she clearly understood the reason behind his actions. It was not because he didn\u2019t want Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s hot body to be exposed in front of others. But did he have to? The women wore a dress, and there was no fear in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Heaven Breaker gave an awkward chuckle, his mouth twitching in speechlessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2019Bao, come down first.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang patted Ah\u2019Bao\u2019s head with a smile as she comforted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow, I\u2019m not, unless Heaven Breaker doesn\u2019t want me to wear it anymore.\u201d Ah\u2019Bao tightly held onto Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s neck, refusing to come down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven Breaker!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang stared at the man who was eating all sorts of vinegar, and shouted with a drawn-out voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine, Po, I don\u2019t want to wear it anymore. Be good, come over here.\u201d \u201cAo Shuang is a man. You can\u2019t always hide in his arms like this.\u201d Heaven Breaker\u2019s gaze had never left the part where Po and Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s bodies were in contact. He had been eagerly watching the whole time, and now he finally said what he wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow?\u201d \u201cWhat does that matter? Ao Shuang is actually \u2026\u201d Po\u2019s mouth was immediately covered by Heaven Breaker\u2019s outstretched hand. He pulled Ah\u2019Bao back from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s embrace and hugged him tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow, meow, meow, meow, hmm ~\u201d Ah\u2019Bao couldn\u2019t utter a word. He could only stare at Heaven Breaker.</p><br/><p>A trace of inexplicable spirit flashed across Dittas\u2019 eyes. Just now, what was this woman trying to say? What actually happened to Qi Ao Shuang?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

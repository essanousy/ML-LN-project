The person\u2019s name sounded pretty, but nobody could stand that attitude. Her memories were full of being rejected by handsome men and looking foolish.</p><br/><p>The door was suddenly banged open and the deafening sound caused Claire to look towards the door. The girl at the door resembled the previous beautiful woman and seemed younger than Claire, however, her expression of disgust and condescending attitude did not match her young age.</p><br/><p>Claire squinted her eyes a little only, because in her memories, she was terribly afraid of the girl before her. It was her younger sister, Lashia, a talented magician. Although she was only twelve years old, she had already become an advanced magician. Because of her outstanding talent, she was selected by the principal of the Sunrise Institute when she was only five years old to become one of his few disciples. This made Gordan Hill incredibly happy. The talented young miss hated Claire because their mother spoiled her so much. This wasn\u2019t strange because Lashia, being a child prodigy, had the love of her grandfather, father, and brother. Thus, her mother spent more time with Claire who was disliked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, you brought great shame to the Hill name, ending up in this state just because you fell off a horse to chase a man.\u201d Lashia held her head high and looked disdainfully at the person on the bed. She walked up to the bed, a sliver of malice glinting in her eyes, and stuck her face right up to Claire\u2019s. She whispered in a low, poisonous voice, \u201cMy dear elder sister, why didn\u2019t you die falling off that horse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked silently at the pretty face before her. Who would have thought that someone who looked this innocent would say something so malicious?</p><br/><p>Lashia looked at Claire\u2019s placid face and was taken aback. Normally her stupid elder sister would be trembling by not, yet currently, she was so calm.</p><br/><p>Footsteps sounded outside and Lashia\u2019s expression changed to a frown. She muttered indistinctly under her breath and instantly, a tiny bolt of lightning appeared in her palm. Before Claire could react, Lashia had already pointed her finger at Claire\u2019s back. Claire felt a terrible pain surge through her body from her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou male-chasing idiot, next time you worry mother I won\u2019t let you off as easily, \u201d Lashia whispered coldly into Claire\u2019s ear. \u201cYou know what will happen if you dare tell Mother. \u201d</p><br/><p>In Claire\u2019s combined memories, it seemed that many similar situations had happened before. Without anyone knowing, the little sister Lashia seemed to give the previous Claire much suffering. Claire dropped her gaze emotionlessly, not looking when Lashia turned around.</p><br/><p>This time, the door opened quietly. The beautiful lady from before peaked inside and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother~~\u201d Lashia greeted happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cLashia, you\u2019re home!\u201d Katherine smiled as she entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mother. Let\u2019s go eat now.\u201d Lashia grabbed Katherine\u2019s arm cheerfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go eat first, I\u2019ll stay with your older sister.\u201d Kathleen patted Lashia\u2019s head and said softly, \u201cYour sister is not feeling well today, I\u2019ll stay here to keep her company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lashia said, eyes cast down with a bitterness unnoticed by Katherine. Watching Katherine walk towards the bed, Lashia quietly and coldly humphed without anyone hearing and left quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, the maids will serve dinner soon.\u201d Katherine sat near the bed and enclosed Claire\u2019s hands in her own. Claire gave a start. The warmth coming from her hand made her relax immediately. So soft, so warm. Just like how that person held her hand and told her to be happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Claire said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it dear?\u201d Katherine smiled gently. Suddenly, her expression changed and she asked anxiously, \u201cDo you feel hurt anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, mother.\u201d Claire suddenly smiled. \u201cMother, you haven\u2019t eaten either. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Katherine gave a start, and suddenly, tears came uncontrollably and silently. It was the first time Claire had asked a question like this, the first time Claire was kind to her.</p><br/><p>Seeing Katherine\u2019s tears of joy, Claire lowered her eyes. Her true feelings were hidden by her long lashes.</p><br/><p>Claire. Claire, this will be my name in the future. A strange light glinted in the young girl\u2019s eyes. The previous Claire didn\u2019t dare report Lashia\u2019s bullying or have the power to strike back. But, in the future\u2026 Claire\u2019s eyes became icy as she remembered the burning sensation on her back once more.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a bright new star rose in the night sky of the Ceylon continent, but as for why, no one knew.</p><br/><p>The next morning, all the servants in Duke Hill\u2019s castle were gossiping among themselves and casting uncertain glances at the study. It was nothing big, just their Miss\u2019s strange behavior! Usually, she would already be out searching for handsome men by now, at either the theatre or the City Center Library\u2026 because young noble gentlemen normally hung out there. But today, she actually went to Duke Hill\u2019s study! When the Duke wasn\u2019t working inside, he would usually let his children inside his study. Although Claire fell off the horse yesterday, the doctor said she would be fine. But based on Miss\u2019s wild personality, she would never enter the study she despised!</p><br/><p>In a large study with shining windows, a few huge bookshelves lined against the walls. Neatly classified books of all genres lined the bookshelves. A pretty blonde girl leaned on a windowsill thumbing through a thick book, The History of Ceylon.</p><br/><p>Flipping through the book, the girl\u2019s expression became complex. She had already reached the section on the history of the country, Amparkland. The most credited people for the establishment of the country was the Hill clan, a family whose coat of arms was a rose. The young girl lifted her head to gaze thoughtfully upon the rose regalia hanging above the desk. It seems the Hill family wasn\u2019t simply wealthy.</p><br/><p>Outside, light footsteps sounded but stopped abruptly at the door. Even though it was extremely light, Claire noticed instantly.</p><br/><p>From the door came a low and cold voice,\u201cMiss, the Duke has returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Claire answered unenthusiastically, closing the book. From her combined memory she already knew the person outside the door was her knight, Jean, who was supposed to protect her.</p><br/><p>Claire got up and just when she was about to set the book back on the bookshelf, she heard a series of footsteps sounded outside the door. Then, she heard the sound of Jean\u2019s greeting.</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open and an austere, old man with luxurious clothes appeared. He looked to be more than fifty years old, but very energetic. His brows and Claire\u2019s were similar, letting her know that he was her grandfather. Currently, the Duke held a great amount of power in Amparkland and was also the most powerful man in his family.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather,\u201d Claire greeted indifferently, her previous cowardly attitude gone.</p><br/><p>Gordan Hill looked at the young girl in front of him and frowned, a strange emotion flickering in his eyes. He couldn\u2019t believe at first that his headstrong granddaughter would be willingly reading in the study when he heard about it, but now his own eyes convinced him. And how differently she dressed! Usually she would wear elaborate dresses like a butterfly, but today she donned the plainest white dress, her curly golden hair in the simplest style. Did she hit her head too hard when she fell off the horse yesterday?</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you fell off a horse yesterday?\u201d Gordan walked in, asking casually. The people following him stopped outside and lightly closed the door to the study.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine now,\u201d Claire replied lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s good.\u201d Seeing the book in Claire\u2019s hand, Gordan,was a little surprised. She\u2019s reading The History of Ceylon? He knew this granddaughter of his inside out: capricious, unruly, and abnormally attracted to the opposite sex\u2026 She, who hated studying and learning more than anything else, was actually reading the most dull and boring Ceylonese History?!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what do you think after reading The History of Ceylon?\u201d Duke Gordan asked offhandedly, walking to his study desk.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet the banner of roses fly forever,\u201d Claire replied quietly with a hint of a smile.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan\u2019s eyes bulged as he stared, astounded at the smiling girl before him. What did he just hear?</p><br/><p>Let the banner of roses fly forever!!!</p><br/><p>Let the Hill clan exist forever!</p><br/><p>\u201cSay that again!\u201d Gordan commanded in a deep tone, squinting at the girl in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet the banner of roses fly forever.\u201d An imperceptible hint of a smile flashed within Claire\u2019s eyes. This elderly man in front of her was the heart and center of this clan, the head and the leader. Through numerous previous experiences, she knew exactly how important it was in unfamiliar surroundings to pay close attention and take advantage of superior people to the greatest extent. If she wanted to survive in this unknown world, if she wanted to become powerful, then gaining the favor of this person in front of her would be her first threshold.</p><br/><p>If someone else had told him this, Gordan would dismiss it without a thought because it would only be a means of flattering. But its meaning was drastically different when this young girl said it! His only son and other two grandsons and granddaughter had never said anything like it, but it was said by someone who was considered a failure like Claire. Duke Gordan was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, I have been acting out of line insensibly and it has been going on for too long. From now on, I will take my studies seriously and definitely not let down the Hill clan again.\u201d Claire stare at the stunned old man. Every word, every sentence had been said clearly, and her green eyes held a serious gaze.</p><br/><p>Amazed, Gordan looked blankly at this sincere young girl, unable to speak for a long time. Claire kept quiet, too, silently staring at her grandfather.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Finally, Gordan came back to his senses and laughed in relief. He patted Claire on the shoulder and praised, \u201cThis is my girl, this is the child of the Hill Clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t disappoint you,\u201d Claire smiled. Her smile was shining with confidence.</p><br/><p>This day, the whole manor boiled.</p><br/><p>This idiotic girl that was infatuated with men and always disliked by the duke was actually led out of the study today, hand-in-hand with the normally serious duke, and they were both smiling!</p><br/><p>The foolish male-chasing Miss of the Hill Clan was now favored! The news spread like wildfire throughout the whole manor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Aren\u2019t you coming with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned, feeling very bad in her heart!</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather\u2019s expressions also darkened. Black Feather was the one who was the most impatient. He said solemnly, \u201cAo Shuang, this guy is dangerous. Don\u2019t go with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys better hurry to the place you should be going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil touched the Treasure Cat in his arms and spoke lightly without waiting for Qi Aoshuang to say anything. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see Feng Yixuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see Leng Lingyun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression changed, not understanding what Camil meant by those words.</p><br/><p>Camil looked at Qi Aoshuang with a smile that was not a smile, and leaned close to her, speaking in a low voice that only the two of them could hear, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know where Leng Lingyun was after he disappeared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun left without saying a word in order to save your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what that is on your earlobe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see Feng Yixuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan is suffering because of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s pupils contracted. She turned around and stared blankly at Camil.</p><br/><p>Camil was still gently smiling, nonchalantly smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang almost gnashed her teeth as she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you go with me, or with one of them, to get mixed up in that complicated competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil narrowed his eyes and revealed a warm smile.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked down coldly, and said with a low voice: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil smiled at Black Feather and White Emperor while hugging the Treasure Cat. \u201cIt is actually the safest for Ao Shuang to be staying with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that you or the forces you assist will come and pick her up when you become the Great Demon King.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha \u2026\u201d Camil said, and then he led the way while holding the Treasure Cat.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gave White Emperor and Black Feather a complicated glance, but she did not say anything. Instead, she followed Camil and left.</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather didn\u2019t say anything to stop them, simply because they were thinking the same.</p><br/><p>In such a chaotic situation, it would be safer if Ao Shuang stayed with Camil.</p><br/><p>Although Camil\u2019s identity has always been suspicious, he won\u2019t hurt her.</p><br/><p>At least, not now.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Camil and Qi Aoshuang went on the stairs, their backs disappearing from White Emperor and Black Feather\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Black Feather snorted coldly at White Emperor, then rushed upstairs as well.</p><br/><p>White Emperor only let out a barely audible sigh as he slowly made his way to the stairs.</p><br/><p>Camil brought Qi Aoshuang to a balcony on the second floor and instructed the waiter to close the door before handing the Treasure Cat back to Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>After that, he walked over to the side and elegantly poured a cup of tea for Qi Aoshuang, then handed it over to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why Leng Lingyun left without saying goodbye?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where Feng Yi Xuan is now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Aoshuang did not reach out to take the tea from Camil, but stared at Camil and asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Camil smiled as he placed the tea on the table in front of Qi Aoshuang, then sat down beside Qi Aoshuang and slowly threw out a sentence, \u201cBoth of them will participate in this martial arts competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll recognize them. \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s hands tightened, and she only realized that she had lost her composure when she saw the Treasure Cat using its claws to scratch her arm in displeasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas this also caused by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xiao Aoshuang was looking at Camil with a very unfriendly gaze, and her tone was even colder.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy little Ao Shuang, how can you think of me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I that kind of person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil\u2019s tone was full of grievance, but there was no more expression on his face. He was still wearing a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aoshuang coldly snorted and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know that Leng Lingyun is not a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil stood up, poured himself a cup of tea and spoke slowly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was stunned. She stared at Camil\u2019s back, unable to say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan isn\u2019t a human either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil turned around and said with a sweet smile on his face, making Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind go blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny that Leng Lingyun thought that Feng Yixuan was just an ordinary human. He volunteered to leave, wanting Feng Yixuan to bring you happiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil looked at Qi Aoshuang and smiled like a picture.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang felt her mind blanking out as her thoughts completely stopped at this moment.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun was not a human?</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan wasn\u2019t either?!</p><br/><p>Camil seemed to find the stimulation given to Qi Aoshuang insufficient, he put down the teacup and smiled: \u201cAnd that earring on your ear, it was given to you by Leng Lingyun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of his eyes. \u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, something seemed to explode in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>An eye, this purple crystal earring was one of Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes?!</p><br/><p>It was actually Leng Lingyun\u2019s eye!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the door was kicked open at the wrong time.</p><br/><p>The door revealed the sneer on Lee Laura\u2019s face. Her beautiful eyes were filled with malice.</p><br/><p>Lee Laura did not see Camil, her eyes were all on Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>She sneered, and with a light flick of her hand, the entire room was covered in a barrier, completely isolating itself from the outside world.</p><br/><p>She knew that both White Emperor and Black Feather were in other rooms, meeting with her older brother\u2019s competitors. Naturally, they had set up their own barriers, and didn\u2019t have the time to take care of Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she took advantage of this opportunity to snatch that adorable cat, and mainly to teach this lowly human a lesson.</p><br/><p>She still knew her limits. At least she couldn\u2019t take her life.</p><br/><p>Lee Laura coldly snorted and slowly walked over to Xiao Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>She had to admit that Qi Aoshuang was indeed pretty beautiful. As a human being, she was definitely a top beauty. No wonder Wan Fengliu would fall for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLowly human \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her words, she was struck by a terrifying force. Her pupils constricted. She wanted to raise her hand to block the force, but she realized that she had no power to resist.</p><br/><p>With a stuffy groan, Lee Laura crashed into the door but didn\u2019t knock it open. Instead, she bumped onto the barrier that she had laid down.</p><br/><p>With a \u201cwaa\u201d sound, Lee Laura\u2019s chest continued to churn and she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Her internal organs were actually all shaken to the point that they seemed like they were burning.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang hugged the Treasure Cat in her arms as she coldly stared at the miserable Lee Laura. Suddenly, she revealed a bright and peerless smile as she gently said, \u201cYou have to remember, not every human is someone you can offend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, it wasn\u2019t convenient to attack you outside. I didn\u2019t think that you would come to me by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Laura\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief. Was it the human in front of her that had injured her?</p><br/><p>How was that possible?</p><br/><p>Ddi this human have the power to surpass her?</p><br/><p>Looking at the bright smile on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face, her heart shuddered.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know why, but at this moment, a chill rose up from the bottom of her heart and expanded until it was almost able to seep through her entire body.</p><br/><p>Why did she feel that the human in front of her was dangerous?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy beautiful lady, are you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil slowly stepped forward with a gentle and elegant smile on his face. He reached out his hand to hold onto one of Lee Laura\u2019s arms and asked softly.</p><br/><p>Lee Laura was stunned. She raised her head and looked dazedly at Camil\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>The pair of deep blue eyes on his handsome face were filled with gentleness, almost to the point of melting someone.</p><br/><p>It was charming, but also mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>For a moment, she couldn\u2019t say a word. She could only stare blankly at the charming face in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil\u2019s gentle smile was like a spring breeze that warmed her heart. His gentle voice made her lose her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Lee Laura regain her senses. Looking at Camil, she somewhat nervously replied, \u201cI, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil smiled and withdrew his hand. He looked at Lee Laura and said softly, \u201cBeautiful lady, my friend has a bad temper. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, what else could Lee Laura hear? Her eyes were only focused on Camil\u2019s handsome face and his warm smile. She hurriedly nodded, but she didn\u2019t know what Camil was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the cat, my friend cares a lot, so please don\u2019t make it hard for her. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil\u2019s soft voice seemed to have a devilish quality to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Laura nodded with infatuation, she looked at Camil\u2019s face without shifting her gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, miss, the door is over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentle smile on Camil\u2019s face was devoid of any impurities, making Lee Laura\u2019s heart thrilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lee Laura obediently walked to the door, obediently turned around and looked at Camil and said softly, \u201cMay I, know your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill we meet again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Aoshuang\u2019s mouth twitched, what the hell was this?</p><br/><p>She knew Camil\u2019s intentions, and it was not wise to start a fight with this young lady.</p><br/><p>This was because this was in the Demon Sector. It was not good if a demon had been injured by a human in such a public place?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCamil would gently tell her his name, and if he had the chance again, would he meet her again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then get rid of the trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Aoshuang originally thought so, but after hearing Lee Laura\u2019s words, Camil\u2019s face changed abruptly.</p><br/><p>The deep blue eyes instantly became abnormally cold and a trace of undetectable brutality flashed through them.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Camil silently walked in front of Lee Laura and grabbed her by the neck.</p><br/><p>Lee Laura\u2019s eyes widened as she felt the ice-cold hand on her neck. In that instant, her entire body was filled with fear.</p><br/><p>Her eyes reflected Camil\u2019s ice-cold face. She couldn\u2019t understand why the previously extremely gentle person would be so terrifyingly cold at this moment.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aoshuang was also stunned, she did not understand why Camil\u2019s attitude had changed so suddenly.</p><br/><p>He had a smile on his face just a moment ago, but now he looked like a bloodthirsty ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to know my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Camil\u2019s cold voice was as suffocating as of a demon\u2019s imprisonment, circling around her ears.</p><br/><p>Lee Laura felt as if her body was on the verge of igniting into flames. Her life core was shaking inside of her body, almost as if it was about to burst out of her body.</p><br/><p>She tried to scream, but nothing came out of her mouth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Become Claire\u2019s second pair of eyes.\u201d Emery chuckled. A spirit\u2019s senses were far better than the senses of a normal person.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I do? Right now I don\u2019t have even the slightest bit of energy.\u201d After hearing this, Walter was a bit relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can let you gain some energy. But you must become my disciple\u2019s second pair of eyes and help her detect and survive dangers.\u201d Emery said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat contract?\u201d Walter asked doubtfully, then frowned. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t even think about restricting me forever. And not the master-servant soul contract either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Emery shook his head and said gently, \u201cNo, I only need an equal contract where you and Claire can communicate mentally within a certain radius. Claire will probably meet a lot of danger in the future. I hope you can help dispel those dangers with all your effort. As compensation, I\u2019ll help you recover some of your power and find a suitable body for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat good?\u201d Once he heard this, Walter was delighted, but then asked in suspicion, \u201cAre you trying to deceive to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely not. I swear upon my honor as a magician.\u201d Emery said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s good, no problem.\u201d Walter was happy again. In the days that followed when Walter met those unusually annoying problems, he would realize how tragic it was that he agreed to Emery\u2019s proposal. If Claire was a little devil, then Emery was a big devil.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the two negotiating, confused. Emery then made Claire put her hand on top of the Spiritual Stone and started chanting some strange incantation. A faint white light covered Claire and the Spiritual Stone. The white light dissipated after a short while, but Claire felt something different in her head. She could now communicate directly with Walter telepathically!</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter should be more sensitive to dark magic, so with Walter by your side, things will be much easier.\u201d This was what Emery said, but Claire didn\u2019t really understand what he meant. She only felt that Emery was planning for something!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Claire, you just came back today so you must be tired. You should rest early.\u201d Emery pushed open the window and jumped out.</p><br/><p>Claire looked thoughtfully at the Spiritual Stone in her hand while stroking her chin. She knitted her brows, thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter, is this Spiritual Stone very valuable? Can you conceal your dark aura?\u201d Claire frowned as she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s very valuable. By attaching myself to this stone, I can hide my dark aura. If I don\u2019t expose myself on purpose, then everyone would think this was a normal stone.\u201d Walter said, very pleased with himself. This meant that when Emery found out there was something in the stone, it was Walter himself who purposely exposed himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cValuable?\u201d Claire played around with the small stone, and said casually, \u201cIt\u2019s disposable, only able to be used once before becoming trash. This thing is valuable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, this could count as a sub-Artifact! You can store a spirit inside. There are very few people who can recognize this is a Spiritual Stone. Your master is remarkable. Even the Divine Prince couldn\u2019t identify it.\u201d The last sentence was completely unnecessary. If the Divine Prince recognized this stone, Walter wouldn\u2019t be here talking to Claire right now.</p><br/><p>At least with Walter around her it would be easier to sense dark auras. Claire thought about it, then let it go. Today she was too tired. She would ask this guy about dark magic another day.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d Walter was waiting for Claire to respond, only to hear this lazy word again.</p><br/><p>Walter again stared at Claire when she calmly took off her clothes. Then with only one glance from Claire, Walter felt cold all over, and hurriedly squirmed into the Spiritual Stone.</p><br/><p>The next day, as soon as Claire woke up, the housekeeper came to tell her that the scholar Camille would come and teach her literature and math. Looks like Gordan had already prepared a schedule for Claire this summer.</p><br/><p>After breakfast, Claire went to her own study. Camille was already there waiting for her. Everyone had a study, but Duke Gordan\u2019s study had more books, so Claire usually liked to read there.</p><br/><p>Just like before, Camille acted cultured and refined, with his never changing gentle smile. His gorgeous blonde hair was still splendid.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, thank you for waiting.\u201d Claire smiled and curtsied before Camille.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve also just arrived. Let\u2019s start class then.\u201d Camille smiled.</p><br/><p>Claire sat down, sitting up straight. Someone already placed all the textbooks she was going to need on her desk.</p><br/><p>Camille wrote equations on the blackboard while Claire listened intently. Suddenly, one of Camille\u2019s small movements aroused Claire\u2019s suspicion.</p><br/><p>Camille was a little stiff when he wrote, and although it was only a tiny bit, the stiffness was definitely there. Claire knew that little movement by heart. It\u2019s because when one is wounded, lifting one\u2019s hand strains the injuries. Camille still had the gentle smile fixed on his face, and his face was also rosy, so one could ever tell that he was injured just from his external appearances. Also, as a physically weak scholar and the student of the most famous scholar in the capital, who would want to hurt him?</p><br/><p>The truth is often surprising. Claire could be certain that Camille was injured, and it wasn\u2019t minor either.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t ask. This was unrelated to her. Since Camille tried to cover it up, that meant he didn\u2019t want people to know. Camille\u2019s identity shouldn\u2019t be so simple, but Claire wasn\u2019t interested about it.</p><br/><p>A whole morning\u2019s teaching passed by peacefully.</p><br/><p>Camille kindly declined the invitation to stay for lunch and left alone.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, as Claire, Gordan, and Katherine ate lunch, Claire discovered that Gordan\u2019s mind was on something else.</p><br/><p>As if something big had happened.</p><br/><p>Gordan didn\u2019t even bother to finish the meal before leaving hurriedly.</p><br/><p>Claire thoughtfully watched Gordan disappear from the door of the Grand Hall and kept on eating slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to know what happened?\u201d Walter\u2019s voice appeared vulgarly in Claire\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d Claire replied coldly, without any emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go ask that knight of yours. When he met his Royal Highness the second prince in Gale Gorge, they kept making hand signals at each other behind your back.\u201d Walter hastily explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know he works for the second prince, but he also works for my Grandfather.\u201d Claire\u2019s words shocked Walter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know all this?\u201d Walter exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, they\u2026 \u201d Claire\u2019s voice stopped, making Walter extremely impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey what? Keep on talking!\u201d Walter urged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter\u2026\u201d Claire started in an carefree voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you know? Curiosity often causes people to lose their lives.\u201d But this nonchalant voice made Walter\u2019s heart chill. This seemingly bright girl only in her teens was definitely not as innocent as her appearance seemed.</p><br/><p>Walter obediently shut up, not making another sound.</p><br/><p>After talking to Katherine for a while, Claire also left to take an afternoon break. After the break, she had equestrian and fencing lessons.</p><br/><p>Jean followed Claire from behind all the way until they reached Claire\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Claire turned around, looked at Jean and asked unemotionally: \u201cDid something happen last night? Something related to the second prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Claire finished speaking, Jean\u2019s facial expression instantly changed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

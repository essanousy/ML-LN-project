I visited suddenly, I hope it didn\u2019t bring you any problems.\u201d The Divine Princess, Liuxue Qing got up and gently smiled at Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem at all. Please sit down, your highness.\u201d Claire nodded and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuanxuan wanted to see you the whole time, so when she heard you returned, she couldn\u2019t help but visit immediately.\u201d Liuxue Qing said in a pampering manner, looking at Xuanxuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Divine Princess is so kind to Xuanxuan.\u201d Claire said admiringly.</p><br/><p>Liuxue Qing smiled without saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis, can I see your study?\u201d Xuanxuan pulled Claire\u2019s hair slightly, attracting Claire\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuanxuan, be good. You know not to, you can\u2019t cause any trouble for Miss Claire.\u201d Liuxue Qing continued to smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, don\u2019t worry elder sis Qing, I\u2019ll be good.\u201d Xuanxuan hugged Claire tightly and tilted her head as she said to Liuxue Qing, \u201cPick me up at night, big sis.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: here I find out that only Qing is the first name, oops. Two character last names in Chinese are rare, but they exist.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk. I\u2019ll pick you up at night.\u201d Liuxue Qing stroked Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s head, pampering.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis Qing is the best.\u201d Xuanxuan showed a sweet smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Claire, can you please take care of Xuanxuan?\u201d Liuxue Qing had a gentle and elegant smile on the whole time.</p><br/><p>Claire fidgeted internally. You two have already finished talking and deciding, now you ask me if I can?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Xuanxuan\u2019s so obedient.\u201d Claire nodded and smiled.</p><br/><p>After Claire sent the Divine Princess away, she brought Xuanxuan to her own study.</p><br/><p>Claire sat at the study desk, watching Leng Xuanxuan touching-this, looking-at-that curious manner. Claire\u2019s was incessantly puzzled. This child was really strange. Why would she affectionate towards her? From the first time they had met, she had been that way. Now it was like she was going to stick to her and now leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuanxuan\u201d Claire called quietly, looking Leng Xuanxuan who had stepped on a chair and climbed up the study desk, flipping different works.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sis.\u201d Leng Xuanxuan suddenly raised her head, looking at Claire. She smiled brilliantly. \u201cDid elder sis cross paths with my elder brother before coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire frowned. Leng Lingyun had already contacted Leng Xuanxuan?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid your elder brother tell you?\u201d Claire asked, confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I saw it.\u201d Leng Xuanxuan pointed at her eyes, serious.</p><br/><p>Claire froze. Saw it? What did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does this little girl make my blood run cold?\u201d Walter said to Claire in a low voice, suddenly feeling his heart palpitate.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw it?\u201d Claire watched Xuanxuan, who had a serious expression, and asked in reply, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like how I can see the venerable Divine Princess doesn\u2019t really treat me well because she likes me, but because she liked my older brother.\u201d Leng Xuanxuan set down a book, looking at Claire with strange smile on her face.</p><br/><p>Walter started shivering even more. This little girl\u2019s gaze seemed like it could see right through oneself.</p><br/><p>Claire froze, staring at the child who was just five years old, not able to say anything even if she wanted to. Was this child really only five years old?</p><br/><p>How were her eyes so keen and astute?!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, have you heard the rumor that the Divine Prince possesses a pair of violet eyes that can see the future?\u201d Leng Xuanxuan stopped smiling and sat on the study desk, looking at Claire, face to face.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded slightly. \u201cI have.\u201d Currently, Claire was inwardly apprehensive. Perhaps, perhaps this girl could see the future? Was it possible?</p><br/><p>The next moment, Leng Xuanxuan\u2019s expression changed back into the pure smile that a five year old should have and she changed the topic naturally, pointing at a book and asking Claire, \u201cElder sis, what does this mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked and explained to Leng Xuanxuan while smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, this girl is not simple, definitely not simple.\u201d Walter said, trembling.</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t say! Claire coldly humphed. Of course she knew without Walter saying that. This child was definitely not as simple as she seemed.</p><br/><p>After the day passed and night had come, Liuxue Qing finally came to pick Xuanxuan up. Only after Leng Xuanxuan reluctantly said goodbye to Claire did she and Liuxue Qing leave on the carriage.</p><br/><p>And not long after Leng Xuanxuan left, Lashia returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, you finally came back. You didn\u2019t even bring me to learn through experience with you. Once I heard you returned today, I wanted to come back immediately, but Master didn\u2019t let me, wanting me to finish first and then come back.\u201d Lashia fumed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you next time. Wait, where\u2019s Mother? Why haven\u2019t I seen her?\u201d Claire frowned. Once she returned, the first thing she did was report to Duke Gordan, then she went to find Mother, but wasn\u2019t able to see her. She wanted to ask Grandfather, but Leng Xuanxuan had taken up her time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother is at the imperial palace. She\u2019s become the the the head maid. I don\u2019t know why, but the princess requested to the king for Mother to go to the imperial palace to accompany her. Not to do anything, just accompany her, chat, and order the other maids. Dunno what the princess is thinking.\u201d Lashia frowned, seeming unsatisfied that Mother went to the imperial palace to work.</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent. The imperial palace had always been an unpredictable place, a power struggle vortex. Why had Mother actually gone to the imperial palace and become the princess\u2019s head maid?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, everybody is praising you for the Niya city incident. The emperor even said he\u2019ll award you. Also, when you were training, did you go encounter anything special? Are you going to class with me tomorrow?\u201d Lashia asked in succession.</p><br/><p>\u201cI made a wind leopard my mount. First, tomorrow, I\u2019ll go to the palace to visit Mother, then go to class the next day. Unfortunately, I still need to finish my studies and get the medal after passing the exam. The Hill clan cannot lose face.\u201d Claire smiled and said. The king actually personally presided over the exam and would personally give the medal to the students who passed. The medal was a sign of the honor of being able to serve the country.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind leopard?! A seventh grade magic beast?\u201d Lashia became excited. \u201cWhere? Where? Let me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnclosed in the courtyard.\u201d Claire said. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know already.\u201d Lashia enthusiastically dashed to the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Claire sighed, seeing the dusky sky. She hoped Katherine, that gentle woman, wouldn\u2019t be swept into the corrupt court struggle.</p><br/><p>At dinner, Duke Gordan treated Ben warmly, but Ben didn\u2019t pay attention. However, Duke Gordan didn\u2019t care and continuously tried to talk to Ben.</p><br/><p>Just as they finished eating, a maid came and reported to Duke Gordan that the princess had sent a carriage that was already waiting outside the Hill mansion. It was sent by princess Maurice to sent Claire to the palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Claire, you should go see your mother now and attend class tomorrow.\u201d Duke Gordan instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Grandfather.\u201d Claire nodded, then went out with Jean.</p><br/><p>Imperial palace: brightly lit, magnificent and gorgeous</p><br/><p>The maid brought Claire directly to the harem. Jean could only wait at the entrance.</p><br/><p>TL: because harems only allow women or eunuchs cuz, ya kno\u2026</p><br/><p>The maid led Claire through a long corridor to the princess\u2019s resting place.</p><br/><p>It was bright inside. Claire immediately saw the gentle woman she was concerned about, Katherine. Katherine sat on a sofa with princess Maurice next to her. The two seemed to be talking about a happy topic. Outside of Claire\u2019s expectations, the second prince, prince Nancy, was also there.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, your highnesses.\u201d Claire bowed slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you came. We were just talking about you.\u201d Princess Maurice seemed to more happy than Katherine when seeing Claire, hurriedly getting up and greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d Katherine also stood up, smiling, watching Claire eagerly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019ve returned.\u201d Claire nodded towards Katherine and smiled. Naturally, she knew this gentle woman had been worried for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I didn\u2019t think that the plague at Niya city was like that, and I also didn\u2019t expect that you would actually be able to resolve it so quickly.\u201d Prince Nancy said in admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all due to Master Cliff\u2019s contributions and the Temple of Light\u2019s help that it was settled so quickly.\u201d Claire smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when did you learn to act so humble, there\u2019s no need in our presence.\u201d Princess Maurice pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be so restrained in front of the princess, her highness is very kind.\u201d Katherine went up and pulled Claire\u2019s hand, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d Claire saw that Katherine\u2019s mood was pretty good and relaxed. Seems like Mother had a good time in the palace. Everything was fine as long as she was happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, sit, tell us about what happened at Niya city and also about that grand wizard.\u201d Maurice pulled Claire over and they both sat down on the sofa. She excitedly wanted Claire to tell what had happened.</p><br/><p>Claire saw Katherine smiling, so she smiled also and started to narrate. Naturally, she omitted a few things. As everybody chatted for a while, the night became late, but princess Maurice still didn\u2019t want to let Claire go. Only when Nancy reminded Maurice did she reluctantly let go of Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest early. Can\u2019t the both of you meet again tomorrow?\u201d Nancy consoled the unwilling princess Maurice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d When princess Maurice heard this, she started becoming happy. \u201cClaire, see you at school tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Your highness should go to rest.\u201d Claire said, then turned to Katherine and nodded lightly. Only then did she leave with Nancy.</p><br/><p>In the long corridor, the candle light made the two\u2019s shadows extremely long.</p><br/><p>The two were silent. Nancy walked very slowly. After a good while, he said quietly, \u201cClaire, you\u2019re, you\u2019re not the same as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Claire said indifferently. Evidently, she didn\u2019t want to talk about this subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The current you attracts many gazes.\u201d Nancy stopped. He watched Claire as he said quietly, \u201cSo dazzling, making people unable to move their gazes away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire halted, but didn\u2019t turn back. She only said icily, \u201cSecond prince, it\u2019s already very late, I want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t finish speaking. Instead, she widened her eyes suddenly, turned around, and abruptly threw herself on Nancy, pushing Nancy away. The two rolled messily on the ground.</p><br/><p>Killing intent! Hidden so well, she almost didn\u2019t sense it.</p><br/><p>Where Nancy had been standing at, a ghost-like figure appeared. Silent, extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>An assassin!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Now all we have to do is find Wynes and break the sky.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aushuang saw Wynes, Wynes\u2019 face was ashen, his eyes bloodshot, and he looked extremely dispirited. Clearly, he had found out about Beelzefini\u2019s engagement. This must be because he felt hopeless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWynes\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang called out softly.</p><br/><p>Wynes didn\u2019t seem to hear him. He just sat there, not moving at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBethany\u2019s here.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang lightly shook her head and let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>As expected, Wynes jumped up as if his butt was a spring. Staring with widened eyes, he looked around in fear, but all he saw was the calm face of Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d never wake up.\u201d Wynes said dispiritedly and sat down again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t fight for it?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sat at the side and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight for it?\u201d Of course I do! I wanted to fly to her and take her. But will she promise to leave with me? \u201cCan I take her away?\u201d Wynes smiled wryly, his face full of grief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if I say you can be with her without taking her?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Wynes with a smile that was not a smile.</p><br/><p>Wynes was stunned. He turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang and asked uncertainly, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cQi Ao Shuang, what do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if you are the City Lord of Nine Heavens City?\u201d What do you think your chances of marrying her are? \u2019 The corners of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s lips curled up as she asked mockingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d What a pity \u2026. Wynes revealed a mocking smile as he said calmly, \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not the city governor, and I can\u2019t become one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if your brother dies?\u201d \u201cThen will your father\u2019s hearts support you?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang continued with a faint smile, \u201cI have seen your so-called brother\u2019s son before, but he did not grow up.\u201d No one with eyes will support him. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d When Wynes heard what Qi Ao Shuang said, his heart skipped a beat and his face changed, \u201cYou, what are you talking about?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that your brother will let you go when he finds out about your current strength?\u201d Perhaps he already knows that action is being taken? \u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled coldly. Such a judgment is not without merit, and I believe that Wynes knows better than anyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what can I do?\u201d \u201cAfter all, he is the legitimate one, and I \u2026\u201d Wynes\u2019s face darkened, he lowered his eyes and murmured, \u201cAnd I\u2019m nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to ask you, if he\u2019s gone, will you be able to get your father\u2019s people to support you?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang couldn\u2019t be bothered to say anything more, directly asking this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Wynes\u2019 eyes flashed with determination as he resolutely replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d I will help you with that man. When it\u2019s over, act immediately. Let\u2019s get in touch now. \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang stood up and patted Wynes on the shoulder. \u201cAlso, think of a way to get out of here.\u201d \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t know that you are the next City Lord, she probably won\u2019t agree to marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d Wynes stood up abruptly, looking at Xiao Ao Shuang with shining eyes, but he did not say anything. However, his eyes flashed with a strange light, and he held onto the hand that was on Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say too much.\u201d \u201cWynes, there\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d With a faint smile, Xiao Ao Shuang withdrew her hand and patted on Wynes\u2019.</p><br/><p>Wynes\u2019s lips were quivering. He looked at Xiao Aushuang and seemed to have thousands of words to say. However, in the end, he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it now.\u201d Xiao Aushuang kept her smile and spoke seriously to Wynes, \u201cBethany, I will help you with your appointment.\u201d It\u2019s easier for me to meet her as an emissary. Where are we supposed to go? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, uh, uh \u2026\u201d At this point, Wynes, who was very serious a moment ago, suddenly turned red, unable to speak for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang laughed and shook her head, \u201cThen why don\u2019t I ask you to come to the White Leafed Forest outside the city?\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Wynes blurted it out without thinking. This was rather urgent.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I will help you with your appointment after settling this matter. Go and contact the person who supports you now.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not waste any more words. She was going to urge Jonathan to deal with this matter as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang \u2026\u201d Wynes looked at Qi Ao Shuang and shouted the three words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat word goes without saying.\u201d \u201cWhen you were beaten like a pig and refused to frame me, you already had the qualification to not say those words.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled, nodded her head and turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>Wynes was left standing on the spot, watching Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back gradually disappear. A warm feeling filled his heart and gradually overflowed.</p><br/><p>A knife on the head. Indeed, it was Jonathan\u2019s style. He had asked the woman whom he liked in the Nine Heavens City Lord to send him a secret letter, inviting him to meet her outside the city in the White Leaf Forest. Upon hearing the location, Xiao Ao Shuang felt embarrassed. It seems that the quiet place in the White Leaf Forest is really suitable for lovers to meet. More accurately speaking, it was a wild mandarin duck.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go after him and kill him in secret tonight.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go too.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, sneak in. Just don\u2019t let Ditto know.\u201d \u201cWhat if he really can\u2019t stop us.\u201d Jonathan lowered his voice.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded.</p><br/><p>When night fell, Jonathan, Qi Ao Shuang and Jin Yan quietly left the city. Naturally, they didn\u2019t inform Dittas.</p><br/><p>Moonlight poured down, filling the land with a hazy mist. The moonlight was mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>In the White Leaf Forest, a simple and unadorned carriage was quietly parked there. As for the horses pulling the carriage, their four hooves were all wrapped in a soft cloth as they kicked silently on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Witch\u2019s carriage.\u201d \u201cTsk, tsk, as expected of a professional hooker. Look at that horse carriage, look at those hoofs \u2026\u201d Jonathan found a secret place to squat and looked vulgarly at the carriage in front of him, sighing. \u201cThat silly bird is coming soon.\u201d He would definitely not bring many people with him. At most, he would bring two trusted aides with him, and he would also not let his trusted aides approach him. \u201cThis is awesome. Watch me chop watermelons later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of enmity does he have with you?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan\u2019s glowing eyes and asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe insulted me, he insulted my entire family!\u201d Jonathan said through clenched teeth. He looked extremely angry and sorrowful. It seemed that there was indeed a deep hatred between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right, according to your personality, how could your people still be alive?\u201d \u201cYou will only find someone to settle the score with now?\u201d Xiao Aushuang asked in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh, this, in fact, is the intelligence that he suspects my family has betrayed. That\u2019s when I said what someone was wearing that day, and he said no. \u201d Jonathan rolled his eyes and said in an unnatural way.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang twitched the corner of her mouth and did not say anything.</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was a slight sound of movement in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201d Jonathan made a silent gesture and restrained his breath. Qi Ao Shuang and Jin Yan did the same and withdrew their auras.</p><br/><p>As the soft voice got closer, a man\u2019s voice came in low, \u201cJust wait here for me.\u201d \u201cDo not disturb me without my instructions.\u201d His voice was filled with excitement and excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mayor.\u201d The two voices responded in unison.</p><br/><p>Then a footstep came closer.</p><br/><p>Johansson looked at Qi Ao Shuang and gave her a complacent look. Look, sure enough, this pervert has a confidant, but he won\u2019t let it get close. In order to meet with a woman, he had even given up his life.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was speechless, this mayor \u2026</p><br/><p>Under the moonlight, Qi Ao Shuang could see a man dressed in black walking towards the horse carriage at top speed. Even from such a distance, she could hear his breathing quicken. As expected of a lecherous animal \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you, you go distract the dogs. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, right?\u201d Jonathan suddenly turned to Jin Yan.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan\u2019s expression was calm as he nodded his head slowly. Without saying a word, he silently disappeared from his original spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Jonathan narrowed his eyes and watched the man in black open the carriage door and spit out a word.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Jonathan and Qi Ao Shuang appeared behind the man in black.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Jonathan made his move. In the blink of an eye, the dagger in Jonathan\u2019s hand had pierced into the man\u2019s back. There was no sound of the sharp weapon stabbing into his chest. Instead, there was the crisp sound of metal clashing against metal.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Jonathan cursed.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that the Nine Heavens City Lord had a life-saving magical equipment on him. Thinking about it, it made sense. It would be strange if the dignified city lord didn\u2019t have a life-saving magical equipment. The common sense of the low-level mistake made Jonathan and Qi Ao Shuang did not immediately succeed. However, although Jonathan was cursing, there was no sign of panic. In any case, in his eyes, this man was already a watermelon. There was no difference between him cutting it now and cutting it later.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d You! \u201cWho is it?\u201d By now, the Nine Heavens City lord had regained his senses. His lust for love had dissipated, and he was using all his strength to roll his body to the side. He stared at Jonathan and Qi Ao Shuang with wide eyes. White and black, black and white.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you guys!\u201d The Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord gritted his teeth in anger and fear. An envoy from the Star Academy! He was also a friend of Dittas, and he actually wanted to assassinate him!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s us.\u201d Johansson grinned as he stared at the terrified Nine Heavens City Lord.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stared silently at the person in front of her. Tonight, he had to die. It was that simple.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone come!\u201d The Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord began to shout. He knew very well that it would be impossible for him to escape from the hands of these two tonight. That was why it had naturally cried out. Now was not the time to wonder why they wanted to assassinate him!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you scream your throat out, no one will answer you.\u201d Jonathan grinned and approached the Nine Heavens City Lord.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the smile on Johansson\u2019s face froze. Qi Ao Shuang was also stunned.</p><br/><p>There was no other reason but the fact that Dittas had appeared silently in front of them, standing in front of the Nine Heavens City Lord.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

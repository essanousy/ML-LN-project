Their excitement was buzzing. The Sunrise Institute students didn\u2019t surround Claire; they just watched her from afar, feeling conflicted.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you\u2019re amazing! When did you learn Dou Qi?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you were excellent today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While drowning in praises, Claire only smiled mildly, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>Becoming famous in one fight.</p><br/><p>As Claire left, Yixuan Feng still laid there, not moving. Wenmo Shui gulped, and then carefully walked forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYixuan?\u201d Wenmo Shui inquired.</p><br/><p>He was responded to with silence.</p><br/><p>\u201c Yixuan, are you okay? Don\u2019t scare me, if you die, then your T-rex Ma won\u2019t forgive me. She will literally peel a layer off my skin before burying me with you! Even if you want to die, you have to wait for your mom to come here, then die!\u201d Wenmo Shui was tearing up, howling with grief.</p><br/><p>As before, Yixuan Feng didn\u2019t say a word, silently laying there with an unclear expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYixuan, you can\u2019t die. Save your breath, I\u2019ll carry you back. Wait until we arrive home and then you can die.\u201d Wenmo Shui said as he scooped up the unmoving Yixuan Feng, carrying him on his shoulder, shuffling down the platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to vomit\u2026 \u201d Yixuan Feng finally choked out these few words, groaning as quietly as a mosquito. Really, he was shaken so much he was about to vomit.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Yixuan, you\u2019re alright, very good, as long as you\u2019re alright it\u2019s okay.\u201d Wenmo Shui happily set Yixuan Feng down and Yixuan Feng wobbled down. Wenmo Shui immediately supported him and was truly happy. Good, Yixuan Feng, that little rascal, could speak. This meant that he could bear that inhumane person\u2019s humiliation. Good, good, this rascal didn\u2019t completely collapse. Wenmo Shui supported the weak and dizzy Yixuan Feng on his shoulder as they left.</p><br/><p>The Grand Exchange ended like that. A shocking beginning and a shocking ending. The ambassador\u2019s expression became extremely ugly. Naturally the emperor had to say some good words. From the ambassador\u2019s point of view, the ending award ceremony was very simple.</p><br/><p>But the prize was nevertheless extremely controversial. The contestants who attended the competition didn\u2019t dare say that the prize should have been theirs, and no one even mentioned the prize. Although the dean went to bring the prize back, no one could accept it. Everyone could see what was going on during the competition. Without Claire, they would not only be defeated, but they would also bring shame to Amparkland.</p><br/><p>Following tradition, the court held a banquet, firstly, to celebrate victory, and secondly, to send Lagark\u2019s students off.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, as Claire stole away to rest, sipping tea in the greenhouse, a servant came to report. The Sunrise Institute\u2019s principal had sent people to send over the rewards. Because he said he was busy, he couldn\u2019t personally come, so he sent an instructor to send the three rewards.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the three extraordinary items on the tray the servant was holding, quietly sipped her tea, and slowly stood up, walking to the tray that the magic sword was placed on. With one swipe, she threw the sword to Jean, who was behind her, and then mildly said, \u201cSend the other people back. I\u2019ll only take what I deserve.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant became slightly frozen, looking at Claire\u2019s ice-cold expression, quickly lowering his head as he brought the silver tray out.</p><br/><p>Jean accepted the sword and as he pulled it out a little, cold rays shot out. A good sword! Jean\u2019s face revealed a slight smile. He liked this present very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cPack this up. From now on, you are going to use this sword to protect me.\u201d Claire sat back into the seat and remembered the awkward moment that happened that day. Her foot was stepping on the abnormal young man\u2019s back. Once she thought of the young magician who was proficient in the art of assassination being humiliated by her in public, Claire began to feel headache. That was not her intention. Now, she can only think of plans to combat the coming storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress, are you worrying about that young man you had competed against today?\u201d Jean putting back the sword to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were to lose to a woman who is much weaker than you because of her deceit and were stepped under her foot in front of everyone, would you feel good?\u201d Claire asked irritably.</p><br/><p>Jean was speechless. Yes, not only would a man that had been stepped on the back by a woman in public be out of control, anyone would be furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful during this time. That person is very proficient in the art of assassination.\u201d Claire felt headache. When an assassin met an assassin, it seemed like neither one could benefit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, mistress. I would always stay by your side to protect you.\u201d Jean said extremely seriously.</p><br/><p>And there was a party tonight\u2026 Claire closed her eyes and sighed. She didn\u2019t want to go if possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know how troublesome it is. You really fueled the trouble; any men would be die vomiting blood because of your insult. I really pity that person. Tricked, defeated, and even stepped on the back. Oh yeah, it is going to be a delightful eternal performance. Now we are going to be pleased.\u201d Walter said, completely opposite of what he was thinking. He was like a raven being steamed, bickering incessantly.</p><br/><p>Claire did not say anything but pulled out the Spiritual stone and pinched forcefully on it.</p><br/><p>Walter twitched and quieted.</p><br/><p>The world was silent.</p><br/><p>Jean saw Claire pinch the Spiritual stone then casually put the stone back, her expression was the same as before. Not knowing why, he felt cold. Suddenly he pitied Walter, and somewhat understood why Walter always called Claire a little demon.</p><br/><p>The dinner party was held as usual and Claire appeared in a black formal dress and looked brilliant. At this night\u2019s party, she became the main character and naturally, Lashia was not present. The emperor went through the formal speech, and then the party began. Nobles surrounded Claire, and their talking made Claire\u2019s head ache. Many were those who Duke Gordan told her to befriend. But there were also some nobles that stood at a distance, and they all gazed in confusion at her side.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, everyone, Claire and I have appointment. If you do not mind, I have to borrow Claire for a moment.\u201d Princess Maurice appeared and smiled, keeping \u201charassments\u201d away from Claire.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes flashed with gratitude. Princess Maurice and Claire withdrew to the balcony and then Claire let out a light sigh. If it wasn\u2019t for Duke Gordan waving her over, she would have definitely not paid attention to those boring aristocrats.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, you were really great today.\u201d Princess Maurice\u2019s eyes flashed with light, admiring Claire sincerely.</p><br/><p>Claire bitterly laughed and shook her head. Really, in terms of brute force, she was far from being Yixuan Feng\u2019s match. It was just that she won this time using a hidden card. If Yixuan Feng knew she could use Dou Qi, he wouldn\u2019t have so brashly challenged her. But this night, she didn\u2019t seem to have seen that guy\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been said that Yixuan Feng has been muddleheaded this whole time, not sober. It\u2019s probably because he was shocked.\u201d Princess Maurice said with a proud smile. In her eyes, Claire was the hero that had completely defeated that guy!</p><br/><p>Muddleheaded this whole time? Claire was a bit surprised. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng and Wenmo Shui both didn\u2019t attend the banquet. Yixuan Feng lay on the courier hostel\u2019s bed, not moving at all. Wenmo Shui was aside, guarding him while chewing chicken.</p><br/><p>The ambassador was extremely worried about Yixuan Feng\u2019s situation, so he didn\u2019t force them to attend this humiliating sending-off banquet. Yixuan Feng\u2019s background wasn\u2019t something the ambassador could afford to offend.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Do you want to die or are you already dead?\u201d Wenmo Shui asked, his words blurry. After Wenmo Shui knew that Yixuan Feng could bear that strike, he wasn\u2019t polite anymore. He sat on a chair nearby with his foot stepping on Yixuan Feng\u2019s butt while chewing roasted chicken.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng was silent, lying on there, still daydreaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t die, then eat something. Wait until the banquet ends and we\u2019ll leave this night. I don\u2019t want to stay at this damned place at all.\u201d Wenmo Shui grumbled while chewing a roasted chicken wing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow beautiful, how valiant\u2026 \u201d Yixuan Feng\u2019s tiny voice quietly sounded, seeming like he ignored the Wenmo Shui\u2019s stinky pig foot on his butt.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wenmo Shui asked, confused, spitting out the bones in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow valiant, how enchanting she is\u2026 \u201d This time Wenmo Shui heard Yixuan Feng clearly.</p><br/><p>What?!!</p><br/><p>Wenmo Shui instantly had an ominous premonition.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

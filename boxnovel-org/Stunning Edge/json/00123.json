She was neither servile nor overbearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Miss Lan, hello.\u201d The crown prince was smiling, but he was actually secretly astonished. Although the girl was so young, her features were already extremely refined. It could be seen how beautiful she would be when she grew up. At the very minimum, she would not lose to her elder sister, Lan Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, this is the sword my sister owes you.\u201d Claire took the box from Li Mingyu and handed it to the crown prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The crown prince was a bit uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister said that she\u2019s very apologetic for breaking your highness\u2019s sword that day.\u201d Claire was raising the box to the crown prince, no intentions of taking it back.</p><br/><p>The crown prince accepted the box. Meanwhile, his gaze was wandering. Li Mingyu secretly felt amused. Sure enough, as Claire predicted, the crown prince was looking for Lan Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, if you\u2019re not busy, please stay for a meal.\u201d Li Mingyu invited, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Is Miss Lan Ling not here?\u201d The crown prince finally couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin Lan Ling just arrived at our country. She hasn\u2019t adjusted yet and is resting.\u201d Li Mingyu lied on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so.\u201d The crown prince paused. Li Mingyu\u2019s words seemed suspicious. But in any case, why was Lan Ling not seeing anyone, including him? Unless she was actually feeling unwell?</p><br/><p>That afternoon, the Li clan elders were full of awe. How long had it last been when the Li clan was at a level where they could eat with the crown prince? And yet, currently, the crown prince was sitting at the main seat, conversing with Li Mingyu and laughing at times.</p><br/><p>Claire ate peacefully, noticing out of the corner of her eye that the crown prince was a little distracted. Of course, she knew what he was thinking about. She sighed inwardly. Who would have thought that the crown prince was also ordinary, actually fascinated by Lan Ling. Although it wasn\u2019t very obvious, it was already beginning to show. But Claire wasn\u2019t too worried. She could see that the crown prince was no simple figure. He knew how to see the big picture. Even if he was very pleased with Lan Ling, if it came down to it, he could sacrifice Lan Ling for the greater good of the country in a heartbeat. Such a person was a true ruler.</p><br/><p>After lunch, the crown prince still hadn\u2019t met who he had came to see, but he couldn\u2019t say it either, so he just left.</p><br/><p>The Li clan was still as busy as a marketplace, flowers and gifts continuously sent in. Even Li Mingyu felt a little bit of a headache. Meanwhile, the Li clan elders were extremely excited. How long had it been since the Li clan had been so active? Could the Li clan reclaim its radiance? Their gazes towards Claire were now completely different. Before, their gazes were filled with hatred and fear, but now, they were fawning and full of hope. They could see the chance of the Li clan reclaiming its glory! Just thinking about it made them enthusiastic. They couldn\u2019t care less about who was the one bringing back their glory any more.</p><br/><p>At nightfall, Claire stood alone at a high rooftop, a soft breeze greeting her face, her thoughts wandering far away. Reviving the Li clan would strengthen Lagark. Was it right or wrong? If Grandfather knew, would he be angry? If Mother knew, would she be content?</p><br/><p>\u201cWifey, what are you worrying about? Such an expression doesn\u2019t suit you at all,\u201d a familiar voice suddenly crept right into Claire\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes instantly widened. She turned around quickly and saw the person floating beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Yixuan\u2026\u201d Claire stared fixed at the person before her. His red hair was still so flamboyant, his dark eyes staring at Claire intensely, just floating, smiling. Claire hadn\u2019t even sensed when he had come near!</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! Claire stared at Feng Yixuan with wide eyes. He was floating? And there was a wind whirling around him?! Looking carefully, there was actually a pair of translucent wings extending from Feng Yixuan\u2019s back, transparent and shapeless! She watched intently as Feng Yixuan descended and stood beside Claire, grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d Claire said finally after a long time. Yes, the feeling Feng Yixuan gave off was completely different from before. He had become powerful! Extremely powerful!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy seal was undone.\u201d Feng Yixuan laughed. \u201cIn the future, I can protect my wifey. And I will continue to become stronger until I can destroy the mark on your hand.\u201d Although he was laughing, his eyes were filled with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you ice attributed?\u201d Claire was a bit puzzled as she watched the wings on Feng Yixuan\u2019s back slowly fade away.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m ice AND wind attributed,\u201d Feng Yixuan said a little cockily. \u201cWhat do you think? Aren\u2019t I awesome? I\u2019m now a double elemental magician.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou undid your seal?\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes sharpened as she asked in a low voice, \u201cI remember Shui Wenmo said that you were currently totally unable to bear the power of the seal. Also, what is the seal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I standing here perfectly fine?\u201d Feng Yixuan shrugged and said casually, \u201cMy seal was created the moment I was born, because every few generations, an exceptional person possessing the powerful ability to control wind appears in the Feng clan*. But because the power is too strong, many people of the past were shredded by wind blades before they could use the could control the power properly, so every time such a person is born, their power is sealed immediately.\u201d Although Feng Yixuan was saying this very casually, Claire understood exactly how dangerous Feng Yixuan\u2019s actions where. No wonder Shui Wenmo had tried to stop him so desperately. One mistake and he would have been torn to shreds.</p><br/><p>*Feng means wind. Dunno if I mentioned that before. BTW Shui means water so hmmm</p><br/><p>\u201cBut hah! I\u2019m perfectly fine right now. Ah, wifey, you\u2019re still wearing the glove I gave you, haha. One day, I\u2019ll personally take off the glove for you\u2026\u201d Feng Yixuan grabbed Claire\u2019s right hand with one swipe, laughing heartily, but before he finished speaking, Feng Yixuan\u2019s handsome face was greeted with Claire\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan hugged his face, grimacing painfully as he howled and squatted down.</p><br/><p>Claire retracted her fist coldly. \u201cIf you keep on screaming, I\u2019ll beat you until your face is full of bruises. If you touch me again, I\u2019ll slaughter you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan, still covering his face, muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone else around.</p><br/><p>As Claire\u2019s eyes sharpened, Feng Yixuan immediately shut up.</p><br/><p>Claire stared at the crouching Feng Yixuan, her feelings complex. He had actually risked his life to undo the seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, how did you find this place? How did you know I was here?\u201d Claire suddenly thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Feng Yixuan bounced up and down very proudly. \u201cOf course I knew. I\u2019ve known where you were the moment you entered the city. And I also know that you will represent the Li clan at the martial arts tournament.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s eyes instantly flashed. Right, the Feng clan was one of the four major clans of Lagark. How could they not be aware?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will represent the Li clan.\u201d Claire nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the time comes, I will be representing the Feng clan. Shui Wenmo will be representing the Shui clan and the sworn enemy of the Li clan, the Hua clan, will send Hua Yilin. Hua Yilin is very brutal and cunning and, unfortunately, is truly strong. Before, both Shui Wenmo and I weren\u2019t his match. But now, humph!\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s tone had turned icy as he finished speaking. Evidently, both Feng Yixuan and Shui Wenmo had suffered in the hands of this person called Hua Yilin.</p><br/><p>Claire fell silent, pondering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope I face him the first round so I get the chance to beat him,\u201d Feng Yixuan said coldly, gritting his teeth. Of course, he was hoping that Claire and Hua Yilin would not become opponents. It was too dangerous. Although the martial arts tournament was only called a friendly competition, if there really was a mishap, there would be no way to confirm if it was on accident or on purpose. He didn\u2019t want Claire to be the insane Hua Yilin\u2019s first opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he a magician or a warrior?\u201d Claire inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth. Actually, he shouldn\u2019t be classified as a warrior or magician. He can control water with his ancient technique and mold water. He\u2019s so proficient, he can condense water from air, difficult to deal with.\u201d Feng Yixuan was completely serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Claire nodded. Fortunately, she had learned about him beforehand for if she drew lots and faced him in the first round before witnessing his capabilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, I need to go back. I only have half an hour. See you two months later, wifey. Take care of yourself.\u201d Feng Yixuan flew up immediately with a swoosh, fast enough so that Claire couldn\u2019t react in time and punch him again. He glanced meaningfully at Claire, then left, flapping away.</p><br/><p>Claire watched as Feng Yixuan disappeared into the night, silent for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow thoughtful of him. He came specially just to tell you about Hua Yilin.\u201d Li Yuewen\u2019s voice suddenly appeared behind Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin Yuewen.\u201d Claire turned and was met with Li Yuewen\u2019s apathetic expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy was Feng Yixuan?\u201d Although it was a question, her tone was certain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Claire nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that fellow was defeated by you at Amparkland, he became a running joke. After he returned, that t-rex mother of his chased him for hundreds of streets.\u201d A delighted smile appeared on Li Yuewen\u2019s lips, taking joy in his misfortune.</p><br/><p>Claire went . If Li Yuewen hadn\u2019t mentioned it, she would have forgotten about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut in any case, if you face him in the tournament, what will he do?\u201d Li Yuewen crossed her arms, looking far into the distance of the dark night.</p><br/><p>If she faced Feng Yixuan in the tournament, what would happen?</p><br/><p>Claire stared into the vast darkness of the night, silent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

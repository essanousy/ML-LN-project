It was for no other reason than she was looking at Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother \u2026\u201d She was somewhat surprised to see him here.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior apprentice-sister.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang nodded politely in greeting. No matter what, this Talina showed her concern for him while she was in the canteen, and Qi Ao Shuang still had a good impression of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, when are we leaving?\u201d Seeing the look in Tanina\u2019s eyes, a trace of craftiness that was hard to notice appeared in her eyes. She silently moved closer to Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cA while.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang spat out two words.</p><br/><p>Tarina\u2019s eyes fell on Parina, a complex emotion flashing in her eyes. Who was this woman? What relationship did he have with Xiao Aushuang? Why together? It seemed to be related to a different feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, you \u2026\u201d Tarina opened her mouth, but she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarina, is this your junior apprentice-brother?\u201d If you want to come with us, we can take care of you. \u201d The man next to her spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Tarina was overjoyed. These two powerful men were the senior brothers of the sect that Yunia belonged to. Out of respect for Yuna, they had brought her along. If only he could bring Qi Ao Shuang with him.</p><br/><p>Before she could say anything, Qi Ao Shuang already spoke up, \u201cThank you for your kind intentions senior, there\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression changed slightly as a trace of anger flashed in his eyes. The meaning behind his words was clear. He was saying that Xiao Aushuang did not know what was good for her.</p><br/><p>Talina opened her mouth slightly, not knowing what to say. All men had their own pride. Could it be that the actions of her senior had hurt her pride? Tarina felt regret in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, be careful. We\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201d said Eunia at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior apprentice-brother, be careful.\u201d After quite a while, Tanina forced out these words. Actually, she really wanted to let Qi Aoshuang know how to do what she wanted. If she couldn\u2019t, then she didn\u2019t want to keep moving forward. He didn\u2019t want anything to happen to Qi Ao Shuang, but because he was afraid of hurting her self-esteem in front of so many people, he didn\u2019t say it out loud.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded, not saying anything else.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Tanina\u2019s group left. Before she left, she even turned to look at Qi Ao Shuang, her eyes filled with worry.</p><br/><p>Parina\u2019s mouth twitched, her heart was filled with sorrow. It couldn\u2019t be that this lousy blockhead who didn\u2019t know how to cherish the fairer sex really had a woman take a fancy to him?</p><br/><p>Only after they were far away did she squat down. She looked at Xiao Ao Shuang and asked with a teasing tone, \u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang, who is that woman?\u201d Your senior sister? Why do I feel like she\u2019s looking at you differently? \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang ignored him and started rummaging through her storage ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, does that woman like you?\u201d Parina did not hesitate to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe treated all her junior brothers and sisters like this.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang finally replied coldly. As far as Xiao Ao Shuang was concerned, this was the truth. This senior apprentice-sister Talena was extremely caring towards her disciples. She was a kind-hearted woman.</p><br/><p>Parina rolled her eyes. Is that really true? Or was the rotten wood too slow? The way the woman looked at him was clearly different. Heh heh, but this is good too. It was extremely beneficial for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, where\u2019s Chang Kong?\u201d Parina asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tired and resting.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, where do you want to rest?\u201d \u201cDo you have a beast bag with a spirit beast?\u201d Parina blinked her eyes and asked. There was no air in the interspatial ring, and creatures could not stay inside. If that was the case, then Qi Ao Shuang must have a special bag like the one used to store the spirit beasts. It wasn\u2019t really that valuable.</p><br/><p>Xiao Aushuang did not reply, she did not want to tell anyone of Chang Kong\u2019s true identity. Seeing that Qi Ao Shuang did not reply, Parina assumed that he had tacitly agreed.</p><br/><p>Under Perina\u2019s astonished gaze, Qi Aushuang took out the barbecue utensils and seasonings, started a bonfire and started the barbecue. Oil dripped from the grilled meat onto the firewood, and the smell of it wafted into Parina\u2019s nose. Parina swallowed her saliva as she watched the barbecue gradually turn yellow and enticing. \u201cYou, you know how to barbecue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything, and her eyes became misty as she looked at the roast meat. She thought of all her friends, of the dinner on Wind Island that day. As if it was yesterday, they were so close to him. However, in the past, everyone was no longer by his side. When would he be able to reunite with them? Was there a day like that? There must be.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Ao Shuang finished roasting the meat, he cut off half of it for Parina.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, here for me?\u201d Parina was a little surprised. Looking at the roast meat, she pointed at herself and asked doubtfully. This cold rotten wood would actually voluntarily give it to him to eat?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget it.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said indifferently, preparing to take it back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said I didn\u2019t want it?\u201d Seeing her right hand being burned, Parina hurriedly reached out to snatch it away from her. She even cried out in alarm, \u201cSo hot, so hot ~ ~ ~\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang ate her food silently, paying no more attention to Parina.</p><br/><p>While she ate the roast, Parina glanced at Qi Ao Shuang. While praising the delicious taste of the roast meat in his heart, he became even more doubtful of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s identity. Although this guy was cold, his heart didn\u2019t seem that bad, and he even cooked delicious roasted meat. If he really did become her boyfriend, it would be pretty good too. Pah pah pah pah! What was he thinking? This wasn\u2019t his original intention. His goal was to capture this fellow\u2019s heart and then torture him to death.</p><br/><p>After resting, the two of them continued on their journey. After passing through the small forest, they arrived at the fourth level without a hitch. The fourth level was actually a huge lake. The waters of the lake were crystal clear, and the aquatic plants below could be seen clearly by the fish swimming about. However, this water was strangely clear. There were no ripples at all. Even the fish swimming in the water did not change the flow of the water around the fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you pass through this lake, you can reach the next layer. However, this lake wasn\u2019t that easy. \u201cThis lake can only bear very light weights. It can\u2019t fly, nor can it build ships, let alone swim over.\u201d She picked up a piece of wood from the side and threw it down, but the wood sank.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee?\u201d A thing as heavy as a piece of wood can\u2019t float on it. However\u2026 Parina picked up a leaf the size of a basketball and dropped it on top of the tree. The leaf floated on the surface of the water. \u201cI can only bear this weight. No matter how big the leaf is, it won\u2019t be able to bear it.\u201d Parina explained.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stared at the leaves on the lake, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>A sly smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. Damn brat, let\u2019s see if you can get help from me this time? You can\u2019t get across this lake without me. Let\u2019s see what you can do!</p><br/><p>Parina was secretly pleased with herself. She narrowed her eyes, waiting for Qi Ao Shuang to ask her. After which, she decided on how she would wash up and mock him before bringing him over. However, in the next moment, Parina\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang gently stomped her feet on the ground as she walked forward, standing lightly on the leaf. However, the leaf was not affected at all. It was still floating on the surface of the water. In the next moment, a breeze blew past, and the leaves on the water slowly moved forward with Qi Ao Shuang in tow.</p><br/><p>Parina\u2019s eyes were wide open as she watched Xiao Ao Shuang leisurely drifting forward. She was speechless for a long time. How did this happen? Why did this guy seem like he had no weight? Why was he able to stand on the leaves and float past them?</p><br/><p>As Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s figure got farther and farther away, Parina finally came back to her senses and grunted angrily. Then he crouched down and put his hand to the surface of the water and muttered something. Very quickly, the surface of the water before her rippled. A huge turtle floated up. She jumped onto the tortoise\u2019s back, which was around the size of a round table, and ordered the tortoise to chase after her.</p><br/><p>When Parina caught up to Qi Ao Shuang, she bared her fangs and brandished her claws as she asked, \u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang, how did you do it?\u201d How can you stand on these leaves? \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang remained silent, not replying. Her eyes fell on the group of people in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang, I was asking you a question, how did you do it?\u201d \u201cAre you not human, are you a ghost?\u201d Parina\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but she immediately curled her lips, secretly laughing at how she could say such brainless words.</p><br/><p>The group that Qi Ao Shuang saw was none other than Talina and the rest. However, their situation didn\u2019t look too good. This was because their faces were somewhat anxious. The four of them were standing on a light blue disk that floated gracefully on the surface of the water. Clearly, the disk was the treasure of one of them. However, the disk was only floating there, not moving forward at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo me a favor and I owe you one.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d At first, Parina was afraid that she had misheard him. This cold guy actually wanted her to help him? That can\u2019t be true, right?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang remained silent, not repeating what she said earlier. His face, however, was as calm as ever.</p><br/><p>Parina pursed her lips and said unhappily, \u201cFine, fine, fine. What can I do for you?\u201d However, he was secretly delighted in his heart. Damn brat, you also have a day like today! You have a day when you ask for yourself. Hahaha ~ ~ See how I will mock you in the future after I help you!</p><br/><p>\u201cTake those men to the other side.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang pointed at the group of people and said indifferently.</p><br/><p>Perina looked in the direction Qi Ao Shuang was pointing at, and saw that Tanina and the others were trapped on the spot. She immediately became angry. So this bastard wanted me to help someone else? She thought that he had a request for her, but who knew that it was to help others, or to help that woman!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to help them?\u201d Why should I listen to you? \u201cWhy should I help them?\u201d Parina was furious and very unhappy. Because the plan in his heart didn\u2019t work out. He had wanted to see the dejected look on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d \u201cStill not helping?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not say anything else, only asking this kind of question in a neutral tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d Help! But remember, you owe me a favor. \u201d Parina resented the idea and urged the tortoise to swim forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d \u201cWait for me on the shore,\u201d said Qi Ao Shuang as she said that. Her body sped up, passing by Parina and landing lightly on the ground, \u201cI will wait for you on the shore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d After hearing the last sentence from Qi Ao Shuang, her heart finally felt a little better.</p><br/><p>Just like that, Qi Ao Shuang floated past Ta Lina and the rest. Without even glancing at them, she floated forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother?!\u201d Tarina naturally saw Qi Ao Shuang and let out a low shout of astonishment. The others were also surprised to see Qi Ao Shuang gently floating on the surface of the water. What magic is this?</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother?\u201d They didn\u2019t even look at you! \u201cTo think that you were worried about him earlier.\u201d Yuna looked at the back of Qi Ao Shuang and her face turned dark. She grunted unhappily. However, how did this guy manage to float on the water?</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a person is indeed not worth worrying about.\u201d The man beside Yuna also disdainfully spoke up to belittle Xiao Ao Shuang. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about him, but he doesn\u2019t put you in his eyes at all.\u201d Although his tone was disdainful, there was also a faint hint of jealousy, because he could not walk on the surface of the water like Qi Ao Shuang did. No wonder this red-haired kid refused to go along with them. So he had some ability after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe never wanted to help you, hmph!\u201d Yuna looked at the retreating back of Qi Ao Shuang, and her heart filled with hatred. It was all thanks to Talina who stood up straight in the cafeteria, that ungrateful bastard! \u201cSenior apprentice-brother, what\u2019s wrong with this floating disc of yours?\u201d \u201cHurry up and replenish your magic, how long are we going to be stuck here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo add, to add, I\u2019m already very fast.\u201d The other man was sweating profusely as he explained, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any confidence in his words. He hadn\u2019t expected such a situation to occur either, and it had been a long time since it was completed. This was bad. He might have to stay here for a few days.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s back, a complicated expression appeared on Tanina\u2019s face. Did he really leave just like that without even looking at himself? Was he really that kind of person? In her heart, however, she didn\u2019t want to believe that Qi Ao Shuang was such a person.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you guys trapped?\u201d Suddenly, a female voice that seemed to have heard it before reached everyone\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Tarina and the others turned, puzzled, only to see a woman standing behind them, staring at them with wide eyes, atop the back of an enormous turtle. Everyone was surprised when they saw this. This woman actually managed to cross the lake in such a manner. How strange! However, there were indeed many capable mutants in the Star Academy. Although they were unique, they definitely weren\u2019t the only ones. After a moment of surprise, everyone returned to their normal state.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d We\u2019re in a bit of trouble. \u201d Yunia\u2019s senior apprentice-brother spoke out in an embarrassed manner. He knew that the floater could not be repaired in a short time. Maybe a few days on the water.</p><br/><p>Of course, Talina could recognize this woman. It was the woman who was walking with Qi Ao Shuang. Some wondered why they had split up, but did not ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need any help?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll lead you there. It\u2019s not like I can stay here forever.\u201d Instead of being overbearing, Parina\u2019s tone was mild. She knew that if she was too arrogant at this moment and these people couldn\u2019t get angry at her for a moment, then she wouldn\u2019t be able to take them away and wouldn\u2019t be able to make that cold blockhead owe her a favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, thank you very much.\u201d \u201cThank you, senior apprentice-brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small matter. Everyone, come up.\u201d With a smile, Parina let the tortoise step forward and let them all step forward. After Una\u2019s senior brother put away the floating disc, Parina drove the turtle to swim forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you so much.\u201d Yuna opened her mouth to thank him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Parina replied politely, but her heart was filled with sorrow. Who would be willing to let Chickie save you guys? If it wasn\u2019t for that lousy piece of wood, I wouldn\u2019t have done such a thankless and thankless thing.</p><br/><p>With a complicated expression, it was unknown what she was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cTanina, look at how kind he is. He doesn\u2019t look like your junior apprentice-brother at all.\u201d Hmph! \u201cIngratitude!\u201d \u201cThink about it, you didn\u2019t even care about your own safety when you were in the cafeteria. Just now, you were so worried about him. Look at him, when he passed by, he didn\u2019t even look at you!\u201d \u201cIs he worth your kindness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Talina didn\u2019t say anything, and her eyes dimmed a little.</p><br/><p>When Parina heard this, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a wave of displeasure in her heart. Everyone on the turtle\u2019s back, except Parina, was shocked. Even after they had steadied themselves, they were still a little afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, everyone, stand still.\u201d Parina acted like nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, Yunya, enough.\u201d All right, Yunya, enough. One of the men spoke up to comfort them.</p><br/><p>Yuna let out a cold snort, her face as grim as ever. She no longer spoke.</p><br/><p>But the more Parina listened, the angrier she got. Worse than that piece of rotten wood! Hmph, when we get ashore, I\u2019ll see how I\u2019ll wash off you bastards. You guys are the ones who are ungrateful!</p><br/><p>When they got to the shore, they were naturally very grateful to Parina. At this time, however, Parina\u2019s face darkened. She said with a strange tone, \u201cThank you for the wrong person. Do you really think I ate too much and had nothing better to do than to help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yunia and the others were stunned. They didn\u2019t understand how the woman in front of them could change her expression so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the heart to help you useless fellows. A mere lake is able to trap you in the middle. Useless. If Qi Ao Shuang didn\u2019t ask me to help you, do you think I would have come to help you? \u201cUngrateful. I wonder who is ungrateful and ungrateful!\u201d Seeing the wonderful expressions on everyone\u2019s faces, she felt extremely satisfied. Since they had already been brought ashore, she would owe them a debt of gratitude. Naturally, she would take advantage of this opportunity to mock them.</p><br/><p>The faces of Yuna and the group were extremely marvelous. They were constantly changing, the color of their livers was red, and in the end, they could not say a word. There were astonishment, gratitude, gratitude, shame, and regret \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that lousy piece of wood finally owes me a favor this time. Let\u2019s see how I torture him!\u201d Before leaving, Parina laughed out loud and left. Only Yunya and the others remained where they were with complicated expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>Yuna stared angrily at the departing figure of Parina, unable to say a single word for a long time. So this despicable woman didn\u2019t have any good intentions! As she listened to her last words, Tarina\u2019s heart was filled with worry. He was also regretting how he could accept this woman\u2019s help so easily. This time, he was going to make things difficult for Xiao Ao Shuang. What should he do?</p><br/><p>Parina chased after him, a strange sense of joy rising in her heart as she saw Qi Ao Shuang standing in front of her, waiting for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, let\u2019s go.\u201d Parina happily said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang glanced at the somewhat abnormal Parina, but didn\u2019t inquire further. She only nodded faintly and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Then he walked on.</p><br/><p>Parina followed with a smile, in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the more he ascended, the fewer people there were. He saw fewer and fewer students along the way. Some people could no longer move forward and did not want to lose their lives. They simply gave up and used the only teleportation scroll given by the academy to return. Naturally, there would be teachers to judge their trial levels.</p><br/><p>Even Qi Ao Shuang was able to pass the fifth level without any difficulties. She finally understood that this red-haired fellow\u2019s strength was definitely not inferior to those 6-star students.</p><br/><p>The sixth level was a bit difficult. The sixth level was a flat plain, but there was a massive tornado blowing on the plain, and it never stopped. To get to the next level, you need to safely pass through this violent cyclone. Many people were left with only half their lives after the tornado, so they gave up on moving forward. He only obtained the proof of his strength as a 6-star esper.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked up at the huge tornado, the tornado roared, its violent power seemed to tear people apart. Qi Ao Shuang looked up and saw an embarrassing scene. In the sky above the tornado, there were countless shreds of clothes, and some belongings were still roiling about. The clothes and belongings of those who had obviously entered the cyclone were swept up into the sky.</p><br/><p>This violent tornado may be difficult for others, but it\u2019s a piece of cake for Qi Ao Shuang. All the winds were Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s friends \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang entered the tornado with a calm face, and Parina quickly followed behind. As expected, wherever Qi Aushuang went, the tornado would not go berserk, instead, it would gently circle around Qi Aushuang, or even hover around her body gently. This was the first time she had seen the wind so close to a person. Even if this guy had a wind attribute physique and used wind magic, there was no need to exaggerate things so much. This guy, who exactly was he? Parina followed closely by Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s side, pulling her by the sleeves of her robe and passing through without a hitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is the first time I\u2019ve passed so easily.\u201d After passing through this tornado, Parina patted her chest, stuck out her tongue and said playfully, \u201cI used to be the one who caused all this trouble.\u201d This tornado was very strange. The stronger a person was, the bigger they would be able to resist it. The weaker one would be able to resist it, but at the same time, they would be easily blown into the sky. \u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d Parina explained.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked at the tornado, deep in thought. This tornado was indeed very strange. After a long period of time, the strong would remain strong, and the weak would remain weak. However, no one dared to hide all their power and enter this tornado, because without any defense, the outcome would be very comedic, and they would be directly blown into the sky to fly a kite.</p><br/><p>Under the ground of this tornado, there seemed to be a mysterious force. It seemed to be faintly resonating with the Source of Wind in his body. It was a pity that the Wind Origin was resting. Otherwise, he could call it out and ask about it.</p><br/><p>As for the seventh level, it was more dangerous. As expected, it was on two levels compared to the sixth level and below. The number of people who passed was even fewer. This was a magical land. In the skies above, ice cones continued to descend. The cold wind howled through the air, piercing straight into the bones. However, the ground was extremely hot, and the temperature was abnormally high. Flames were continuously spewing out from the ground, and if one was not careful, they would be grilled to the ground. Half of it was hot, the other half was cold.</p><br/><p>Once a person stepped on it, their shoes would probably immediately be scorched and evaporated. He also needed to guard against the flames that were rising from the ground and the falling ice cones.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee?\u201d The seventh floor has been completely different since the beginning. I didn\u2019t go there the last time. It\u2019s too dangerous here. Some people were the cream of the crop in their sects, so they had masters to give them treasures. They could use them to pass through this place. A small number of people go by on their own. The eighth floor is even more difficult. No one has ever seen the ninth floor. Parina stood at the edge of the room and said while looking at the front with lingering fear in her heart.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang silently stared at the terrifying scene before her. The icicles in the sky unceasingly fell, violently stabbing into the ground. After which, there was an ear-piercing sizzling sound as they evaporated instantly. Flames continued to erupt from the ground. The high temperature of the flames seemed to be able to burn everything, making one\u2019s heart palpitate. What was even more troubling was that the spots where the flames were emitted were extremely irregular, and there was no way to predict where the flames would appear the next second.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t accompany you on your journey. Be careful on your journey.\u201d Suddenly, she frowned and thought of something, then said in a low voice, \u201cRight, the eighth floor is said to be a terrifying swamp. There are many rocks floating above the swamp, and you can only pass through by stepping on them.\u201d But not every rock can bear to stand on it. You have to be careful not to fall down. If you fall down, you will be beyond redemption. \u201cI heard it from someone. You have to be careful, don\u2019t die. Remember, you still owe me a favor that you haven\u2019t paid back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Parina knew that with her cultivation, she could not advance any further. He couldn\u2019t give Xiao Ao Shuang any more trouble, or else both of them would be in danger. The higher he went, the more dangerous it became. This was why there were people below the sixth level who were willing to bring along those who had a relationship with him, but after the sixth level and the sixth level, nothing like this would ever happen again. That would only harm people and themselves.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang turned to look at Parina and nodded, \u201cThank you, I will be careful.\u201d \u201cYou will also return alive to repay your favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s good that you know.\u201d Parina pursed her lips and snorted.

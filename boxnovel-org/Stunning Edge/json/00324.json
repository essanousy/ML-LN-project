These Seafolk all had long green curly hair, beautiful posture, fish tails, men and women, but the strange thing was that all of them had the same beautiful face, eyes, nose and eyebrows, as if carved from the same mold. Qi Ao Shuang fell into the sea. Without turning her head, she dived downwards, and all the Sea race members followed her. Leng Lingyun also followed closely behind.</p><br/><p>The depths of the ocean grew darker and darker. Countless fish saw them and fled in all directions. The Sea Race members held Qi Ao Shuang and kept moving deeper into the cave. Everything gradually went dark. At this time, the surrounding merfolk fins shone with a green light, illuminating the road ahead. Qi Ao Shuang did not seem to need to breathe, her face was cold, and she kept diving with a calm face.</p><br/><p>Gradually, a magnificent palace appeared before him. They were all made of milky white shells and emitted a faint white glow. There was no seawater in the palace. It was clear that he had used some sort of magic to separate the seawater. From afar, he saw a girl dressed in green clothes standing at the entrance of the palace as if she was waiting for something. She stood there barefooted, different from the rest of the Seafolk. She had a pair of beautiful legs.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression was cold as she swam over, slowly standing at the entrance of the palace. The green-clad girl had a beautiful face and an outstanding figure, but her pretty face was exactly the same as those Sea Tribes\u2019. When the Sea race saw the girl in cyan, they all prostrated themselves and bowed respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019re finally here.\u201d The green-clad girl knelt in front of Qi Ao Shuang with a pious look on her face, lowering her head with extreme respect.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun also followed, standing behind Qi Ao Shuang. The azure-clad lady didn\u2019t even raise her head as she spoke respectfully, \u201cSir Ru Bing, you\u2019ve come as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlueflower, thank you for your trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s voice was extremely cold, without any fluctuations or warmth. It was so cold that it penetrated deep into one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is my mission.\u201d That azure-dressed lady called Qinghua knelt on the ground respectfully and did not get up.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang said coldly without raising her eyes.</p><br/><p>Only then did Blueflower raise her head and slowly rise to her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang asked lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this servant\u2019s body.\u201d Blueflower said softly.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression did not change as she extended her hand to pierce through the azure flower\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d At this time, Leng Lingyun suddenly spoke to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows and turned to look at Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to disappear.\u201d Leng Lingyun looked at Qi Ao Shuang and said clearly.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly turned around, looking at Leng Lingyun, her eyes became colder and colder. The her Leng Lingyun spoke of wasn\u2019t Qinghua, but the real Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stared coldly at Leng Lingyun, advancing towards her step by step. Leng Lingyun did not even bother to dodge, and just stood there facing Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qi Ao Shuang raised her hand, and with a loud slap, she slapped Leng Lingyun in the face. A trace of blood slowly seeped out from the corner of Leng Lingyun\u2019s mouth; it was extremely shocking. As for Leng Lingyun, she did not dodge, and only stared at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fell in love with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face was terrifyingly dark.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun did not say a word, but just stood there looking at Xiao Ao Shuang. However, his eyes were filled with determination and perseverance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was furious, she raised her hand and was about to attack again.</p><br/><p>Qing Hua\u2019s face tightened as her heart leaped into her throat.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun did not dodge, and just stood there.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, very good, very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly laughed out loud, putting down her hands and said coldly: \u201cI will give you one more chance.\u201d \u201cIf none of you have passed this test, don\u2019t blame me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Only then did Leng Lingyun relax, and let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d No need to thank me so early! I\u2019ve been too indulgent with you! \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t take back your hearts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes were cold, she was truly enraged.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun did not say a word, and stood behind him with her head lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlueflower, just temporarily follow them.\u201d \u201cProtect them well.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiao Ao Shuang finished speaking coldly, she closed her eyes and slowly fell to the ground. Leng Lingyun stepped forward and hugged Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Bing, you shouldn\u2019t disobey your master.\u201d \u201cMaster\u2019s love for you is incomparable.\u201d Looking at Leng Lingyun\u2019s nervous expression, Qing Hua sincerely spoke.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun just looked at the person in her arms without saying a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Bing, the master made a big mistake because of your disappearance. That\u2019s why he\u2019s in such a difficult situation right now.\u201d \u201cLord Ice, please reconsider.\u201d Blueflower was still trying her best to persuade him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master seems to have only asked you to protect us, not to keep your mouth shut?\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes darkened, and she spat out these words coldly.</p><br/><p>Qing Hua was stunned. She stared at the ice-cold Leng Lingyun, unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang, who was in Leng Lingyun\u2019s arms, slowly woke up. The moment she woke up, she was facing Leng Lingyun\u2019s face. The worry in Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes gradually melted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang extended her hand and gently wiped away the blood at the corner of Leng Lingyun\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d Leng Lingyun revealed a warm smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve thought of everything \u2026\u201d There was a hint of melancholy in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes, as well as her feelings, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Can you really abandon her for me? \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled and held onto Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s hand, \u201cI will not let you disappear, I will not let you disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly revealed a smile, but it was a bitter one.</p><br/><p>By now, Blueflower was watching quietly from the sidelines, her fists clenched tightly. His smile should belong to his master! Didn\u2019t he not know how to cherish his master\u2019s love?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. If we go up, they\u2019ll probably be waiting impatiently for us.\u201d \u201cEspecially that tyrannosaurus, Feng Yixuan.\u201d Leng Lingyun smiled, put down Qi Ao Shuang, held her hand, and jumped into the sea.</p><br/><p>Qing Hua bit her lips, her eyes filled with dissatisfaction as she followed him.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the surface of the sea, the group of men was still frozen by Hua Li. When Feng Yi Xuan saw them approach, his eyes widened in fear and worry. He was afraid that Xiao Aushuang would understand.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang crouched down in front of Feng Yi Xuan and revealed a smile. \u201cYi Xuan, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was startled and his face finally relaxed.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun extended her hand and all the people were untied.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeng Lingyun, you bastard, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Feng Yixuan leaped up and was about to rush towards Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>However, a green shadow flashed across his eyes. When Feng Yixuan regained his senses, he saw a beautiful woman dressed in green standing in front of Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was stunned. What was going on with this blue-clothed woman?</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Flame, you still haven\u2019t changed.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s still as popular as ever. I still love playing around with Lord Ru Bing.\u201d The girl in cyan said with a gentle voice.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan frowned as he looked at Leng Lingyun, but she ignored him and turned her head to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Flame, have you recovered your memories yet?\u201d Qinghua asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans are stupid, of course they won\u2019t recover so quickly.\u201d Leng Lingyun spat out faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Feng Yixuan flew into a rage.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun ignored them, and Qinghua still stubbornly stood between them.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene in front of her, the corners of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s lips curled up in a faint smile.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun briefly explained Qinghua\u2019s identity, and did not mention what had happened between him and Qi Ao Shuang. Everyone was surprised and sighed endlessly. After this storm, everyone set off again. The expression in Blue Flower\u2019s eyes had always been that of his follower, Qi Ao Shuang. Feng Yi Xuan and Leng Lingyun sat beside Qi Ao Shuang. Feng Yi Xuan kept scolding Leng Lingyun, but Leng Lingyun remained silent. From time to time, she would smile at Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>After exiting the Bluesea, Mishus\u2019 mount also needed to rest. Thus, they descended into a large, lush canyon. After clearing out a piece of empty space, everyone felt relaxed under such a beautiful environment. Qi Ao Shuang sat to the side and watched Feng Yi Xuan roast the meat. Leng Lingyun had lit a fire while the others were also busy preparing some fresh food. Eating the dry rations carried in the interspatial ring all the time did not taste good.</p><br/><p>As Qi Ao Shuang smiled as she looked at the others busying themselves, she silently sat down beside Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t exist!\u201d They were both masters. Your presence has upset everything. \u201d Blue Flower\u2019s voice sounded in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s ear in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was stunned, turning to look at Qing Hua.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are superfluous, you are just an appendage. \u201cJust an impostor trying to rob his master of his love, you should say.\u201d Qing Hua\u2019s eyes were incomparably cold.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Qing Hua\u2019s face, and suddenly revealed a brilliant smile. Lowly but firmly, she replied: \u201cDo you know?\u201d I thought so. But I don\u2019t think so now. My existence must have my meaning. I have too many memories of my own, my own relatives and friends. I have ideals and hopes. I wish I could go back to the continent with them one day to visit my family, my friends, and live happily ever after. And you? \u2019 Qi Ao Shuang paused for a moment, before continuing, \u201cWho is the only enchanted item?\u201d You have no life of your own, no memory of your own, no family or friends of your own. You are the poor one. \u201d</p><br/><p>Qinghua was completely stunned, staring blankly at the determined look in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes, unable to say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will work hard to survive.\u201d \u201cDefinitely.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang stood up, and without turning back to look at Qing Hua, she walked straight towards the crowd in front. \u201cBecause, I have them.\u201d A voice drifted over.</p><br/><p>Because I have them.</p><br/><p>In this instant, Blueflower fell into a trance.</p><br/><p>For some reason, a ridiculous thought suddenly appeared in Qing Hua\u2019s mind. Her master and this woman would fight for her sooner or later!</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

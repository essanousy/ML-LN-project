A handsome young gentleman with with shiny blonde hair and soft blue eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, he will be your tutor from now on. He will teach you literature, geography, etc. every morning.\u201d Gordan led Camille in person into the study, and after introducing him to Claire, turned to Camille, \u201cCamille, sorry to trouble you from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so serious, your grace. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d Camille smiled warmly and nodded at Claire, \u201cMiss Claire, greetings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire had been standing for a while, and she also greeted, smiling,\u201cTeacher, please enlighten me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to call in the steward if you need anythings. I still have some business to do,\u201d Gordan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever pleases you, your grace.\u201d Camille smiled warmly, ever so gently and gracefully.</p><br/><p>Claire bowed, watching Gundan leave.</p><br/><p>Only the two of them were left in the spacious study. Camille looked uneasily at the young girl in front of him: a plain white dress with only a simple lace at the hem, her beautiful golden hair pulled up in a simple bun without any decorative accessories, but a deep, cold gaze within her green irises as cold as the night sky. This pure girl was the infamous male-chasing idiot of the capital?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease have a seat, teacher.\u201d Claire smiled.</p><br/><p>Camille was a bit surprised at Claire\u2019s indifferent smile. The girl was different from what he heard. Rumors said she was extremely attracted to the other gender, so Camille came with much preparation and thought. If it wasn\u2019t for giving the Duke face, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have undertaken this task. But, this girl in front of him felt\u2026 How to explain it\u2026 Although she was smiling, it felt completely fake, giving off an extremely cold feeling.</p><br/><p>Camille disregarded his confusion, settled his expression, and put on a professional smile. He took out a book he had brought. \u201cThen, Miss Claire, today let\u2019s start learning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I would like to inquire about this.\u201d Claire didn\u2019t look at the book in Camille\u2019s hand, but instead held up the book in her hand. Camille glanced, and was a little surprised. The book was <em>The History of Amparkland</em>.</p><br/><p>The morning passed peacefully without the imagined harassment, but in between Claire\u2019s never ending questions, Camille was astounded. The young girl seemed like a sponge, absorbing every single piece of information. All her questions were right to the point, some were so complex that even his master, Landis, wouldn\u2019t know the answers to.</p><br/><p>In the morning, they studied. In the afternoon, they rested. Camille left the castle exhausted, still confused and astonished.</p><br/><p>Jean, who had been faithfully standing outside the door, heard everything. He was even more confused than Camille. The man-crazy Miss didn\u2019t bother the handsome man right in front of her? Instead, she was asking such profound questions, some that concerned sensitive topics? What was happening?</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Claire sat leisurely in the greenhouse, reading a book while drinking the black tea her maids brought. A few other thick books were piled next to her. The servants standing further away gossiped among themselves, suspicious of their currently quiet Miss. Was she doing all these in order to please the Duke?</p><br/><p>Jean, as always, stood not far behind Claire expressionlessly, but this time, he gazed at her from behind curiously.</p><br/><p>Knowing the basics of the world now, Claire closed the book gently. Magic, Dou Qi; these concepts were blurry in her memories, but she finally understood them after reading the book. Jean, her personal, poker-faced knight, who was always beside her, used Dou Qi. The Lashia who hated her and tried to hurt her yesterday used magic, Lightning magic. And her control was good \u2013 Lashia had made her feel intense pain without creating any physical wounds. The nature of Claire\u2019s body was Fire, tested long ago. She never paid attention to this before nor cared to study it. Her Spiritual power results were also very ordinary. With Lashia the child prodigy around, all the glory and focus was on her, so Claire was destined to live in Lashia\u2019s shadow.</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s more accurate to say the previous Claire wasn\u2019t interested in anything besides handsome men. The corner of her mouth lifted imperceptibly into a bitter smile. Why did I transmigrate into this kind of a person\u2019s body?</p><br/><p>At this moment, a maid came in, bowed, and reported: \u201cMiss, his highness the second prince has come to visit you. He is waiting in the grand hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire frowned slightly. His highness, the second prince? Oh, right. The Claire from before fell off her horse trying to chase him, allowing her to enter Claire\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not seeing him. I\u2019m busy right now.\u201d Claire said casually, setting down the teacup and picking up another book to read.</p><br/><p>The maid just stared, standing there, unable to move. Jean was also speechless. Was this some plot to win the second prince\u2019s heart? Since when did this failure Miss become so smart? Using a method like this.</p><br/><p>The maid just stood there, unsure of what to do. How should she report back to his highness? What\u2019s up with Miss today? Usually when she heard that his highness was there, she would have run out like the wind. But today? Uncharacteristically, she said she wouldn\u2019t meet him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blocking the light,\u201d Claire stated impatiently, seeing the shadows on her book. She lifted her head and frowned at the maid who was too stunned to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d As if she had just awoken from a dream, the maid hurriedly withdrew to the grand hall.</p><br/><p>In the grand hall, his highness, the second prince, sat there indifferently, filled with disgust. It was all that man-crazy woman\u2019s fault, chasing after him and falling off that horse, injuring herself, but his father, the emperor, had scolded him and ordered him to come visit. He understood why; no matter how annoying she was, no matter how disliked she was by Duke Hill, she still was the granddaughter of the Duke. In any case, she did fall off that horse because of him, so it was his duty to come visit. But just thinking of how man-crazy the woman was, Nancy shuddered. Whatever, he\u2019ll just pretend she\u2019s an annoying fly, wish her well, and leave immediately.</p><br/><p>Nancy sighed and forced his heart to settle down. He waited for Claire to fly out of the door like an elegant butterfly. Finally, there were some footsteps and Nancy looked up at the door. He saw a maid with a weird expression, but not the girl who was infatuated with men like he had expected.</p><br/><p>Nancy, puzzled, look at the nervous maid who greeted him. Then she stuttered, \u201cYour highness, Miss\u2026 Miss she\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she hurt very seriously?\u201d Nancy asked, incredibly confused. Wasn\u2019t it clear that although she fell off the horse, she was completely fine?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d The maid stuttered, not daring to say anything else. She also didn\u2019t dare to say on her own accord that the Miss was too injured to meet the second prince, as she was a servant. Unless she was tired of living, she would keep quiet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d Nancy asked, getting a little impatient. What exactly was the man-crazy woman up to?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Miss said, said\u2026 said she doesn\u2019t have time!\u201d The maid finally got the words out. \u201cThe Miss says she won\u2019t see you. Your highness may leave now.\u201d After rushing through her words, the maid let out a long sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Nancy\u2019s expression immediately froze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

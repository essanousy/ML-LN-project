If that annoying girl was going to die, then let her die. It had nothing to do with her. But if Lashia died, the gentle Katherine would be heartbroken. Just thinking about the gentle Katherine made warmth emerge from her heart. For that gentle woman, Claire couldn\u2019t let that headstrong girl die.</p><br/><p>Nobody noticed the killing intent of the guy called Yixuan Feng. His smile was like a flower as he walked slowly onto the stage while the Sunrise Institute\u2019s students looked on him with hostility. He looked like he was casually taking an afternoon stroll. With his air of indolence, no one could discover his killing intent.</p><br/><p>The feelings that the youth Yixuan Feng and Lashia gave off were completely different. If this youth was a beast who concealed his true intents with a gentle smile, then Lashia would be an energetic little lamb.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Lashia, it\u2019s a great pleasure to see you again.\u201d Yixuan Feng said with an elegant bow. The genial smile on his face was strikingly irritating in Lashia\u2019s eyes. This youth\u2019s peers had almost murdered the senior! How despicable and hateful! She must take this into account and beat the heck out of him. Last time it was because the opposing side had something suddenly pop up that they had won. But this time it would be different, because in this period of time she had studied and practiced magic incessantly, improving herself persistently. This time, she would use her own strength to crush her opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201d Lashia coldly humphed and stopped talking, beginning to chant a short incantation. Countless small lightning bolts shot towards Yixuan Feng. Lashia understood that this wouldn\u2019t be able to damage Yixuan Feng; this was only to confuse him in order to stall for time to chant a longer and more powerful spell.</p><br/><p>A disdainful, cold smile appeared on Yixuan Feng\u2019s face. With a wave of his hand, a ray of glittering light dispersed outward, completely destroying the lightning bolts Lashia had created.</p><br/><p>Claire frowned. Yixuan Feng\u2019s offhanded use of magic sent off warning bells in her head. Yixuan Feng was actually an Ice attributed magician, and his power and strength had already long surpassed Lashia.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoho, your arrogant little sister is really out of luck now. They\u2019re on completely different levels.\u201d Walter\u2019s vulgar voice sounded in Claire\u2019s head. Many instances in the future would prove that Walter\u2019s foresight was so keen that it annoyed other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d Claire mentally communicated with Walter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2019s aura is very similar to my own.\u201d Walter smacked his lips and laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand, he\u2019s not a dark magician. I\u2019m saying that his way of thinking is the same as mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA sinister, crafty person who likes to strike while hidden, likes to plot, and smiles while killing.\u201d Claire coldly said. This person, humph, definitely wasn\u2019t just a magician. The aura emitting from the core of his body was an assassin\u2019s. There\u2019s nothing more scary than an assassin proficient in magic. An assassin couldn\u2019t fight a magician or warrior head on, because that would be like trying to break a rock with a pebble. But when a magician is meditating or a warrior is resting, an assassin can silently take their lives. Being both an assassin and a magician, that youth was truly terrifying.</p><br/><p>Walter\u2019s mouth twitched. Even though it was the truth, when it came from the little devil\u2019s mouth, it sounded so piercing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, I think with his power, that guy can already insta-cast. I reckon he\u2019s scheming something against your little sister.\u201d Walter blinked and continued to say useless stuff that Claire already knew.</p><br/><p>To save or not to save?</p><br/><p>\u201cHurricane! Storm clouds! Lighting! Comply with the ancient contract and come to my side! \u2013 Thunderbolts descend!\u201d Lashia\u2019s chanting was coming to an end. It would not feel good if anyone was struck by this spell. Ordinary people would certainly die, and normal magic shields wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand this type of attack either. Many on-looking magicians felt a tightening in their chests, wondering diffidently, that if it were them, could they have blocked this terrorizing assault.</p><br/><p>The rumbling of thunder became louder and louder, and the color drained from the faces of everyone. Mozart, the principle of Sunrise Institute, nodded his head, pleased. The recent growth Lashia had was very satisfying. The ambassador squinted at the Lashia on the stage without expression. Even though this young girl was powerful, she was not powerful enough to be of any threat to them, or they wouldn\u2019t have left her to grow until now. Cliff yawned, a little bored, and glanced towards the dress of the servant girl behind him.</p><br/><p>The wind howled, storm clouds filled the sky, and thunder boomed. Soon, the stage became darker.</p><br/><p>But Yixuan Feng looked unruffled. He just stood there elegantly, almost like he was waiting for Lashia to finish chanting her spell.</p><br/><p>Claire watched the stage becoming darker and darker and her heart sank. In such a condition, there was no way to see clearly what happens onstage. At least for most people. Claire\u2019s sharp vision caught the faint but cold smile on Yixuan Feng\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>It was the smile of death!</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng\u2019s fingers moved slightly and a tiny icicle appeared between his fingers. Because of the looming thunderbomb, he only released a transparent shield for others to see. Then Yixuan Feng also started chanting, and a dense forest of icicles of different sizes appeared before him, ready to counterattack. Only the tiny icicle hidden between his fingers was slightly different, clear-cut and sharp. There seemed to be a faint, strange aura about it, but Claire couldn\u2019t understand what it was.</p><br/><p>The one thing that Claire did understand was what this cruel and cunning youth wanted to do. He was going to receive this blow from Lashia, then counterattack with his dense icicles, but then secretly shoot the tiny icicle from between his fingers into Lashia\u2019s chest! Although Cliff had added protective magic shields on Lashia\u2019s vitals, Claire wasn\u2019t positive that the youth couldn\u2019t forcefully break the shield and stab the icicle into Lashia\u2019s heart. In the last round, the competitor from Sunrise Institute was almost beaten to death and the shields had cracked, and Claire was sure that that flirty guy didn\u2019t use all his strength. Then what about this Yixuan Feng? How scary was his power and strength? Most importantly, although both countries didn\u2019t want to lose their students in the competition and added the magic shields, if someone accidentally died during the fighting, there wouldn\u2019t be any investigation or trial. Accident, the word accident; it seems like this youth called Yixuan Feng was going to use this word to its fullest.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, in a split second, the two attacked.</p><br/><p>Claire saw very clearly that Yixuan Feng was about to shoot out the special small icicle following closely behind a huge icicle that was aimed for Lashia\u2019s chest. Even if Lashia could block the normal large icicle, there was no way she could defend against the special small icicle hidden behind it.</p><br/><p>The lightning moved, the icicle moved. Yixuan Feng had on a smile that was like the spring wind.</p><br/><p>In that instant, Claire\u2019s gaze became profound and her pupils suddenly widened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

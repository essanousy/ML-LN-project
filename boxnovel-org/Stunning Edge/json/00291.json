Qi Ao Shuang was also stunned.</p><br/><p>There was no other reason but the fact that Dittas had appeared silently in front of them, standing in front of the Nine Heavens City Lord.</p><br/><p>With a calm expression, Dittos stood before the two of them and looked at them indifferently.</p><br/><p>As for the Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord, he was ecstatic as he shouted anxiously, \u201cDittas! Dittas!\u201d It\u2019s good that you\u2019re here. These two people want to kill me, you save me. You can kill them. Help me kill them! \u201d At the end, the Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord yelled out crazily.</p><br/><p>There was not the slightest change in the expression of Dittos. He only looked calmly at Qi Ao Shuang and said faintly, \u201cAre you the one who wanted to kill him?\u201d \u201cReason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he must die.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said this with a calm face. This was not a valid reason. Even if he said it, he wouldn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos!\u201d What\u2019s the use of talking to them, Dittos? \u201cKill them for me!\u201d The Nine Heavens City\u2019s Mayor shouted hysterically from behind him, \u201cHurry!\u201d Do you want your sister to be a widow? \u201d</p><br/><p>With a cold and detached expression, Dentance looked at Qi Ao Shuang but did not say anything. Qi Ao Shuang did not dodge, but met his eyes.</p><br/><p>Johansson blinked and said nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos!\u201d What the hell are you doing? Don\u2019t you understand what\u2019s going on? They want to kill me! They just tried to assassinate me! The Nine Heavens City Lord shouted angrily in embarrassment, but he did not dare to attack Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan. He knew that he was far from being their match, and he also understood the erratic personality of Dittas. If he did, Dittos might stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he died, there\u2019s still someone who can become the Nine Heavens City Lord, and that person will be even better than him.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d The Nine Heavens City lord cried out in shock and looked at Qi Ao Shuang in disbelief. Then, he jumped up as if he was stepped on by his tail and pointed his finger at Qi Ao Shuang, \u201cI know, I know, I know!\u201d That little bastard sent you! He had never thought that he could be so capable! I really should have gotten rid of him earlier! \u201cI heard that he has some ability now, but I didn\u2019t expect him to be able to instruct you!\u201d The Nine Heavens City Lord cursed angrily. He was extremely shocked in his heart. He never thought that the useless bastard would increase his strength so greatly in such a short period of time, not to mention that he would actually invite this year\u2019s Star Academy envoy to assassinate him.</p><br/><p>Still, Dotans did not show any expression. He merely looked at Xiao Ao Shuang and asked faintly, \u201cIs that what you wish to see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang answered with a simple and forceful word.</p><br/><p>Without another word, Dittos waved his right hand gently. His actions were extremely casual and casual.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the noisy voice of the Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord suddenly vanished, and a huge bloody hole appeared on his chest. Through the bloody hole he could see the crude carriage behind him. And the heart of the Nine Heavens City\u2019s lord had been crushed into smithereens without a trace. Blood continued to flow out crazily without a sound \u2026</p><br/><p>The Lord of the Nine Heavens City looked at Dittos and indifferently retracted his hand. Then, he slowly lowered his head to look at his chest. His eyes were filled with disbelief and fear.</p><br/><p>Jonathan opened his mouth and looked at the scene in front of him. Looking at the hands of Dentance and then at the completely dead City Lord of the Nine Heavens City on the ground, he immediately forgot to think about it.</p><br/><p>And so Dittos had casually killed his brother-in-law, the husband of his favorite sister! The Nine Heavens City Lord was dead!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart slowly chilled, but she was not surprised. It was as if Dittas had expected this.</p><br/><p>A cold aura enveloped the surroundings. Jonathan looked at the corpse on the ground and swallowed his own saliva. With a \u2018gurgle\u2019, he did not say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Dotans casually said something and was about to leave with a calm face. It was as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded, then turned around and followed after him.</p><br/><p>The people in the carriage did not show themselves, nor did they make any sound. Jonathan blinked at the carriage and followed silently. He didn\u2019t need to worry about the fact that the body would be cleaned up.</p><br/><p>After walking to the front, Jin Yan stood to the side and waited with an indifferent expression. Beside him, there were two people lying on the floor, as if they were dead asleep. The two men had been dead for a long time. When Jin Yan saw Qi Ao Shuang and her group come out, he didn\u2019t feel surprised when he saw Dittins. He just followed them silently.</p><br/><p>The forest quieted down, and only the faint sound of wind could be heard.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a slight rustling sound echoed out. Someone came to take care of the aftermath. A group of men in black quickly cleaned up the floor and carried away the corpses. Everything was restored to its original state.</p><br/><p>When everything was over, the curtain of the carriage was lifted by a slender, snow-white hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll gone?\u201d A soft and seductive voice rang out in the forest. This voice was mesmerizing, making people want to peep into her beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, miss, they\u2019re gone.\u201d In the darkness of the night, an intangible voice answered in a low voice. He could only hear people\u2019s voices, but not see them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that red-haired youth?\u201d There was a hint of curiosity in her gentle voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, this person is one of the envoys of this year\u2019s Star Academy, Qi Ao Shuang. He is this year\u2019s biggest dark horse. He passed the eighth level\u2019s examination in one go, defeated Jonathan, and became the second. This is only in Dittos. \u201d The low voice slowly explained without any emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like that. He\u2019s really young.\u201d And the Dittas log seemed to care about him. Was Dittos really interested in men? \u201cHehe \u2026\u201d Her gentle voice gave off a low chuckle, making one\u2019s entire body go limp.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d The low voice answered patiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was joking.\u201d I knew, of course, that the wood had no interest in men or women. \u201cBut today, I was so curious about that red-haired youth \u2026\u201d There was an unconcealable curiosity in her gentle voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not, miss.\u201d As you can see, Dittos can mercilessly kill his brother-in-law. \u201d His deep voice was no longer cold and detached; it was now filled with a hint of worry. He knew exactly how powerful Dittas was. Dylan had long since discovered his existence, but he ignored him. Dittos was a dangerous man, not one they could afford to offend.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I know my limits.\u201d There was a trace of anger in her gentle voice. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back too.\u201d This was half the favor he owed Jonathan. \u201cWhat a troublesome little demon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A low voice replied. An afterimage flashed, and a masked young man appeared on the carriage, gently swinging the whip. The carriage slowly and noiselessly drove off.</p><br/><p>The white leaf forest once again returned to its former tranquility.</p><br/><p>The moonlight remained the same, but the situation was different.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the hotel, Dittens was walking in front when he suddenly turned to face Qi Ao Shuang and said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan, who blinked and spread out his hands, indicating that he didn\u2019t call me, that I didn\u2019t need to go in. Qi Ao Shuang nodded to Jin Yan, indicating that he didn\u2019t need to worry. It would be fine as long as he waited outside.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang followed Dittos into the room. Dittos closed the door behind him and sat on the sofa first. Qi Ao Shuang also slowly walked over and sat down.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang.\u201d Suddenly, Dittos spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang answered softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, only you understand me.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Dittos suddenly spat out those words. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026. When he killed the Nine Heavens City Lord, Dittos knew that in this world, only Qi Ao Shuang knew about him. Jonathan\u2019s look of surprise was ridiculous. Only Qi Ao Shuang looked calm, not surprised at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I agree with you.\u201d Yet, Qi Ao Shuang said this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, as long as you understand.\u201d However, Dittas did not care and continued, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, don\u2019t disappoint me. Grow up quickly.\u201d Without you, on my way, I would have found it tasteless. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang was silent for a long time, silently looking at the cold but serious face of Dittas.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead and do what you want.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t take too long. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201d \u201cYour mind should be more on cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, thank you for today.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang stood up and thanked him with a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say thank you to me, I have my own reasons for doing things.\u201d Dittos said indifferently.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded and said no more, turned around, opened the door and left. As Dittos had said, she still had work to do. It was to inform Wynes that he was ready to act, and to do so as soon as possible. He wanted to stabilize the situation as soon as possible and ascend to the position of mayor.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan had been quietly waiting at the entrance the entire time. When he saw Qi Ao Shuang come out to greet him. Jonathan had gone back to his room to sleep. After all, he didn\u2019t need to worry about the rest of the matters, and Dittas wouldn\u2019t \u201ctalk\u201d with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, Jin Yan, look for Wynes.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d Jin Yan nodded.</p><br/><p>The two of them left the room quietly and headed in the direction of Wynes\u2019 residence. However, someone stopped him not far from Wynes\u2019 entrance.</p><br/><p>And what stopped them was a woman. A woman who was extremely beautiful, so enchanting that she could make people lose their minds.</p><br/><p>Her graceful figure was like a willow, her delicate face was like the bright moon in the sky, and her enchanting eyes were like silk. Her soft black hair gently fluttered in the wind, attracting people\u2019s hearts. He suddenly appeared in the middle of a deserted street and blocked Qi Aoshuang and Jin Yan\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang \u2026\u201d The exceedingly beautiful woman slowly opened her mouth, her gentle voice almost making people forget to breathe as if they had forgotten to think about it, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time.\u201d \u201cWhy have you only just arrived?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

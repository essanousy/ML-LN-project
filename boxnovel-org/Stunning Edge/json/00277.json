Dittos could actually feel his own consciousness?! How is that possible? However, the truth was right in front of his eyes. Dittos. His strength was unfathomable.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyelids trembled as she retracted her consciousness.</p><br/><p>He slowly opened his eyes and took a deep breath. Then, he stood up and walked to the shore with a calm expression. Just now, he had comprehended everything in the swamp, including the state of all the floating rocks.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang leaped lightly and landed on the rock nearest to the shore. Without any pause, she quickly rushed forward. His figure gradually submerged into the thick miasma.</p><br/><p>As Qi Aushuang quickly caught up with the other students, everyone looked at her in shock. Xiao Ao Shuang moved quickly over the floating rocks without any hesitation, and in the blink of an eye, they were left behind. Mao Mao blinked his beady eyes as he watched Xiao Aoshuang leave. After a moment of slight hesitation, he swam after her.</p><br/><p>When the other students saw this, they let out a sigh of relief. As long as the terrifying monster didn\u2019t attack them, they would feel more at ease. However, that red-haired youth was about to suffer. Everyone had the same thought in their hearts.</p><br/><p>However, what shocked them the next moment was that the terrifying beast in their eyes didn\u2019t attack Qi Aoshuang, but rather swam happily by his side. He swam left and right, following closely behind Qi Ao Shuang, but had no intention to attack. It even seemed friendly!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d One of the students looked at the departing Qi Aoshuang and Mao Mao with astonishment, unable to make heads or tails of the situation.</p><br/><p>The others were also puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat youth is this year\u2019s dark horse.\u201d What do you think of his speed? \u201d At this time, the demon student spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery quickly.\u201d \u201cEven faster than Jonathan.\u201d Another student replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The demon student indifferently spat out.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the other people finally changed. Everyone looked at each other, seeing the astonishment in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is very strong.\u201d The demon student slowly came to a conclusion that was not a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he is strong, the attitude of that monster is too strange!\u201d He didn\u2019t want to bother Dittos and Jonathan because he\u2019d suffered in their hands, so he avoided them. However, this red-haired kid, why didn\u2019t that monster dodge? Instead, they went up to him? \u201cIn fact, in fact \u2026\u201d The man said no more. However, everyone was well aware of this fact. The monster even seemed to be trying to curry favor with him.</p><br/><p>Was that red-haired youth stronger than Jonathan and Dittos?</p><br/><p>Impossible!</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately denied what they were thinking.</p><br/><p>However, what was going on with the monster happily following by his side?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it, hurry over now.\u201d That demon man warned them to seize the opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The man with the injured hand immediately nodded. That monster was terrifyingly powerful. No matter how he attacked, he wouldn\u2019t die. Even if he was on the verge of death, as soon as he came into contact with this swamp, he was once again as lively as a dragon and as strong as a tiger.</p><br/><p>At this time, Qi Ao Shuang was still rushing forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu gu?\u201d \u201cGu gu gu gu!?\u201d Momo had been screaming beside Qi Ao Shuang the entire time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMomo asks you how did you find those heavy rocks? \u201cTo think that you are actually this powerful.\u201d The sky began to translate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI comprehended it myself.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said lightly, then she raised her head and looked ahead, frowning, \u201cHow big is this swamp, and how long will it take to get there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu gu gu gu ~ ~ ~ Gu gu!\u201d Momo kept shaking her head and cooing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you keep going at your current speed, it will still take you more than a day.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sleepy. I\u2019ll go to sleep first. You better hurry on your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoo, coo ~ ~\u201d Momo gently cooed twice before her large head began to sink downwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cMomo is going home to rest as well.\u201d \u201cHis home is right under the swamp \u2026\u201d Chang Kong muttered softly to himself, then his voice became softer and softer.</p><br/><p>More than a day? Qi Ao Shuang slightly frowned. If he didn\u2019t stop for a day, how big was this swamp? Just now when he was comprehending his consciousness, he was only able to sense the place where Dittas had advanced, but he hadn\u2019t seen it before. It would take more than a day at this rate, and the others would take longer.</p><br/><p>To persevere for a few days under such terrible conditions, and also to guard against the attack of a terrifying fellow like Momo, was indeed not an easy task. It was not only a physical test, but also a spiritual one. Those who managed to make it through here alive were no ordinary people.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang continued forward, and a blurry shadow appeared in front of her. It was a familiar sight to Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>It was Jonathan.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stood still. She looked at Jonathan who was standing on a floating rock, but didn\u2019t do anything. After pausing for a moment, she stomped on the rock and used the momentum to jump onto the rock in front of her. Xiao Ao Shuang thought for a moment, but did not follow, only following behind.</p><br/><p>However, Jonathan soon noticed something strange behind him. He turned around, squinted his eyes and looked behind. When he saw the silhouette behind him, Jonathan shouted excitedly, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, is that you?\u201d \u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang pouted her mouth helplessly and moved to the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Qi Ao Shuang, I knew you could do it.\u201d However\u2026 Jonathan suddenly frowned, looked at Qi Aoshuang curiously, then suddenly opened his mouth wide and exclaimed in surprise, \u201cNo way, you\u2019re faster than me!\u201d I started after me, and now I\u2019m catching up with me. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuck, that\u2019s all.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan\u2019s surprised expression and said perfunctorily, \u201cI just happened to be able to sense if these rocks are real or not, so I was lucky enough to be a little faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Jonathan touched his chin and looked at Qi Ao Shuang, blinking his eyes. He did not know what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go. We should hurry through here.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at Jonathan, who was still in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Jonathan nodded, then frowned and asked seriously, \u201cYou can sense the rock and it will move faster than me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang didn\u2019t know what Jonathan meant by this question, but seeing how serious Jonathan was, she could only nod her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, show me the way, you\u2019re fast.\u201d \u201cYou can point me the other way as you go. It\u2019s faster.\u201d Jonathan said this very seriously.</p><br/><p>The corners of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mouth twitched, she had never seen such a shameless and serious person.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalk by yourself.\u201d Xiao Aushuang threw out a few words in annoyance, and was about to walk away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d No, wait. It will be lonely for you to walk alone. This swamp is very big. It\u2019s so lonely, so lonely, so let\u2019s walk together and talk along the way. \u201d Jonathan shouted from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lonely, I\u2019m not lonely, I\u2019m not empty!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang jokingly retorted, \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019m afraid of you. Don\u2019t be like Tang Seng anymore, we can leave together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Monk, who is that?\u201d \u201cIs he like me, a handsome man with a graceful bearing?\u201d Jonathan looked at Qi Aoshuang with expectation and said these words.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was speechless. She only had one thought in her mind, and that was to not look at this fellow\u2019s face. Thus, he silently rushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me!\u201d Jonathan ran after him.</p><br/><p>Just like that, the two of them continued forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, to be honest, the feeling you give me is very different.\u201d In the end, I wasn\u2019t wrong. You are the second person who managed to pass the eighth level of the smelting trial on your first try. \u201d Jonathan jabbered on after Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first is Dittos?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang asked Jonathan casually. It was obvious that Jonathan was trying to get him to ask who the first person was.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sort of.\u201d However, before the two of you, there was another person who passed the eighth level of the trial on his first try. However, after being expelled by the academy, he was no longer considered a student of the academy, and his record is naturally not counted in it. \u201d Jonathan replied lazily, his voice casual. \u201cIn fact, in the hearts of the students, that talent is the academy\u2019s pinnacle figure.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just that the academy doesn\u2019t allow us to talk about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Upon hearing Jonathan\u2019s words, Qi Ao Shuang was intrigued. \u201cWhy was he expelled?\u201d Why is it a forbidden topic again? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause he almost destroyed the Star Heavenly Pagoda and injured the headmaster as well as a few elders.\u201d Shocking the world, right? This kind of tragic history was strictly forbidden in school. That\u2019s why less and less people learned of it later on. \u201d Jonathan narrowed his eyes. His eyes seemed to be recalling something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw it?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang asked with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I was still a freshman then.\u201d I only see what happens after it happens. \u201cThe Principal and the Elders are all half dead, the Heavenly Star Tower is shaking, and the surroundings are in ruins.\u201d Jonathan shrugged, as if regretting not seeing the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask, how old are you now?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly thought of a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, ask your age.\u201d A man\u2019s age is a secret. \u201d Jonathan smiled cunningly, but would not say his age.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man\u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is called maturity!\u201d \u201cMatured, do you understand?\u201d Jonathan\u2019s ears were sharp. He immediately heard what Qi Ao Shuang said and quickly retorted.</p><br/><p>From this, it could be seen that this fellow\u2019s age was definitely not as simple as he looked on the surface. However, it was not strange. The world itself was a wondrous place. As he cultivated deeper into the sect, his physical body naturally reached a certain level of strength that prevented it from aging. If one\u2019s youth were to remain forever, then one would naturally not be able to see their age.</p><br/><p>On the afternoon of the second day, the two of them successfully crossed the swamp and passed the eighth level of the trial. Dittos was long gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d Jonathan tore open the scroll and said lazily, \u201cWhen we go back to the competition, I reckon it will be the second.\u201d To my great relief, I didn\u2019t have to see Lenny\u2019s old hen\u2019s face again. \u201cXiao Aushuang, let\u2019s go.\u201d Jonathan tore the scroll apart and slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back first. I\u2019ll take a look at the ninth floor.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go\u2026\u201d Jonathan heard what Qi Ao Shuang said the last moment before he disappeared. His expression changed drastically, and he was teleported out before he could finish his words.</p><br/><p>If he went to the ninth floor with his current strength, he would die without a doubt! Does this kid want to die so badly? The last thing Jonathan saw when he was teleported out was the calm face of Qi Ao Shuang. He felt both angry and worried at the same time, but there was also a hint of sadness in his heart.</p><br/><p>After the teleportation, Jonathan appeared at the designated place next to the Sky Tower. There, the coaches would take turns to change shifts and pick up the students who came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pity, what a pity \u2026\u201d Jonathan shook his head and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEight stars.\u201d The instructor next to him quickly determined Jonathan\u2019s test results. The instructor knew Jonathan. He kept shaking his head and sighing. He asked doubtfully, \u201cJonathan, what happened to you?\u201d I\u2019ve never seen you sigh like this. \u201cDid he almost pass the ninth level?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop teasing me. Teacher, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know about it. Even Dittos has no way of going over.\u201d Jonathan shook his head and sighed. Before he could finish his words, Jonathan stopped.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s a pity? What was he regretting? It was a pity that a powerful student like Qi Ao Shuang had gone to the ninth floor to die?</p><br/><p>Pah! He would never be so merciful! What does the life and death of others have to do with me? What was he regretting?</p><br/><p>Jonathan scratched his head and closed his eyes in distress. Suddenly, he did not understand what he was regretting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d The instructor could not help but ask when he saw Jonathan\u2019s distressed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, hur hur, nothing.\u201d Jonathan laughed dryly, and was about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to participate in the 8-star competition after the exam.\u201d The instructor was baffled by Jonathan\u2019s strange behavior, but still reminded him dutifully from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Jonathan rushed off.</p><br/><p>At this moment, looking at the bright exit, Qi Ao Shuang knew that it was the exit to the ninth floor. After finding a corner to sleep and recover her spirit, Xiao Ao Shuang did not hesitate and prepared to take a step forward.</p><br/><p>At this time, a clear and bright voice was heard, \u201cGo back, don\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang was shocked, she suddenly looked up and looked around. But there was no one around. And that voice rang in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back, you can\u2019t go there now.\u201d The clear and bright voice rang out once more, carrying with it an indescribable charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slightly frowned, feeling shocked in her heart. Who was this person? He was completely unaware of his existence! In this academy, if it wasn\u2019t Dittas, he would be number one. Isn\u2019t Dittas the strongest person in the academy?</p><br/><p>Then, who was the person who was speaking to him right now? This man\u2019s strength was probably far beyond his own. This was because Xiao Ao Shuang could not sense his presence at all, nor could she sense where he was speaking to her.</p><br/><p>Who was this man with a pleasant voice?</p><br/><p>Why did he feel a sense of familiarity?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

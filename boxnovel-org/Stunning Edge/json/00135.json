A flash of determination gleamed in Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes at the same time. Claire had made a miraculous breakthrough during the tournament, so he had to become stronger and stronger, strong enough to protect Claire!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the Li clan for now. Do you want to explain anything to your friends? I will lend you a memory crystal and pass it onto them. You can just cultivate here without worry,\u201d An Lisha said very simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, girl, just cultivate here. Hahaha, you can\u2019t run away anyways. There\u2019s fierce wind all around the island and anything that tries to pass through gets ripped to shreds. Only after you\u2019ve finished learning will I send you out,\u201d the old man laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>Her lip twitched. It seemed the situation had already developed passed her means. In any case, it was the first time she repaid someone like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to burden you with sending my friends the memory crystal,\u201d Claire said to An Lisha politely.</p><br/><p>An Lisha only nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, thank you for bringing me and thank you for finding the elder to teach me,\u201d Claire thanked solemnly.</p><br/><p>An Lisha smiled. \u201cThank Yixuan. If it weren\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t have done anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan started to twist uncomfortably at these words. Claire\u2019s expression turned a little unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, finish up and return. Really now, I\u2019m about to start teaching them, stop wasting time,\u201d the elder waved offhandedly, impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! Also, I just used up a spatial teleportation scroll, give me two,\u201d An Lisha said powerfully. She handed over the memory crystal to Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of logic is that? Robber! You\u2019re a robber! Why do you ask for two when you\u2019ve only used up one?\u201d the old man started to squabble.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to use one to return\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou robber! Robber!\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire started explaining to the memory crystal that she didn\u2019t know how long she would stay and that they could do as they wanted. If they couldn\u2019t find anything to do, then return to the Hill manor and wait for her there. And Jean should take White Emperor and Black Emperor back.</p><br/><p>After finally being able to force over two spatial teleportation scrolls, she left with Claire\u2019s memory crystal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Little lass, boy, we start today. The demonic training starts!\u201d The elder said seriously, his hand at his hip.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, senior Feng Astral, I want to take a shower and change clothes.\u201d Claire pointed at her bloodstained, torn clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Alright, go then. First familiarize yourselves with the surroundings. The kitchen is over there and there\u2019s a hot spring in the woods behind the house for washing. We can start training tomorrow.\u201d The elder stroked his chin, pondering.</p><br/><p>They started the next day.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Claire became familiar with the lay of the land. The island wasn\u2019t large, but you couldn\u2019t see the ends from one end to another. Surrounding the island was a high wind wall, spinning quickly. Claire tested by throwing a stick and the stick instantly shattered! Stones turned to dust when thrown. They were truly isolated from the world.</p><br/><p>The training was bitter and boring. Claire and Feng Yixuan trained at separate areas and only met at night. By then, they were both exhausted and would go to sleep immediately after eating. They spent most of their time at two far ends of the island. As the elder had said, if they trained close to each other, they might hurt each other on accident. Feng Yixuan cultivated smoothly ever since his seal had been undone. But Claire was the opposite. Because she was fire attributed, she couldn\u2019t sense the wind elements, so the elder\u2019s shouts filled her days.</p><br/><p>The days passed one by one. And just like that, half a month passed, when suddenly, news arrived that disrupted their training.</p><br/><p>An Lisha appeared and brought Claire a letter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you come here for? They\u2019re far from finished,\u201d the elder grumbled. Especially Claire. She hadn\u2019t made any improvements after such a long period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to find Claire and give her something.\u201d An Lisha pulled out a letter and handed it Claire, who was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen to the Li clan?\u201d Claire asked with a frown. \u201cOr did something happen to my friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeither. Your friends all left to do their own business and your knight also returned to Amparkland. This letter was sent to me by your knight. I don\u2019t know what its contents are,\u201d An Lisha answered truthfully.</p><br/><p>Claire watched the sealed letter, an ominous feeling arising in her heart. She tore it open and her expression changed instantly.</p><br/><p>Cliff was in trouble!</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Feng Astral, I have some business and must leave! Please agree.\u201d Claire put the letter away, her face determined.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only learned the first level. Yixuan\u2019s already entered the fifth level. You want to leave after only having learned so little?\u201d the old man fumed angrily.</p><br/><p>But Claire didn\u2019t waver, determined as she said, \u201cSomeone dear to me is in danger. I must go to him. You also said yourself that learning just one level is fine. My attributes are not suited for your Heavenly Astral Wind. Senior Feng Astral, you know this already. No matter how I tried for these past few weeks, I wasn\u2019t able to break through any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Astral paused, unable to say anything seeing the determined glint in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they to you?\u201d An Lisha saw that Feng Yixuan was a bit at ill ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy master, Master Cliff.\u201d Claire understood what An Lisha meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s her master. You heard that. When a master is in trouble, how can his disciple not go? If you were in trouble, would I just stand by and watch?\u201d An Lisha saw from the corner of her eye Feng Yixuan relaxing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Feng Astral stroked his beard. \u201cAlright. Girl, you can go. In any case, you\u2019ve already learned my Heavenly Astral Wind, even if it\u2019s just one level. Haha, that\u2019s already enough to anger Si Konglin to death. We\u2019ll continue our training and you can go.\u201d</p><br/><p>We? Feng Yixuan frowned. What did he mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go with Claire too!\u201d Feng Yixuan suddenly understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cTough luck! You\u2019re even more talented than your T-rex mother. Just stay here and learn from be obediently. I\u2019ll teach you all I can about my supreme techniques. Haha, let\u2019s go!\u201d Before Feng Yixuan could reacted, Feng Astral picked up Feng Yixuan, laughing heartily as they left to the other side of the island.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s shouts as he struggled came from far away, but it was no use.</p><br/><p>Claire and An Lisha shared a glance, wordless.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-madam An, I\u2019ll be in your care,\u201d Claire forced out after some thought. She had always felt awkward trying to figure out how to address An Lisha.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease call me Aunty An, haha. Let\u2019s go. Your night is waiting.\u201d An Lisha pulled Claire close and tore a spatial teleportation scroll. Their figures vanished.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s heart sunk lower and lower. In order to break through, Master had actually gone to <em>that</em> place!</p><br/><p>Once Claire\u2019s eyes opened, she discovered they were now in a secret room. An Lisha started explaining. \u201cThe scroll is set to the secret underground chambers of the Feng clan. Let\u2019s go. Your knight is waiting in the main hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Lisha led Claire through the chambers, navigating through multiple twists and turns. Along the way, servants bowed and gave their respectful greetings. Claire noted keenly that they all had respect, some even fanaticism, in their eyes. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder who exactly was An Lisha.</p><br/><p>Upon arrival, sure enough, Jean was sitting upright wordlessly, Black Feather and White Emperor perched on his shoulders. When they saw Claire, the two creatures dashed towards her excitedly, taking over her shoulders. They rubbed her cheeks affectionately.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Jean stood up abruptly, his eyes so fixed on Claire. There was something throbbing about his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean, let\u2019s go. We shouldn\u2019t tarry. I\u2019ll question you along the way.\u201d Claire was extremely anxious. She turned around and bowed deeply to An Lisha. \u201cAunt An, thank you for your help. I will never forget your kindness. If there ever comes a time when you need me, I, Claire, will do my utmost to serve you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Claire. Be careful.\u201d An Lisha smiled and nodded gently. \u201cI\u2019ll see you out. I\u2019ll also inform the Li clan of your leaving. You don\u2019t need to worry about the Li clan any more. It is already shining gloriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Aunt An\u2026\u201d Claire felt warmth towards the warmly smiling woman. She didn\u2019t know how to thank her for all she had done for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was all through your own efforts. I didn\u2019t do much. Alright now, you still have matters to attend to. Hurry up and be on your way,\u201d An Lisha said, understanding.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded. And without further ado, she followed An Lisha out the entrance of the Feng clan.</p><br/><p>A carriage was already waiting for them and they got on. Before Claire asked, Jean answered all her questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, after you were brought away, we saw your explanation in the memory crystal. Because we didn\u2019t know when you would return, everybody decided what they would do in the meantime. Ben went to go train, saying he needed to improve his strength and reclaim his title as Dragon King. Walter though he was too weak, so he left to traverse the continent and also improve his strength. Camille returned to the capital to continue being a famous scholar. He also wanted to pass on the message to call him if there was anything interesting and that he welcomes serving you tea at his place any time. Qiao Chuxin, Summer, Shui Wenmo, and Dong Fenghou also decided to journey. Leng Lingyun returned to the Temple of Light to carry on with his duties. And Lashia is currently taking care of the wind leopard.\u201d Jean reported on each person concisely.</p><br/><p>Claire nodded. She took out the letter and frowned. \u201cWhat had happened in this case?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

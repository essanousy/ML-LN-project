I only do things for money.\u201d But, this mission sure was costly, he paid with his life and didn\u2019t even touch a corner of his target\u2019s clothes. All because of that wretched Holy Divine Prince, who has nothing better to do than to come to Gale Gorge for medicinal herbs. It would be fine if it was anyone else from the Temple of Light, but it had to be that overpowered Holy Divine Prince! Walter still felt scared every time he thought about that one-sided defeat.</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t ask anymore, knowing it would be useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, let\u2019s return together.\u201d Princess Maurice happily walked over. She had already safely stored the beast core that Claire gave her away.</p><br/><p>Claire accepted Maurice\u2019s invitation and after resting for a while, the group returned back to the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, next weekend is my birthday, and my father, the King, has prepared a birthday banquet. You must come.\u201d Princess Maurice invited Claire on the way. Of course, a formal invitation card would also be sent to the Hill castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Claire agreed with a smile.</p><br/><p>On the road, Maurice clung to Claire and made Claire tell her everything that happened in Gale Gorge. Jean and Nancy walked in the front, Maurice and Claire were in the middle, and the three warriors walked in the back.</p><br/><p>Maurice was so brisk and lively right now, completely different from how solemn she was at the Institute. This must be her true personality.</p><br/><p>The group traveled to Berthe without a hitch. At the city gates, they parted ways. Maurice was reluctant to leave and only left after reminding Claire she must be present at her birthday banquet.</p><br/><p>After Claire went to the Mercenary Guild to turn in her task, she went back to the Duke\u2019s castle.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, you\u2019ve come back. The Duke wants you to go to the study as soon as you arrive.\u201d The housekeeper at the door respectfully passed on the message. The stiff housekeeper\u2019s attitude towards Claire had totally changed. It wasn\u2019t because of the Duke\u2019s doting on Claire, but because he wasn\u2019t an ordinary man. He was an unusually powerful person. He felt Claire\u2019s changes and also believed that she was the Hill clan\u2019s future hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Claire indifferently replied. She went to the study without even changing her clothes.</p><br/><p>She knocked on the study door lightly, and Gordan\u2019s dignified voice replied, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire entered the study through the door and Jean waited outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, I\u2019m back.\u201d Claire said quietly, looking at the dignified old man sitting behind the study desk. Emery stood aside, wearing a brown robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, being back is good.\u201d Gordan nodded. He got up, smiling. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad. I killed some third grade and fourth grade magic beasts.\u201d Claire reported seriously. Then she glanced at Emery. Emery already understood from Claire\u2019s gaze that everything must have gone successfully, so his heart settled down.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Did you get injured?\u201d Gordan walked up to her, concerned.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Claire shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, not bad, not bad. This is how a member of the Hill clan should be.\u201d Gordan happily nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, Grandfather, I met the wizard sage Cliff.\u201d Claire suddenly changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? And then?\u201d Gordan asked eagerly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a perverted old man.\u201d Claire said solemnly.</p><br/><p>Gordan\u2019s face twitched and he didn\u2019t know what to say. Cliff, that wizard sage, was definitely a huge pervert. All the beautiful female teachers of the Sunrise Institute had been molested by him before, either by trying to touch their chests or lifting their dresses.</p><br/><p>Emery had an odd expression on his face, like he wanted to laugh, but this wasn\u2019t the right time to.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe forced me to become his disciple and gave me a Transportation Bracelet, Invisiblility Cloak, and stuff like that.\u201d This additional sentence made Gordan go wild with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re sure? It\u2019s like this? Haha, this is too good.\u201d Gordan slightly convulsed, his words stumbling over one another. Then he became pleased with himself, \u201cI just knew my darling Claire would be chosen by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Gordan was exceptionally happy, Claire looked towards Emery. Emery\u2019s expression was a bit complicated. He was both happy for Claire but also slightly dejected.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was Cliff who forced me to become his disciple, so he had to agree with a condition that I brought up.\u201d Claire saw Emery\u2019s expression and unexpectedly said these sentences.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gordan came back to his senses. Hearing that his darling granddaughter was so arrogant, he was a bit worried if this would anger the impressive Cliff.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only had one condition. I already had a master, so he could only be my second master, and if he couldn\u2019t accept it, then he forget could about it. He agreed.\u201d Claire stated flatly.</p><br/><p>As soon as Claire finished saying this, Gordan\u2019s mouth hung open and was speechless for a long time.</p><br/><p>Throughout the whole world, Claire must be the only person to negotiate when becoming a disciple, and to a wizard sage, and with such a harsh condition!</p><br/><p>But Emery was completely frozen. He of course understood the meaning of Claire\u2019s words, of course knew who she meant when she was talking about her first master. For many years he had thought his tear glands were dry, but today, he felt them getting moist.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, you don\u2019t need to worry, I know my boundaries. Also, things that I decide will never change.\u201d Claire said seriously.</p><br/><p>Gordan was shocked, and it took him a while to come back to his senses. He then roared with laughter, \u201cGood! Worthy of being my granddaughter. Exactly how I was like when I was young. I won\u2019t worry, I believe you will deal with this properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for understanding, Grandfather.\u201d Claire smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be tired, so you should go wash and change your clothes and then visit your mother.\u201d Gordan was obviously very pleased and happy. He thought of how to spread out that Cliff had accepted Claire as his disciple as fast as possible, and he also wanted to ask Jean about the details.</p><br/><p>After Claire left, Gordan turned towards Emery, a complex expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmery, you can see that Claire, that child, has made up her mind already.\u201d Gordan sighed heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your Grace, I\u2026 \u201d Emery didn\u2019t know what to say. His heart was so warmed and touched that it was about to melt completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just hope you don\u2019t let down Claire\u2019s kind intentions.\u201d Gordan let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grace, don\u2019t worry. I understand.\u201d Emery said emotionally. At this moment, he had already fully given his heart to Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s good. Hehe, you can go now. I imagine you have a lot of things to say to that child. I need to find Jean to learn about some things, you can leave.\u201d Gordan nodded his head with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Emery bowed and also left.</p><br/><p>That night, no one knew what Gordan and Jean discussed in the study.</p><br/><p>After showering and changing clothes, Claire went to meet Katherine. Seeing Claire return safe and sound, Katherine was extremely happy. Only after eating dinner with Katherine did Claire go rest. Lashia never showed up; Katherine said Lashia went to the principal\u2019s to study.</p><br/><p>Not long after Claire returned to her room did she hear a tap on her window. Claire naturally knew who it was, opening the window and moving out of the way for Emery to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you came just at the right time. I have some things to consult with you.\u201d When Claire saw Emery, her mood was quite happy.</p><br/><p>Emery smiled while looking at the girl in front of him profoundly. After setting up a magic hood with a wave of his hand he asked, \u201cClaire, did everything go smoothly this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it was successful. I learned the arcanum, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot of information to digest. I wanted to ask teacher about this.\u201d Claire brought out the Spiritual Stone she had been carrying.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual Stone!\u201d Emery was hugely surprised. Looking at the valuable treasure in Claire\u2019s hand, he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.</p><br/><p>Claire handed the stone over to Emery and Emery inspected it carefully. \u201cAh! There\u2019s something inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn idiot couldn\u2019t win against someone and lost his body, then attached his soul to this. It\u2019s a dark magician called Walter Simon,\u201d Claire replied indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter Simon?!\u201d Emery exclaimed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Teacher, is this guy famous?\u201d Claire was doubtful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a genius, the genius of dark magicians. Sinister, crafty, cunning, and shameless, he\u2019s wanted by the Temple of Light. But he escaped safely every time. But this time\u2026 \u201d Emery looked at the Spiritual Stone in his hand curiously, as if doubting if the soul inside was the Walter he knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he really that clever?\u201d Claire smirked and then said lightly, \u201cHe met the Holy Divine Prince of the Temple of Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Then it\u2019s not strange at all.\u201d Now Emery didn\u2019t find the situation weird any more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalter, come out! Otherwise I\u2019ll make you wish you were dead.\u201d Claire coldly commanded.</p><br/><p>The next moment, smoke spiraled out from the small stone in Emery\u2019s hand and a human image instantly formed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is the dark magician genius Walter Simon!\u201d Emery looked at the figure and stated certainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Walter said haughtily.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want a beating? Speaking to my teacher in such a manner!\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes shot out an icy light.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, exalted magician, I am the Walter Simon. What is your command?\u201d Walter immediately switched to a flattering tone.</p><br/><p>Emery blinked. Why did he feel that the aura between his darling disciple and this guy was so complex?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I know.\u201d Emery raised his eyebrows, a bold idea forming in his head.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Claire saw the normally expressionless Emery grinning evilly.</p><br/><p>For no reason at all, Walter\u2019s whole body suddenly felt cold.</p><br/><p>Something bad was going to happen!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

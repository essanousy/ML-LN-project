It was as if the enchanting Claire was right in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cPft~\u201d Wenmo Shui spit out the last piece of bone onto Yixuan Feng\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Yixuan Feng blankly wiped it off his face and giggled, \u201cWenmo, she\u2019s so enchanting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wenmo Shui opened his mouth wide, dumbstruck. As he saw that person giggling foolishly, the unease in his heart grew bigger and bigger. This was the first time he saw Yixuan Feng in love like this!</p><br/><p>He\u2019s done for! This guy was actually in love!</p><br/><p>This little bastard had always treated those women disdainfully as if they were beneath him. One time, he couldn\u2019t stand to watch a super affectionate younger female cousin to the point that he spit out tea from his mouth, not giving any face, causing his T-rex Ma to think there was something wrong with his body and secretly check. The result showed that all of Yixuan Feng\u2019s functions worked properly. It was just that he couldn\u2019t fall for those women.</p><br/><p>Now, he had finally fallen for a girl.</p><br/><p>But!!!</p><br/><p>This girl won\u2019t do!</p><br/><p>Because she was from Amparkland and the influential Duke Hill\u2019s granddaughter!</p><br/><p>Currently, the relationship between Amparkland and Lagark seemed fine, but they all knew the relationship was in fact, quite strained. Turbulent waves swelled secretly. Lagark\u2019s current emperor was not someone who was satisfied with what he had now.</p><br/><p>So this woman absolutely won\u2019t do!</p><br/><p>Also, the ambassador seemed to have his way of thinking.</p><br/><p>Before Yixuan Feng could say anything, Wenmo Shui suddenly jumped up. He pulled the sheet and after a slight vibration, Wenmo Shui immediately tore it to shreds. Wenmo Shui wrapped up Yixuan Feng without a word, tightly and securely.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap! You barbarian! What are you doing?\u201d Yixuan Feng angrily yelled as he finally came back to his senses and saw Wenmo Shui tie him up. It was already useless to struggle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Tonight we will go back. That woman won\u2019t do, she is Amparkland\u2019s Duke Gordan\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d Wenmo Shui carefully wrapped him up from head to toe and then tightened it, hard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking to die?! Let me go! I want to find her right now.\u201d Yixuan Feng wriggled like an earthworm, but how could he be a match for the warrior, Wenmo Shui?</p><br/><p>Wenmo Shui picked up Yixuan Feng with one swipe and lightly threw him onto the bed. Then, Yixuan Feng, who had been wrapped in circles, was wrapped up even more and continued on to wriggle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou barbarian actually dare to tie me up. I will make you\u2026 eugh, eugh, umph\u2026\u201d The last words didn\u2019t come out. Wenmo Shui had stuffed a wad of bed sheets into Yixuan Feng\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Wenmo Shui completely ignored Yixuan Feng, who was crazily wriggling on the bed, and instead, minded his own business as he started to pack up stuff. They needed to leave this place tonight. With the ambassador\u2019s personality, he probably wouldn\u2019t easily let the woman called Claire go. Double classed magic warrior! Even though right now her level wasn\u2019t that high, nobody could predict if it would be like this in the future. The ambassador wouldn\u2019t risk letting her grow.</p><br/><p>Also, naturally, he couldn\u2019t let Yixuan Feng know this information. Wenmo Shui looked at the struggling person on the bed and made a decision. They\u2019ll leave right now! They\u2019ll bring this guy back home and let his mom deal with him. As long as they went home, he didn\u2019t need to deal with it any more.</p><br/><p>The moment the students and instructors that attended the banquet came back, they saw Wenmo Shui carrying a mummy-like Yixuan Feng onto the carriage. Yixuan Feng wriggled with all his might as Wenmo Shui faced the stupefied instructors and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll leave first. Teacher, this guy suffered too much. I was afraid he would be too depressed and try to commit suicide, so I took on a small measure.\u201d As he said this Wenmo Shui didn\u2019t look shameful at all, his expression and heart rate staying the same.</p><br/><p>The instructor stood, dumbfounded, not knowing what to do or say. The other students also stood spellbound, watching this strange, comical scene.</p><br/><p>The ambassador nodded and let them go. From the very start, the ambassador was afraid that Yixuan Feng had received too much of an impact and do something that would influence the somewhat peaceful relations of the two countries. Wenmo Shui bringing him away right now naturally was a good thing. The faster the better!</p><br/><p>No one noticed that when Wenmo Shui said those words that the person on his shoulder, Yixuan Feng, started to wriggle even more. As Yixuan Feng continued creating muffled sounds the whole time he was carried onto the carriage. Only Wenmo Shui could figure out Yixuan Feng\u2019s muffled words. \u201cEugh, eugh, eugh, ah eugh eugh\u2026 eugh eugh\u2026 eugh\u2026 umph\u2026 umph, umph\u2026 (Wenmo Shui, you lowly person, I\u2019ll become your mortal enemy\u2026 slaughter you\u2026 ) It was a pity these muffled sounds were smothered into the dark night.</p><br/><p>The carriage left, carrying Yixuan Feng who had been wrapped up tightly and the languid looking Wenmo Shui, disappearing into the night. After showing customs their documents, the carriage left that night without a hitch.</p><br/><p>And so, Yixuan Feng was unfairly brought away forcefully by Wenmo Shui, leaving far away from his heart\u2019s valiant and enchanting Claire.</p><br/><p>After the banquet was over, Claire and Duke Gordan left together on a carriage.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan had a red glow, his mood very good. In the moment he knew Claire was actually a double classed magic warrior, he became moved and then understood that clearly, Claire must have learned Dou Qi with Jean. This granddaughter was really too hard working. This time really made him incessantly surprised. It surprised him so much his heart almost jumped out of his throat.</p><br/><p>In the dead of night, Claire laid on the bed with eyes closed, but wasn\u2019t deep asleep.</p><br/><p>Currently in the study, there was a solemn and tense atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, the youth who lost to the Miss, Yixuan Feng, and that valiant warrior, Wenmo Shui, already left the capital at night.\u201d A man clothed in tight garments reported to Duke Gordan in a low tone.</p><br/><p>Duke Gordan frowned, then slowly nodded. In a low voice, he said, \u201cSend more people to follow Claire. They must protect her. Although she displayed her strength when winning this competition, as a magic warrior, I\u2019m afraid with that person\u2019s personality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Emery was silent, feeling worry in his heart incessantly. Today, Claire was truly extremely radiant. But just as a tall tree attracts the wind, famous people attract too much trouble. That careful and cruel ambassador who would kill a thousand innocents for one guilty was truly a threat to Claire. If the ambassador found out that Claire had become this strong only recently, he would do anything to eliminate her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your subordinate swears to protect Miss with his life.\u201d The tight clothed man thumped his chest while swearing to protect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are on guard; they won\u2019t succeed so easily. But we definitely can\u2019t be careless. Also, right now, Claire is a double classed magic warrior. Cliff over there\u2026\u201d Duke Gordan frowned. He was a unparalleled magician, but his disciple didn\u2019t learn only his magic. Then what would that person think? Gordan\u2019s thoughts were endless.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, you do not need to worry. I believe Miss will definitely handle this business well.\u201d Emery consoled Duke Gordan in a low voice. He completely believed that Claire would definitely handle the situation well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. If there\u2019s no problem, you may take your leave.\u201d Duke Gordan lightly waved, indicating for everyone to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, somebody has come.\u201d Walter suddenly sounded quietly in Claire\u2019s mind. The footsteps outside were different from usual. It definitely wasn\u2019t a servant or that wooden faced knight. Also, Emery, that guy, usually came in through the window. Then who was it?</p><br/><p>Claire didn\u2019t speak. Of course she had already sensed the sounds from outside the door. Jean didn\u2019t do anything, so he recognized the person, and he wouldn\u2019t do anything that could be detrimental to Claire now.</p><br/><p>The person at the door seemed to be pacing back and forth, their footsteps very, very light. It seemed like they were hesitating.</p><br/><p>The room was extremely quiet as the silver moonlight came in through the cracks of the window.</p><br/><p>The person outside the door suddenly stopped and stood there quietly.</p><br/><p>After a long time, words floated gently through the seams of the door. \u201cThank you. Thank you for saving me today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, the footsteps hurriedly left, as if they were escaping.</p><br/><p>The voice was Lashia.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat little girl actually knows how to express thanks!\u201d Walter\u2019s voice was as loud as if he discovered the New Continent as it howled in Claire\u2019s mind, \u201cRemember, she walks with her nose pointed at the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d Claire yawned and lied down on the bed to sleep, without any superfluous words.</p><br/><p>Walter silently blinked, thinking something unknown.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the Temple of Light.</p><br/><p>In a dark room.</p><br/><p>The green haired and strange eyed clairvoyant faced her crystal ball with a frown.</p><br/><p>She still couldn\u2019t read the natal chart of the person the goddess wanted to find.</p><br/><p>If it continued on like this, if we don\u2019t find that person faster, there will be trouble.</p><br/><p>If the person was outside of her range\u2026</p><br/><p>Then the goddess will descend to purge!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

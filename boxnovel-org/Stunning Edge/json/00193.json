The king started to pale. It wasn\u2019t an illusion, the shrine was actually shaking. The queen gripped her armrest, face paling, watching the human incredulously. She never imagined that the youth would have such terrifying strength. She finally realized that even if the youth had not saved their brethren, the youth still had the power to forcibly take what he wanted anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor, please stay your hand,\u201d the mermaid king said hastily. He finally understood their true circumstances.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression remained icy. The mermaid king still had not said he would hand over the God Feather.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor, please stop. It is not that we do not want to hand over the God Feather, but that it is currently not in our possession. A few years ago, it was stolen.\u201d The mermaid king finally could do nothing but reveal the truth.</p><br/><p>What? Qi Aoshuang was shocked. She finally stopped the tremors, eyeing the king coldly as she said, \u201cWho stole it?\u201d Qi Aoshuang finally realized why the mermaid king had not been willing to hand it over. This was the mermaid race\u2019s so called pride?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho stole it?\u201d Qi Aoshuang coldly regarded the unsightly king.</p><br/><p>The mermaid king hesitated, gritting his teeth. Well, he had already lost face anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was another human.\u201d The king\u2019s expression grew more unsightly. \u201cNamed Xue Longfei.\u201d He would remember this name even after he died. It was this insolent who had stolen away the relic piece, but he hated this human for something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, leave.\u201d The queen motioned for the poor mermaid soldiers to withdraw.</p><br/><p>The mermaid soldiers all watched Qi Aoshuang with trepidation as they silently withdrew. In the blink of an eye, only the king, queen, and Qi Aoshuang were left in the shrine.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak. What happened?\u201d Seeing the king\u2019s clenched teeth, she knew the situation was not simply just that. The relic weapon was stolen by a human?</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, we are fully aware of the spiritual relic weapon. Unless they are combined, the parts are mere ornaments. We are also sure that the weapon would never be assembled, so we gave the golden tiara to our daughter.\u201d The mermaid\u2019s king now filled with anger. For a moment, he did not speak.</p><br/><p>The queen sighed. \u201cI should tell it instead. One day, our daughter recklessly decided to swim in the open ocean with the tiara, then met a human. That human was Xue Longfei. He took away our daughter along with the golden tiara!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person stole away your daughter? Did he fall for her good looks?\u201d Qi Aoshuang questioned.</p><br/><p>The king and queen suddenly flushed with embarrassment. After a long time, the two said weakly, \u201cThat unfilial daughter, she abandoned us, abandoned our entire race to follow that man! We won\u2019t acknowledge such an unfilial daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang immediately understood. The human man must have been too charming, that even the mermaid princess could not resist his charms, so she willingly left with the man. It was a cruel joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Xue Longfei?\u201d Qi Aoshuang raised a brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of Swerther\u2019s city lords. Vile, nasty, ugly man. He goes around collecting beautiful women. His city is at an island. The surrounding eighteen islands are all under his jurisdiction.\u201d The queen fumed with anger.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang knew that the queen\u2019s words were not totally true. If Xue Longfei really fit the queen\u2019s description, would the mermaid princess really fall for him and follow him?</p><br/><p>Now that she knew where the relic piece was, there was no need to stay here. Once they found the princess, they would find the relic piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does your daughter look like?\u201d Qi Aoshuang asked faintly. \u201cAnd where is the city?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer portrait is inside here.\u201d The queen took off a necklace from her neck and walked over to Qi Aoshuang from the throne to show her. \u201cThe city is called the City of Unruly. East of here is an archipelago. You will know once you ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked and saw a smiling, devastatingly beautiful woman. She wore a small, exquisite tiara. This must be the relic piece. Though the painting was underwater, it remained clear, evidently enchanted with magic.</p><br/><p>To phrase it differently, the mermaid princess had eloped, leaving with the relic piece, not actually stolen away. This was why the king and queen\u2019s attitude was so strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, got it.\u201d Qi Aoshuang handed the pendent back to the queen, but the queen stopped her. \u201cBenefactor, if you find this unfilial daughter, please give this pendant to her, tell her we have no more relations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked down at the pendant, then looked at the queen. Her eyes were filled with deep grief. Suddenly, Qi Aoshuang was reminded of Katherine\u2019s final moment, her gently, tenderly smile. She gripped the pendant, then said coldly, \u201cIf that is the case, why don\u2019t I kill this unfilial daughter for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang turned, about to propel the aquafission beast forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d The queen said frantically.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Qi Aoshuang stopped, but did not turn around. She continued to say coldly, \u201cDoes your highness want me to bring back her corpse? That\u2019s too much of a hassle. You should send people over at the time, I will throw her into the sea for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d the queen cried out.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang sighed in her heart. Motherly love\u2026 Mothers were always worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d The queen raced over, face full of worry and grief.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will bring her back to you save and sound, and am delighted to do so.\u201d Qi Aoshuang said faintly, then left on the aquafission beast. Xue Longfei, what kind of person was he? Even a stately mermaid princess fell in love with him at first sight, then abandoned her parents and clan to live with him on land.</p><br/><p>The queen watched Qi Aoshuang\u2019s leaving figure blankly, vacant for a long time. For some reason, she believed Qi Aoshuang\u2019s words. A thought surfaced: this human would definitely bring back her daughter!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang left the mermaid kingdom unimpeded. Once everyone saw Qi Aoshuang appear at the entrance, they all let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAoshuang, what happened? Did you get the relic piece?\u201d Qiao Chuxin asked quickly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang let out a sigh. She turned to Dong Fenghou. \u201cLet\u2019s talk after entering Moomoo cow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou instructed Moomoo cow to swallow them all again. After entering, everyone dismounted from their aquafission beast. Dong Fenghou sent back the aquafission beasts and trumpet beasts. Everyone watched Qi Aoshuang expectantly, waiting for her response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey did not have the relic piece. The mermaid princess has it, but she eloped with a human.\u201d Qi Aoshuang spoke calmly. She showed everyone the pendant. \u201cThis is the mermaid princess. We just need to find her to find the relic piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eloped?!</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked, then looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>What kind of person would the mermaid princess elope with?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person she eloped with is called Xue Longfei. The mermaid queen said he is one of Swerther\u2019s city lords, his city located on an island. Let\u2019s go, we need to find him,\u201d Qi Aoshuang said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Longfei?\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned. Though the Temple of Light did not have much influence in Swerther, Leng Lingyun still knew one or two things about this country.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know this person?\u201d Feng Yixuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. I\u2019ve heard of him.\u201d Leng Lingyun spoke in a low voice. \u201cThis person\u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun frowned. Looking at the pendant that Xi Shaoqi was currently holding, he frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Qi Aoshuang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is versed in both pen and sword. He is very popular in Swerther. His City of Unruly is thriving under his administration. It is said that\u2026\u201d Leng Lingyun paused hesitantly. \u201cIt is said that he is extremely handsome and powerful, but he is a typical playboy. He has a large number of concuncubines and there are still countless women after him.\u201d This description was very different from the queen\u2019s. It seemed the mermaid queen hated humans so much, she deliberately defamed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, young master Leng, since when did you engage in gossip? Why do you know this so clearly?\u201d Xi Shaoqi asked jokingly. It was very strange that Leng Lingyun knew this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese were written in the Temple of Light records.\u201d Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression changed. That the Temple of Light had bothered to record so extensively on one person showed how much power and influence he must have in Swerther.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions also changed at these words. They all assumed pensive looks.</p><br/><p>A playboy? Even a grand mermaid princess was swayed into leaving, so he was definitely not simple. Xi Shaoqi passed back the pendant to Qi Aoshuang. \u201cThis person is definitely no ordinary man. We want to keep the situation as minimal as possible. If our identities are revealed, the Black Lightning will be after us.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned. Exactly how powerful was the organization?</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go to the East, Dong Fenghou,\u201d Qi Aoshuang instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dong Fenghou responded, then told Moomoo cow.</p><br/><p>Xue Longfei\u2026 Qi Aoshuang\u2019s gaze darkened. What kind of person was he?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

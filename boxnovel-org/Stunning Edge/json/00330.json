The floor was clear and the surroundings were spotless. However, there was no one around. On the sofa and on the table, fresh flowers were strewn all over the place. The fragrance wafted through the air. He continued forward along the floor, the pure energy getting stronger and stronger, closer and closer.</p><br/><p>After walking down a long and clean corridor, the view in front of them instantly widened.</p><br/><p>When Qi Aushuang saw the scene in front of her, her pupils constricted. The front wall was covered with a network of crystal wires. Two luxurious chairs were placed at the corner of the wall, on which sat a boy and a girl. The boy was carved from jade, with bright eyes, a round face, and small, rosy lips. His eyes were as clear as a spring as he quietly watched everyone. The little girl by the side leaned lightly against the back of the chair, her eyes closed. Her long eyelashes were like two rows of small brushes that could move a person\u2019s heart. Her pretty face, however, was pale white. She was dressed in white lace, and her hair was as black as ink. The contrast between the snow-white clothes and the pitch-black hair was extremely intense, giving people a strong impact on their eyeballs. Her dark hair fell over her head, and she dragged down the steps.</p><br/><p>Who are these two children? The expressions of the crowd slightly changed, and some doubt appeared in the depths of their eyes. However, Xiao Ao Shuang quickly confirmed the identities of the two children.</p><br/><p>The crystal net that was stretched out from the little girl\u2019s back was connected to the crystal net on the wall behind her. Looking towards the top of the net, Xiao Ao Shuang was so shocked that her whole body started trembling. At the top was a person whose entire body was covered only by a piece of white cloth on his waist, and his hands and feet were nailed to the wall by a sharp crystal spike. White light constantly flowed into the crystal threads, and it was more like the crystal nets were constantly being consumed than the light that was surging out of his body. The blond hair hung down lifelessly, and there was not a trace of blood on his face. Other than Camil, who else could that breathtakingly beautiful face be?</p><br/><p>Those two children, one was a god, and the unconscious beautiful girl was the mother god! They actually appeared on the outside. Now the Fathers and the Mother look like harmless children.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stared at Camil who was nailed to the wall, her heart aching in pain. Camille, it turns out that Camille\u2019s life is actually like this, so even though he is omnipotent, he is lonely. Yet, such a person had fallen into such a dangerous situation. Qi Ao Shuang bit her lip as she stared deeply at Camil not far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not a place for you to come to.\u201d The handsome looking god slowly stood up and looked at the blue and white flowers as he lightly said. The voice was clear and melodious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can stop me where I want to go, including you.\u201d However, the blue and white flower didn\u2019t laugh at all, laughing mockingly and mockingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is mine, and I have the right to deal with him. You have no right to interfere.\u201d His father frowned slightly as he looked at Qing Hua and said unkindly, \u201cYou don\u2019t belong to this world, so you have no right to interfere in our affairs.\u201d \u201cGo back to where you came from.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, he\u2019s my bargaining chip.\u201d \u201cAs the highest god of this world, he is actually weak to such an extent. How laughable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d The face of the Father God turned cold. He and the Mother God used this form of representation not because of their strange hobbies, but because he lost too much strength in order to save the Mother God.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, or hand over that person?\u201d Qinghua took a step forward, his eyes darkened as a terrifying oppressive aura instantly gushed out from him, directly suppressing his father.</p><br/><p>This terrifying aura that could be seen with the naked eye caused the face of his father and god to change. He took a step forward, wrinkling his brows and instantly releasing an imposing aura.</p><br/><p>When the two auras collided, there was a soft sound of collision in the air. Afterward, everyone watched in shock as the Qi from the deity was neutralized by the Qi from the flower. The flower\u2019s Qi entered the father\u2019s body without any hindrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026!\u201d His father\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He reached out his hand to cover his chest, but blood slowly seeped out from the corner of his mouth. Then his body wavered and he took a step back. He quickly reached out to the handle of the chair to steady himself.</p><br/><p>The collision of these two forces caused everyone to feel immense pressure. It was as if a lone boat was caught in a storm and was unable to stabilize its body. His heart was almost forced to a standstill. Everyone\u2019s hearts trembled, and they all silently stood to the side. They knew that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to interfere in a battle of this level. It was already extremely lucky for them to be able to stand here. The exchange between the gods was already too much for them to bear just because of the power unleashed from their probing each other just a moment ago.</p><br/><p>The look in her eyes grew colder and colder, and she had almost lost her patience to continue pestering him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath or handing over the person?\u201d Qing Hua said impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost too much energy \u2026\u201d His father looked at Qing Hua, unwilling to give up, and spat out a few words. However, before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by Qing Hua\u2019s cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when you were at your best, you were no match for me.\u201d Qing Hua sneered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill the gods of this world either, quickly hand it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Father God did not say anything. Instead, he slowly turned his head to look at the Mother God who was sleeping beside him. His eyes were filled with boundless longing and reluctance, and there was even pain in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has made up her mind to die. No matter how much power you infuse into her, she will still disperse. Don\u2019t do any useless nonsense. \u201d \u201cSooner or later, you will die. Do you choose to die now or in the future?\u201d \u201cNow that she\u2019s dead, I will make your death very ugly, and her death even worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun slightly frowned. She still hadn\u2019t changed. She was always so overbearing, always such an aggressive tone. She still didn\u2019t know what love was. Only possession, possession.</p><br/><p>The expression of the Father God became more and more sorrowful. He extended his hand and gently caressed the pale face of the Mother God. His lips slightly moved, as though he was saying something. However, no one heard him say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, take him away.\u201d The Father God slowly knelt in front of the Mother God. He gently leaned his head against the Mother God\u2019s thigh and said those words in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cBoring!\u201d The blue and white flower gently flicked her sleeves, and the sharp crystals on Camil\u2019s four limbs instantly vanished. Camil\u2019s body slowly floated into the air, slowly descending and landing in front of Qi Ao Shuang. Xiao Ao Shuang extended her hand to catch Camil. Jin Yan stepped forward and took off his cloak to cover Camil\u2019s body. There was no blood on Camil\u2019s four limbs from the sharp crystals. The wounds on his body slowly healed. Seeing this, Qi Ao Shuang finally calmed down. Camille was fine, but he could make it in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cCamil\u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang whispered into Camil\u2019s ear, but Camil was still unconscious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Qing Hua indifferently said that, then turned around and walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>Jin Yan came forward and carried Camil. He nodded to Qi Aushuang before taking a step forward. Qi Ao Shuang nodded lightly, following behind.</p><br/><p>Everyone walked out in silence. Qi Ao Shuang followed behind Jin Yan and looked at Camil on his back. Her eyes were filled with slight sadness and deep reluctance. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s gaze slowly shifted to Feng Yi Xuan. After staring at Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s back for a long time, she slowly shifted her gaze back to Jin Yan. She looked at each of the crowd before finally turning to meet Leng Lingyun\u2019s gaze, who was walking beside her.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s gaze was deep, and she stared at Qi Ao Shuang. However, Qi Ao Shuang only smiled and did not say anything. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s attitude caused Leng Lingyun\u2019s expression to turn serious.</p><br/><p>Everyone walked out of the palace. Qing Hua, who was walking at the front, suddenly turned around and looked at Xiao Ao Shuang with a cold smile, \u201cThis man will recover slowly. Nothing will happen to him.\u201d She was referring to Camille.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang nodded gently and walked to Jin Yan\u2019s side. She extended her hand and gently smoothed the hair on the front of his head before letting out a soft sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Qinghua\u2019s eyes turned cold, raising her voice to remind Xiao Aoshuang impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang responded in a low voice. She turned around and smiled at Dittos and Jonathan. \u201cJonathan, Ditto. It\u2019s good to be friends with you.\u201d You\u2019re too power-hungry, Dotans, to think about too many things. In fact, when a person had something to protect, it would become stronger. Jonathan, it\u2019s hard for you to spend so many years with Dittas. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, I will still accompany you.\u201d Jonathan shrugged and said helplessly.</p><br/><p>However, there was a trace of unease in the eyes of Dentance. He looked at Qi Ao Shuang hesitantly, then slightly frowned, as if he was thinking about what Xiao Ao Shuang had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingyun, I\u2019m sorry, thank you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang walked in front of Leng Lingyun and looked up at her with a sad smile, her heart full of guilt. This man had done so much for him, yet in the end, he had been unable to respond to his feelings. Leng Lingyun was a good man, a good man \u2026</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s eyes were deep, but she did not say a word. However, there was something firm in the depths of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was stunned on the spot. As he watched Qi Ao Shuang approach him, Qi Ao Shuang spread out her arms and hugged him. She slowly moved closer to his ear and whispered a few words into his ear. \u201cYi Xuan, I like you.\u201d These few words were like a thousand jin boulder that pressed down on Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart. At this moment, Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart nearly stopped beating. This was the first time Qi Ao Shuang had spoken her mind out loud and responded to him in a positive manner.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang let go of him and smiled at Feng Yi Xuan, silently watching him. Since when had this person entered her heart? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps it was his first time seeing him arrogantly baring his fangs and brandishing his claws at the arena, or perhaps it was his appearance when he encountered the Dark Mage, or perhaps it was his appearance just in time after the battle with the Moon Goddess \u2026 Too much, too much. At this moment, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind was filled with the images from the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo Shuang, you \u2026\u201d A sense of unease arose in Feng Yixuan\u2019s heart. It gradually spread out, nearly devouring his heart.</p><br/><p>Blue Flower suddenly stepped forward and placed his hand on Feng Yi Xuan\u2019s forehead with lightning speed. Feng Yixuan\u2019s entire body shook, and he froze on the spot.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang turned around and saw the cold expression on Qing Hua\u2019s face and the anger in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t belong to you, then don\u2019t continue to drag it out shamelessly.\u201d The cold voice of Qing Hua was filled with impatience and annoyance.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang watched Qing Hua\u2019s movements and then looked at the frozen Feng Yi Xuan. She suddenly felt a sense of loss. She knew that Qing Hua was restoring his memories \u2026 A memory like fire.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s hands, which were hidden in her sleeves, were slightly clenched. She watched the movements of Qing Hua and paid close attention to Feng Yixuan\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d Lily whispered to Jin Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo recover the deepest memories of Breezy, as memories of fire.\u201d Jin Yan\u2019s heart was extremely complicated. He had already guessed everything from the conversation between Qi Aoshuang and Qing Hua. Young Miss said that he would support all the decisions he made, forever and unconditionally. But does Miss have to support herself by sacrificing herself to save Camille? If he fought against Qing Hua, the result would most likely be him infuriating her. Other than Feng Yi Xuan and Leng Lingyun, everyone else would be mercilessly killed by her. In just a short period of time, Jin Yan had already understood the personality of Blue and White Flower. Cold, cruel, overbearing, always aloof.</p><br/><p>Dittos\u2019 eyes darkened as he silently watched the scene in front of him. Suddenly, he felt a weight on his shoulder, followed by a wave of warmth. Turning his head, he saw Jonathan put his hand on his shoulder and nod resolutely after smiling at him. For some reason, an indescribable feeling filled his entire body as his heart suddenly felt warm. What was this feeling? Dotans was stunned. He turned back to look at Qi Ao Shuang. The words Xiao Aushuang had said just now were still etched deeply into his mind. Family love, friendship, love \u2026 Dittos slowly reached out his hand, hesitated for a moment, and finally pressed his hand down heavily on Jonathan\u2019s hand. Jonathan was stunned, then a knowing smile appeared on his face. At the very least, Dittos had already taken his first step, although he didn\u2019t know if he would have the chance to take his next step in the future.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Qing Hua retracted her hand, turned around and looked at Xiao Ao Shuang, coldly shouting: \u201cQuick, fulfill your promise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked deeply at the frozen Feng Yi Xuan. A faint smile slowly appeared on her lips as she nodded: \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d He then turned to the crowd and said, \u201cThis is a deal between me and her. None of you are to interfere. Don\u2019t lose your lives in vain.\u201d \u201cI hope you all are doing well \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Jin Yan clenched his teeth, but his expression changed. He was about to say something, but Qi Ao Shuang firmly shook her head, using her eyes to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cHmph!\u201d Qing Hua coldly snorted as he extended his hand and waved it towards the others. A powerful and terrifying pressure swept over them. The next moment, everyone was shocked to realize that they were unable to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to leave peacefully, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to stop myself from killing everyone who causes trouble.\u201d Qing Hua coldly stated her purpose for doing this. She was very clear that if these people saw her killing Qi Aushuang, they would definitely not just stand there and watch. At that time, she would definitely kill them all. And Qi Ao Shuang probably wouldn\u2019t give up so easily. This way, she would lose her original intention.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang did not speak again. She looked at the crowd once more before slowly walking in front of Qing Hua.</p><br/><p>Qing Hua\u2019s eyes turned cold. She stretched out her hand and stabbed towards Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s chest. Her hand directly pierced through Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s chest, but there was no blood. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body gradually became transparent, slowly forming a stream of air that attached itself to Qing Hua\u2019s arm and flowed towards her body.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun\u2019s hands trembled slightly. He was trying his best to resist the restraint of the azure flower, trying his best to break through it. At this moment, he only had one thought in his mind, and that was to not let Xiao Ao Shuang disappear!</p><br/><p>The people who did the same naturally included Jin Yan and Dittas. Unfortunately, before the tyrannical power of Blue Flowers, no one could get rid of them.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang felt her body turning light and light, and she gradually lost all feeling in her body. However, her consciousness did not disappear immediately. She could see everything around her very clearly. He saw her body gradually disappear. Then, Jin Lian and Liu Li fell from the sky to the ground. The two of them were unconscious. He could clearly see Leng Lingyun\u2019s pained expression, Jin Yan\u2019s pained expression, Lily\u2019s fear and sorrow, and Dittas\u2019 bloodshot eyes as he looked at Qing Hua with hatred. Feng Yixuan, where is Yi Xuan? He remained where he was, his head bowed.</p><br/><p>In fact, I\u2019m really reluctant to part with her\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at all this, Qi Ao Shuang was filled with reluctance. He also wanted to go back to the continent to meet his friends. He wanted to be with them, wanted to live with them \u2026</p><br/><p>Everything became a dream.</p><br/><p>However, meeting them in this life was really good, really good \u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s consciousness was slowly becoming muddled. Was everything settled?</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

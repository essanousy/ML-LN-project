Why are people always so complicated?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumans are very complex and extreme animals. Humans have the best side, but they also have the ugliest side. \u201cThat\u2019s normal.\u201d At this time, the frivolous tone of Chang Kong changed and he spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d \u201cPeople are the most extreme \u2026\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang repeated the words of Chang Kong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should not be soft on those ugly, nasty ones. \u201cFor the best, we naturally have to cherish it.\u201d The voice of Zhangkong suddenly became cold as he said in a deep voice, \u201cThere is a saying that benevolence towards the enemy is ruthlessness towards oneself.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s better to kill those two people now.\u201d When he said this, it was as easy as eating a meal.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d \u201cKid, I can\u2019t tell that you\u2019re so ruthless. Aren\u2019t you a child?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slowly walked towards the shore, talking to Yu Zhangkong in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d I\u2019m an adult! Although he was just an adult, he was no longer a child. Also, I have inherited memories in my head. I still know a little bit about humans, this complex animal, \u201che said. The sky retorted unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAlright, alright, you\u2019re an adult.\u201d With a faint smile, Xiao Ao Shuang walked to the shore and raised her head to look at Simi and Lenny.</p><br/><p>With their backs facing Qi Ao Shuang, Simi and Lani had their eyes on Qi Ao Shuang from the corner of their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, which path is the right one?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang was standing on the shore, looking at the swamp with some vexation, seeming to not know which rock to go to.</p><br/><p>Simi and Lani were both nervous. If Qi Ao Shuang hadn\u2019t chosen the right path, it wouldn\u2019t have been bad for her to fall. If he chose the right path, that would be good as well. Attack him and let him fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, let\u2019s guess.\u201d Xiao Aushuang mumbled to herself. With a tap of the tip of her foot, she floated to a rock not far from Simi and Lenny.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang cried out in alarm as her body started to sway.</p><br/><p>Excitement appeared in Simi and Lani\u2019s eyes, almost wanting to cry out.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Ao Shuang staggered a little bit, stood still, let out a long breath and said: \u201cPhew! That was close!\u201d \u201cLooks like I was lucky enough to take the right path.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, the rock beneath Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s feet did not shake at all.</p><br/><p>Simi and Lani\u2019s eyes turned heavy with disappointment. The two of them looked at each other and nodded lightly, preparing to make their move. It was obvious that Qi Ao Shuang relied on her luck to step on that solid floating rock. In other words, his strength wasn\u2019t enough to clear this swamp.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly turned her head and saw that the two of them had stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Simi and Lenny also met Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes. Seeing that Qi Ao Shuang stood there without moving and just stared at them like that, they could not help but feel a little flustered. Could it be that Xiao Ao Shuang saw through him?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the two of you disappointed that I didn\u2019t fall down?\u201d A stunning smile suddenly bloomed on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s handsome face.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the two of them changed, and their expressions became unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d I seem to have no enmity with you, why do you want my life? \u201d Xiao Ao Shuang looked at Lenny with some doubt, touching her chin as she asked puzzledly.</p><br/><p>The moment Qi Ao Shuang said this, Lenny and Simi\u2019s expressions became very interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cSince you\u2019ve noticed, then there\u2019s no need to waste your breath. Go die.\u201d Simi sneered endlessly. Earlier, when he saw Qi Ao Shuang guessing that the rock was treading on solid ground, he had already determined that Qi Ao Shuang was not his match. In that case, and he was already in the swamp, there was no need to pretend. How could he have imagined that this was Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s way of paralyzing him?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you die, do you understand?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang pursed her lips and looked at Lenny. What she wanted to express was that before Lenny and Simi died, they should at least tell her why they were targeting her. However, to the two of them, this sounded like another meaning. It was like her last wish.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d Lenny would naturally not repeat the embarrassing incident again, much less let the girl by his side know. Her pride did not allow her to say it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTut, that\u2019s a pity.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sighed softly, she could see the killing intent in their eyes. Since they were already so merciless, why should she be so merciful to them?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell!\u201d Simi grinned wickedly, her handsome face already deformed. She let out a low growl, a ball of flame gathering in her hands. With a sudden push in the direction of Qi Aushuang, he decided to leave the matter of the fire to her. You\u2019re letting her go just like that?! \u201cBig trouble, big trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d However, Xiao Aushuang smiled faintly, not nervous at all, \u201cThey were the ones who started this matter first, she would not reveal what happened today if she did not have full confidence.\u201d Also, who said I let her go just like that? \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t beat her to death the last time you hit her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot dying at that time doesn\u2019t mean that he won\u2019t die in the future.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled sinisterly. At this time, why did he keep feeling that even though Qi Ao Shuang was smiling, it was still very cold? Why is that?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The air was full of doubts, so naturally, he kept asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t what she cares the most about her face?\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t it just because of that face?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said casually, \u201cWhen she becomes a Bao Gong, I wonder if there will be more men circling around her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what?\u201d The more he panicked, the more he almost jumped up and pinched Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s neck. He didn\u2019t understand what Qi Ao Shuang was talking about. \u201cWhat is Bao Gong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA man with a face as black as carbon.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang said lazily, \u201cBefore she left, I struck a cold wind into her body.\u201d He brought something with him. It would slowly flow all over her body. \u201cNot just the face, but the skin will slowly turn black.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d You are even more vicious than me! I only wanted to kill her, but you actually dared to attack her. Good, very good, very good! I admire you. \u201cFrom now on, you will follow this Young Master, this Young Master will protect you.\u201d The sky nodded heavily as it spoke in excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap, let\u2019s go in. We\u2019ve comprehended a little something, let\u2019s continue.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang grabbed onto the sky and shoved him into her chest, and the sky automatically entered her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s hurry up and finish your business. Let\u2019s go find that woman and watch the show.\u201d In the end, the Sky was still mumbling excitedly.</p><br/><p>Eight trigrams! Color! Put a stone in the well! It was difficult for these features of Vast Sky to make Qi Ao Shuang combine him with the pure elemental essence of the legends.</p><br/><p>After finding a quiet corner to sit down cross-legged, Qi Ao Shuang connected several barriers before slowly closing her eyes and trying to merge herself into the world.</p><br/><p>Everything went dark and quiet.</p><br/><p>Between heaven and earth, everything had disappeared, leaving only darkness behind. The wind, a gentle breeze slowly blew over. The wind blew against Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face, ruffling her hair before it slowly blew forward. Qi Ao Shuang closed her eyes but felt the wind far away, her consciousness slowly chasing after it.</p><br/><p>Gradually, a little light appeared in front of them. It was getting brighter as he continued forward. The surroundings suddenly became clear. Everything was imprinted into Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s mind. The bubbling swamp, the floating rocks. Real and fake, real and fake \u2026</p><br/><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s consciousness continued to move forward. Hairy? Momo swam happily in the swamp, harassing the students. Those students were suffering unspeakably. They wanted to investigate the solid floating rocks and also wanted to guard against Momo\u2019s attacks. One of the students had his right hand tightly bandaged and cold sweat covered his forehead. The person who had been attacked by Momo and had cried out in pain should have been him.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s consciousness continued forward, and she saw a relaxed figure. It was Jonathan. Jonathan stopped and stopped for a short time. Soon, he could find the next rock to land on.</p><br/><p>As he continued forward, he saw another figure. It was clearly faster than Jonathan\u2019s speed.</p><br/><p>Dittos?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s consciousness stopped moving forward, and she could feel the Dentance moving forward in front of her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Dittos stopped. He slowly turned his head to see that there was no movement behind him.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong? Xiao Ao Shuang was puzzled as to why Di Tan suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, a trace of a smile appeared on Dickens\u2019s handsome face. He simply smiled at the space behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, not bad.\u201d Dotans spoke a few words into the void behind him. He smiled lightly and turned around, quickly dashing forward.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang was stunned.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Two youths and a young girl were coldly watching her, but when their eyes met they hurriedly looked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if they aren\u2019t satisfied, they didn\u2019t even have the qualifications to be chosen, even worse than your peacock little sister.\u201d Walter disdainfully said. Lashia always walked with her nose pointed at the sky, was that not a peacock?</p><br/><p>\u201cThose three are all warriors.\u201d Jean frowned looking at the three whom had grouped together and seemed like they were discussing something.</p><br/><p>Claire ignored them, put White Emperor on her shoulder, and started searching through the illustrated handbooks: The Complete Magic Beasts illustrated handbook, The Complete Shapeshifters illustrated handbook, and also the Complete Phantoms illustrated handbook.</p><br/><p>Carrying the thick, heavy books was really uncomfortable, so Claire handed all the reference books for Jean to carry and found the nearest table to sit down and started flipping through one.</p><br/><p>Standing behind Claire, Jean watched the three people who had been unfriendly the whole time walk over. The leading young girl had on her back an unusually shaped broadsword and walked towards Claire with a cold expression. The two youths behind also had unfriendly expressions. From time to time their gazes drifted towards the magic sword at Jean\u2019s waist. That was the competition\u2019s prize. After Claire received it, they didn\u2019t expect that she had actually bestowed it to her guardian knight!</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire Hill, I, Alice Roman, will now challenge you to duel!\u201d The young girl\u2019s words powerfully resonated and were exceptionally solemn as she coldly watched Claire.</p><br/><p>When Jean heard this family name he frowned slightly. Was it the daughter of the Roman family? The Roman clan was an aristocratic family in the capital and had many people with courtly positions.</p><br/><p>Duel?!</p><br/><p>There was an uproar among the people nearby and the quiet library was suddenly noisy. For a duel, if the other side was afraid and didn\u2019t accept then it would be extremely humiliating. But, this young girl was obviously a high level warrior. Although Claire was a magic warrior, her cultivation wasn\u2019t that high. Wasn\u2019t this girl\u2019s behavior a little over the top?</p><br/><p>The surrounding people started gossiping, but most people wanted to see Claire\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo time.\u201d Claire insipidly said, flipped the illustrated handbook on the table and didn\u2019t even give so much of a glance at the young girl. Her indifferent attitude shocked everyone.</p><br/><p>The nearby people watched Claire in amazement and shock. Did she know such a refusal was the greatest insult to the other person? In situations like this, the other person might try to kill her, even at the risk of their life. And such a an uncaring and casual rejection. Was she treating a duel like an invitation for a meal?</p><br/><p>As expected, the young girl called Alice had already turned red in the face. She fiercely clenched her teeth, her heart already flooded with rage. This arrogant male-chaser, thinking of herself as unparalleled after just learning a bit of Dou Qi. If the person who faced Feng Yixuan was her, then that person would have had an even worse loss! Because that day Claire had shown that she was only at the advanced warrior level! If Claire was replaced by her, then that Feng Yixuan would have been beaten up even more unsightly!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo all people from the Hill family have no backbone or real strength? Is that why you don\u2019t accept my challenge?\u201d Alice mocked, sneering as she tried her best to control her anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least people from the Hill family are civilized and won\u2019t be like a vixen, shouting and yelling in a quiet library.\u201d Before Claire spoke, a cold voice floated over.</p><br/><p>Another uproar resulted, and looking behind, the crowd saw a cold-faced Lashia icily watching this side. The words just now were said by Lashia. So Lashia had always been in the library, and she saw everything from the moment Claire entered.</p><br/><p>Alice\u2019 face greened and paled. Just now her behavior really was uncivilized. The capital\u2019s library was always a place where capable people gathered. The people who could be borrow books here were not commoners and her actions just now really weren\u2019t appropriate. Naturally, when she came back to her senses, she regretted them. But she still wouldn\u2019t acknowledge her mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cGenius Lashia, didn\u2019t you also lose very badly. Not only did you almost lose your life, but you almost dishonored our country.\u201d This Alice had disliked Lashia for a long time. What genius magician, magician engaging in close combat with a warrior was the equivalent of certain death.</p><br/><p>Lashia\u2019s expression changed as she was about to explode.</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s cold voice, although low and gentle, interrupted timely. \u201cHow can person who didn\u2019t even pass the preliminary round bark in here? Are you feeling that it\u2019s a pity that we didn\u2019t humiliate our country in the end or are you upset that you weren\u2019t the one onstage humiliating our country?\u201d Claire\u2019s tongue started becoming poisonous. Claire never had any good feelings towards these arrogant aristocrats.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!!!\u201d Alice was furious, abruptly pulling out the sword on her back and pointed it at Claire.</p><br/><p>The library\u2019s mood instantly became tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Claire slowly stood up, a peerlessly brilliant smile radiating from her face, in that instant captivating everyone. But the words Claire said was a different matter. \u201cLittle vixen, let\u2019s go, I accept your dual, let\u2019s go out. I don\u2019t want to bother the people here who are reading.\u201d That gentle tone of voice and seductive smile charmed everyone completely, making them lose their senses and overlook her malicious words.</p><br/><p>Truly malicious, Walter thought. Women, don\u2019t mess with them. This was really a gentle knife. This feeling was too \u201camazing,\u201d like he was going to be butchered but was still helping her clean the knife. So, Walter concluded insightfully, it\u2019s most terrifying when that little devil smiles.</p><br/><p>Claire slowly got up and walked towards the entrance. When she passed by Lashia, a sliver of worry flashed in Lashia\u2019s eyes as she said two words in a quiet and low voice. \u201cElder sister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire looked back slightly, nodded at Lashia, and then walked out.</p><br/><p>Lashia stared blankly, then an imperceptible smile appeared on her face, gentle and faint.</p><br/><p>Claire walked in front with Jean following from behind.</p><br/><p>Alice sheathed the sword onto her back and followed with a face full of anger. The rage in her eyes reached the skies as she hatefully watched Claire, itching to dismember Claire\u2019s body into a thousand pieces. This hateful male-chaser actually called her in that way.</p><br/><p>Lashia also followed from behind. The people at Lashia\u2019s sides were her followers. At the very back was a large mass of people. They all originally came to the library to look up information, but when they heard Claire accepted a duel, they all eagerly ran out to see the excitement.</p><br/><p>Once they saw clearly the person Claire accepted a duel against, they all became shocked. It was Alice Roman. Alice was the Sunrise Institute\u2019s third ranked warrior. At thirteen years of age she is already at the level of a grand warrior, truly making people shocked. Meanwhile, Claire was a magician who had only used advanced warrior level Dou Qi, and her level as a magician had never been tested before.</p><br/><p>Which family would win this contest?</p><br/><p>Quickly, the plaza in front of the library was surrounded by an impenetrable crowd and the number of people continued to grow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted you accepted my duel.\u201d Alice sneered, fuming with rage. The pleased expression in her eyes deepened, as if in the next moment, victory was hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d Claire only insipidly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Alice actually said profoundly, \u201cIsn\u2019t it too boring this way, let\u2019s make a bet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Claire raised her brow slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I win, I want the sword your knight has! If I lose, I\u2019ll give this sword to you.\u201d Alice pulled out the strange sword on her back and fiercely struck it into the ground. Immediately a thin crack appeared on the slate plaza\u2019s ground.</p><br/><p>She wanted Jean\u2019s magic sword?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

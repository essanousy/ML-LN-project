Get back to business!\u201d Xue Longfei ordered the spectators. They all glared at Qi Aoshuang, but still dispersed.</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou hurriedly ran over to Qi Aoshuang as if his butt was on fire. \u201cAoshuang, I-I\u2019m going back to the inn. Chuxin, Chuxin is still there.\u201d Dong Fenghou had overheard Xue Longfei say that the Temple of Light and Black Lightning already had the inn surrounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Qi Aoshuang nodded, frowning. Her gaze had not shifted from Xue Longfei, who was still smiling brightly, evidently cautious.</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou madly hastened to the inn. No one stopped them, which made Qi Aoshuang even more suspicious of Xue Longfei.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you approach me?\u201d Xue Longfei walked over casually, motioning for the girl beside him to leave.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang watched him carefully, but did not sense any malice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your relationship with those religious fools. I only wanted to have a fight with you. The results are already out. You are stronger than me,\u201d he said plainly as he sheathed his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mermaid princess.\u201d Qi Aoshuang also sheathed her sword, coldly announcing her objective. One thing was certain: Xue Longfei would not act based on common sense. She was a little surprised at his free spirit, even a little envious.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? You\u2019re looking for Qian-er*?\u201d Xue Longfei stroked his chin thoughtfully, then said coldly. \u201cDid you fall for her good looks? Are you into women?\u201d</p><br/><p>*adding -er to the end of a first name is a form of endearment, like a cute nickname</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s expression turned frosty, Azure Ripple blade already in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was joking!\u201d Xue Longfei took a few steps back, his hands raised in surrender. \u201cDon\u2019t be hasty, I was just joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph!\u201d Qi Aoshung humphed coldly, retracting the Azure Ripple blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why are you looking for Qian-er?\u201d Xue Longfei still did not understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are after her tiara, and want to bring her back to her parents\u2019 side.\u201d As Qi Aoshuang finished speaking, she could already see that Xue Longfei\u2019s expression was different from usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, don\u2019t look at me that way. I didn\u2019t kidnap her, she stubbornly wanted to follow no matter what.\u201d Xue Longfei seemed somewhat unsatisfied. He did a hair flip, then sighed, \u201cIt was just my luck that I was born with such good looks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang immediately felt a burst of disdain, but didn\u2019t say a word. She only eyed him coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, you should go help your friends. We\u2019ll meet at the easter pier. My boat is there. I will bring you what you want and tell Qian-er to return to her clan.\u201d Xue Longfei shrugged.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned, watching Xue Longfei skeptically. What exactly was he planning?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Your friends must be amidst a difficult battle currently,\u201d Xue Longfei advised.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strong are the people they are fighting compared to you?\u201d Qi Aoshuang gave no indication of leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course weaker than me. As the strongest one, I was reserved to fight you.\u201d Xue Longfei raised a brow playfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll just wait here for them.\u201d Qi Aoshuang walked over to the fountain and sat down calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Xue Longfei\u2019s eyes widened, watching the expressionless Qi Aoshuang. Did she not care about her companions? Or did she have confidence in them? It seemed to be the latter. He couldn\u2019t help but doubt. Were her friends really that strong?</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang did not say a word, continuing to sit calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? What are you up to?\u201d Xue Longfei sat down right next to her, chatting naturally. \u201cI don\u2019t like those religious hypocrites who spew lies all day either. Originally, they had a branch here, but I secretly eliminated them. They have told me to watch out for the perpetrator ever since, what a joke. Why would I hand myself over?\u201d Xue Longfei chatted freely without any precautions.</p><br/><p>\u201cDestroy the Temple,\u201d Qi Aoshuang answered simply. She looked up at the sky, calculating when they would wrap up at the inn. She secretly sighed in her heart. Xue Longfei was truly unruly beyond belief. The City of Unruly, what a name that befitted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, really? Haha, good idea.\u201d Xue Longfei raised a brow excitedly. Then he frowned. \u201cBut right now you\u2019re being chased down by the Temple. How can you destroy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang regarded him coldly. \u201cDo you think your phrasing is correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, haha. It\u2019s more like the Temple is eating your dust.\u201d Xue Longfei laughed, correcting his mistake.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang frowned. \u201cWhy did you decide to help me? Were you not assisting the Temple?\u201d Qi Aoshuang did not care for the Temple of Light, but the goddess of Light was another story. The goddess\u2019s terrifying strength remained fresh in her memory. Therefore, though she did not care for the Temple itself, it was best not to face them directly.</p><br/><p>Xue Longfei smoothed back his hair, adopting a relaxed posture. \u201cNo reason. I do what I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang was silent. His words and posture fit his personality perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Claire\u2026\u201d Xue Longfei started to say, looking at her black hair.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang broke him off. \u201cCall me Qi Aoshuang. The name Claire died with someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Qi Aoshuang, is there a person of the Feng merchant clan among your comrades?\u201d Xue Longfei changed to a different topic. He had noticed the nearly imperceptible trace of grief in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s eyes. The person she spoke of was probably her mother. Naturally, he did not believe the girl before him would cruelly kill her own mother. It must have been another \u201cgood deed\u201d of the religious hypocrites.</p><br/><p>Hmm? She was aware the Feng Trade Union was renown throughout the entire Ceylon continent, but did not understand why he would suddenly ask such a question.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there came the sound of thundering footsteps.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the one with red hair. He is the Feng clan\u2019s Feng Yixuan, the son of the president of the Feng Trade Union.\u201d Qi Aoshuang indicated at the hurriedly running Feng Yixuan.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan and Leng Lingyun arrived followed closely by the Xi brothers along with Qiao Chuxin and Dong Fenghou.</p><br/><p>Once they saw Qi Aoshuang and the gorgeously dressed man was sitting together peacefully, they were all shocked. Dong Fenghou\u2019s chin was about to dislocate. Before he had left, Qi Aoshuang was still coldly affront him, sparks flying. How were they now harmonious?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You must be from the Feng clan, one of the people wanted by the Temple of Light and empire of Amparkland.\u201d Xue Longfei watching Feng Yixuan with a whimsical.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s expression changed, about to flare up.</p><br/><p>But Xue Longfei said something that struck him heavily. \u201cFor you, the Temple of Light and empire of Amparkland has put the Feng clan under heavy pressure. Are you not going to return?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone froze at his words.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was dumbstruck, staring at Xue Longfei blankly, but Xue Longfei\u2019s gaze was firm. He appeared entirely truthful.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething happened to the Feng clan?\u201d Qi Aoshuang stood up promptly. Though he was smiling whimsically, his eyes were serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can figure out your identity, you think others can\u2019t? The ones you have faced on your journey are greenhorns.\u201d Xue Longfei shrugged heedlessly. \u201cThe Temple of Light must be gathering talents who rival your strength besides I to kill you. You should take care of yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened to the Feng clan?\u201d Qi Aoshuang\u2019s heart sunk. An Lisha\u2019s bright smile appeared in her mind\u2019s eye. To Qi Aoshuang, she was already a special existence. Though she appeared fiery, she was tender on the inside. At the time, it was she who had brought Qi Aoshuang to the Feng island and asked the Astral Wind elder to block the lightning strikes. When Qi Aoshuang was at her lowest point, it was she who sheltered her.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan was currently unusually calm. He said coldly, \u201cWhat happened to the Feng clan? Please tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Longfei\u2019s expression shifted slightly. Though the aura of the red haired youth before him was like that of a calm lake, he sensed an indescribable pressure. The pressure was even more dreadful compared to Qi Aoshuang\u2019s. A terrifying thought flashed in his mind. This youth was even stronger than Qi Aoshuang?! Was this why Qi Aoshuang confidently sat down, calmly waiting for them?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease tell me.\u201d Feng Yixuan\u2019s voice was clear cut, tranquil, yet spine chilling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Feng clan is currently being pressured. Many branches have been suppressed, and Amparkland keeps on provoking Lagark,\u201d Xue Longfei said grimly. \u201cI suggest you return.\u201d Though he had already sensed Feng Yixuan\u2019s power, he still advised him.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan\u2019s eyes were already filled with hellfire.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

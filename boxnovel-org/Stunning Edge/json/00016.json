His robe was snow white without a speck of dirt. If he was not bothered the least in Gale Gorge, then he must be really powerful.</p><br/><p>Claire sized up the person who just landed. The young man looked to be about only twenty years of age, but the delicate pattern on the corner of his snow white robe showed his high position in the Temple of Light. His long silver hair flowed in the wind and his perfect features only showed indifference. His rare violet irises especially caught attention. His whole being gave off a pure stateliness that couldn\u2019t be violated.</p><br/><p>The young man glanced at everyone impassively, but when his gaze passed over Claire, a strange light glinted in his eyes; however, he moved his gaze on without a word. Then, he slowly lifted his hand and an indescribable pressure flooded out. All the Wind Wolves dropped to the ground, whimpering, as if they were afraid. Shortly, they started backing away slowly, creeping away until the whole wolf pack was gone. At the same time, when the pressure reached the crowd, everyone\u2019s breathing became difficult and they all felt an urge to kneel down and worship. If they were normal people, they probably would already have, but because they were not normal people, and naturally everybody forced the urge down.</p><br/><p>The young man in white seemed to notice the situation on this side. He lightly pointed and removed the pressure. Everyone let out a breath of relief.</p><br/><p>But Claire\u2019s face dropped. Was this one of the strong? This was power, this was the difference between her and the truly strong! When could she surpass this person?!</p><br/><p>The white robed, absolutely handsome man waved his hand again. A pure white light surrounded all the wounded people in the center of the crowd. Their wounds healed so quickly it was visible. Gasps and shouts resounded continuously. Healer, this white robed man was a healer! And with a wave of his hand, he could heal a group of people at once!</p><br/><p>The beautiful man with violet eyes didn\u2019t even wait for anyone to thank him before he floated off the ground, disappearing from their sight. Once he disappeared, they came back to their senses and realized how impolite they were. All of them were too busy aweing at his strength and forgot to say thanks to their life savior.</p><br/><p>Claire looked at the night sky, not saying a word for a long time. Jean kept quiet, seemingly understanding Claire\u2019s strange, fluctuating emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful young lady, why are you here? And just the two of you?\u201d Jackson, after making sure that no one was around, asked Claire curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, to complete a task.\u201d Claire answered shortly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you so much for your aid.\u201d Jackson smiled, thanking them from the bottom of his heart, \u201cI still haven\u2019t asked for your name yet, miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, we didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Claire said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Miss. We will all remember your assistance at heart.\u201d Jackson replied earnestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any danger anymore,\u201d Claire said coldly, obviously not in a good mood, \u201cWe shall thus leave. Come on, Jean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, miss, if you don\u2019t mind, camp out with us here. The more people the safer. We discovered that Gale Gorge seems abnormal today, as if something went wrong. That\u2019s why we met the Wind Wolves.\u201d Jackson said, sincerity written all over his face. He really cared about the safety of this beautiful young girl. How pitiful would it be if such a beauty lost her life by the hands of those ugly beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire, what he said makes some sense. It is unusual here.\u201d Jean whispered to Claire, \u201cMaybe we should camp here right now, and split up when we reach that place tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Claire thought about it and nodded her head. Indeed, an unspeakable strangeness floated in the air.</p><br/><p>In the night, the lit bonfire shone over the clearing, and every tent hung up their own lights.</p><br/><p>Claire sat alone in the tent Meditating, absorbing the elements. The density of elements in Gale Gorge was evidently higher than inside the city.</p><br/><p>Jean sat beside the bonfire, not far from the tent, chatting casually with the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, thank you for today. I\u2019m Jackson, squad leader of the seventeenth squad of the Iron Blood mercenary group. And you?\u201d Jackson drank from his wineskin, celebrating their survival. Of course, they knew their limits and priorities and wouldn\u2019t get drunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cJean.\u201d Jean replied lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the young miss is Claire.\u201d Jackson heard Jean calling Claire\u2019s name and asked to confirm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Actually, we didn\u2019t help much. The person who actually helped you was that person from the Temple of Light.\u201d Jean said indifferently, blocking Jackson\u2019s next words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is very powerful.\u201d Jackson placed the wineskin in his hand down and put on a solemn face, \u201cHe didn\u2019t even cast any spells, and only used pressure to scare the beasts off. And from the golden pattern on the edge of his robe, we can tell he definitely isn\u2019t just any ordinary person from the Temple of Light.\u201d Although the Wind Wolves scared off were only third grade beasts, to force them off by only using pressure showed that this person was very strong.</p><br/><p>Jean pondered, his mind filling with thoughts about the beautiful man whose violet eyes were extremely rare.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Holy Divine Prince of the Temple of Light!\u201d Jean suddenly said, certain.</p><br/><p>Jackson and everyone else were shocked. After a long time, Jackson came back to his senses and said as if in a trance, \u201cRumors say that the Holy Divine Prince has the purest power of Light, and is not only a powerful magician, but also a rare healer. He\u2019s the next in line for the seat of the pope. Legend even has it that his violet irises can see into the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jean was silent. He believed the first things Jackson said. They weren\u2019t exaggerated; he saw the power of that person just a moment ago. But the violet irises that could see into the future might be exaggerated. Rumors often become far-fetched.</p><br/><p>In the tent, Claire slowly opened her tightly closed eyes, coldness and unwillingness evident.</p><br/><p>The strong! So this what the strong were like in this world! She must become powerful, must!</p><br/><p>The Holy Divine Prince of the Temple of Light? Claire closed her eyes slowly. One day, she would become a person as powerful as that. No! Even more powerful than him!</p><br/><p>This was Claire\u2019s first contact with him and definitely not the last.</p><br/><p>In the night sky, the brightest star seemed to go off its path a bit.</p><br/><p>In the Temple of Light in the city of Berthe.</p><br/><p>In a damp, dark room, a woman with silky green hair knitted her brows together tightly. She was the best clairvoyant in the Temple of Light. In front of her, on an ancient wooden rack, the originally clear and bright crystal ball now had a faint streak of black!</p><br/><p>Why did she have an ominous feeling?</p><br/><p>It seemed as if a powerful force was going to change something, and related to the Temple of Light\u2019s future. What is it?</p><br/><p>She was only sure that this wasn\u2019t a good feeling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

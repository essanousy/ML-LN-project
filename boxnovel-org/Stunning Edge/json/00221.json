Qi Aoshuang continued looking at the astonished woman in red with an expressionless face.</p><br/><p>The woman in red took the sword back. After standing still, she asked curiously, \u201cWhy did you kill the three people in front of you without dodging my attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first two are my enemies. Even if it\u2019s an illusion, I won\u2019t be merciful.\u201d Qi Aoshuang said passively.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the third person? It\u2019s not your enemy anymore, is it?\u201d The woman in red frowned as she asked this question. Her heart was filled with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d Qi Aoshuang said indifferently.</p><br/><p>Eh? The woman in red was stunned by Qi Aoshuang\u2019s honest words. She then asked anxiously, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you dodge my attack and instead of attacking me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I want your power, I cannot offend you!\u201d Qi Aoshuang\u2019s words were even more straightforward.</p><br/><p>The woman in red\u2019s heart was already spurting blood. However, she forcefully held it in on the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you really are an interesting person, very honest.\u201d The woman in red smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the core of fire this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the woman in red finished speaking, she disappeared.</p><br/><p>As for Qi Aoshuang, she returned to reality once again. Before her eyes was a bright red crystal cliff face, and she was still floating in mid-air. She slowly lowered her head and saw a fiery red line quickly extending from her palm to her arm. The core of fire had disappeared. Her entire body felt totally comfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, little brat, your luck is pretty good. You actually absorbed all the power of the fire.\u201d The man looked at QI Aoshuang who was floating in the air and spoke while narrowing his eyes. \u201cThe Core of the Fire has been formed for 500 years, and not everyone can completely absorb it. If the soul of the fire is not satisfied, the only thing that can be obtained is a crystal without any power, and a better one can absorb 70%.\u201d This little brat was actually able to absorb all of it. \u201cCould it be that the Core of the Fire is a man? Did she seduce him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow!\u201d The Fortune Cat mewled unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was joking. Ah Bao, look, she\u2019s still just a little brat. Which blind man would fall for her?\u201d The man laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d \u201cFar away in Ragka, Feng Yixuan ferociously sneezed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, What\u2019s wrong? Have you caught a cold?\u201d The people beside him asked with concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Feng Yixuan shook his head and then stared viciously at the sky. \u201cI wonder which bastard is speaking ill of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAchoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan wasn\u2019t the only one who sneezed \u2026</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather\u2019s hearts were at ease when they heard the man\u2019s words. It looked like this time, Qi Aoshuang could successfully absorb the power of the Core of Fire. She would be able to raise her strength to a higher level.</p><br/><p>As for Qi Aoshuang, she was still feeling the burning sensation surging through her body.</p><br/><p>Hot, very hot, very hot\u2026</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang slowly frowned.</p><br/><p>Her body felt like it was on fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be?\u201d The man looked at the still floating Qi Aoshuang and twitched his mouth. \u201cHuo Hun actually likes her so much? Huo Hun is definitely a man!\u201d</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather didn\u2019t know what was going on. They anxiously looked at Qi Aoshuang floating in the air, while their ears pricked up to listen to the man\u2019s next words. It was not bad to have a treasure cat. In order to make the kitten happy, the man explained Qi Aoshuang\u2019s situation in detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, Ah Bao, is the color of the flames on the little brat changing?\u201d The man placed the Fortune Cat on his shoulder. The cat widened its amber eyes as it watched the changes on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The flames changed from red to gold, then white, then navy, then blue. \u201cMeow?\u201d The Fortune Cat stared blankly at the flames on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s body. It turned black in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe King of Flame has come out!\u201d The man slightly raised his eyebrows. Although he did not care about these things, they were all different for the little brat!</p><br/><p>The King of Flame!!!</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather looked at each other in horror.</p><br/><p>What many people didn\u2019t know was that flames also had a king.</p><br/><p>The black flame was the king of flame. When the other colors of the flame met the black one, it was not an attack, but a worship. If two Flame Mages were to fight, the person who possessed the King of Flame would positively win because no one would challenge him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the King of Flame very powerful?\u201d Black Feather asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The man squinted his eyes and smiled, \u201cIt never do anyone any harm. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Black Feather was confused, and White Emperor also frowned slightly. They had heard of the King of Flame before, but had never actually seen one before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe King of Flame doesn\u2019t have any attack power at all,\u201d the man squinted his eyes and smiled, \u201cBut every other flame has to bow to him and dodge him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah? White Emperor and Black Feather\u2019s mouth slightly twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cA King doesn\u2019t need to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the man was excitedly explaining, a shocking change happened to Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>A long sigh came out of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s mouth, as if it came from the distant horizon, causing people\u2019s hearts to be deeply shocked.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang\u2019s entire body was enveloped in a golden flame, and on her back was a pair of golden flaming wings. Her eyes were completely empty. Her black hair suddenly grew longer in an instant before reaching her ankles. After that, it began to wildly flutter about.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? It\u2019s interesting. \u201cThe man said.</p><br/><p>Woosh!</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang slowly turned around, looking at the few people below with an indifferent expression.</p><br/><p>Under everyone\u2019s astonished gazes, the wings on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s back grew bigger and the color changed.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the wings on her back turned black, and their length also tripled. The flames covering her body also turned from gold to black.</p><br/><p>Black hair, black eyes, black wings, black flames.</p><br/><p>It was an extremely beautiful, breathtaking beauty.</p><br/><p>White Emperor suddenly sensed the abnormality in his surroundings. The surroundings had been scorching hot magical essence, but now the red color of the canyon was fading, or more accurately speaking, it was all gathering towards the direction of Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>The heat under their feet slowly disappeared, and the red ground under their feet gradually returned to its original color. The red color of the flowers, plants, and small animals slowly faded.</p><br/><p>Mad elemental undulations, immense power, and boundless energy flooded towards Qi Aoshuang like a flood breaking through a dam.</p><br/><p>She slowly descended and stretched out her arms. She raised her head and closed her eyes. A red pillar of light suddenly appeared in front of her, dyeing half the sky red immediately. The pillar of light gathered together and flew above Qi Aoshuang\u2019s head before pouring down. As soon as it fell down on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s body, it disappeared completely, fusing together with her.</p><br/><p>White Emperor and Black Feather stared at the scene in front of them in surprise. The Treasure Cat didn\u2019t even blink.</p><br/><p>It became cool around, and all the redness faded away. Only the crystal cliff face at the end of the ravine was still red, but its color was much lighter.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gave a slight sigh of relief. At this moment, it felt like ten thousand horses were galloping forward and a raging storm was brewing inside her body.</p><br/><p>The black flame covering her body slowly retreated, and her wings slowly retracted.</p><br/><p>She suddenly opened her eyes, frowned and said in a low voice, \u201cAdvanced!\u201d</p><br/><p>All she could do was to wait quietly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a puzzled voice came from the sky, \u201cEh, where is the Core of Fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang looked up and saw a woman dressed in fiery red clothes floating. The woman was beautiful, but her blood-red lips and exaggerated hair ornaments looked weird. The large jeweled bracelets and necklaces made her too flashy. Huo Hun was also dressed in red. But they are essentially different in temperament.</p><br/><p>The woman in red noticed Qi Aoshuang. She slowly flew in front of her, raising her chin and disdainfully asked, \u201cHey, do you know who took the Core of Fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang did not answer. She coldly stared at the red monkey fart in front of her. She had to admit that she was still no match for her opponent. There was an extremely berserk elemental wave coming from the woman in red. The fire elementals circled around her in an exaggerated manner. Why did someone with such strength still want to find the Core of Fire?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you something, you don\u2019t understand, do you?\u201d the woman felt despised. She pointed a finger at Qi Aoshuang\u2019s nose and shouted angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeow!\u201d The Treasure Cat in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s arms reached out its paws rapidly towards the woman in red.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d The woman in red screamed and quickly withdrew her hand. A few bloody wounds had already appeared on the back of her hand, and blood was oozing out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastard!\u201d The woman in red roared and was about to attack, but she swallowed the words when she saw the Treasure Cat\u2019s look in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s arms. The woman quickly took a few steps back as if she had seen a ghost, and her words was no longer arrogant, \u201cWhy is she here? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

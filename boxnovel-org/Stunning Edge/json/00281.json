I don\u2019t know how to describe this behavior. Only one thing was certain, and that was that Dittas was a martial arts fanatic. Something had been thrown away in pursuit of power. Among them was love.</p><br/><p>This person seemed to have his own rules for the division of emotions. The reason why Lenny was allowed to stay by his side and help Lenny pass the eighth level of the Heavenly Pagoda was because he felt that he owed Lenny a favor. However, once he was done with his favor, he could do something as heartless as this. Towards the attitude of his sister\u2019s child, it was also thought-provoking. What Dittos was saying was that the child didn\u2019t care what happened to her, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt her sister.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang frowned as she thought of something terrifying. For the sake of his sister, Dittens was courteous to the young master. What if one day, Dittas thought, the relationship between him and his sister came to an end? Assuming that Dittos cared about his sister because of her sister\u2019s care, if he felt that the relationship was over. What would that do?</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, a chill crept up Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>What kind of person was Dittas?</p><br/><p>In order to pursue the peak of power, would he really be heartless and heartless? In his previous life, Qi Ao Shuang had heard of that kind of abnormal martial arts fanatic. Some people, in order to pursue extreme martial arts, would cut off all emotions, and some even killed all their relatives. In order to no longer have any worries, they would climb the peak of strength.</p><br/><p>Was it possible that Dittas was one of these people?</p><br/><p>For the next few days, Dittens helped with Nine Heavens City\u2019s preparations. Jonathan took Qi Ao Shuang shopping, eating and talking to beautiful women all day long. As for Lani\u2019s disappearance, Dittas\u2019 sister was very worried. She sent people to look for him, and also sent people back to Lani\u2019s house to inquire about it. Keira, the kid, had been clamoring all day for Lenny. No one suspected Dittos.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the mayor\u2019s mansion knew that Dittas had no interest in Lenny. Who would have thought that Dittas would invite Lenny out in the middle of the night? Naturally, no one doubted Dittas.</p><br/><p>A week later, Dittos offered to return to the Institute.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittas, you, you\u2019re not waiting for Lenny?\u201d Now Lenny hasn\u2019t been found, and her father says Lenny never came home. \u201d Elisa asked with a frown. Eliza had always taken Lenny\u2019s feelings for Dittas to heart. Although the child was a little cold and arrogant, he was not picky with his looks and family background. It had been so long since he had been with Dittas that it was clear how much he loved him. And now Dittos was indifferent to Lenny\u2019s disappearance. Naturally, Eliza was not happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe she already went back to the academy by herself.\u201d Dittens said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d The child could never leave without giving me an answer. \u201d Eliza immediately denied it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how should I know?\u201d I\u2019m going back to the academy first. I\u2019m about to start the competition after the exam. After I finish this, I\u2019ll be back. \u201d Dittens did not want to dwell on this issue any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDittos \u2026!\u201d Elisa wanted to say something but stopped herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201d Dittos nodded, bowed slightly, and then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan nodded and left.</p><br/><p>Elisa opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but in the end, she just silently watched as Dittas\u2019s figure disappeared from the entrance. Every time Dittos left, he left by himself, not allowing Elisa to send him off. Elisa stood where she was, frowning as she looked at the empty door.</p><br/><p>Dittas, this child, who was he really like? Sometimes, he felt that he was terrifyingly calm.</p><br/><p>Just like that, the three of them returned to Star Academy, and Lenny never appeared again.</p><br/><p>After returning to the academy, Qi Ao Shuang asked about the dorm and found that Wynes had returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, where did you go?\u201d \u201cJust returned from the Sky Tower?\u201d Wynes greeted him happily, six small golden stars already attached to his school uniform.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I went to Nine Heavens City.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sat down, smiled at Wynes and said, \u201cCongratulations, you have become a 6-star student.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this is all thanks to you. Thank you for teaching me so much.\u201d Wynes poured a glass of water for Qi Ao Shuang and said happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I recall correctly, Bethany is also a 6-star.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang accepted the water and drank a mouthful of water before asking jokingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, hehe ~\u201d Wynes scratched his head in embarrassment. However, there was an unconcealable look of satisfaction and happiness on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Qi Ao Shuang, why are you going to the Nine Heavens City?\u201d It\u2019s going to take a long time, so you\u2019re already out of the Tower? I\u2019ve only been out for a week. You\u2019ve been to and from the Nine Heavens City? \u201cYou, what star are you now?\u201d Wynes asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEight stars.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Haha! \u201cAwesome, as expected!\u201d Wei Ansi laughed out loud in excitement, looking at Xiao Ao Shuang happily shouting, \u201cI knew you were not simple, you are really amazing.\u201d I heard that a student who participated in this trial for the first time got an 8-star exam. I didn\u2019t expect it to be you. No, I should think about it! \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that you\u2019re so powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang just smiled and didn\u2019t say anything else. She felt that Wynes was really happy for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, the competition will start in another month.\u201d \u201cI think you can definitely achieve a good result. Haha, maybe you can even win against Dittos.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the biggest dark horse of the year.\u201d One must know that in the past, only Dittos had received an 8-star evaluation on his first attempt at participating in the survival training. \u201cYou are the second. You will definitely surpass him.\u201d The more Wynes talked, the more excited he became.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang smiled and shook her head, saying lightly: \u201cWynes, there are two things that are wrong with your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Wynes wondered.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirstly, I am well aware of the difference between me and Dittas. I am no match for him. \u201cSecond, I am not the one who obtained the 8-star evaluation on my first attempt at the exam. Before Dittancz, there was another person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. Even those seniors I\u2019ve interacted with recently, no one knows about it.\u201d At this point, Wynes pursed his lips and added, \u201cI\u2019m a 6-star student now, so a lot of people are willing to strike up a good relationship with me. \u201cMy strength has indeed improved greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way of people. \u201cA lot of people climb up and down.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sighed softly, before saying solemnly, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the person who passed the 8th level of the Heavenly Pagoda was.\u201d \u201cThat person is currently a forbidden topic in the academy. You\u2019d better not ask others, or cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d \u201cAlright.\u201d Wynes nodded and stopped asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare well for a good result among the 6-star students.\u201d If she were your opponent, what would you do? \u201c\u201d I don\u2019t know. Qi Ao Shuang laughed as she teased Wynes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cThat, that, that \u2026\u201d Wynes\u2019s face instantly turned red. He scratched his ears and face, seemingly at a loss.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang looked at Wynes in amusement. With such a shy personality, would he really be able to successfully catch up to Bethany? Looks like I need to help him in a timely manner.</p><br/><p>For the next month or so, Dickens and Jonathan came to see Qi Ao Shuang, and then the three of them appeared in the campus cafeteria, the library, the training grounds \u2026 The three of them naturally attracted the attention of countless people. The three young men with outstanding appearances were peerless in their time, and the countless young women were even more restless.</p><br/><p>Even more male students were trying to figure out what was going on. Why Lenny, who had been with Dittos and Jonathan, was gone, replaced by the red-haired boy.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until the end of a month\u2019s training time, the end of the competition, that the list of names was announced, that everyone came to a sudden realization. It was even more of a sensation.</p><br/><p>That red-haired youth had passed the eighth level his first time participating in the trial. Moreover, he actually took second place in the following competition. He had defeated all the previous 8-star students, including Jonathan! The first was still Dittos.</p><br/><p>When the list was announced, the entire academy was in an uproar. Everyone was struggling to find out who exactly this Qi Aoshuang was. He was actually able to defeat Jonathan and the others in one fell swoop. He was ranked second among the eight stars!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Qi Ao Shuang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second one is not Jonathan, but Qi Ao Shuang?\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, who was so amazing that he actually pulled Jonathan off his horse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, I\u2019ve never heard of this name.\u201d \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019ve never seen such a result before. Could it be that this is the first time I\u2019ve participated in a smelting trial and obtained such results?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Discussions broke out all around them, creating a huge ruckus.</p><br/><p>Talina stood underneath the public display screen, staring blankly at the second name on the huge board for a long time without moving half a step.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s so arrogant. So he really has some skill.\u201d Yuna stood by Tanja\u2019s side and spoke in a rather complicated manner. The embarrassing scene from that day was still vivid in his mind. He thought that Qi Ao Shuang was ungrateful and ungrateful, but in the end, he was the one who asked the woman to help them. He never thought that he would be able to pass the eighth level of the Heavenly Pagoda in one go, and also become the campus\u2019s number two figure. No wonder he was so calm in the cafeteria.</p><br/><p>Looking at the words \u201cQi Ao Shuang\u201d on the leaderboard, Tanina\u2019s heart was filled with complex emotions. So it turned out that the difference between him and him was that huge. He was already an 8-star, but he had only acquired a 5-star.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Qi Ao Shuang, I knew you could do it.\u201d Eight stars! \u201cTreat, you have to treat.\u201d A cheerful and sweet voice reached everyone\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Looking towards the source of the voice, she saw a sweet-looking pure love girl shaking Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arm \u2026</p><br/><p>He said happily. Who is that girl?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Parina, one of the four school beauties.\u201d Yuna said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>Talena looked at Qi Ao Shuang from afar, her heart filled with disappointment. When everyone heard the name, they all turned to look at him. Look at the biggest dark horse of the year.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like this. Look, that red-haired kid\u2019s face is full of impatience. The two of them aren\u2019t the kind of relationship you think they are.\u201d Seeing her like this, Una hurriedly comforted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, what did you say?\u201d What do they have to do with me? \u201d A trace of uneasiness flashed across her face, and she hurriedly tried to distinguish it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not blind. \u201cWhat attitude do you have towards that brat? Do you think I can\u2019t tell?\u201d Una shook her head and sighed.</p><br/><p>Talena became silent, not saying another word, only watching Qi Ao Shuang and Parina from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo time, no money.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang pushed away the hand that was holding onto her arm and coldly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t forget, you owe me one!\u201d Seeing Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s attitude, Parina immediately frowned and said in a cold voice. What lousy reason was this! There was no money! Wasn\u2019t it embarrassing for this annoying fellow to say something like that?</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang went silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo money, I\u2019ll treat you, okay?\u201d I\u2019ll give you my congratulations. \u201cLet\u2019s go eat!\u201d Parina took hold of Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s arm again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can return the favor by eating.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang shook off Lina\u2019s hand once again and impatiently led the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you think it\u2019s beautiful!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the one who invited you to dinner. Do you think that you can repay your debt so easily?\u201d Parina hurried after him.</p><br/><p>Tarina watched them leave, her expression dark.</p><br/><p>The surrounding boys stared at the back of Qi Ao Shuang with envious and jealous eyes. The school belle, Parina, had taken the initiative to date him. Although they were dissatisfied with Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s arrogant actions, no one dared to take the initiative to provoke her. Who asked him to be the second ranked student in the academy? The young ladies around them looked at Qi Ao Shuang with longing and longing in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarina, you are.\u201d Since he liked it, he had to take the initiative. \u201cYou still have a chance. Look at Qi Ao Shuang, she clearly doesn\u2019t have any interest in Parina.\u201d Looking at the worried look on Tanja\u2019s face, Yunya couldn\u2019t help but feel infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d Tarina lowered her eyes, unable to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are from the same sect. He sent people to help you, proving that his attitude towards you is different. \u201cYou have to make good use of this opportunity. Think about it, his appearance is outstanding, and now he has achieved such good results. I wonder how many girls are eyeing him like prey.\u201d Yunya continued to persuade him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say any more, Eugenia, I see.\u201d Tarina had a complicated look on her face.</p><br/><p>Una sighed softly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang and Parina walked out of the crowd, while Parina chattered, \u201cXiao Ao Shuang, let\u2019s go eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your meal at this hour?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang replied bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can\u2019t you come with me?\u201d Parina frowned and said unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have time. He\u2019s coming with me to the dean\u2019s office.\u201d A voice suddenly and coldly interrupted her. Surprised, Parina abruptly turned around, only to see the calm and handsome face of Dittas. It was Jonathan who stood behind Dittos.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Parina was about to say something, but could not say anything in response to the cold look in Dittas\u2019s eyes. It was just a light glance, but it gave Parina an indescribable sense of pressure, causing her heart to tremble uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Qi Ao Shuang.\u201d Dittens said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang nodded.</p><br/><p>The three of them turned around and left. Looking at their retreating backs, Parina stomped her feet. This hateful Dittas, hateful! Parina stared at Dittas\u2019s back angrily, cursing in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be tied down by boring love.\u201d While walking on the road, Dittens said these words coldly.</p><br/><p>Jonathan opened his mouth wide. How could Dittas be like this?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

White Emperor and Black Emperor were currently crouching on Jean\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s loss is not assured!\u201d Summer humphed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about a bet, little thief?\u201d Ben raised a brow. He had long seen through the strength of the two onstage. The blue haired fellow\u2019s strength was above Claire\u2019s. Claire was really unfortunate, going to be eliminated on the first round.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! You think I\u2019m afraid of betting?\u201d Summer said fiercely. She really disliked Ben\u2019s tone of voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll bet Claire will lose. If I win, you must fulfill three of my requests. If I lose, I will fulfill three of <em>your</em> requests,\u201d Ben snickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Claire will definitely win!\u201d Summer huffed.</p><br/><p>Camille\u2019s eye slitted. He leaned back in his chair, watching the two on stage silently.</p><br/><p>Dong Fenghou was currently munching on the snacks Qiao Chuxin had bought from the peddlers.</p><br/><p>To hide his identity, Walter was wearing a hat. He pushed it down further, trying to hide his worry.</p><br/><p>The five minutes passed by quickly and the injured people were swiftly carried away for treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cResume,\u201d the referee announced, far away from the barrier. Even so, he still sprinted away to a safer area, as if sprinting the hundred meter dash. He had a feeling the barrier would break sooner or later.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weak!\u201d Hua Yilin sneered. He burst forward towards Claire, a sword of water appearing in the palm of his hand.</p><br/><p>Water molding!</p><br/><p>Instead of facing him straight on, Claire retreated back swiftly. She could sense that the strength of this person before her was not something she could face. Both his outer strength and inner strength were far above her own. She wouldn\u2019t be able to win directly, so she could only outsmart him.</p><br/><p>Splash!</p><br/><p>Hua Yilin\u2019s sword struck where Claire had been standing loudly. Subsequently, the stage started shaking and there were loud tremors. Before everybody\u2019s stunned fazes, the stage collapsed! Smoke and dust flew and it was starting to become hard to see what was happening inside the barrier.</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan stood up abruptly. Right beside him, Shui Wenmo grabbed him tightly, fearing that Feng Yixuan would not be able to bear it and rush upstage.</p><br/><p>As the dust settled, two figures could be seen.</p><br/><p>Golden flame wings extended from Claire\u2019s back, gently flapping. Hua Yilin too had a pair of wings, transparent, made of water. Seeing this, Feng Yixuan left out a breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, well. Our Lagark has quite a few talents. First, Feng Yixuan becoming able to mold wind after his breakthrough. Now, it seems, Hua Yilin also made a breakthrough to mold water.\u201d The emperor\u2019s eyes slitted.</p><br/><p>The crown prince remained silent. As he watched the two, a sudden feeling of unease arose, but as for why, he could not say.</p><br/><p>Li Yuewen\u2019s palms were sweaty, still clenched in fists. Li Mingyu\u2019s brows were also knit tightly. They could both sense that Claire held a disadvantage in close combat!</p><br/><p>Hua Xiuning\u2019s expression was cold, a hint of a smile in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, Claire!\u201d Summer clenched her fists too, extremely worried.</p><br/><p>Ben had an assured expression, sure that he would win. Ben hoped he could win the bet, but at the same time, he had already made a decision in his heart. If the blue haired kid dared to try to kill Claire, he would disregard everything else and transform back to his real form and beat him up until even his own mom wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize him!</p><br/><p>Floating in the air, Claire eyed Hua Yilin coldly. \u201cEnclosed\u2026 Sky!\u201d Jean and the rest were astonished. Claire\u2019s expression turned ice cold. She understood that Hua Yilin was not trying to compete, but kill her! A thick murderous aura emanated from the bottom of his eyes! Since he had already decided to kill her, why should she hold back?</p><br/><p>Enclosed Sky?!</p><br/><p>The technique that Elder Huo had used?! The barrier that none of them bad been able to mar?</p><br/><p>Hua Yilin froze for a moment. He watched as Claire abruptly clasped her two palms together before her then open them quickly. White flame appeared from out of her two hands. They seemed to be alive as they ran past Claire\u2019s sides, then turned and trapped Hua Yilin inside. In the end, a square shape was formed.</p><br/><p>Hua Yilin sneered disdainfully. \u201cAre you messing around?\u201d</p><br/><p>But just when he finished speaking, the square abruptly shot up and then closed at the top, forming a cube, trapping Hua Yilin inside. The boiling hot aura even leaked out of the stage\u2019s barrier, causing the audience to feel hot, tongues dry.</p><br/><p>The giant white flame barrier stunned everyone. It was the first time they had seen such a strange sight. Most of them had never even seen a flame this color.</p><br/><p>Hua Xiuning\u2019s expression changed. She clenched a fist, scrunching up a handkerchief. Would the undefeated Hua Yilin would be defeated today by that girl?</p><br/><p>Claire\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cCompress!\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the cube started to shrink. But Hua Yilin was not one who would wait for death!</p><br/><p>There were constant loud explosions from inside the cube. Hua Yilin was attacking the flame barrier, but to no avail. A small crack would appear occasionally only to close up immediately.</p><br/><p>Hua Xiuning finally couldn\u2019t keep her cool anymore, crossing and uncrossing her legs repeatedly. Hua Yilin had never lost before! Was he really going to be defeated today?</p><br/><p>Summer waved a small fist excitedly. It seemed to her that Claire was definitely going to win. But Ben still had his arms crossed, uncertain who would win.</p><br/><p>Claire did not dare to be careless at all. She focused her gaze on the shrinking barrier. She understood that Hua Yilin was not going to end here. Enclosed sky was that Elder Huo\u2019s technique, but the power of her Enclosed Sky was far from the Elder\u2019s!</p><br/><p>The barrier suddenly stopped shrinking and started to tremble. It seems a powerful force was resisting the barrier.</p><br/><p>The cube started shaking more and more violently.</p><br/><p>The next moment, countless pillars of water shot through the barrier, riddling it with holes. The ear piercing sizzling sound startled the audience. Everybody\u2019s hearts lept to their throats. Some couldn\u2019t help but stand up excitedly.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Claire was unusually calm. She floated silently in mid air, closing her eyes.</p><br/><p>What was she doing? Hua Yiling was about to break the barrier at any second now, but Claire had her eyes closed? Was she crazy? Or did she give up?</p><br/><p>Feng Yixuan clenched a fist tightly, staring fixedly at Claire. How could Feng Yixuan not notice that that bastard Hua Yilin already had a murderous aura? He was planning on killing Claire!</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, calm down. The results are not set in stone,\u201d Shui Wenmo repeated constantly as if reciting a buddhist scripture. What he feared the most was Feng Yixuan recklessly dashing upstage. At that time, there would be countless trouble!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, bright light shone, everything white. The barrier was broken. Fire and water scattered. The golden light and the silver shine of water droplets sparkled, a dazzling sight to behold.</p><br/><p>Hua Yilin grasped a huge sword tightly, floating in mid air, his eyes full of bloodlust and excitement.</p><br/><p>In the audience, Hua Xiuning revealed a cruel smile. Hua Yilin was serious! Claire, you will die today.</p><br/><p>At this time, Claire\u2019s eyes were still closed shut. Hua Yilin brandished his sword, aiming at Claire, a bloodthirsty smile on his face. \u201cGood. I acknowledge you. I will kill you seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Claire\u2019s eyes remained closed. Hua Yilin laughed coldly and dashed forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cVanish\u2026\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes opened abruptly, emitting golden rays of light, a magnificent sight.</p><br/><p>In that instant, a thick, golden barrier enclosed both Claire and Hua Yilin inside.</p><br/><p>What was she doing?</p><br/><p>\u201cFlames? Another flame barrier?\u201d The female t-rex stroked her chin, pondering. The barrier was very thin, yet the flames were golden. Why?</p><br/><p>Soon, the experts present understood why.</p><br/><p>Although the barrier was thin, it was exceptionally strong. The heat it emitted was much higher than that of normal flames. And what was most astonishing was that the huge sword of molded water was slowly turning smaller and smaller until it disappeared completely!</p><br/><p>The barrier actually prevented water from entering?!</p><br/><p>Instantly, low exclaims rang out in the stadium.</p><br/><p>The golden flames actually had such an effect?</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t just that. Hua Yilin was shocked to discover that the water vapor within the barrier was slowly decreasing too!</p><br/><p>What a lunatic! Astonishment flashed through Hua Yilin\u2019s eyes. This girl was actually more insane than him! Not only did she isolate them from water, she was also steadily burning up all the water vapor in the air inside the barrier! If this continued, both of them wouldn\u2019t be able to breath! The barrier would gradually burn up all of the air inside!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good! My determination to kill you has been strengthened.\u201d Excitement, madness, bloodlust, all of those emotions flashed through his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaste of breath!\u201d Claire finally said. It was the first time she had said anything, but these first words angered Hua Yilin!</p><br/><p>Fighting is fighting! Why did he talk so much?</p><br/><p>With a quiet whoosh, an ordinary looking sword materialized in Claire\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Claire raised the sword, a cold smile on her face as she said softly, \u201cAzure Ripple blade, let me see your true power today. Otherwise, I will only use you to chop firewood from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next instant, the sword started vibrating, as if reacting to Claire\u2019s words. At the same time, a sword materialized in Hua Yilin\u2019s hand too. Evidently, Hua Yilin also had a rare interspatial storage ring!</p><br/><p>A cold glint flashed in her eyes. The air was about to run out, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to use water magic any more. It was now down to Dou Qi. Relatively speaking, her Dou Qi level was lower than his, but what if they were in a situation where they almost couldn\u2019t breath? Would he still be able to exert his full strength?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had become close with the Holy Maiden, since they hunted in the same party. \u00a0She kept talking about her home planet until his ears had hurt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you going to hunt more, hyung?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should worry about yourself rather than worrying about me. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and do the ritual.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stayed for the off chance that the Blood Ritual could go wrong, then he head to earth. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if Planet Jaku was the only hunting ground available to Woojin. \u00a0It was still important for him to clear Dungeons that couldn\u2019t be handled by anyone on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t be able to come back for several days if he went to Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll have to leave after clearing the Dungeons that are about to break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sss-ahhhhhh. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even in death, the heart was beating. \u00a0When Jaemin grabbed the heart, blood shot out as it formed a fog of blood, and it was directly absorbed into Jaemin. \u00a0After the ritual was done, it felt as if something had changed. \u00a0However, the change was marginal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was a bit out of step as he stepped out of the starting block. \u00a0However, every time he took a step, the change that would occur would become bigger. \u00a0He\u2019ll get to taste a growth that couldn\u2019t be compared to before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood luck.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was different from his previous self. \u00a0His face was overflowing with confidence. \u00a0After Jaemin gave his goodbye, he stepped through the portal heading toward Planet Jaku. \u00a0Woojin entered into a Portal heading towards Seoul Station\u2019s 1st exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?

Soonghoon was meticulous in gathering data, and he was adept at stealing away the initiative in the negotiations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon was well aware of the fact that Alandal held the absolute high ground in regards to Dungeons when talking to other guilds and countries. \u00a0He used this fact well in the negotiations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After coming to a mutual aid agreement regarding Dungeon clearing with the Kaneda guild, they finalized on the stake Alandal would have on the cleared Dungeons. \u00a0After that negotiation came to an end, Soonghoon faced the United States\u2019 Bad Sector guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019m sure the president will decline the offer you made in regards to making a movie. \u00a0Moreover, Alandal is currently in an alliance with the Titan guild\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had been having an intense conversation for over 30 minutes, yet they weren\u2019t even close to coming to an agreement. \u00a0Soonghoon decided to push the negotiations to a different date.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hoo. \u00a0We'll start the negotiation again tomorrow.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bad Sector was the second biggest guild in the US behind the Titan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The negotiation hadn't been easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon sat in front of the delegation from Britain. \u00a0He frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You guys didn\u2019t send any data our way, and you just dropped in on us. \u00a0What is the reason behind this move?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[President Kahng-woojin said to come to Alandal...] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Uh-huh!

The light looked as if it was about to turn off when the building shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is that? Did you just feel that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it an earthquake?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several new groups inside the ready room including the Hot Girls. \u00a0Soolgi grabbed the hands of her group members as she looked on with worry in her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll be fine.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The evacuation alarm rang out immediately after she spoke her words. The noisy siren let out a bright light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ehhhhhhhhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhhhhhk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What's wrong?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sudden sound of the siren, a screaming person and the disarray of people caused the waiting room to devolve into chaos. Hot Girl's Soolgi was also taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She remembered the evacuation directions she learned from her school curriculum, so she yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShelter! We have to get to the shelter.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Dungeon Shock, every building was required to construct a shelter within.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soolgi's words caused the frightened people to rush out into the hallway. \u00a0It was the middle of the day, yet the hallway was dark with the light off. \u00a0It amplified the fear being felt by the people. Everyone rushed towards the sign of the fire exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one person started to run, everyone followed suit. Soolgi felt a sense of danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018We should evacuate slowly and in order\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had learned that evacuations should proceed in an ordered manner. \u00a0It prevented additional accidents from happening. \u00a0However, this was only possible in training drills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In reality, fear made everyone run down the stair. \u00a0They wanted to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go, unni!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soolgi and the members of the Hot Girls tried their best to follow behind the group of people. \u00a0The people were rushing down the emergency staircase when everyone suddenly came to a stop. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roo-roo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They heard breathing, and it was clear that it wasn\u2019t the sound of a human breathing. \u00a0Moreover, it was accompanied by the sound of people screaming!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-ahhhhhh!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soolgi couldn't see down to the end of the staircase, but she could tell something serious was going on down there. Her mind went to the most likely catastrophe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's a Dungeon Break.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was sure monsters had appeared at the broadcasting station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oohk, hook.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous employees of the broadcasting station were present, but the girl groups were made up of girls in their teens and 20s. Most of the girls had their two hands over their mouths, and they were barely able to hold back a scream as they cried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cL...let's exit here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A member of the boyband named Tony spoke quietly, and they quietly exited the emergency stairway. \u00a0They looked at the floor number, and they were on the 7th floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is another emergency staircase over there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tony aggressively took the lead, so everyone followed his directions. They walked carefully as if they were afraid they would be found out by the monsters. \u00a0They opened the door to the other emergency staircase, but the situation was the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-ah-ahhk! Help me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek, koo-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone immediately stopped walking when they heard the noise coming from the opened door to the staircase. \u00a0When they carefully closed the door again, one could hear women crying, and several people were standing in place absent-mindedly as if they were distracted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone looked at Tony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...why me....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a little bit more assertive than others, but he was still a normal male idol. The current situation frightened him too. \u00a0Even if they asked him for directions, his mind was blank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a vibration rang out from the emergency staircase, and they could hear something getting closer to them. \u00a0Everyone instinctively distanced themselves from the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cL...let's go to that room.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When someone yelled out the suggestion, they opened the door, and they entered a spacious office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cB...block the entrance.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They moved desks and furnitures to block the entrance. \u00a0As if they felt a little bit relieved, people started speaking to each other in quiet voices. \u00a0It was as if they were trying to shed their nervousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several people started to cry again. Soolgi hugged the crying members of the Hot Girls as she tried to console them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHook. \u00a0What should we do, unni?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of Hot Girls were still in high school. \u00a0Soolgi was the oldest of the bunch, so she hardened her heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. \u00a0Don't worry. \u00a0Someone will come rescue us soon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was the Roused or the soldiers, the monsters would be eradicated soon. \u00a0It would be better if they were at a shelter, but the office was good enough. \u00a0They just had to hide in safety.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, even a small task like that was too hard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koo-oohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When something roughly banged into the door, everyone became surprised. \u00a0Their bodies convulsed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhk! What are we going to do!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe quiet! Everyone hide!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one dared to approach the door, and everyone tried to find a place to hide that was as far from the door as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The furnitures were roughly pushed aside, and an enormous black panther appeared from across the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-rook! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeek!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tony met eyes with the black panther, and his body froze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black panther ran in as it swung its paw. \u00a0Tony's face was ripped right off his skull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The incident happened in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silence descended, and it was accompanied by extreme fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't a movie, training drill or even a haunted house experience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't some prank. \u00a0It was reality, and it was a catastrophe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-wahhhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black panther caused the people's body to freeze into immobility. \u00a0All they could do was shake as they didn't know what to do. \u00a0The black panther looked at the humans huddled together. \u00a0Earth was overflowing with easy preys. \u00a0It felt satisfaction as it was about to slowly start its slaughter. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-chahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A flock of bats broke through the window. \u00a0The bats gathered in a single location, and they transformed into a person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a man wearing a black coat. \u00a0Everyone's face lit up with hope at the appearance of Do-jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It's a Roused!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roohk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black panther glared at the figure, and it attacked first. \u00a0It jumped into the air and it swung its paws. \u00a0It's front paw was strong enough to bend steel. \u00a0Instead of avoiding it, Jaemin swung his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The full weight of the black panther was behind its attack, but it couldn't win against the fist of a vampire, who had been tempered by drinking blood everyday.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-wahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the shocked black panther could land on the ground, Jaemin kicked it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't kill it with a single blow, but the shock was enough to give the panther a whiplash. \u00a0Moreover, his kick wasn't the end to his attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He crushed the black panther's head with his foot, and its large body moved no more. \u00a0The man wearing a black coat had dropped his sunglasses during the fight, so he went to pick it up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...we're saved!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oohk, hoooooooong.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people cried in relief when they saw the Roused, who had come to save them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Jaemin was searching for Soolgi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSoolgi?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soolgi's eyes turned round when her name came out of the Roused's mouth. \u00a0The familiar jawline, body type, and even his voice....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJaemin?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin walked towards Soolgi. \u00a0He had searched all over the broadcasting station. \u00a0He had finally found her. \u00a0He was thankful that she was still alive in this mess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa is here, Soolgi.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin spoke playfully as he opened both his arms. \u00a0Tears started to flow out of Soolgi's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou idiot. \u00a0You are 7 month late.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He watched her cry as she replied. \u00a0He had a smile that expressed his sadness and a little bit of bitterness. \u00a0Her trembling, fear and relief was all conveyed to him. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. Everything is fine now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought his body had been cursed when he was turned into a vampire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he was thankful for the strength that had allowed him to protect someone precious to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0What the hell? \u00a0It's another break?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sungoo had exited the Dungeon after he finished clearing it. \u00a0His eyes turned round when he was immediately given the news about the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's happening near Alandal?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector Che-haesol is defending the place.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol's ability was at Rank B. \u00a0However, she had successfully Tamed a Wyvern recently, so it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say her monster collection was equal to 10 Rank A Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich area suffered the most?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to head back to Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?

Thread-like spider web was wrapped tightly around her like a cocoon. \u00a0The sight seen through the spider web, which was woven like a net, was disturbing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous white cocoons were hanging all over the ceiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, she was in the same boat as everyone else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I can't breathe.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was barely able to maintain her breathing. \u00a0Moreover, there was a unique scent emanating from the spider web, and it made one's mind lazy and faint. \u00a0It was becoming hard for her to think straight.

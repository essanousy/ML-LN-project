Tee-tee-teeng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fierce battlefield where machine guns were firing relentlessly towards the charging monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous monster's ogre leather was so hard that bullets couldn't penetrate it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ogre took big strides as it ran. \u00a0It was about to reach the camp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rocket launchers simultaneously launched their projectiles, and the rockets hit the target. Chunks of flesh was ripped away from various parts of the body, but as it was falling down from its charge, it threw its club.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous club flew through the air towards a window that had been continuously raining down bullets towards the ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ahk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFabio!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldier using the machine gun was immediately snuffed out, and Fabio, who had been off to the side, barely hung onto his life. \u00a0The club had ripped off one of his arm, and he wasn't in a good state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had taken a blow to the head too, so his head was soaked with blood. \u00a0If left alone, he would die from excessive bleeding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go down. \u00a0Stay with me a little longer.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ooh-oohk.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio supported Fabio down the stairs. The advance of the monsters were endless. \u00a0They didn't show any signs of decreasing in number no matter how many were killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This battle had been continuing for the 5th day. \u00a0The entire city of Rome was lost. \u00a0There weren't even an official count on how many civilians and soldiers had died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters continued to march forward, and the humans kept retreating. \u00a0Their territory was getting larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exiting the building, Antonio searched for the medics located in the rear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The place was filled with soldiers injured by the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh. \u00a0Hurry up and heal me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ahhk! Help me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The final order came down amongst the screams of pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLoad up the injured! We are retreating.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the retreat order was given, the explosives placed along the last battle line would explode in 5 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStay with me a little longer, Fabio.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no space to lie down inside the truck. \u00a0The medic sitting on the bench quickly wrapped bandages around him in an attempt to stem the bleeding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his friend's eyes were fluttering as it closed. \u00a0It seemed he was almost at death's door, and this would be Antonio's final goodbye with his friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio let out a curse as he grabbed his gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll get his revenge for his comrade! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">We wanted to shove bullets into the monsters up until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-doo-doo! Doo-doo-doo! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldiers gave a final covering fire as the troops started to retreated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAntonio! Hurry up and get in.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A vehicle with a machine gun mounted on the roof stopped next to him. \u00a0Antonio got on the vehicle, and they quickly retreated. \u00a0He spoke to the soldier operating the machine gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have 4 minutes left.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Explosives were planted in various locations. \u00a0It'll deal a bug blow to the advancing monsters. \u00a0They had to get far as possible before the explosives went off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The territory held by active monsters was slowly expanding. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the monsters moved under orders, they weren't wild animals. They were basically an alien army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't a monster hunt anymore. \u00a0This was the start of war between the monsters and humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to catch the Monster Lords.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monster Lords. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were beings on a higher level than the Dungeon's Boss Monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These beings were shrouded in veil, and not much was known about them. \u00a0They brought a sense of danger that rivaled the Dungeon Shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, reinforcement is coming from Korea.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time Antonio had heard of this news, so he turned to look at his comrade. The other man's face was filled with hope. It was a bizarre sight to see since the human army was retreating, and they had to continuously cede their battle lines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere's Korea located at?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio was unfamiliar with the country called Korea. This was the first time he heard about them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTo be precise, Kahng-woojin is coming here. \u00a0I'm talking about the King of Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio was very ignorant about current affairs, but even he knew about Alandal. \u00a0His eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe messiah of the Middle East!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone in the world knew about his war on terror in the Middle East. This was especially true for soldiers, and he had been a significant area of interest for Antonio. \u00a0He was more knowledgeable about the situation than most civilians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggeeeeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The vehicle came to a rough stop, and the people rolled around in the back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit! What the hell?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh shit. Monsters!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet ready to fire!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Airborne monsters had suddenly appeared in the air. The barricades on the ground had momentarily stalled the ground-bound monsters. This was when the monsters started to attack from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The evacuating vehicles stopped, and the soldiers readied themselves to fire thier weapons. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, someone else shot down the monsters before they could.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk! Puh-puh-puhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several dozen magic spells flew into the air as it shot down the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it a Roused unit?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I think he is here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio got off the vehicle as he mumbled to himself. \u00a0It looked as if he had been mesmerized.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was happening not too far away. \u00a0It was as if consecutive rockets were detonating. The monsters couldn't resist against the magic spells that flew into the air. \u00a0They either crashed to the floor, or they flew back from where they came from.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heeeeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Phantom Steed was racing across the road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my god!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio was in disbelief. \u00a0He clenched his fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Kahng-woojin. He never expected to meet Kahng-woojin during his lifetime! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stopped in front of the vehicles, and he let off the woman riding behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeal them. I'm leaving immediately.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease be careful.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked when he heard the Holy Maiden's farewell. \u00a0He would have never thought he would hear such words from her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden reeked of Holy Power. \u00a0When she got off, Shing Shing looked as if it had expelled a 10 year old poop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to charge towards the barricade holding back the monsters when Antonio blocked his way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0You can't! The barricades are rigged with explosives.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Did you already detonate it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Oh my god!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio was surprised when flawless Italian came out of Woojin's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0It'll be going off soon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He checked his watch then he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere's 59 seconds left. \u00a0It would be best if you entered after the bombs goes off.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The advancing monsters were stacked up, because of the barricades. When the rigged bombs went off, it'll take out a great number of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be better to advance after that had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit! I'll see you later, Melody.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, monarch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned as he urged Shing Shing forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe bomb is going to\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Antonio lamented at his hero's recklessness, Woojin was already calculating the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI won't make it in time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosives would go off before he could get there. It might destroy all the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose are my EXP.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the monsters bunched up in one place was going to be blown up...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Woojin had a familiar, who specialized in group hunting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJaenis!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black smoke coalesced as the Lich appeared next to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[My lord.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTake them all out within 30 seconds.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis looked at the destroyed city around him. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t anything new, but Jaenis kind of liked what he saw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is always enjoyable to be able to destroy a city.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fire came out of Jaenis' Staff. \u00a0It ignited the barricades, buildings and any obstacles in the way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwah-gwah-gwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a large-scale explosion! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosion was followed by flames sweeping the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo-rook! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Sunggoo saw this, he would have been surprised by the fire wall. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wall of fire burned the monsters, and it even detonated the explosives that still had some time left before they went off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The additional explosions quickly started to engulf the city. \u00a0Woojin called out his Death Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-shoo-shoohk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ooh-oh-oh. \u00a0It's war!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I missed this. The scent of death!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Death is always a noble cause.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked when the summoned Death Knights spoke in an excited manner. \u00a0Their fundamental nature was to hate and envy living beings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a reason why they had gotten along with him for the past 20 years...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He let out a laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn't this familiar?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tail end of Woojin's lips rose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone laughed. They were excited for the upcoming battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned the Steel Staff while he rode Shing Shing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwah-roohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He transformed it into an axe. \u00a0Woojin lashed Shing Shing's reins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go boys.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Battle Roar has raised the fighting spirit of the allies.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Battle Roar has increased the allies' fighting power.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight's followed Woojin's lead as they rode their Phantom Steeds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had named Kiba the captain of his Dimensional Domain's defense. \u00a0It was unfortunate, but he had left Kiba behind just in case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ooh-oh-oh!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is a Festival of Blood!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The excited Death Knights were galloping as they summoned the Skeletons. \u00a0There was a trail of Skeletons being summoned behind them. The Skeleton ran in a line behind the Death Knights, and they were swept up by madness. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-kee-keek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the Undead army charged, Lich Jaenis laughed as he used his flight magic to float into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I heard you awakened as a Warrior.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin looked at him, Jaenis' red eyes gleamed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It really has been a while.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis held his staff with one hand, and he used the other hand to caress the embedded gem on top of the staff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jee-jee-jeek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An ominous black energy clashed and sparked. Jaenis spread both his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwah-ah-ah-ahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black energy crawled like snakes as it shot up into the sky above the city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black energy disappeared as if it had been melted into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;The Lich's Curse has descended on the battlefield.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;The fighting powers of the enemies will be decreased.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;The enemy's ability to act will be slowed.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ha-ha. Would my lord like to show me his fighting capability?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn't he say he was a Dual Class?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no coincidence in this world. Maybe he would become the key to Jaenis' greatest desire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-uh-uh-uh!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the Undead army charged, Dolsae formed himself from a pile of concrete. The enormous golem started to rage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As always, the Titan of Destruction took on the role of the spearhead. \u00a0The Undead army advanced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They headed towards the bold Dimensional lord, who dared to form a colony inside the Colosseum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god. \u00a0This must be a dream.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio was so flustered that he just clutched his head with his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so surprised that he was having a hard time speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had met the world's greatest hero Kahng-woojin! \u00a0He even exchanged words with him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cImpossible. \u00a0This doesn't make any sense.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Antonio. \u00a0Come back to your senses. \u00a0We are still in the battlefield.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0I'm sorry... \u00a0I was too surprised.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio realized his mistake. \u00a0He hardened his expression. He was an honorable soldier, yet he had acted like a fan girl going wild over a star. \u00a0Moreover, he had done it in a battlefield where life and death was determined.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEveryone please listen to my words..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the Holy Maiden's words, all the soldiers directed their attention to her after they got out of the vehicles. \u00a0She was a beauty, who had accompanied Kahng-woojin here. Her face looked quite familiar\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Melody I serve the goddess Aria. \u00a0My power can touch you only if you believe in the existence of Aria.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't required for them to become worshipers of the Aria church.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they had to acknowledge her existence. \u00a0This would allow her Holy Power to flow into them. \u00a0Unfortunately, this was the restriction that had been placed on her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is for all of you. \u00a0I hope my heart will be conveyed to you all.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody gathered her two hands, and she closed her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chaaaaahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Light exploded forth from her, and it brightened the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light emitted by her didn't hurt the eyes. The energy surrounded one\u2019s body in a snug manner, and it purified the energy within one's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if the mental stress from the battle, various wounds, and depleted stamina was all restored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, it wasn't just a feeling. \u00a0It was happening for real.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light emitted from her bodysurrounded the wounded soldiers being transported.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened when the light started to lessen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The transport trucks had been used to move the injured, and people poured out from these vehicles. \u00a0One of them was Fabio. He looked for his best friend and comrade Antonio.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAntonio!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, Fabio! My god!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio's eyes turned round when he saw Fabio. Fabio's arm had been torn off yet a new one had grown in its place. \u00a0Moreover, Antonio couldn't see any wounds on him....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god! This is a miracle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Antonio and Fabio looked at the praying Melody with absentminded eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He finally remembered her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was the first human to be found inside a Dungeon. \u00a0It was the SS Rank Roused from the US.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was the Holy Maiden Melody.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

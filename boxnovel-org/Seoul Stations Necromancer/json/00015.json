I had some extra time, and I wanted to somewhat wrap up this dungeon part. Please turn off the adblockers if you are able to. Thanks~)</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew, It\u2019s done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo wiped the sweat off his ghastly face. The last floor was a very large space, and there had been enough monster to fill up the whole floor. Of course, Sunggoo wasn\u2019t sweating, because he had participated in the battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you excavate it all?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s words, Sunggoo brought the pile of blood stones to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can someone like big brother be Rank F? At the very least, you should be Rank D. Since you have a lot of abilities, you could even receive Rank C.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll get it later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo looked at Woojin, who spoke indifferently, as if he was seeing a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters on the last floor of the Dungeon was wiped out by Woojin and his summoned beings. Sunggoo was assigned the role of excavating blood stone from the monsters Woojin pointed out. He basically did the clean up work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had the ability to hunt 1 star and 2 star monsters by himself. His battle ability was close to a Rank D, and he wouldn\u2019t fall short against a Rank C in terms of versatility. He was able to summon the Skeletons, and he could search for the blood stones. Moreover, he was able to extract some gray energy from the dead monster\u2019s corpses, and he was able to use it to heal himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Isn\u2019t there a saying that says a sandalwood is fragrant even in seed leaf?(TLN:idiom used to describe genius who display their abilities even in childhood) Sunggoo looked at this person, who had finished his Roused registration only 3 hours ago. He believed this noob Roused Kang-woojin will become someone to be reckoned with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? What are you doing? You are going to learn it instead of selling it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin inserted his magic in to the Magical Scroll he held in his hand. As the Magic Scroll disappeared, he absorbed the magic, Electric Shock. He had to save his Achievement Points since he had a lot of skills to learn. Therefore, he decided to learn the magic, Electric Shock, since he already possessed the Magic Scroll.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he wanted to learn a more higher ranked Magic, he could only learn from Magic Scrolls related to the Necromancer class. Still, Electric Shock would be useful when attacking a person. There was no downside in learning it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul. You already have a lot of ability yet you are learning more magic, big brother? If you had sold it, you could have sold it for one hundred million won\u2026..\u201d (TLN: 100,000,000 won or $89306 dollars)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Hong-songgoo\u2019s words, Woojin\u2019s face became rigid. A 100 point Magic Scroll was worth a hundred million?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026it was that expensive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. It allows you to gain an additional ability. It is qualitatively different from an Artifact.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magical energy had to be injected into an Artifact for it to activate its imbued magic. On the other hand, Magic Scroll allowed a Roused to learn the magic. With a Magic Scroll, one didn\u2019t have to worry about losing it, and even a low ranked Magic Scroll could be used for research. Of course, it would be expensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Why would such an expensive item drop in a mere 2 star Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure. You must be really lucky. It isn\u2019t like it never happens. It just doesn\u2019t show up that often. So what kind of magic was it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s the one you got hit with. It\u2019s the Electric Shock that was used by the hobgoblin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul. You would have at the very least gotten one hundred million\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One hundred million. It was one hundred million.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he knew the Magic Scroll was worth one hundred million then he would have just used 100 points to learn the Electric Shock. He wanted to buy the Magic Scroll from the Achievement Store to sell, but the Skill Books purchased from the Point Store couldn\u2019t be used in a transaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only Woojin could learn it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had learned \u2018Soul Extract\u2019 to restore the barely alive Sunggoo. It cost him 50 points, but he didn\u2019t hesitate since he had to learn it anyway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a monster or a person dies, their souls remain next to the corpses for a brief moment. At that moment, he could extract the souls then he could use it as a source of energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was magic, vitality or stamina, a small portion of it could be recovered. When Woojin injected it into someone else, the efficacy decreased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo thought Woojin was using healing magic, but the truth was different. Woojin was stealing the life force of others to share with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSsssoop, whew. Let\u2019s not worry about the cost.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tried to soothe his aching innards. If he had sold the Magic Scroll, then he wouldn\u2019t have to traverse a Dungeon for a long while. No, if he thought about the fallen real estate value in Seoul, he could have moved into a huge villa that was much bigger than the current one room\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, let\u2019s not think about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow much can I get with this much blood stones?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the very least, you could get around 800. I think you can get more. I\u2019m not too sure\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had invested 100,000 won, so he made a good amount of profit. If his party members hadn\u2019t run away, we would have only received one million won for his cut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all mine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf\u2026of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about the Return Stone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have it here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sungoo swept the blood stones into the bag, and they were about to head upstairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt looks like an ambush.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He only had a low level detection skill, but he could feel a faint sense of murderous intent. Woojin gave Sunggoo a warning. When Woojin came to a stop, Sunggoo\u2019s expression also turned serious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had killed all the monsters. Unless they re-entered the Dugneon, the monsters won\u2019t regenerate. If there was an ambush, then it had to be Bae-dohsoo\u2019s party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre they trying to PK?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin questioned Sunggoo, whose voice was shaking from worry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes this happen often?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt happens occasionally. It probably happens more off the record. This is why people don\u2019t party up with a group they don\u2019t know. The hell\u2019s gate is opened when a treasure like Magic Scroll and Artifact is found. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf there is a fight, how is it handled?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo one will know what had happened inside the Dungeon. It is an written rule that they\u2019ll only act when there is indisputable evidence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Then it\u2019s an easy way to dispose of a dead body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned and he looked up into the dark stairway. He stopped walking then he looked back. There were monster corpses lying everywhere. Woojin took several steps back as he distanced himself from the stairway. Sunggoo also followed Woojin\u2019s action.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, stop hiding there like a rat. Why don\u2019t you come out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon, there was a response from Woojin\u2019s words. Bae-dohsoo\u2019s party slowly stepped on to the stairs. One had an awkward expression, and another seemed to be apologetic. The rest had a no nonsense attitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened? Did you defeat them all?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo put on a performance as he slyly asked a question. Woojin spoke in a low voice toward Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m planning on taking him by surprise when he gets close.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo looked at Woojin with worried eyes. Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou bastards ran away yet you have have the gall to show up again. Why are you here when you should be waiting in front of the barrier?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sudden disrespectful words spat out by Woojin made Bae-dohsoo\u2019s eyebrows twitch, but he laughed awkwardly as he tried to keep his expression in control.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Why are you being like this? Aren\u2019t we on the same team? We just made a tactical retreat, and we came back to clear the Dungeon. When we arrived, it seemed all the monsters were killed. How did you do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo\u2019s thoughts were in a complete state of confusion. Two F ranked Roused were able to clear all the monsters, so he couldn\u2019t believe what had happened. Bae-dohsoo secretly looked towards the bag filled with blood stones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those who were blinded by greed couldn\u2019t see what was right in front of their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop fucking around. You just wanted to take the Return Stone, but now you are covetous of a ready made meal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin threw the bag filled with blood stones in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwa-roo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood stones spilled out from the bag\u2019s opening. It\u2019s was thrown about the midway point between Woojin and Bae-dohsoo\u2019s party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry taking it if you covet it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s words, Bae-dohsoo\u2019s expression stiffened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems you are mistaken. Do you think we will try to PK someone, who had defeated a monster we couldn\u2019t kill? It is a misunderstanding. We aren\u2019t that stupid.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry for not looking out for you. However, my life was one the line so what could I do? We just came back to look for the Return Stone. Since you cleared the Dungeon, we were fortunate enough to be able to retrieve Jongchul\u2019s corpse. Therefore, I am very thankful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s words, Woojin felt that he had been too sensitive. Yes, the people here weren\u2019t at all like those from the Alphen Planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe they were hiding themselves on top of the staircase in case they ran into a monster? From their perspective, they had no idea of what was going on at the bottom floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe I\u2019m being too sensitive\u2026\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the past 20 years, he had lived in a location where people betrayed each other for a fistful of money. This is why he was always on edge. However, this was earth. This place was Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It is a place where peace and moral was alive\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-roo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026my ass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin hurriedly waved his arm through the flame that ignited in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRight now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s shout, the man with the bow shot an arrow toward Hong-songgoo. His fireball attack was an ability they had to get rid of first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Bae-dohsoo ran away, he had come to an agreement with his party. They weren\u2019t skilled enough to attempt a 2 star dungeon. The money wasn\u2019t that great, but they had decided to return to the 1 star Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They returned to carefully look for the Return Stone, but all the monsters were dead. Even the hobgoblin was dead, and this made his head spin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Greed grew in him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how hard they searched they could only find Jongchul\u2019s corpse. Woojin and Sunggoo\u2019s corpses were missing. This meant the two of them had conquered the bottom floor by themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they were able to defeat the hobgoblin, this meant one of them was hiding his real capability. This is why they had prepared an ambush, but their opponents saw through it first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo tried to put Woojin at ease. At the same time, he tried to assess the situation. He tried to determine if it was worth killing them. Dohsoo\u2019s eyes almost flipped over backwards when Woojin threw the bag filled with blood stones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a sum of money equivalent to working a 1 star Dungeon for one month.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo confirmed from Woojin\u2019s sharp reaction that he was suspicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He is on guard against us.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he was on guard meant it would be dangerous for them. He didn\u2019t know what method they used to kill the numerous monsters, but he was wary of attacking them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He decided to use the fact that his opponent was feeling a sense of danger against he. He thought it was worth trying to attack them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Let\u2019s hit them.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo gave the sign they had agreed to in advance, then he used his Ignition ability. At the same time, Woojin\u2019s face was engulfed in flame, and an arrow pierced through Sunggoo\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party members attacked the surprised man even before the flame had formed. The weapons would cut through more easily through human flesh than the tough leather of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. Please don\u2019t resent me. Aren\u2019t all Roused like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo took out the dagger equipped on his belt, then he stabbed it toward the staggering Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though, the flame was impeding Woojin\u2019s sight, he was able to grab the hand stabbing at him. Woojin reversed the grip on the hand as he threw him. His strength and speed was so fast that Bae-dohsoo didn\u2019t have the chance to do anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was on par with a Roused with a physical ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. That\u2019s pretty hot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the flames faded away, Woojin wiped his face with his hands. He glared at Bae-dohsoo\u2019s party, who was taken aback. Sunggoo had an arrow in his shoulder, and he was looking at Woojin with tear-filled eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt was pretty insolent attack.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His face was slightly red, and it seemed he had taken some minor burns to the face. However, Woojin was smiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I should have expected this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin extended both his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scattered monster\u2019s corpses exploded, and the scraps of meat flew everywhere. It was a grand sight. If one had a weak constitution, the grotesque sight would make one faint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cResent me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a white smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Resentment wouldn\u2019t change anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll laugh to my heart\u2019s content.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll taken on all the resentment from the weak. It would be too cruel for him to deny them that much, since their souls would be imprisoned as they will fall from grace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons\u2019 bone knives didn\u2019t show any hesitation or mercy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKooh-ahhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the entire party was taken down then Woojin headed towards Bae-dohsoo. He was still twitching, so it seemed he was still alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW, wait a moment, let\u2019s talk\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you waiting for your Ignition ability\u2019s cool time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwa-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unhesitatingly stabbed the dagger he took from Bae-dohsoo into his heart. Bae-dohsoo trembled for a moment before he went limp. Woojin looked at him without showing much interest as he took the Bae-dohsoo\u2019s bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was filled with blood stones they had acquired before they met the hobgoblin. Moreover, Woojin searched Bae-dohsoo\u2019s body, and he took his wallet. He took out all the cash and he stuffed it into his pocket. Before he knew it, Woojin was humming a tune.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Un\u2026unbelievable.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of Hong-sunggoo, four lives were taken in an instant. He tried to cover his mouth with both hands as he tried to stop the words that almost leaked out of his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so surprised that it seemed he wasn\u2019t conscious of the pain caused by the arrow in his shoulder. Woojin also went through the other party members\u2019 pockets, then he mumbled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, the bastards who try to stab me in the back will never speak again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is he saying this for his benefit? Sunggoo\u2019s eyes trembled uncontrollably.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe people I hate the most are those who try to stab others in the back. Isn\u2019t that right, Sunggoo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin whipped his head around, and he looked into Sunggoo\u2019s eyes. He was so surprised that he almost wet his pants. Woojin had killed four people, but his face was too indifferent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even when one kills a monster, or even a small animal, one usually feels excitement, or guilt. Some kind of emotion should be stirred up, yet Woojin looked like he had pulled weeds out from the side of the road after he killed these people. Sunggoo couldn\u2019t sense any change in his emotion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like Woojin was something more than a murderer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His peacefulness drove the terror deep into Hong-songgoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

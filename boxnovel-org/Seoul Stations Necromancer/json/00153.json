Her Taming ability wasn\u2019t great against intelligent races. \u00a0It was more suited for the simple-minded monsters and the wild beasts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she had brought Jackson from earth, then she would have been in a better position to help. \u00a0However, she hadn't, so her presence in the party had been greatly diminished. The only ability that was useful was her Telepathic ability, but it was only used to sync everyone's thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had basically taken the role of a walkie-talkie. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is there to apologize for? \u00a0If it wasn't for Ms. Haesol, we wouldn't have been able to recover so many spoils of war.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The moles were disassembling the corpses, and they were were gathering the Bloodstones. \u00a0There were also a growing pile of Items they had taken from the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an incredible amount of stuff. \u00a0This wasn't an amount one could gather just from clearing one or two Dungeons on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe also have a lot of Artifacts now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka spoke excitedly as he activated his Detection Magic. \u00a0The Artifacts were more important than the Bloodstones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, they were taking Items with hidden abilities. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. \u00a0Let's rest a little bit before we explore. Lil bro Kahng said he'll be here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. However, do you think that Flame Roused will be ok?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdo smirked at Blanka's careful question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho? Mr. Sunggoo?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He seemed to be in an urgent....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he burned the colony to the ground, he also burned the Dimensional lord to death. Then he was immediately chased away by the Lich. \u00a0Sunggoo quickly disappeared into the distance. \u00a0No, they just couldn't see him, but they could hear terrifying sounds of explosions coming from nearby. \u00a0It seemed they weren't too far away from their location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't worry about him. \u00a0Mr Sunggoo is sturdy.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. \u00a0Still, I wonder if we should help him. \u00a0The monster that was chasing after him looked very dangerous.\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol laughed at Blanka's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn't a monster. \u00a0It is president's familiar. \u00a0It is a Lich.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? That was a Lich? \u00a0It disappeared so fast...\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He searched through his memory, and he thought he had caught a glimpse of the Lich. Blanka scratched his head. \u00a0Haesol spoke as if to say he shouldn't worry about Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNormally, Mr. Sunggoo looks unreliable, but he's also the person, who lasted the longest next to our president.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka queried with his expression as if to say, 'Why would you say that?' </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBig incidents always occurs near the president. \u00a0The fact that he is still alive is a big accomplishment in itself.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His skill was unquestionable. \u00a0Sunggoo had burned all the enemies to death at once. These were the monsters the party had struggled to kill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdo licked his lips in regret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, Magic is the way to go when kiting.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did his ability have to be Body Reinforcement\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn't as if his ability was bad. \u00a0Baek-jungdo was quite satisfied with himself. His Body Reinforcement ability was able to show its true worth during the night.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin thought Sunggoo had looked cool, but Sunggoo had a desperate expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's join up with Sunggoo hyung after he finishes his training.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. \u00a0It seems we'll have to start training for real if we want to keep up with Mr. Sunggoo.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were all Rank A.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden was Rank SS.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Hong-sunggoo became a SS Ranked 9th Circle Master, the party members doubted whether they would be able to keep up with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, the Holy Maiden was the only party member, who hadn\u2019t become exhausted. \u00a0She was the main reason why they were able to hunt until now with the currently constructed party. \u00a0Her healings and blessings had been a big boon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin had retroactively become a vampire, and the problem was he wasn't compatible with the Holy Maiden. \u00a0He couldn't gain any benefit from her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let's gather all the Artifacts.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The moles tamed by Haesol could dig through the corpses to gather the Bloodstones, but they couldn't collect the Artifacts. \u00a0They would have to do it themselves, so everyone stood up from their seats.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Woojin suddenly showed up. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLil bro is here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked when everyone was happy at his appearance. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe haven't seen each other for only few days, yet you guys are this happy to see me? Were you on your way to loot?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka shook his head from side to side at Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are going to gather the Items.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't be a hypocrite.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked around his surrounding to see the Colony that had been burnt to the ground.

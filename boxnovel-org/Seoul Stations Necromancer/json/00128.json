It blocked the heat, sound and debris from the explosion. \u00a0It blocked everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka had his two hands raised as if he was holding up the sky. \u00a0Then Blanka threw up some blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKool-rook.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had overextended himself in his use of magic, so he tried to calm his twisted insides. He looked at Woojin with resentment in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCouldn't you have warned us what would happen?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been nervous at the appearance of Dread, so he had prepared his barrier. \u00a0If he hadn't, they would have all been swept up into the explosion. \u00a0However, Woojin just shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou didn't have to take action.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Spirit Armor. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Spirit Armor always hovered around Woojin. \u00a0If there were any hint of danger, his barrier would form. \u00a0He had risen to a level where he could block most explosions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the party members near him would also be protected. Woojin didn't need anyone else to block for him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had said Blanka\u2019s actions were unnecessary, so he felt aggrieved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of being thankful, he....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. \u00a0You threw up all the delicious things you ate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk tsk. \u00a0I told you to just watch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sungoo and Baek-jungdoh scolded him, so Blanka felt like crying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had forgotten something. \u00a0Everyone here were Rank A Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were Roused, who were arguably one of the best in the world. \u00a0They all had the ability to protect their own lives, so he had had overstepped himself by stepping forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn't it reasonable for me to step forward?!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to yell those words, but he didn't have the energy to do so. \u00a0His head was spinning. \u00a0He was swaying unsteadily on his feet when an unknown energy suddenly entered his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mind relaxed a little bit. \u00a0He realized Woojin had used an unknown ability to bolster his energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018His abilities are endless...\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had Summoning skills, battle capabilities, magic and now healing.... \u00a0He wondered how broad the spectrum of Woojin's skills was... \u00a0He couldn't even guess at how many abilities Woojin possessed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm all right now. \u00a0I can heal myself now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka indicated his thanks with his eyes, then he started to activate the magical energy that had just been stabilized. \u00a0He assessed his own body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSelf Healing is pretty rare.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at him in fascination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This man was a Buff Type Roused, yet he was also a Healing Mage. \u00a0It seemed his ability didn't rely on Holy powers, so he was an oddity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's your name again?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's Blanka.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are fluent in Korean\u2026 Did you say you are from the Vishnu Guild? \u00a0How much do you receive from them?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome to Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka reigned in the energy that was trying to churn once again, and he looked at Woojin. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was his game? \u00a0He couldn't read anything from Woojin's eyes, yet it didn't seem like he was joking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is this?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if this was a Dungeon Raid team that didn't feel any sense of crisis, how could he try to scout someone in such a situation? \u00a0However, Blanka had no thoughts on changing his guild affiliation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm thankful for you words, but the guild master is my close friend.

Let's go conclude this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put the table and chairs into his Inventory, then he started to move. The white beach was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0Instead, the aftermath of the explosion left behind a huge lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses and Bloodstones were all engulfed in the explosion, but he wasn't sorry for his actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the middle of the lake, there was a purple gem. \u00a0It was where Dread had died. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stepped onto the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Air Walk&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used a Warrior Class skill that lightened one's body. \u00a0His level was still too low to be able to walk across the sky, but he could easily walk across water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Splosh. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His feet touched the water, but the water didn't reach above his ankles. Woojin walked across the water matter of factly, and he grabbed the gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;You've acquired a Dimensional Fragment.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He finally acquired one. \u00a0He could finally acquire a Dungeon that'll lead to Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put away the purple gem, then he walked across the sea towards Dread's underground palace. \u00a0He looked below, and he could see the green light of the Return Stone. \u00a0He retracted the energy that was maintaining the Air Walk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he activated a skill that increased his mass. \u00a0He quickly sank to the bottom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were still several sea monsters alive, but he was able to ignore them easily. \u00a0He took the Return Stone, and he shot out of the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-hah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had invested all his Stats into Intellect and Magic, so his Energy was comparably weak. \u00a0His previous actions had consumed all of his Energy. \u00a0He couldn't reactivate the skill Air Walk and walk across the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShing Shing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heeeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin rode the summoned Shing Shing towards his party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEhng? You aren't going to search for the treasures?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first Clear of this Dungeon, so there were a lot of Artifacts hidden here. \u00a0Woojin shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can't stay underwater for a long time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The influence of the Warrior Class allowed him to boast an incredible lung capacity compared to a normal person, but he couldn't stay past the 10 minute mark underwater.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sea was too large to use the Search Magic to find the location of the Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have a Buff that allows one to travel underwater without breathing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Blanka's words, everyone's attention was focused on him. \u00a0It was especially true for Woojin. \u00a0There was a strange sparkle in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn't he quite useful?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one only considered the Buff skills, Woojin had found someone in India, whose versatility was only second to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they exited the Dungeon after safely clearing the Dungeon, a large group of people greeted the party. \u00a0There were reporters from the Indian press, high ranking government employees, local bigwigs, people from the Vishnu guild, onlookers....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, Woojin would have summoned his Phantom Steed to escape the crowd. \u00a0He would have immediately disappeared towards the airport, but Woojin did something out of character. \u00a0He got on the car that had been prepared for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The four people, who cleared the Dungeon, and the Vishnu guild's guild master Kassim got into the waiting limousine. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hahaha. \u00a0I have to thank you for easily clearing the Dungeon that was impossible for us to handle.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is thanking you for clearing the Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kassim couldn't speak English, so he spoke in Hindi. \u00a0Blanka translated his words into Korean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. \u00a0Hindi?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took only a brief time to search through his Achievement Store. \u00a0He purchased the drug for learning Hindi, then he drank it. \u00a0Woojin pulled a medicine bottle from mid-air, and he started to drink the content. \u00a0Kassim looked on in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kassim?

He had gotten into the car for only one reason.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I have a deal I want to present to the Vishnu guild. ] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What kind of a deal?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal was called the best guild in the world, because of a single Roused. This was an offer being made by Alandal. \u00a0Kassim's eyes twinkled when the conversation turned towards guild business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I want you to give me Blanka.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Oh. \u00a0He is my blood brother.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka nodded his head at Kassim's disapproval. \u00a0On the other hand, he felt good, since this man clearly thought very highly of him. \u00a0The world's greatest Roused was coveting him. \u00a0He felt a sense of thrill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How much do you want?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I can't sell my brother for money\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll give you 100% rights to run this Dungeon.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kassim looked at him in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one went by the measured Energy, this Dungeon might be over 6 stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't help, but be surprised when he was given all the rights to the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kassim thought about the massive profit. \u00a0Then he started to weigh it against the worth of his blood brother, who was a Rank A Roused.....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[H...hyung-nim!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka was flustered as he spoke. \u00a0Kassim felt guilty, so he was about to turn down the offer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[When another Dungeon like this forms in the future, I'll clear it and I'll give you all the rights to that one too.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo...koo-hmmmm.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were very risky Dungeons that couldn't be cleared by the current Roused. The profit would be massive if he could clear these Dungeons. \u00a0He would earn the rights to two Dungeons over 6 stars for the price of a single Rank A Roused.....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll add one more.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll accept the offer.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka looked at Kassim with a ridiculous expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[H...hyung-nim.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kassim patted Blanka's shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Try to put what happened five years ago out of your mind. \u00a0Let us settle all the debt within our hearts.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Dungeon Shock swept across India five years ago, Blanka had saved Kassim's life. The light within Blanka's eyes shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Didn't I save you?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka had save Kassim from danger. As thanks, Kassim had befriended him, and they had become blood brothers. \u00a0Kassim coughed in embarrassment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How can I keep you to myself in the guise of repaying my debt? \u00a0Shouldn't I want you to play in bigger waters? ] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Huh\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked as he listened in on their conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You two settle everything.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grabbed Blanka's shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome to Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow.

He rejoiced as he looked at Blanka. Blanka would be able to support them with his Buff magic. \u00a0He had a variety of Buff magic, and they all had good effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was amazing enough maximize every power by half. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he joined Alandal, he wouldn't be of much help to Woojin. \u00a0However, he would be of great help to the other Roused like Sunggoo and Haesol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026it feels like I've been sold.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka let out a resigned sigh, and Sunggoo laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh.

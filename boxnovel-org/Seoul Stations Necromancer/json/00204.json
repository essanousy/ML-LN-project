Earth\u2019s Code?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe order has been given, and we\u2019ll recover Kim-kahngchul in 5 minutes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ten minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to take out Kahng-woojin first. \u00a0Then they will take out Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mess caused in the world would be cleanly reverted, and everything will start over once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Leone led his subordinates down the stairs of the Seoul Station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyong hid Sooah behind her, and she spoke in a trembling voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP...please step back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be alright. \u00a0This will take only an instant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul stepped forward with a blank expression on his face. \u00a0He was doing what needed to be done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI won\u2019t let you, you bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She hadn\u2019t been threatened, but she could tell what he was about to do. \u00a0She acted on her maternal instinct. \u00a0She tried to protect her child.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyong wrapped herself around Kim-kahngchul</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRun away, Sooah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMom!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Lee-soogyong\u2019s cry, Sooah hesitatingly ran towards the exit. \u00a0On the other side of the door, the security guards were fallen all over the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could regular people hold back a Rank A Roused?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-ahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul easily pushed Lee-soogyong away. \u00a0She screamed as she fell to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou won\u2019t remember this anyway.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their fate would repeat again. \u00a0He would no longer exist in this world, and she wouldn\u2019t remember what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sins he was committing right now would be wiped away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The delay was for a brief moment, but it was enough time for Sooah to sneak out through the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul quickly exited the room, and he came to a stop immediately. \u00a0Cindy and Do-jiwon had been coming towards this very room. \u00a0Moreover, one could see Sooah hiding behind them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho are you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t he Kim-kahngchul?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two slim beauties chatted to each other, and Kim-kahngchul\u2019s expression hardened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened to the people here? \u00a0Did you do this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They tried to argue from a moral high ground, but the women were afraid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had come here to play without knowing what was going on. \u00a0They arrived to find the security guards on the floor, and Sooah was being chased by a man. \u00a0This particular man had been known as the greatest Roused of Korea, and he had been imprisoned in an isolation room. \u00a0They faced him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By any account, this was a suspicious and scary situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tsk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul ran forward. \u00a0The promised time was close at hand. \u00a0If he wanted to be saved from this false world, he needed to get the Code.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Large tears could be seen in the eyes of the child.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Paht.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul held a small awl in his hand. \u00a0It was more than enough to snuff out this small life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-ah-ahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul charged forward like an angry bull. \u00a0Do-jiwon and Cindy screamed. \u00a0This was the only way they could fight back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their screams saved them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-ahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy squinted from the heat as she looked at the flame in front of her. \u00a0She had thought Kim-kahngchul was on fire, but after opening her eyes further, Kim-kahngchul was fighting with a ball of fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk\uff0cpuhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ball of fire was swinging its arms and leg. \u00a0She started to see a form take shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a man wearing red clothes, which looked like Korean traditional robes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He possessed white skin, and his hair, eyebrows and pupils were red. \u00a0He was a handsome man with a distinctive look.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMove. \u00a0I\u2019m trying to save the world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was inappropriate for this situation, but the red haired man let out a light laugh. \u00a0No matter how one looked at this situation, Kim-kahngchul was attacking three defenseless women. \u00a0His actions was far from saving the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The red-haired man\u2019s smile made Kim-kahngchul feel much more desperate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should stop this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the desperate Kim-kahngchul, the other man acted as if he had all the time in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused in front of him was a Fire Element Roused, who was easily able to turn aside a Rank A Roused like him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis won\u2019t do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man\u2019s hands shimmered as if it was about to melt before it ignited. \u00a0The flames reached out towards Kim-kahngchul. \u00a0\u00a0The bands of fire wrapped around Kim-kahngchul, and all his movements were restricted. \u00a0He fell to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul struggled on the floor, but he didn\u2019t show any signs of giving up. \u00a0He pursed his lips, and in a flash, a shiny needle flew towards Sooah\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-shoohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow dare you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A wall of flame appeared in front of Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the needle could reach its target, it melted from the heat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm. \u00a0Should I burn you or not?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the loops of flame was just restricting Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul, who was tied up, just felt a warm sensation from the flame. \u00a0However, if the temperament of the flame was changed a little bit, the bands of flame could turn Kim-kahngchul into ashes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the man didn\u2019t have to worry about what to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Not yet!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, Kim-kahngchul shivered as he started to struggle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His body slowly started to turn gray, and he disappeared as if he had never existed in this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man had seen this numerous times before where beings disappeared without leaving behind a corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? \u00a0He was a Dimensional lord?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tilted his head in confusion. \u00a0Do-jiwon and Cindy approached him, and they bowed towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT...thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had already been several weeks, since they had moved to Alandal. \u00a0They knew most of the well-known Roused, yet this was the first time they saw this man in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee, sister-in-law. \u00a0It\u2019s me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Do-jiwon and Cindy became surprised, the handsome man with the red hair grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s me, Sunggoo. \u00a0I\u2019m Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had won against the Curse of the Dragon\u2019s Breath. \u00a0He was born again as a Dragon Human hybrid. \u00a0He was the Flame Man Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN...no way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dojinwon and Cindy shook their head as if they couldn\u2019t believe it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was never this handsome\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seoul Station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Captain Leone\u2019s insistence, the party members quickened their steps. \u00a0They relied on the light attached to the magnetic levitation cart as they ran down the dark tunnel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are almost at our target.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were inside subway station building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a long line of capsules interconnected to each other. \u00a0Each capsule was labeled with numbers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were looking for a specific one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">G-529.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone gave the order when he saw the asian features of the man within the capsule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStart opening the hatch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party members placed equipments that will open the capsule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had done this numerous times, so their actions were in sync. \u00a0In a flash, they had unlocked all the clasps that kept the capsule sealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOpen it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-shoohng. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chweeeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The air escaped, and a nude figure of a man could be seen. \u00a0There were hoses placed in the man\u2019s mouth and ears. \u00a0There were devices attached to the head, heart and other body parts. \u00a0It looked as if the man was stuck inside a spider\u2019s web, and it looked creepy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet him out of there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The connecting equipments were being pulled off, and the man had to be put on the cart. \u00a0They just had to take him out now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At this point, they had spent only 3 minute and 30 seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jee-jee-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-ahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A party member fell backwards when one of the equipment let out a spark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust sever it with the cutter!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they couldn\u2019t pull it off with their hands, they would just cut the man free.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jee-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, party member\u2019s body shook from being electrocuted. \u00a0The electric shock was transferred when the cutter touched some unknown barrier made out of electricity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-uh-uh-uh\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone ran forward, and he was able to pull away his subordinate. \u00a0The subordinate had already lost consciousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell is going on!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Leone had rescued several dozen people before. \u00a0This situation was a first, so he was confused by the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chee-chee-chee-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t sure if the smoke originated from the electric current, but it lingered around the nude man\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWas there some kind of powerful lock placed on him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had always brought out Iello before. \u00a0This was the first time he would be bringing Kahng-woojin into reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCaptain. \u00a0We don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he didn\u2019t have a solution, it would be a waste of time to stand around here. \u00a0Moreover, two of the party members was unconscious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPut everyone on the cart. \u00a0We\u2019ll save Kim-kahngchul first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rest of the party gathered the two party members on the cart, and they hurriedly went towards Kim-kahngchul\u2019s capsule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In truth, it was impossible to tell if it was bright or dark outside. \u00a0A small light appeared in the emptiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light registered at the same time as the darkness. \u00a0Then\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ehhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t fight the queasiness, so he emptied the content of his stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to move him. \u00a0We don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Leone\u2019s words, the awakened Kim-kahngchul cracked open his eyes to look at his surrounding. \u00a0The party members picked him up, and he was put on the cart. \u00a0When he looked up at the ceiling from a prone position, the ceiling looked familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Subway station.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this the Moon World?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Or was this the real earth?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fake\u2026 Did he finally shed the bonds of illusion?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was saved.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt relief, and at the same time, he remembered something he had forgotten. \u00a0His eyes opened wide as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEarth\u2026 Code\u2026 I\u2019ve failed in acquiring\u2026it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone stood still for a brief moment, and his face crumpled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. \u00a0Let\u2019s get out of here first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to get out of here within the 10 \u00a0minute time frame. \u00a0If not, the Guardians would resume their activities. \u00a0The party members quickly walked out of there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Flying Fortress Bibi\u2019s Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. \u00a0That was a close call.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan and the other members arrived late. \u00a0All they could do was to console Sooah and the battered Lee-soogyong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say to make up for this, but I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t an outsider, who broke in. \u00a0Kim-kahngchul was someone they had locked away, and his surprise attack had almost resulted in a disaster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo where\u2019s hyung-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sunggoo\u2019s question, Jung-minchan groaned. \u00a0Hong-sunggoo had changed too much. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t for his unrefined way of talking, Jung-minchan would have mistaken him for someone else. \u00a0The atmosphere around him had completely changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe said he had something he wanted to check out the Moon World, so he went there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich Dimension is that in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he hesitated for a moment, Jung-minchan spilled everything he heard from Woojin. \u00a0Sunggoo listened tcalmly, and he didn\u2019t show any signs of being surprised as he replied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo we just have to protect little miss Sooah until hyung-nim comes back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t just his appearance that had changed. \u00a0He turned more simple-minded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes. \u00a0That is true, but\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan had been taken aback by Kim-kahngchul\u2019s surprise attack, but he now remembered the problem that was almost at their front door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA really powerful Dimensional lord is coming straight towards our fortress. \u00a0His target is probably\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Minchan didn\u2019t tell him, he could guess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll go welcome him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When did Sunggoo become such a reliable man?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When confronted by Sunggoo\u2019s confidence, Jung-michan gave a different opinion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about we move the fortress to avoid the fight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. \u00a0We can run away after we attempt the fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t reliable. \u00a0He might be reckless...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Ms. Haesol will be back soon. \u00a0Ms. Bibi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0I\u2019m not used to you now that you are all grown up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had grown in terms of height, and she had developed exceptionally in some places. \u00a0Sunggoo laughed awkwardly as he looked at Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMs. Haesol is bringing back friends, so may we move the fortress to the sea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen please do so. \u00a0I\u2019ll warm up by searching nearby for a fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After arriving on deck, Sunggoo\u2019s entire body turned red, and he jumped into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked like a phoenix in flight, so the people of Alandal was mesmerized by the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll head towards Incheon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the population had left Seoul already. \u00a0The nearest body of water was the western sea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi\u2019s Castle moved towards that direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, the Phantom Unit led by Blanka was assigned to protect Sooah. \u00a0Dimensional lords might pull off a surprise attack, so the Undead army, Ratick tribe, Wyvern unit and the Fortress\u2019s defense system was put on alert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The non-combat personnels went below deck, and they headed towards the evacuation shelter. \u00a0\u00a0After Bibi\u2019s Castle was put on emergency alert, they arrived over the western sea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zwahhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The portal shimmered, and Che-haesol appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan fiercely greeted

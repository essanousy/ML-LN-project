This was the first time he had experienced such a phenomenon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's gaze landed on a Return Stone placed on top of the desk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were no monsters here. \u00a0There wasn't even a portal heading towards a Dimensional Domain present. \u00a0It was just a bedroom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn't be able to find Toppler's location by searching more thoroughly, so he exited the Dungeon with the Return Stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you ok?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm fine. Do you have any theories on what just happened?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden's elegant eyebrows arched.

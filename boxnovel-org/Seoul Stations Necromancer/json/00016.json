When one looked at his expression as he counted the money, one couldn\u2019t find any indication that he was feeling any guilt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo couldn\u2019t even let out a moan since he was afraid of Woojin. He just stood there. Sunggoo got his feet wet in the 1 star Dungeons, but this was the first time he saw someone be killed in front of his eyes. Moreover, the killing was done through a person\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked indifferent after he killed these people. He acted as if he had experienced such trifling events numerous times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey carried around a lot of cash.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin felt great since he obtained an unexpected revenue of $900. At Woojin\u2019s humming, Sunggoo suddenly started to hiccup.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou almost died because of me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN..no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn\u2019t for Woojin, he would have already died when he was left to the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen why don\u2019t you double the amount.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI saved you twice now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In total, he wanted 4.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he emptied all of his savings account, he wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with the 40 thousand dollars. Sunggoo made an expression as if he was about to cry. Woojin took out the arrow embedded in his shoulder with a happy expression. Then Woojin gathered the undispersed souls of Bae-dohsoo and his party members. He used it to heal Sunggoo\u2019s wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo felt something enter him, and he gasped as he felt the rapid regeneration. This wound healing couldn\u2019t be compared to the one before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Soul Extraction was more effective if the soul came from a higher form of life. Of course, a human\u2019s soul would be a better source of energy than a monster\u2019s soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTh..thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it was nothing. Everything I do will be charged.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo quickly gathered the scattered blood stones then he followed behind Woojin. When Woojin and Sunggoo exited the Dungeon, the public service employee\u2019s eyes became round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Why are there only two of you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey were all taken down by the monsters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s composed words, the public service employee\u2019s eyes narrowed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen how were you able to gather all the blood stones?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if others die, it doesn\u2019t mean one should leave all the valuables behind. Right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s assertive answer, the public employee\u2019s eyes narrowed further. When he looked at the situation, he guessed these two had stabbed the others in the back to monopolize the profit. However, he had no way of proving it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-hmm. Just sign here before you leave. The Bureau may contact you if they decide to hold an investigation on a later date.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, and Sunggoo signed the entrance ledger that was handed over to them. Then the public employee in charge used a \u2018Deceased\u2019 stamp to make a mark next to the names of the Roused, who had entered with them into the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one was near a subway station, there was always a decent Bloodstone exchange store nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The price of the Bloodstones almost never fluctuated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The exchange store took a fixed amount of tax, and it also took the fee one was required to give to the very first person who cleared the Dungeon. The rest was deposited into the customer\u2019s account.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin exited the Shinrim Station\u2019s exchange store, his mouth was practically hanging from his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ve earned over 13,000 dollars from a single Dungeon.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blood stones were worth 12,300 dollars, and he had taken $900 from those bastards\u2019 wallets. Originally, this was suppose to be split amongst eight people. However, the important fact was he had earned $13,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if he included the $4000 he\u2019ll receive from saving Sunggoo\u2019s life, then he had a large sum of around $17,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Next time I\u2019ll have to go around the Dungeons by myself.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could make this much money at once like this, he didn\u2019t need to worry about the entrance fee. He could clear a Dungeon in 1 hour, so it would be much more profitable for him to clear it by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wrapped his arm around Sunggoo\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPut in your phone number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Hong-sunggoo put in his phone number, Woojin immediately pressed the call button . After he heard the ringtone come from Sunggoo\u2019s pocket, he ended the phone call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood, good. You have my account number?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019ve definitely written it down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Travel safely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out 10 dollars from his fat wallet. Sunggoo tried to dissuade him, but he put the bill in Sunggoo\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUse it for transportation fee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTh\u2026thank you. Big brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yea. Remember I really hate bastards who stab me in the back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I\u2019ll bear that in mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo lowered his head after he watched the happy Woojin leave. Sunggoo\u2019s face looked as if he had lost his country.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe said four\u2026 I\u2019ll be short even after I break open my savings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-songoo had become a Roused two month ago, and he had made a lot of money compared to his 21 year old peers. Still, it hadn\u2019t been easy for him to make money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had visited the 1 star Dungeons everyday for the past two months. He was able to earn more than 30 thousand dollars. He had been successful in saving some money, increase the effectiveness of his fireball ability, and decrease his cool-time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an incredible amount of cash flow compared to a regular person. However, it was money he had earned by putting his life on the line. His stomach churned at the idea that he would have to blow all the money he had struggled to gather.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he was pulled out from a certain death, so how could he compare his life to his entire asset? He probably could get a loan for $4,000 to fill the missing amount of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghh. When he said 4 bills, I hope he didn\u2019t mean the big 4 bills?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it is 40 thousand or 400 thousand, he intended to give him everything he got. However, he probably didn\u2019t have the ability to make 400 thousand dollars. It was a figure that felt too far away to reach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hoped Woojin didn\u2019t put such a high price on his life. Sunggoo headed towards the bank to break open his savings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon was a pretty successful owner of a cellphone store. He had 8 years of experience as a salesman, and he had used the money he had saved to purchase a store. His store was quickly becoming a fixture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah-ahm. There is no customers today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon let out a yawn when the glass door opened and a man quickly ran in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere\u2019s the restroom? Is it here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man abruptly opened the door behind the counter, then he entered it. Soonghoon watched this with surprise in his eyes. He probably lost the ability to speak since he was too flustered?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is this? Who is this crazy man?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon rose from his seat, and he spoke in an annoyed voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMister. That is the storage room. Please come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When there weren\u2019t any reply or reaction, a vein popped out on Soonghoon\u2019s forehead. He wanted to make sure the man wasn\u2019t doing his business inside the room, so he opened the door to the storage room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh jeez, come out\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon\u2019s clothes were grabbed by a hand, and he was forcibly dragged into the storage room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-dahng-tahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was thrown into the boxes containing products, Soonghoon knew something was wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He\u2019s crazy. A crazy man has appeared.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon quickly located his opponent. No, his opponent grabbed him first. He was lifted up by his collar, and Soonghoon struggled as his feet didn\u2019t even touch the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What, what kind of strength.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon was a big man, but his opponent was stronger than him. Moreover, his denseness was proportional to his strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek, Zzuhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon was suddenly struck on his cheek, so he lost the words he was about to say. His ears rang with a buzzing sound.(TLN: Mawp mawp) Moreover, he couldn\u2019t think about anything as if he had become dumber.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek, Zzuhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opposite cheek was struck, and Woo-soonghoon\u2019s consciousness started to fade. He tasted a coppery taste in his mouth as the inside of his mouth started bleeding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek, Zzuhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonhoon came to his senses when his cheeks were hit again. He felt an instinctual fear. He used all of will to desperately open his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH, help me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek, Zzahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of an answer, the hand flew towards him. Soonhoon felt a sense of despair when his numb cheeks were hit again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He has completely lost his mind. If I\u2019m not careful, I might really die.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did he see it on the TV? Indiscriminate violence? Didn\u2019t innocent people get beaten for no reason? Or maybe someone sent a killer after him? Now that he thought about it, the opponent probably entered the storage room since it didn\u2019t have a CCTV. He was sure this was a planned attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Yes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the first time, the other person spoke instead of using his hand. Sooghoon reflexively answered him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek, Kwadahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man in question once again roughly threw Soonghoon against the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet up. Attention.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a long time since he was in the military, but his survival instinct made it all come back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he let out even a squeak, it felt like he would be beaten to death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man in question was emitting such an atmosphere. His pose made him look like a mafia boss, who was in charge of several hundred underlings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hate bastards who hit me in the back of my head.(TLN:figure of speech about betrayal) Moreover, I hate those who dare to scam me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They hadn\u2019t even met before, so how could he have hit him in the back of the head? Soonghoon was too scared to make an expression showing his innocence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin glanced at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019re not going to answer me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He really wanted to know what he had done wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew, all right. Think of this as your lucky day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf this was the Alphen Planet, I probably would have killed you immediately.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon didn\u2019t know how the man could say he had lucked out in this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe thankful you were born in Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir! Long live the Republic of Korea!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t over do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was in a country with human rights. He had to follow the laws and morality of this place, so he couldn\u2019t kill this man for such a transgression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin decided to end this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Took. (TLN: sfx of phone hitting the floor)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cellphone he threw fell right in front of Soonghoon\u2019s foot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou sold me this newest phone yesterday.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fuck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon finally remember who this man was. He looked like a guy recently arrived from the boondocks, and he had sold him a handphone that was worth less than $10 for $90. He had felt so good about that sale that he even remembered the guy\u2019s name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The pushover from yesterday is this bastard?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could a person change so much?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The yesterday\u2019s pushover came back today as the grim reaper. Moreover, it seemed he was a Roused. If he new this person was a Roused, he wouldn\u2019t have tried such a clumsy scam.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI bought the newest phone\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, when I went home, I was told it was an old one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat, that is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWas there an error on your part?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was an extreme situation where his life may be on the line, so he started quickly turning the wheels in his thoughts. Woo-soongjin had 8 years of experience as a salesperson, so of course, he knew what was Woojin\u2019s intent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI, I must have made a mistake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew that was the case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bullshit. You beat up a person like this because of a mistake?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive me another one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat, what kind of model\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow would I know? You choose it for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive me the most expensive one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon thought hard on it. However, he eventually had no choice, but to take out the one smartphone he had left in stock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a happy face as he exited the cellphone store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo. The world has become so much better.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t even take a second before the map opened. The navigation searched for his destination, then at the same time, it started giving him directions. The internet was very fast, and everything was to his satisfaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. The latest phones are the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened his address book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"><span>[Mother] [Do-jaemin] [Real Jaemin] [4]</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat guy transferred it correctly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a person in the modern age, the address book was a list of one\u2019s human connections. Woojin smiled as he looked at the list of phone numbers. He told the phone salesman that he would be back again. He ordered the salesman, Woo-soonghoon, to enter his phone number, then Woojin warned him not to change his phone number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin called his mother to find out the address of the restaurant she was working at. It wasn\u2019t too far from his house. Woojin\u2019s steps was light as he returned to his house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hoo hoo. After I save a little bit more, we\u2019ll have enought to move. Before all of that, I should probably make mother quit her job?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was a bit spiteful towards her workplace, but it was the first time he would be visiting her workplace. Therefore, he bought a box of beverage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Soongmi\u2019s Restaurant]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think she said it was here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had found the restaurant at around 4 o\u2019clock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though it should be the idle hours, the small restaurant was half full.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rrring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the sound of the door opening was heard at the counter, a young lady reflexively gave a greeting with her eyes still glued to the cell phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pew pew. Pee-buh!, Pew pew pew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soongmi was in the midst of playing a game on her phone.

He wasn\u2019t handsome yet he had a good looking face. He had a heavy atmosphere around him. He was a beauty of corruption with a dark aura around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was something about his face\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBig brother Woojin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?

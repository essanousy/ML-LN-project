This is the words coming from the goddess of prophecy. \u00a0We should weigh her words carefully. \u00a0We have to get ready for the worst possible scenario.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody nodded along with Jaemin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, there was someone around the Immortal that thought like a normal human being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A goddess is saying these stuff, so how are we supposed to prepare against it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We have to analyze the prophecy, and we have to minimize the dangers....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eh-ee. \u00a0I don't know anything about that. \u00a0It is too complicated. \u00a0I'd trust hyung-nim more than a goddess.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo waved his hand, and he headed towards the Colony that was almost completed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I thought you were trying to say that the oracle was important.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That is what they were trying to say\u2026 \u00a0It is important.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It might be talking about our deaths. \u00a0Aren't you leery about it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo shrugged his shoulders at Jaemin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If I was going to die, I would have been burnt to a crisp by now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin couldn't come up with more words to argue with Sunggoo. \u00a0He had looked into the deep depth of Sunggoo's eyes. \u00a0The light in his eyes said that Sunggoo had moved beyond death, and it was all the answer that was needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The best way to handle this is to not think about it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, hyung.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this the difference in how much they trusted Kahng-woojin? \u00a0Do-jaemin reflected deeply on Sunggoo's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Sunggoo-hyung believes in him more than anyone else.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If I keep thinking about it, it'll just make my head hurt.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reason behind it was a bit strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo had been by Woojin the longest on earth. \u00a0As he stood by Woojin, it seemed faith in Woojin wasn't what had grown inside Sunggoo. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe Sunggoo's brain was cleared?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, his words made one become suspicious of such a possibility. \u00a0However, they didn't have enough free time to discuss such topics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Somehow, it will all work out. \u00a0I think.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he trying to cheer her up?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody silently nodded her head at Jaemin's words. \u00a0Goddess Aria's prophecies were never wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The message she had delivered was clear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Woojin obtains the treasure he had long been looking for, he might get lost. \u00a0He might lose the path back to his home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It is a horrible thing.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Holy Maiden Melody had already experienced it before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had gathered the Dimensional Fragments, and she had become a Dimensional lord to look for help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had lost all her Points when all the other lords attacked her, and she had lost her Dungeon. \u00a0In the end, she had no idea how she would get back to her home planet of Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was barely able to throw away her Domain before she had headed towards earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was able to come back to Alphen after a long period of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had delivered her analyses of the oracle to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the words that were spoken to her in return wasn't that nice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What the hell do you want me to do?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal would come to his own conclusions, and he would make his own choices. \u00a0Melody's words wouldn't be able to change his actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It isn't something that should go in one ear and out the other.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was they were treating the oracle as a divination coming from a fortune-teller. \u00a0However, Aria's oracle wasn't something that could be easily ignored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aria's prophecy was never wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Maybe I am being presumptuous by worrying for him.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He himself wasn't worrying about it. \u00a0The fact that Melody was putting herself out there worrying for him was ridiculous. \u00a0She became surprised when she realized she equated Alphen's peace with Kahng-woojin's well-being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn't that hyung-nim coming toward us?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sunggoo's words, everyone gathered under the matured World Tree looked up at the sky. \u00a0The Phantom Steed was using its Phantom Gallop, and they could see Woojin on top of it. \u00a0Latasha was being dragged along.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they were almost at their destination, Latasha jumped down to land on her own. \u00a0Woojin got off the Phantom Steed, and he looked at the Colony's symbol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm right on time.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll have two gates on Alphen. \u00a0The Dungeon will be protected by the defenders of the Dimensional Domains, and the Colony will be protected by the Coalition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no way he would lose his way back home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you accomplish what you set out to do?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's eyebrow arched at Melody's question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It was well received by me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As she had surmised, he really went to steal a Holy Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out the gloves as he shook it playfully. \u00a0Melody closed her eyes when she saw it, and the other heroes frowned. \u00a0Monk Tauric, who worshipped god Skia, couldn't help himself. \u00a0He yelled out at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are supposed to solidify our alliance, yet what is your motivation behind gathering the Holy Items?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I needed it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\".....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal had committed theft, yet he was speaking in an imposing manner. \u00a0It needled Tauric's feelings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you covetous of god Skia's treasure?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I already have one.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If I didn't have it, I would have asked for it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one went by the tone of his words, it felt as if the Immortal was taking back something he had loaned out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Now that we are talking about it...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin looked at Melody. \u00a0Her eyes shook from uneasiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why have I never seen Aria's Holy Item on you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He already possessed Thrash's Protection, which was the chest piece of the armor. It just needed to be repaired. \u00a0Moreover, he had obtained the Ingredient Items for the gloves and boots. \u00a0The only thing left was the helm and the belt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed the Holy Items from goddess of prophecy Aria, and the god of time Heres. \u00a0He was a bit puzzled at the fact that the Holy Maiden Melody didn't carry around her Holy Item. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her expression darkened as she spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"After you took away my predecessor's Holy Item...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Item was given to the servant that was closest to the god. \u00a0Whether it was a Holy Maiden, high priest or a monk, it was symbol of power given to the person that'll act as an avatar for the gods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody was an acolyte of the previous Holy Maiden, who had her Holy Item stolen. \u00a0Melody was the Holy Maiden now, but she was incomplete....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The high temple is in enemy territory. \u00a0I wasn't fully able to complete the succession, so I do not have my Holy Item yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She hadn't lost the item that symbolized her position as the Holy Maiden. \u00a0She had never received it in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I'll recover it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll recover the high temple then he'll take the Holy Item from her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was in a good mood. \u00a0It didn't matter how Melody felt about it. \u00a0He needed the Items to make Thrash's Set. \u00a0He was steadily gathering all the Items, and now he had completed a Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he had his gates, he'll earnestly help in recovering Alphen, and he'll complete Thrash's Set Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the mysterious Thrash's Executioner, but he'll eventually find the answer to the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll carry out the obligation I have towards the alliance.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened his Dimensional Store when his Colony was completed. \u00a0The Saurus mountain underneath the World Tree was considered to be his territory. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First, the walls...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin purchased castle walls, and he started placing it around the perimeter of his territory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-koo-koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if by magic, castle walls emerged out of the ground as a barrier was formed. \u00a0Everyone was in disbelief as they watched the miracle occurring in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have organize the roads....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Points were being quickly consumed, but he had saved up a lot from before. \u00a0The more important part was the Bloodstones that would be gathered through taxes and selling Items at the stores. \u00a0This could be seen as an investment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed the Coalition to have a solid base, so they could protect the place. \u00a0Moreover, he would be able to collect on taxes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was logical to prioritize making a stable Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the castle walls finished forming a perimeter, the grounds in various location were smoothed out. \u00a0The space that would be used as drilling grounds and a square was formed. \u00a0Then the roads started widening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The trees disappeared and the boulders were moved. \u00a0Houses were being made. \u00a0Numerous facilities were being built, and in a short amount of time, a town came into being. \u00a0Then several more towns were formed. \u00a0Lookouts formed in various parts of the mountain where the troops would be stationed. \u00a0He also made four Wyvern's Nests that'll protect the skies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had spent an incredible amount of Points, but he still had half his Points left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did I build all the basics?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he first decided to make Saurus mountain his Colony, everyone worried about supplies the most, but it wouldn't be a problem. \u00a0They would be able to buy everything from the Colony city's stores using Bloodstones. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't going to use this place as a shelter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't planning on supporting a resistance that hid and ran away. \u00a0This would be the launching pad of a counterattack. \u00a0It didn't matter if they were visible to their enemies. \u00a0The battle won't be conducted here. \u00a0He was going to take the battlefield to his enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After closing his Store, Woojin looked around his surrounding, and he saw that everyone was on their knees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin and Sunggoo also had dumbfounded expression on their faces as they looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H....hyung-nim.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such a short amount of time, the Saurus mountain had changed in too many ways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"God...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked when Jaemin mumbled the word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there was a god, it would be the being that made the Dimensional Stores. \u00a0He was just someone that used it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it seemed the natives of Alphen didn't share his views.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What the are you guys doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was dumbfounded when he saw the people on their knees with their head lowered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was most suited for destruction, yet the followers of gods, who were known for creation, was worshipping him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey. \u00a0Get up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn't dare raise their heads even at Woojin's words. \u00a0He spoke in a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you don't want a beating, you guys should get up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heroes stood up as they eyed Woojin. \u00a0This was especially true for Tauric, who had expressed his anger towards Woojin. \u00a0Tauric didn't know what to do with himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are give me the creeps. \u00a0Why are you suddenly being so shy?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can't believe I was able to see the god of creation's miracle....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin clicked his tongue as Tauric's words trailed away..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don't know shit about miracles.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this was considered to be a miracle, wouldn't that mean the Dimensional lords of Trahnet were all gods? \u00a0Woojin could act like a god only in a limited portion of this land, and his influence only extended to the Colony city below him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was checking the status of the Colony city through his Information Window when a large portion of his Points was suddenly drained away. \u00a0Half the Points of the Points he had left was used by someone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only two other beings that could use the Points besides Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was in charge of the Colony city on earth, and there was Kiba, who was in charge of defending the Dimensional Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A massive amount of Points were suddenly used, so it meant that most of his defenders had been be replenished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two gates opened up in front of the World Tree. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One headed to his Dimensional Domain, and the other one headed towards the Colony on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Woojin was deciding where he should go, a person popped out from one of the portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh? \u00a0King.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A line of people were exiting the portal. \u00a0It was none other than Che-haesol, Blanka and the Phantom Unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is anything unusual going on? \u00a0How's everything on earth?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Everything is fine. \u00a0We came \u00a0here as soon as the gate was activated.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Colony on earth was safe, was the Points being used at the Dimensional Domain?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Alright. \u00a0You guys should greet everyone here, then go get ready for the mission.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, sir.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Melody.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm going to go visit my Domain for a little bit. \u00a0I want you to settle the nearby locations with my men, and I want you to gather the Coalition.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin entered the portal heading toward his Dimensional Domain, her heart beat faster at some unknown worry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Please return safely.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Worry was squeezing her heart. \u00a0The Holy Maiden was unsure if the worry was for Alphen or Kahng-woojin. \u00a0She couldn't make out her feeling.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

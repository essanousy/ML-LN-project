Woojin asked a question as he looked at Jiwon\u2019s uncomfortable figure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy were you avoiding my calls?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Just\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was there a word that was more ambiguous than the word \u2018just\u2019?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo I make you feel uncomfortable?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN\u2026no. It isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was nervous instead of uncomfortable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She might come to like him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt nervous at the prospect of starting to like him, when she wasn\u2019t qualified to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was forcing herself to ignore him, but he came here to find her\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what\u2019s the real reason why you are here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo reason. I just had something to give you, and since I\u2019m here, I might as well go on a date.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD\u2026date?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. Too many surprising events kept happening to her one after another, so she was dazed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019re here. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She got off when she heard Woojin\u2019s words, and she realized she was at downtown Pyeongtaek. There were too many people here, so she\u2019d never been here before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit too early to eat dinner, so let\u2019s go watch a movie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWoojin. This place is a little bit\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke as he looked at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Is it because there are a lot of people here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you that worried about other people\u2019s gazes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How can she not not mind the other people especially with this face?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon pressed her hat further down her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After looking at Jiwon, he led her to a street stall. He opened his wallet, and he bought two shoddy masks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo yo want to be Iron man or Spider man?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What the heck? What kind of guy was this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Jiwon was flustered, Woojin put on the Iron man mask. He was in a suit, yet he was wearing a mask worn by children on Children\u2019s day. He looked ridiculous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry wearing it\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was taken aback when Woojin took her hat. He put the Spider man mask on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP\u2026please give me back my hat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her hat was akin to her clothes. Without it, she felt naked when other people looked at her. He took her hunched shoulder, then he pointed toward a glass window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What do you mean how is it\u2026 She looked like an idiot. They were Spider man and Iron man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right? Then let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY..you want to go around like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? Do you want me to buy you another mask?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN\u2026no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grabbed Jiwon\u2019s hand, and he led her away. While being dragged away, she glanced at their figure in the building\u2019s window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Iron man in a suit was leading a long-haired Spider man away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time they passed by people, their gazes landed on the two of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. What is that? That\u2019s really funny..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is that? Waa. Jackpot.\u201d (TLN: jackpot or daebak is a term used when you express approval or admiration)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon\u2019s shoulders shrank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. There figures aren\u2019t a joke. Who are they? Are they celebrities?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it some kind of an event?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHalloween is still far off.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They stood in front of the crosswalk. She felt people watching them as pedestrians tried to catch a glimpse of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eyes, eyes, eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the unconcealed gazes she was used to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was something different about it. The disgust, and pity had changed into curiosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. That woman\u2019s body isn\u2019t a joke. Her face must also be pretty??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa. Are you crazy? Where are you looking at?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon couldn\u2019t help herself from laughing when she heard the couple next to them fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was unconcerned with the whispers heard from his surrounding. He turned his head towards Jiwon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a little bit too unexpected\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is too funny, and it is also exciting\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, the signal changed. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grabbed Jiwon\u2019s hand and he led her away. Jiwon grabbed Woojin\u2019s hand a little bit tighter. Her shrunken shoulders straightened, and her steps became a little bit more confident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She threw away her embarrassment. Iron man and Spider man entered the theater.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin scratched his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every movie was sold-out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon grabbed Woojin\u2019s arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don\u2019t really have to see a movie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cToo bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to turn away, when a man wearing a hat and a surgical mask tapped Woojin\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have an urgent business. Would you like to see this movie?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHave a nice day. I really do have an urgent business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the confusion of the moment, Woojin took the tickets, and he saw the man trot away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He looks familiar.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man who was hurrying away turned around. He looked at Woojin , and he gave a wink. Then he disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why did he follow me here?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook the ticket in front of Jiwon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess we are lucky?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon and Woojin bought some popcorn. When they entered the theater, a man with his face obscured by a mask and hat showed up again. When he pulled down the mask, it was none other than Woo-soonghoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He approached the ticket booth, then he took out a bundle of tickets from his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease refund me all of the tickets except for this screening.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t say it was going to be a group viewing\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Could you give me a refund? There is still 20 minutes left before the movie starts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the ticket employee tried to deal with the customer, Woojin and Jiwon had entered the theater. Both of them had an absurd expression on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? They said it was sold-out, but no one is in here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of his underling was overdoing it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, whatever. Let\u2019s just watch it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sat down in the empty theater. He found out the seats in the middle had the best view of the movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo one is in here. If it is stuffy, take it off.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould I?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon took off her mask then she turned toward Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive me my hat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Just watch it like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t I bother you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy? Should I look at you strangely? Should I look at you with pity?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN\u2026no. That wasn\u2019t what I meant\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It came in like a punch. His straight forward answer was very heavy handed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon was taken aback. Woojin spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are pretty. Don\u2019t feel small because you have a scar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are a lot of ugly people out there even if they don\u2019t have any scars, like the orc and goblin from before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOrc and goblin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose girls who came out before. For a moment, I thought I had entered a Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026. Still, you should judge people too much on their appearances.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, aside from the appearance, their souls weren\u2019t pretty. It was greasy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSoul?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour soul is pretty. It\u2019s pure white.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wa. She had goosebumps. How can he say such a buttery comment with a straight face?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t know him that well before, but Woojin\u2019s personality was like the 4th dimension.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t surprised when he looked at a monster like her. No, it seemed he didn\u2019t even have a pulse. His eyes didn\u2019t hold any judgement, and this fact mercilessly shook Jiwon\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had also bought her a mask as a consideration for her\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it\u2019s starting\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin focused on the movie as he ate the popcorn. Jiwon kept alternating from looking at Woojin and the movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, that was fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ah. I think it\u2019s really been 5 years since I saw a movie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think it\u2019s been 20 years since I\u2019ve seen a movie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo ho. What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned when Jiwon laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she had her mask on, he could tell she was having a good time. He felt the happiness in her clear soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSee. Isn\u2019t it good to laugh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to go use the restroom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin left briefly to use the restroom, Jiwon wrapped both her hands around her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her shaking heart was starting to run harder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Jiwon was shell-shocked, Woojin went to use the restroom. While he was urinating, Woojin\u2019s phone buzzed. He took it out to check the message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ve made an appointment at XX restaurant in president\u2019s name. It would be best if you take a stroll there.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a text from Soonghoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell is he up to?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had planned on eating soon, so\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin exited the theater with Jiwon. He searched the address on a map, and he realized the restaurant wasn\u2019t too far away. They had to walk a busy road full of people, but he didn\u2019t mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon had gotten used to the Spider man mask, so she was rather excited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh. Hey there, hero couple. Come spin this once. It\u2019s free.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed to be an advertising event where one had to spin the roulette. Jiwon and Woojin waited in line, and soon it was their turn. There was only a 10% chance of losing. It was an event where almost every spin yielded a prize.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon turned the roulette, then she gathered her hand in a prayer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I\u2019m really bad at these kinds of stuff.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Despite her prayer, she landed on a dud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, too bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Do you want to spin it, Iron man? Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could give your girlfriend a present?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grabbed the roulette, then he spun it hard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The roulette started to spin, and it was slowly heading towards a dud. Jiwon watched on in anticipation, and Woojin looked at her. The man in charge of the roulette had bet his life on this event, and all three of their emotions intersected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The roulette was about to stop on a dud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man in charge of the event discreetly bumped the roulette. This caused the roulette to spin a little bit more, and it barely cleared the dud. Woojin won a prize.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh oh. You won the special prize. Congratulations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man handed Woojin a small shopping bag. Everyone else had received tissues, water bottles and prizes of the same ilk. However, Woojiin\u2019s prize was different.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin narrowed his eyes as he looked at the man in charge of the event\u2026 He glared at Soonghoon. Soonghoon winked back at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghh. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin started to walk again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon played a lottery game along the way, and she also looked at the accessories being sold at a stall. They walked in a leisurely manner. The surrounding people still looked at them with interest, but the two of them really didn\u2019t pay attention to the others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything felt like a new experience, and she was thankful for everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When was the last time she had experienced something like this? She usually walked like she was being chased by people in the busy streets\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon felt like she was in a dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If this is a dream, I don\u2019t want to wake up from it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was wearing a mask, but if Woojin wasn\u2019t with her, she wouldn\u2019t have dared to do any of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iron man and Spider man ignored the whispers inside the restaurant, and they finished their meal. Then they walked towards a nearby park.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of people on the trail inside the park. There were families on a night walk, couples enjoying a date at night, and there were even students walking around. Still, it was less crowded than the main street.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They walked without talking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They sat on a park bench after their silent walk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon couldn\u2019t help, but laugh at her current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is too funny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is. We wore strange masks to the theater, and we ate at a restaurant with in on. People must have thought we were strange..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho cares?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. You are right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The smile around Jiwon\u2019s lips faded away. It sounded wonderful. He had the courage to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m still short on courage. This really is like a dream. I was able to walk in a busy street, watch a movie, and eat out at a restaurant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if it was a brief moment, she was thankful that Woojin had allowed her to dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a brief moment, she had deluded herself into thinking Woojin liked her. However, even if he did like her, she didn\u2019t have the confidence to accept him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was too shabby, and Woojin was already flying high in the sky. She wouldn\u2019t be able to see him even if she looked up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you so much. Thank you very much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt was like a dream. It has been a long time since I haven\u2019t felt afraid of other people\u2019s gazes. I\u2019m really thankful. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she hadn\u2019t said anything, he would have felt her gratitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was for a short amount of time, but Jiwon had felt like she was a main character in one of her novels. However, life wasn\u2019t a novel, and one had to wake up from a dream eventually.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time for her to return to reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she dreamed a little bit more, then she would fall for Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpider man has to return to being the Hulk now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon tightly shut her eyes, then she took off her mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFor your courage, I have a present for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grabbed the medicine bottle in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pee-ewwwwwwwww. Puh-puh-puhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, fireworks exploded in the air. The people, who were enjoying the walk in an indifferent manner, let out a cheer. Each person held a single flower in their hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWaaaa. Congratulations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They gathered around the two to congratulate them, but everyone was taken aback when they saw Jiwon\u2019s bare face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeek? Wh\u2026what the hell?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul. Uh.

They started to speak noisily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pressed firmly on his temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah, Woo-soonghoon. This\u2026uh-whew.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes caught Jiwon\u2019s flustered face. Her mask was off, and half of her face looked unnatural. No. It looked as if her soul had been sucked out of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked flustered as if she was having a panic attack. Woojin summoned the Wall of Bones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha-roo-roo-rook!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the bench at the center, Woojin and Jiwon was surrounded by the Wall of Bones like a dome. This shut them off entirely from the people crowding around them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They couldn\u2019t hear the people\u2019s cheer nor the explosive sounds of the firework.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took off his Iron man mask.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW\u2026Woojn\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t look to be in a sound state of mind.

When Woojin\u2019s hand touched her, she shook like a leaf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Nightmares are terrible.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She must have had a hard time. Woojin knew that pain better than anyone. Woojin understood her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now she will be able to wake up from her long, long nightmare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin carefully applied the salve as if he was praying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Regeneration Salve absorbed into Jiwon\u2019s scar.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

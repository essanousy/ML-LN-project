The British Monarchy and the Parliament went over the decision. \u00a0They came to the conclusion that the Dimensional Fragment was a very important Item, but they decided the aircraft carrier as a payment was an unreasonable. Instead, we propose dispatching an aircraft carrier to the East Sea for 5 years. \u00a0It will shore up your defense...] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was such an enormous offer that Soonghoon's mouth dropped open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had never thought about this before. He couldn't keep the surprise and confusion off of his face. He had lost the pace of the negotiations through his own fault. \u00a0He had basically gave up the upper hand in the negotiation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We can come to an agreement on the money it takes to operate the aircraft carrier. If we split the cost down the middle, we'll agree to station it here for the next 5 years.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This isn't something I can make the call on. I'll have to meet the king later on, then...] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Soonghoon was speaking, the door suddenly opened, so he shut his mouth. \u00a0The person he had been waiting for had appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess everyone's here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome back.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan greeted Woojin in a welcoming manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An aircraft carrier wasn't a child's toy, yet he was asking for it so matter of factly. \u00a0He wondered how valuable this Dimensional Fragment was...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin saw the negotiation group from Britain, he immediately asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you speak Korean?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon had on a shocked expression when the blonde British man started to speak eloquently in Korean. Of course, the man knew how to speak English, but he never expected his counterpart to know how to speak Korean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you give me what I want, I'll give you this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out the Dimensional Fragment from his Inventory, and he held it out. \u00a0The gem was letting out a brilliant purple light, and it was emitting so much magical energy that normal people could feel something was off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. It takes several thousand people to maintain and operate an aircraft carrier. To my knowledge, Alandal doesn't have that many people.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's my business. Just give me the boat and everything within it. I don't need the people.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did Alandal have enough people to pull this off? There weren't that many people that knew how to operate an aircraft carrier amongst the entire population of Korea. This small country had never even owned a aircraft carrier before, so why was he coveting it so much...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll take care of it myself. Will you buy it or not?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026we want the Dimensional Fragment for the purpose of research, but we have no idea what it can do...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can purchase a Dimensional Gate that leads to another planet. \u00a0Basically, with this one Item, you will be able to own a Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's words, the negotiation group and the people from the US and Japanese guild became surprised. It wasn't known to outsiders, but each of them had also gained a Dimensional Fragment. \u00a0Currently, there were researches going on...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill you buy it or not. \u00a0If you don't want it, I'll sell it to someone else.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The negotiation group expressed their dismay at Woojin's unreasonableness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to discuss it with my home country. \u00a0Do you mind if we give our final decision tomorrow?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to wait until tomorrow? Are you willing to purchase the time that I'll waste?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How much was a single day of Kahng-woojin' life worth? He was able to clear a Dungeon in few hours. \u00a0How many Dungeons did he crush during his trip around the world? \u00a0Yet they dared to keep him waiting for a whole day?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan you handle that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP...please give me thirty minutes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKaneda and Bad Sector? \u00a0If this isn't resolved within 30 minutes, I'll sell it to you guys. \u00a0Ah, does Japan have any aircraft carriers?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin asked the question as he looked at the man from the Bad Sector guild. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the man from the Bad Sector guild quickly took out his phone, the negotiator from Britain suddenly stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll buy it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, they were going to buy it no matter what, yet they had acted as if they weren't interested.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring me the aircraft carrier.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin placed the Dimensional Fragment on the negotiation table. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man didn't know what to do as he looked at Woojin. \u00a0Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTake it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026just like this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of a dealing was this? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The decision had just been made, and there were still uncertainties surrounding the deal. Was it really ok to just hand over something so valuable? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin eradicated the negotiator's worries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you guys plan on reneging on the deal, I'll erase Britain off the map.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll of you can all leave. No, you guys come with me to the president's room.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke as he looked at Minchan and Soonghoon. \u00a0Then he exited the prime minister's office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a while, the office was silent as a grave. The air was heavy as it was sucked into Woo-soonghoon's lungs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What the hell just happened now?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The aircraft carrier had been thrown back and forth in the negotiations... In a flash, an item worth billions of dollars had exchanged hands. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is this how it feels to have the world at one's beck and call? Soonghoon had stood at the center of the negotiations. \u00a0He felt afraid, and thrilled at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let's conclude the negotiations with the Bad Sector guild tomorrow.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan tidied up the situation as he sent away the other delegations. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, Soonghoon and Minchan walked the corridor together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. \u00a0I wonder what the king wants to do with that aircraft carrier.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe he just wants one?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon had just tossed that idea out there, but somehow there was a ring of truth to it. \u00a0Minchan let out a groan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, they could just go ask him right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. You guys are finally here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin buried his body into sofa as he greeted them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe other party members didn't come with you?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are still rolling along. I thought we were going to do a Guild General Assembly? \u00a0Why is it being put off from day to day?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe size of assembly got too large.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll the guilds of the world showed interest in it. They are all hoping to attend.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk. \u00a0Is that so?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hammer guild is doing their best. It is scheduled to be in 15 days.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is way too late.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had planned on going to Alphen after the general assembly ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why you don't outsource tasks like this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at his dependable subordinate Jung-minchan. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t want any constraints on his work. \u00a0This was why he had founded a country, and he chose Jung-minchan as the prime minister.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll have it in 6 days. I'll talk to all of the guilds before I head towards Alphen. \u00a0If they can come, they'll be there. The ones that can't attend can watch it on the news.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026if you suddenly propose such a tight schedule\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've waited this long. That's enough. Those people from Hammer are too slow. You take over.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was told to do it, he would do it. \u00a0However, the thought about doing it made Minchan's head hurt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo why do you need the aircraft carrier?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I have something I want to test.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you trying to make a Golem?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? I can give Dolsae scrap metals, so why would I buy an aircraft carrier for him?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no good reason to buy such an expensive aircraft carrier for the purpose of using it as ingredients for his Golem. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan's eyes turned round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat can we do with just the aircraft carrier? \u00a0We really need a lot of people to move that big thing....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou'll have to fill it up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't have to worry about the task, since he had someone else that would be doing the worrying for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan's head was hurting already.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOr I might fill it up in some other way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPerhaps? From the Dimensional Domain?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0It'll be beyond our ability to fight the war with only people from earth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Soonghoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know how to do the SNS? Sign me \u00a0up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? You want me to register president's SNS?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon was surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring me my hand phone.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Songhoon fiddled with Woojin's handphone, and he registered Woojin to the SNS. The country of Alandal wasn't even available at registration. \u00a0As a dual citizen, Soonghoon registered Woojin as a Korean citizen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026so that is how you put up a post.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0All right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll put up on the official Alandal account that president has joined the SNS.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon worked quickly, and suddenly, Woojin's hand phone kept vibrating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ring, ddi-ring. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;TheLight-nim just followed you.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Asdf-nim just followed you.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I'll turn off the notification.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s followers were increasing rapidly, and he was jumping the total followers ranking several dozen spots at a time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He'll pass me by in a flash.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon had a lot of followers. He had as many followers as famous actors. \u00a0However, it seemed Kahng-woojin was going to pass him by at any moment.. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll use this later. \u00a0Is there any Dungeons that are about to Break? \u00a0Do we have any requests that are already in?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. That's....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan's face darkened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are several imminent Breaks, yet none of the governments are asking for help.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo they want to take care of it through their own efforts.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I don't know the exact reason behind it, but I would hazard to guess it has something to do with the Dimensional Fragment you showed earlier.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tapped on his armrest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Greed might burn them, but that was the natural consequence of thier deed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey'll get a stomach ache.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's nothing. \u00a0Just leave them be.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, Kahng-woojin couldn't shut down all the Dungeons. The places that'll Break will Break. The ones that are able to defend their Dungeons will defend them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they were desperate, they'll ask for help. It wasn't a bad idea to give them autonomy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow's the recruitment of new Roused for the guild going?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe resumes for the recruitment are flooding in. In the end, president will have to make the choice. \u00a0Please tell me the time, so I can send out a notice.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't care about resumes. \u00a0Their current ability to clear a Dungeon had nothing to do with their growth potential. \u00a0Who would have expected Hong-sunggoo to become one of the top Roused of this world?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin will choose them based on what he saw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen schedule it 3 days from now.

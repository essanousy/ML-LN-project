He called his mother to see when she could get off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, mother. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After ending the phone call, Woojin looked at Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have nothing to do until 3 o\u2019clock. Do you want to go eat something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be honored. Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDude. Stop over doing it. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh, I really am honored. Where should I take you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. How about a taste makes me feel like I\u2019ve returned to earth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was in trouble. He couldn\u2019t think of any witty words he could reply back with. Before the silence lingered, Sunggoo was barely able to give an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. Should I take you to an organic Korean restaurant? There is a place I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. Let\u2019s go there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked out the window, and he pointed at a specific location. Sunggoo rubbed his eyes when he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOver there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kimbab World]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo berated himself inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Now that I\u2019ve touched some money I became wasteful. Hyung-nim is still frugal.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo ordered what they wanted to eat after they parked in front of the Kimbab World. Woojin ordered tuna kimbab(TLN: canned tuna) and Ramen. He had a very blissful expression on his face as he savored the food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This. This is it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought about his old memories, and his 3rd year in high school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This is what he had tasted at that time. The 20 years as a necromancer was bypassed, and he felt like the 3rd year high school student from earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-roop.(TLN: noodle slurping sfx) Hyung-nim. Which Dungeon should I look up next?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. Is there something like a monster catalogue out there? It would be better if there was a list where the 1 star and 2 star monsters are ordered by their level.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, it exists.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s decided after I see that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll show it to you at the cafe after I organize the information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo headed towards Angel Angel, and they ordered some coffee. Sunggoo glanced at Woojin before he spoke to the barista.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs there anything on the menu that represents the earth\u2019s taste? Is there something that\u2019ll make one feel such a sensation??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sunggoo\u2019s question, the barista frowned as if he saw someone with a couple screws loose. Sunggoo turned to look at Woojin, and even Woojin was looking at him strangely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have a weird taste. I want a Cafe Mocha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Woojin said those words, he went to take a seat. Sunggoo\u2019s face turned red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would like an Americano and a Cafe Mocha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. That would be $10.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo brought a vibrating coaster and he took a seat. Woojin slyly asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe coffee price these days is nothing to scoff at.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s almost priced the same as lunch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked around the cafe\u2019s interior. When he came here previously, he had left without ordering anything. He was surprised when the coffee was more expensive than he thought it would be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soup and rice is $6. The price was almost the same as a coffee\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if there weren\u2019t a lot of people here. This large cafe was half full. Woojin indirectly asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow much would it cost to set up a store like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA cafe? I\u2019m not sure. It should be around 1 million dollars?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how much the rent was, but this cafe was 3 story high. It was a large cafe. Sunggoo was in the dark about such matters, so he guessed at the answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It would be great if I could set one up for mother.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The coffee price was expensive, so he thought the business will do well. It looked to be less arduous than working at a restaurant. He made $300,000 today. He could make 1 million dollars if he worked hard for 3 days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought about it in a relaxed manner. If he purchase a house, then he didn\u2019t have anything else he wanted. He\u2019ll continue to attack the Dungeon to level up, and the money would gather by itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The money itself was trivial. He just wondered if he should set up a store like this, so his mother could have something to occupy her time in relative comfort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pew pew, Pyo-ro-ro-rong..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sipped the sweet Cafe Mocha, and he focused on his phone game. While he was occupied, Suggoo brought up some data on his tablet PC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I have it here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me see. How do I turn the page on this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s the same as a smart phone, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin dragged the window to the top of the screen, then he looked at the monster catalogue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Rakwis from the 3 star Dungeon and the monsters like Goblin and Kobold from the 2 star Dungeons were also classified by the number of stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters with 1~3 stars were classified as low ranked monsters. The monsters were classified as high ranked starting from 4 stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most basic 4 star monster was a troll. Its movement was quick, and it had enough intelligence to use tools. Moreover, they had an abnormal regeneration ability. Still, they weren\u2019t that hard to deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard the 4 star Dungeons and above looks a little bit different. Of course, I\u2019ve personally never been to one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 3 star Dungeon kept the original appearance of a subway station. However, the 4 star Dungeons were basically like stepping into a different world. The entrance just acted as a gate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I\u2019ll know once I enter one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin eyed all the 4 star level monsters. Then he weighed it against his own level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019ll be possible if they are at that level.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were easy monsters to deal with, but there were also difficult ones too . However, he felt like he would be able to take on monsters as high as 4 stars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to level up, it would probably be better for him to attempt the higher ranked Dungeons early on rather than going for the low ranked Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo who assigns the stars?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a measured value.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is being measured?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Dungeon Energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is such a thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Every time a Dungeon is reset, the Dungeon Energy can be measured. Teams read these estimated report to decided if they should attempt a Dungeon or not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head. The stars weren\u2019t really assigned to the monsters. It was the grade for the Dungeons. The monsters were categorized depending on which ranked Dungeons they spawn the most at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This is why it wasn\u2019t strange to see a 3 star monster, a Hobgoblin, in the 2 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst, I want to see and experience it. Find out more about the 4 star Dungeons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don\u2019t have to line up starting from the 4 star Dungeons. We can make an appointment. I\u2019ll look up if there are any empty spots in the schedules.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin learned that the 4 star Dungeons and above were Field type Dungeons. Woojin spent the remaining time listening to Sunggoo\u2019s various explanations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo exited the cafe when the appointed time arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I could take care of these small matters for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. My mother has to live in the house, so she should see it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim. If you need anything, please give me a call.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gave a respectful bow. Woojin nodded his head as he saw Sunggoo walk away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve earned a pretty good servant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo sometimes over did things, but he really liked the affable Sunggoo. He headed towards Soongmi\u2019s restaurant with light steps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soongmi was sitting on the counter, and she was immersed in her hand phone game. Even though she was in the midst of setting a high score, she threw her phone down as she suddenly stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-muh, Oppa. You came? Did you eat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. I ate..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you want some coffee?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I\u2019m heading back out immediately. Where is my mother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a moment. I\u2019ll call for her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soongmi headed inside the kitchen, and she saw Lee-soogyong and the other kitchen ladies busily working since it was lunch time. She was taking care of a stack of dirty dishes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUn-muh. Mother. Elder brother Woojin is here. Please hurry up and come out.\u201d (TLN: Lost in translation. But Soongmi is speaking to Woojin\u2019s mom as if she is her mother-in-law)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO..ok. Ms. Soongmi. Let me finish this up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Lee-soogyong\u2019s awkward exchange, her fellow kitchen ladies made a big fuss about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-whew. Mrs. Lee must be very happy. Your son is making so much money that you are going to look for a house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe way he is making money is like that yankee gentleman, Neil Gates.\u201d (TLN: lol)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. That\u2019s right. I\u2019ve heard about him too. His name was Neil or something . I\u2019ve heard he makes a lot of money. Your Wooojin is like him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m so jealous. If my son was like Woojin, I would have immediately quit this job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo. Hurry up and go. Your son is waiting for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI still have to do my share before going.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At her fellow kitchen ladies\u2019 complements, Lee-joonhyung finished washing the dishes with an shy smile on her face. Since she gained a dependable son, the restaurant work didn\u2019t feel arduous anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe\u2019ll come out after she finishes what she is doing. Oppa should sit here. It won\u2019t be too long.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soongmi pulled a chair towards him, and he sat. When he saw Soongmi sit across from him, he asked her a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh, I\u2019m looking at Oppa\u2019s face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-ooh. I feel a bit uncomfortable when something ugly looks at me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soongmi\u2019s face remained gentle even when she heard Woojin\u2019s straightforward comment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my. You are still so forceful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. Go make me a cup of cofee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, oppa. If oppa feels uncomfortable then I\u2019ll look at oppa sparingly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he remembered. He remembered the memories where Soongmi had clung onto him even though he said he didn\u2019t like her. While Woojin was drinking the mixed coffee Soongmi made, his mother came out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are here, son?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Behind Mrs. Lee-soogyong, the other kitchen ladies followed her out. They acted as if they had come to look at someone else\u2019s precious son. Their gazes made Woojin feel uncomfortable, so he let out a fake cough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhm. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Why are we going to go look at houses when he don\u2019t have any money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With a quiet anticipation, his mother asked the question. Woojin suppress a bitter laugh as he looked at his mother with teary eyes. Well, he guessed it would be ok to go along with this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean we don\u2019t have any money. This was deposited today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin showed her the figure on his smart phone. Even though she was secretly filled with anticipation, Lee-soogyong was surprised. When he said he wanted to move to a different house, she thought he had obtained around $5,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTh\u2026th\u2026three hundred thousand dollars?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Lee-soogyong\u2019s stuttered words, Soongmi\u2019s eyes turned round, and she also checked the figure. She hadn\u2019t read it wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-wah. Jackpot. It\u2019s $380,000! The Roused are the best!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused made a lot of money. They had heard about how much money the Roused made, but they couldn\u2019t help but be surprised when they saw it with their own eyes. Woojin\u2019s mother, Lee-soogyong, was so surprised that she became tongue-tied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-yooh. Mrs. Lee has an excellent son. In a single day, he was able to make couple hundred thousand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaigo. Who cares about that Neil or whatever. Eeeeng. She won\u2019t even have to envy Mahnsook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho the heck is Mahnsook?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, you know about them. The person who sells gas at the snobby large neighborhood</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeeng. I heard about him. Ms Kim is so knowledgeable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo ho ho. Mrs. Lee has been holding back until now! You said he had come back after playing some game, and you were worried about him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQuitting your job is the least you can do. You could open up your own restaurant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf Mrs. Lee opens up a restaurant, then you can count on me. I\u2019ll go there to work for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyong came to her senses when she heard her fellow employees prattle on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW\u2026Woojin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go see some houses?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed when he looked at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin escorted his mother to look around several houses as a real estate agent guided them. His mother\u2019s had a blissful expression on her face as if she was in a dream, and she liked every house we went to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were too many houses she liked, so she was having a hard time choosing one. These houses were much better than the one room, and they were even better than the house they had lived in before his disappearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to buy houses like these with just $300,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they were choosing a house, they came across a problem from an unexpected place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoong. I don\u2019t like this house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The kindergarten had ended, so Sooah had come to join in their search for a house. However, she acted like a petulant kid as she threw a tantrum at every house they visited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you like this house, Sooah?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can\u2019t have a dog in this house. Mom promised me. If we move to a new house, she\u2019ll let me have a dog.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-muh. This kid.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">About a half a year ago, Sooah wanted a dog. However, their residence was too small to have a dog, so Lee-soogyong had promised she would get Sooah one the next time they moved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A long time had passed yet Sooah remembered it. When she looked at Sooah, she had on an obstinate face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought Sooah\u2019s antics were cute, so he let out a delighted laugh. Then he spoke to the real estate agent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess an apartment is out of the question. Can we only look at the houses?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. However, the price is a little\u2026Hahah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let\u2019s see it first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the couple houses on the market, they were able to find a house where everyone liked it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh wow! This house is great\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah jumped around in joy. It was a 2 story house with a small backyard. After the Sadahng station\u2019s Dungeon Break, a new rural housing development had formed on the newly available land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the monsters rampaged, many apartments had collapsed. So it was common place to prefer a single home near the stations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll buy this house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin made a straightforward decision, but the real estate agent had a difficult expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis house was put on the market for a quick sale, so it is priced below the market price. However, it still costs $603,000. The price difference between what you had specified is quite large\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I\u2019ll sign the contract.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let us return to the office.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The real estate agent called the owner, so they would be able to meet each other at the the office. Woojin gave a call to Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Sunggoo. I\u2019m trying to buy a house, but I\u2019m a little bit short. Lend me some money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The worst sin is taking back something after you gave it to the other person\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Well, hyung-nim. I was about to buy something, and I\u2019m about to sign a contract\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t want to lend me the money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[No. It would be my honor to be able to lend my money to hyung-nim.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen we complete the next Dungeon, I\u2019ll pay it back with interest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Thank you. Hyung-nim.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to solve the problem of the money shortage cleanly. Woojin headed towards the real agent\u2019s office.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

If she wanted to go somewhere, her two legs were good enough to get her there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was a doctor of psychology. She had always believed in the will of a person. However, she had become a fervent believer of the goddess now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoly Maiden. The guild master is here for a visit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Understood.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she heard Hamilton\u2019s polite words, Melody spoke as she got up from her knees. She still borrowed her goddess\u2019 voice to communicate with others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a person didn\u2019t accept and believe the goddess Aria, one couldn\u2019t communicate or receive miracles from Melody. One wouldn\u2019t be able to receive her blessing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody gently smiled as she looked at Hamilton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[In the near future, the goddess\u2019 blessing will be with you.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, good heavens. Thank you very much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hamilton\u2019s body shook. She followed behind Melody with a deeply moved expression on her face. She healed those fallen in despair. The members of the Aria church couldn\u2019t be more proud of being a believer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were many people who wanted to be saved. When a real god appeared, people gathered like clouds. They wanted to help in forming this \u2018power\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody headed towards the reception room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody, the Holy Maiden of goddess Aria from Alphen, was surprised by the civilization and the items they possessed. She needed time to get used to this place, and she also needed the time to get ready.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Titan guild was actively supporting her. In return, she shared her holy powers, and she also shared her foresight with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Melody arrived at the reception room, Titan guild master Deaon and his secretary got up from their seats.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease observe good manners towards the Holy Maiden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Hamilton spoke, Deacon approached Melody then he got on one knee. When Melody raised her hand, Deacon kissed the back of her hand. The blonde secretary also did the same gesture. Melody only smiled after this gesture was finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You were looking for me?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her words were heard by Deacon and the secretary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether they were or weren\u2019t part of the Aria church, it was hard not to believe in the existence of the goddess Aria when miracles were performed in front of their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I have to speak to you about the Aria\u2019s Holy Knight Order.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Have you thought about it?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the haughty way she asked her question, there was an excitement in her voice. There was even a smile forming on her haughty face as she anticipated with much pleasure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll help you assemble Holy Knight Order including letting those within the guild volunteer to join it. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The goddess will be happy.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There weren\u2019t even a hint of thankfulness in her words. She said it in a way as if she expected such deeds to be done in the goddess\u2019 name.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon didn\u2019t like that fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t part of the Aria church, yet she was trying to make him into a servant, who works for the goddess Aria. He wasn\u2019t sure if this was Melody\u2019s doing or if it really was the will of the goddess she worshiped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was going to concede something, then he expected a compensation in return.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Trahnet\u2019s army will re-invade Welshire/Western Station in 3 days.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At her words, Deacon immediately glanced towards his secretary. The secretary left the reception room then she contacted the Western branch of the Titan guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is something I am curious about, Melody.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She stood there with a haughty expression on her face. Hamilton, who was by her side, scolded Deacon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou need to treat the Holy Maiden as if you are dealing with the goddess Aria. Mind your manners\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon sighed inside then he spoke again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have something I want to ask you, Holy Maiden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Speak.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you trying to achieve through the Holy Knight Order?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is to protect those who follow Aria.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was already being done by the Titan guild. Furthermore, wasn\u2019t the police of United States also protecting the people?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m talking about your true purpose.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I cannot lie.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At her words, Deacon changed his tactic. If she can only speak the truth, then eventually she will answer his question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you planning to do after you protect the church?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Titan won\u2019t actively assemble the Holy Knight Order unless I know that piece of information. If you tell me, I\u2019ll be able to help you more readily.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody paused when she heard Deacon\u2019s words. Her always peaceful expression didn\u2019t change, and her silence also didn\u2019t last long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I want to protect earth then I want to retake my homeland. I will wage a Holy war.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour homeland?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Alphen. I will save the children of Aria, who are being tormented there.The Holy church will be sent out to protect earth.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he grappled over a thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the Holy Maiden\u2019s foresight, the Titan guild had been able to sharply increase the number of high ranked Dungeons they possessed. The bloodstones and Artifacts that came out of these Dungeons increased the power of the Titan guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the Titans, Melody\u2019s existence was akin to a goose that laid the gold eggs. It really wouldn\u2019t burden the guild to make her a Holy Knight Order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Deacon worried the risk that came with the incredible amount of profit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sweet chocolate can bring on obesity. He worried this sweet profit might brink some risks in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The high rank Dugeons aren\u2019t the end. It is only a stepping stone.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already heard those words from her several times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[There invasion hasn\u2019t even started yet.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this wasn\u2019t the invasion then what\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon thought maybe he might have to share this sweet fruit with the other guilds, and maybe even with the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sat in a plain filled with the wreck of broken golems. By his side, Bibi and Dolsae was leisurely playing around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s strength and agility was increased by the Reinforcement Stones, so he was elated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-haha, hyung-nim. I think I\u2019ve become stronger. Look over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s bloodstone extraction was faster than before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Sunggoo with a somewhat serious expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The use of bloodstones was gaining steam. The Roused worked to decrease the Dungeon Breaks, but the number of Breaks were increasing little by little.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet\u2019s subordinates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Let\u2019s say the earth is still short on mana. The lack of energy won\u2019t allow the materialization of these beings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they will be coming here someday.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin felt that the day wasn\u2019t too far off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet\u2019s 72 Commanders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He called them subordinates, but the commanders were Summoners with a lot of monsters underneath their control. Each one of them were dangerous, and there were a lot of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If all of them showed up on earth at once, then will he be able to block all of them?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s impossible.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On Alphen, it hadn\u2019t only been Woojin. There were several other races, and he even had an alliance with the humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These numerous forces had attacked Trahnet at the same time, but all they managed to do was maintain a tenuous balance of power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wooin\u2019s territory, Alandal, was only a small part of the overall picture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he excluded his Undead Army, Woojin only had tens of thousands of followers. He was only one part of the counter weight system.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Woojin didn\u2019t have his tens of thousands of his Undead Army. He had 4 followers, and only Hong-sunggoo was a Roused..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop excavating the bloodstone, and come over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo hurried over. He was drenched in sweat, but he was happy since his stamina, and agility had increased. He was feeling the joy of seeing his improvement and development for himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you call me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This guy was innocent and kind. This is why he liked Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat Roused Rank do the the directors normally possess?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are all around Rank B.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe vice presidents?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey should be around Rank A.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The vice presidents were of the 6th Circle, and the Directors were of the 5th Circle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By looking at how the other organization were structured, there seemed to be a very small number of people in the 6th Circle. There were a good number of 5th Circle, but their power was lousy in Woojin\u2019s standard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he was comparing it to the standard of Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, the quality of the earth\u2019s fighting power will be increasing soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the mana becomes more plentiful, it\u2019ll speed up the appearance of the 7th and 8th Circle Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was whether if he could trust his back to these people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Will he be able to entrust his back to the Roused like Lee-yunhwee?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their souls were pulsating with a rotten and foul stench.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed people around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed people with exceptional abilitues\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you want to be the vice president?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m askign if you want to become a 6th Circle\u2026do you want to train to become a Rank A Roused? \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo opened his eyes wide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What had been Sunggoo\u2019s initial goal? It was to develop into a high ranked Roused. He had wanted to join a big guild, since they had a support system.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to do it. I\u2019ll do it no matter what.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually the innocent guys were the ones who wanted to reach for something higher. That greed could be qualified to be labeled as a fervent desire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those with aspirations had the patience to endure the pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven though it\u2019ll be arduous?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t care. I will do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will do it with my life on the line.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned when he saw Sunggoo\u2019s eyes burning with passion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Where is this? Who am I?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sweat was running down like rain from Sunggoo. Still, he didn\u2019t want to lose his concentration, so he waited in a state of tension. If he lost his concentration even for a moment, then his life would be in danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee kee kee kee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a hair raising shriek, the Skeleton soldier pushed aside the brush. It aimed its bone knife at Sunggoo\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a joke. If he was hit, then he was dead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While taking short breaths, Sunggoo rolled on the ground. He aimed the hand with the fireball towards the Skelton Soldier\u2019s right temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His fireball ability was much stronger than before, but it wasn\u2019t enough to kill a Skeleton Soldier with a single hit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The head of the Skeleton Soldier was blackened, and it ruthlessly aimed for Sunggoo\u2019s neck with the bone knife.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo rolled forward to avoid the blow, then he approached the Skeleton Soldier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one blow wasn\u2019t enough then he would use two blows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s right hand was a handspan away from the Skeleton Soldier\u2019s helmet when a fireball erupted from his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fireball ignited and the skull of the Skeleton Soldier disintegrated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-kee-keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even before he could be happy, another Skeleton Soldier appeared. Sunggoo shouted with a grave expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk, huk. Hyung-nim. Can\u2019t we take a break?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-kee-keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of answering him, two more Skeleton Soldiers appeared as they pushed aside the thicket. Sunggoo swallowed his saliva when he saw this. He was barely able to face two of them yet Woojin already wants him to face three\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed hyung-nim was overestimating him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Sunggoo felt dismal, he started to focus his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was watching every move Sunggoo made from atop a tree. He was using the Skills, \u2018 Observation\u2019, \u2018Warrior\u2019s Sense\u2019, and \u2018Information Analysis\u2019. He fully mobilized all these Skills to observe Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He fears and admires you. He likes you as he hates you.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Class : Combat Magician</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ability : Fireball, Crisis Detection Ability</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pushed Sunggoo hard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This resulted in Sunggoo gaining 3 levels before the day was over. Moreover, he gained the Crisis Detection Ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked through the catalogue of skills Sunggoo will be learning. There was only a limited selection of Skill Books. Sunggoo won\u2019t be able to learn the ones purchased from the Point Store. However, he had saved the skill books he obtained when he cleared the Dungeons. He\u2019ll let Sunggoo learn some suitable Skill Books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There are things he can learn and there are things he can\u2019t learn.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Skill books didn\u2019t have a universal compatibility. Even if magic was inserted, the Skill Book may not react. Woojin guessed the different Classes limited one from learning certain skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used Observation and Information Analysis to find out Sunggoo\u2019s class. This was a big piece of information. Woojin started picking out several Skill Book Sunggoo could learn. His level was too low to learn some of them. He would be able to learn two Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk, huk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Woojin was distracted, Sunggoo had already defeated the 3 Skeleton Soldiers, and he was trying to catch his breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People will show the full extent of their ability in extreme situations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin raised his magic to make 4 nearby corpses into Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goblin corpses were strewn all over the surrounding. Time flowed four time slower in here, and Sunggoo\u2019s growth was astonishing to see.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

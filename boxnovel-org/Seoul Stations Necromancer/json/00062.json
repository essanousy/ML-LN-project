Thanks and be safe out there tonight.)</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pointless waiting filled Woojin with anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Who is this pig?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was Woojin\u2019s first impression after seeing Kim-jongun, who was the successor of Kim-jongil. The young dictator had a weird hair style, and he pushed his hand out towards Woojin, who was younger than him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNice to meet you, comrade. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. Nice to meet you.\u201d (TLN: Lost in translation. He is talking as an equal. Informal.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin shook hands face to face with Kim-jungun, the North Korean officials, who showed up with him, frowned in anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cComrade. He is the chairman. Be careful with your words..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his words, Woojin raised his hand to cover his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNice to meet you, Jungun-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun, who was directly involved, froze. The North Korean officials, who came with him, and Che-haesol, who came with Woojin, also froze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah, it was a mistake. This was a mistake.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol was regretting everything. Woojin hadn\u2019t cared about the recording cameras when he slapped Hwarang\u2019s guild master\u2019s cheeks. She hadn\u2019t prepared for such a situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was in the wrong in thinking he would show some manners towards North Korea\u2019s supreme commander.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, she wasn\u2019t in the wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had assumed such matters would be dealt with common sense. A normal person would have been careful all on one\u2019s own. Che-haesol\u2019s only fault was forgetting Woojin was a human, who would go past the boundaries set by a normal person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The faces of the officials from the North Korean Army was filled with anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou son of a bitch. Where do think this is? How dare you play with us??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of being cowed by their agitation, Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He said to cover it, so Woojin covered his mouth. (TLN:This is something that was lost in translation. The word in question has two meanings. First definition is to pick and choose carefully. The second definition is to cover/hide something.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why was he angry?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin taunted the official with an amused expression on his face. Kim-jungun, who was looking on, laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-hat. As expected, he is very heroic. Please sit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin sat in his seat, he spoke in a blunt manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s just talk about business. I want to go into the Dungeon right now..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The North Korean officials bristled in their seat at Woojin\u2019s terse words. If they were able to, they would have immediately slapped Woojin\u2019s face. The reporters from the foreign press continued to press the shutter to their cameras.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. You are very straightforward. As expected, you sound like South Korea\u2019s best veteran warrior. Huh-hut.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun laughed heroically at Woojin\u2019s rudeness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the first place, Woojin didn\u2019t have much to negotiate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A day after he clears the Dungeon, he\u2019ll be able to raid the Dungeon for 15 days. He had all the rights to the items found in the Dungeon during this time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just wanted a definite answer agreeing to those terms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you end this properly, then I\u2019 will keep my promise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to wait any more. I\u2019ll go right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Let us take one picture before you go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Kim-jungun stood in front of the reporters, and they took pictures. At Kim-jungun\u2019s orders, the reporters from North Korea took numerous pictures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cComrade. I\u2019ll wish for your safe return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he worried about Woojin? Or maybe he wanted Woojin to come back alive, which would mean he had been able to prevent the Dungeon Break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow I\u2019ve heard everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The meeting ended before 30 minutes could pass. The time it took to take the picture actually lasted half of the meeting. The actual meeting ended way too fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol had been ill at ease more than anyone else in the room. She was sitting with sweat coming down her ghastly face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally. I thought I would die from my heart being squeezed. This place is Pyongyang. Mr. Woojin should be a little bit more careful with your words..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned at Haesol\u2019s request, and he patted her on the shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you just see me being careful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll be heading out first. I\u2019ll see you in a couple days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll pray for your safe return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin waved his hand as he strode towards the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were no portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The North Korean Roused, who attempted the Dungeon, chose death over using a portal to escape. He didn\u2019t know if someone made them do that or it was on their own volition, but it meant that there weren\u2019t any information on this Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHooo. Really\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol shook her head. At the very least, his confidence was the best in the world. He was outspoken even in North Korea where there was an unreasonable authoritarian regime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Woojin entered the Dungeon, the barrier formed in front of the entrance to the Gwangmyung Station. He had 8 days until the Dungeon Break. If he didn\u2019t come back out then it would be impossible to mount another attempt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">North Korea had tried to gather the Roused of the world in the beginning, but no team accepted North Korea\u2019s offer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun watched Woojin enter the station from a different location from Che-haesol. He had a satisfied smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWasn\u2019t he quite straightforward?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt would be great if one Roused like him would show up from within my people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is quite unfortunate. I had heard all heroes were lustful, so we readied a lot of beautiful women. It seems we won\u2019t be able to use them against him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Kim-junun\u2019s word, the official carefully asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes chairman think that man will be able to succeed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019ll succeed. He can do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun\u2019s eyes watched Woojin disappear into the Dungeon. His eyes and voice indicated he was sure Woojin would succeed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Break a leg.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun gave a cautious support for Woojin, and his face held a hint of envy. How great would it be if an extraordinary hero like him existed among his people??</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, this is so annoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to enter the Dungeon from the start instead of using the Portal. He\u2019ll have to defeat the monsters in the outer Dungeon first. It was problematic since North Korea\u2019s Subway Station was very deep underground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The escalators wasn\u2019t working. He had to descend using the stairs, and the monsters kept rushing up towards him. It delayed his progress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he defeated all the monsters, he added more souls to his leveled up Spirit Armor. After he subjugated the souls, he passed through the portal that formed near the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jeeeeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The space distorted. The scene that spread in front of his eyes made Woojin feel a sense of danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The trees and the land was dead. The ruins were covered with viscous moss-like substances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t this a colony?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These weren\u2019t beings from Alphen. It seems Trahnent\u2019s main force had shown up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKae-rook. Kae-rook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a bizarre sound, a fat praying mantis looking monster showed itself from atop the mountain ridge. It was about 1 meter tall, and it was around 1.5 meter in length. Its front appendages were as sharp as swords. They were menacing weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most problematic part was several dozen of them always traveled in a group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were the most commonly seen, and the most troublesome low rank monsters under Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baejik.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since I fought a large group.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned golem Dolsae and succubus Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ah. I\u2019ve finally escaped-nyahng!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had barely convinced the disappointed Sooah, and he was able to bring Bibi along with him to work. Bibi covered her nose when she smelled the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ook. Whose colony is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet\u2019s 72 Commanders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know who this colony belong to. No, it didn\u2019t matter who it was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll get rid of everyone who steps on to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo Dolsae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWeeeeng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae absorbed the dirt in his surrounding. He made a body with the dead dirt, and a horrible stench came off of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even seeing Dolsae\u2019s large body, the Baejiks bravely ran forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle with Trahnet\u2019s fearless troops started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put Dolsae in the front. After he defeated all the Baejiks, he used the corpses as medium to summon the Skeleton Soldiers. He summoned 50 of them at once. There were only that many Baejik corpses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sticky moss-like substance covered the forests, roads, plains, mountain and the abandoned city. It was spread everywhere. Since this was a dead land, there were countless number of monsters in existence at this location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet\u2019s favorite tactic was attacking with overwhelming numbers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">More Baejiks were rushing over when they heard the sounds of battle. Woojin grinned as he heard their horrible shrieks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe aren\u2019t pushovers either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level : 50</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Name : Kahng-Woojin</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Class : Necromancer(Advanced), Warrior</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rank : Middle Rank</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Achievement : 273219</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic : 201/250 Energy : 34/60</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strength : 45 Agility : 39 Stamina : 51 Wisdom : 32</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic : 250 Energy : 60 Recovery : 42 Heal : 40</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Control : 250</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unassigned Point : 0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Reinforcement Stone Re-Absorption Delay Time</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strength : 12 Agility : 31 Stamina : 7 Wisdom : 480</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic : 27 Energy : 6 Recovery : 11 Heal : 5</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Control : 3</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had invested most of his bonus points into Control and Magic. He was increasing his Stat with the Reinforcement Stones, but as he continued to absorb the Reinforcement Stones, the delay time kept increasing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every Stat had different absorption time. In the case of a Stat like Wisdom, he was reaching a limit. He had taken a Reinforcement Stone couple days ago yet it wasn\u2019t fully absorbed yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Woojin could control 250 of his summoned beings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he blended the Skeleton Soldiers and the Skeleton Magicians, he could put forth a large troop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to maximize the power of the Skeleton Soldiers then he needed commanders. This would require the presence of Death Knights. Still, Woojin was quite good at commanding the Skeleton Soldiers himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Diversity wasn\u2019t a strong point in Woojin\u2019s troops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeh-kehk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Baejiks ran towards him, while letting out horrible shrieks. Monsters that seemed to be a hybrid between a spider and ant lifting its head was seen behind the Baejiks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Launcher.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These bastards spat thorns that was akin to tentacles. It had a long range, and its power puts a bullet to shame. They were quite troublesome to deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are also Rantoes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only one in sight right now. It was as big as an elephant, and it was surrounded by an enormous carapace. It had a high resistance to magic, and the carapace had outstanding defensive power. The Skeleton Soldier\u2019s swords, and the magic of the Skeleton Magicians wouldn\u2019t work against this opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Either a Death Knight\u2019s Dark Blade or Lich\u2019s magic could threaten this monster. Woojin couldn\u2019t summon these familiars, so he would have to used the powerful attacks of the Warrior Class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDolsae make a path for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo goo goo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae caused vibrations as he charged towards the center of the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Soldiers stood in lines as they readied to charge. In the back, the bones of the Skeleton Magicians appeared, and they raised their hands to create and maintain their magic. They readied themselves to fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo soo sook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned his Phantom Steed. He got on then he changed his Warrior\u2019s Weapon in to its Axe form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the Warrior Class skills that had be unsealed after he reached level 50.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his weapon changed into an axe, he could use \u2018Smash\u2019 and \u2018Whirl\u2019. The destructive power was increased by a notch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go, kids!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee kee keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spurred his Phantom Steed to gain some good momentum, and Dolsae caught up to him from behind. He summoned Bone Spears, and he threw them towards various locations. When the time was right, he erected Bone Walls to restrict the movements of his enemy\u2019s forces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooong, kwahjeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGguehhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As blood flew everywhere, Woojin charge between the monsters, and he cut down the Baejiks with his deadly axe. Every time he split an enemy open a new Skeleton Soldier was summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The number of Skeletons following Woojin kept increasing, but the number of Trahnet\u2019s monster gathering in this location was much larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin burst into laughter when he saw the enemies swarm towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess my level will increase by a fair amount.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet would invade earth sooner or later. He just had to get stronger quickly to oppose Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He watched his Achievement Points increase continuously, and Woojin\u2019s axe danced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*In the middle of the colony.*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin watched the bizarre creatures that wriggled together to form a shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m curious which bastard is here-nyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are all the same to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. It seems earth will start to see Trahnet\u2019s subordinates-nyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s about that time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin headed towards the center of the colony as he looked around with an indifferent gaze. If this had been allowed to be completed then one of Trahnet\u2019s commander would have shown up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even now the Baejiks and Launchers were continuously being born from the hideous hatcheries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s end this and go out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took him 12 days to wipe out the entire colony. Three days should have passed outside. It was about time for him to go out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahong. I wanted to go sight seeing in North Korea. Too bad-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned, and he marched forward the corpses of Baejiks and Launchers he had readied near the colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The level of Resurrection was still low, so the corpses had only 50% of their original abilities. However, he hadn\u2019t raised them, because of their ability to fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses latched themselves on to the headquarter and the hatcheries. When this was done, he let out all his magic at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Corpse Explosion caused a storm of blood. Woojin covered his face to block the aftermath of the Corpse Explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHooo. This brought me up two level.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During the 12 days of hunting, he had leveled up twice. He still had the 15 days he would be able to use this Dungeon, so it would be possible for him to reach level 60.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A crater formed from the effect of the explosions, and the Return Stone was floating in the middle. However, besides the green Return Stone, there was another purple gem that looked similar to a Return Stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are two Return Stones?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took the two gems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was confused, so he used his Identification magic to find out the gem\u2019s sealed information.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

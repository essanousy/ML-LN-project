What are you going to do being hurt like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon cried in sorrow. She had regained her face. However, Woojin\u2019s face\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. It didn\u2019t matter to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Woojin became a monster, she wouldn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was just thankful he came back alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she received the ring as present, Jiwon had chosen her answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was infinitely lacking compared to Woojin, but\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was ok with her\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon grabbed Woojin around the neck, then she stole his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes turned round from surprise.

He caught sight of Woo-soonghoon standing next to Jung-minchan with both his thumbs in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, it was that bastard. It was that bastard again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hweeeek.

What should he do about that whistling bastard?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon was holding Woojin tightly. He pushed her away with a thumb on her forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess you aren\u2019t afraid of anything.

She quickly separated from him. Woojin was someone the entire population of Korea was paying attention to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a famous person\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I was thoughtless\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even at that moment, the cameras of the reporters were tirelessly recording this scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She hadn\u2019t been able to control her emotions, and her eyes didn\u2019t see anything except Woojin. Now that she came to her senses she really regretted her action. Did she cause more harm than good\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon was thinking to herself, when Lee-sahngho grabbed Woojin\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wordlessly turned his head around to look behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngo\u2019s angry face came into view.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy isn\u2019t my dongsaeng coming out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dongsaeng? He was the oppa of the noisy woman, who had followed after him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhether it is the oppa or the dongsaeng, it seems both of you have a bad habit of rudely touching other\u2019s body without consent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin glared at Lee-sahngho. Lee-sahngho flinched as he took his hand off of Woojin and he took a step back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. What kind of eyes is that?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Swear words were about to automatically come out of his mouth, but there were too many people watching them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened to my dongsaeng? Maybe\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, she\u2019s dead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can this be\u2026. Her corpse? Why didn\u2019t you bring out her corpse? Isn\u2019t it reasonable to treat the dead with respect?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to treat a teammate, who had cleared the Dungeon with one, with respect. Obviously, this was a rule that had to be kept. If he hadn\u2019t fared well in the there, then his actions could be exscused. However, Woojin had come out after clearing the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe corpse\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked around his surrounding. His guild family, soldiers, reporters, Lee-sahngho and the Hwarang\u2019s family were all here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, this place isn\u2019t Alphen.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t need to make a big deal out of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe was a brave woman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe attacked an enemy she shouldn\u2019t have provoked. She died bravely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW..who did it? Which monster killed my dongsaeng?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A monster\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cImmortal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cImmortal\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin patted the shoulder of Lee-sahngho, who was quietly repeating the word like a mantra. Woojin headed back towards his Guild family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you find my phone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026 the army should be holding it for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and the Alandal guild members headed towards the command center located within the hotel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho\u2019s clenched fists shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP\u2026please calm down. There are a lot of people watching us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGather the reporters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMother fucker. Do you think I\u2019ll stay put sucking my thumb?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon Break didn\u2019t happen. Lee-yunhwee was dead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Worst.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the worst of the worst case scenario.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngo calculated inside his head. His gaze headed towards the disappearing Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat mother f\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now that he thought about it ever since that bastard appeared, it felt like Woojin was always blocking his path. He stole a 5 star Dungeon not too long ago, and now he stole the 6 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho was barely able to hold back his anger. He got in the car to avoid the eyes of other people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ri-di-ri-dingdong. Ddi-ri-di-ri-dingdong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho saw the name that accompanied the ring tone, and his stress level shot up a notch. He had to pick up the call from this number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-hooh. Fuck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a cuss words, he pressed the answer button on his hand phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, chairman. Yes\u2026 Yes. I will take those steps. Yes. I\u2019ll minimize the damage as much\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After awhile, Lee-sahngho ended his phone call, and he tried to calm his insides, which was seething with anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHooh-ooh. That fucker Kahng-woojin. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The crazy Roused had come out of nowhere. Rank A? That rank might be a joke now. The media was already labeling him as a Rank AA Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yunhwee probably helped him. However, two people had cleared a 6 star Dungeon\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe probably thinks he made it out well by himself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho chewed on his lips. Even if Woojin was some outstanding high ranked Roused, he didn\u2019t care. The society was organic and everything was intricately intertwined.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-gangchul was the number 1 Ranked Roused in Korea, but Lee-sahngho wasn\u2019t afraid of him. Kim-gangchul was powerless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one insisted on being principled when everyone was bending the rules, then it was the end of that person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Lee-sahngho was influential.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwarang was one of the 3 great guilds of Korea. He had personal connections with politicians, and people from the financial world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His dongsaeng Yunhwee hadn\u2019t like it, but Hwarang was able to grow so large, because he learned how to get on in the world. Moreover, the connections with these people had a large role in the growth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t been wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can\u2019t stand it when someone steals something from me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin dared to get in the way of his ambition?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho\u2019s eyes narrowed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLife is a battlefield. Jot-mahn-ah.\u201d (TLN: He quoted a 2009 Korean meme)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll teach Woojin a stern lesson.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI just cleared one Dungeon, so why do I have to do an interview?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll decline the interview. I\u2019ll send out a press release to the media with the information you have given me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you going to do about finding the Artifacts?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019ll return home after I find them all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll make it so that you will be able to use this hotel for a month. Director Hong, and Haemin will stay to help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess one porter and an errand boy is enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and Haemin puffed out their cheeks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yeah. What did my mother say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had been secretly worried about his mother. Every time he went into the Dungeon, he was always put on tv\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell\u2026 Please listen to my words without being too shocked, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was news about his family, so Woojin was nervous. At Woojin\u2019s query, Jung-minchan spoke with a straight face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about it yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI contacted her, and she hasn\u2019t watch the tv yet. So she doesn\u2019t know about this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s forehead furrowed. He guessed it would be better than her finding out and being worried about him. Still, somehow it gave him a odd feeling\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe said she couldn\u2019t reach president by phone. I took the liberty to tell her that you had left your hand phone in your office, and you were away on a business trip..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA\u2026are you okay with that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Of course\u2026 So, I\u2019m guessing this incident hasn\u2019t come up continuously on the news?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAfter the breaking news came out, the news channels have been showing this location on a live feed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the first time a 2 man team attempted a 6 star Dungeon, so even the foreign presses are treating this incident as newsworthy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It still felt odd\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat was my mother doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe moving date was approaching, so she was going around shopping for furniture\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother must be really excited\u2026. She didn\u2019t have any time to watch tv\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe this was for the best?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want his family to worry about useless things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I head back after picking up all the Artifacts, then wouldn\u2019t it be past the moving date?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Soonghoon and I will take care of it. President should just focus on clearing the Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, ok. Thank\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. This is naturally the job of the the Support Division. Then we\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan got up. Kim-haemin and Woo-soonghoon also got up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease carry on with your conversation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin was pushing in his chair, when he grabbed Hong-sunggoo\u2019s arm. He was sitting there being tactless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector Hong. We still haven\u2019t finished the conversation from earlier.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes? What conversation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-hamein\u2019s eyes kept moving trying to give Sunggoo a hint. However, Sunggoo obliviously looked back at him, while he drank his Cafe Mocha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha ha. Let\u2019s go first. Let\u2019s go talk over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo still hadn\u2019t picked up what Kim-haemin was trying to imply. He eventually just took Sunggoo away from the table. Woojin and Jiwon was the only one left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon\u2019s cheeks turned red for no reason at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened to your work? How were you able to come here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? That is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had come here without any plan. This was the first time she had been absent without notice during the past 4 years she worked at the company.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. She had to miss work yesterday, because of Woojin. So was this her second time doing this? She would have never done such a thing before she had met Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he looked at Jiwon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are more hopeless than you look.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was probably more hopeless than her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou like me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? The ring you gave\u2026 I thought about it for a long time and my heart\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was the result of Woo-soonghoon overdoing it. Still, that wasn\u2019t important right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis woman is asking for big trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou like to live dangerously liking a guy like me. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon wordlessly lowered her gaze. Her eyes immediately welled up, and tears started to drip down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So that\u2019s how it was. Woojin considered her a burden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was too important for a mere factory worker to covet him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Jiwon, who was crying wordlessly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her soul was clean without a speck on her soul.

The oppressive silence inside the conference hall stopped others from breathing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chal-kahk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A reporter pressed the shutter of his camera by force of habit, and the sound was unusually loud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if they were frogs coming out of hibernation, people started to move when they heard the sound. However, no one dared to open their mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo our mutual non-aggression treaty is broken?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can that be? It isn't anything like that. If I knew this place was Alandal, I would have never stepped a foot in this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was curious about one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why he had come to the US himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy goddess gave me a revelation. She wants me to guide the saviour.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. This means Aria sent you here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blasphemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Melody didn\u2019t show any signs of being angry or disgusted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't be compared to someone like her, who was able to hear a goddess' voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he was someone who had already met face to face with a god.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She bowed her head more in front of him...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026 I'm only a lowly servant. I came here as my goddess decreed\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it's all right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He already knew what she was going to say. Woojin waved his hand at her then he looked at Deacon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's have a little talk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon couldn't understand Woojin's Korean words, so his secretary gave an immediate translation from his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026mmmm. This location is unacceptable. Let's move to a different location.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Deacon started speaking to his secretary, Woojin finally had the chance to look at his surrounding. When he spotted a broadcasting camera, he walked towards it. The cameraman was taken aback, and he was besides himself when Woojin headed towards him. Woojin stood in front of him, and he asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs this being broadcasted live?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his unexpectedly sophisticated English, the shocked cameraman shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTurn it back into a live broadcast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's words flustered the cameraman even more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he turned to look at the executive from the broadcasting company, he also had a conflicted expression on his face. The content of the meeting was supposed to be kept a secret. The network made a deal with the Titan Guild to show only an edited version of the meeting at a later time. The guild had to give consent on what would be shown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt'll be like an year-end greeting. A year-end greeting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's words swayed the heart of the executive from the broadcasting company.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This man was a hero, who had saved US citizens from a terrorist attack. The executive thought he had a duty to deliver his voice to the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Americans had a large fear about terrorist attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In response to the attack, Woojin had throw his body in the way to thwart the attack, so the public interest in him was tremendous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can speak now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked straight into the camera and he grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The bastard who shot a missile at me, the bastard who plotted against me as the middle man, the bastard pulling strings from behind\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cameraman didn't know Korean, but Minchan, who had come up from behind, covered his face with his palm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">President. Please speak a little bit more nicely\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSoon, I will find and kill all of you. Wait for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Woojin ended his speech, he turned to look at the broadcasting executive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From listening to his tone and inflection, the executive could tell Woojin was giving a speech that was far from an year-end greeting. However, it was being broadcasted live, so the executive couldn't do anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cameraman turned his head, and he whispered to the executive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould I continue to film this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The footage of the Holy Maiden kneeling in front of Woojin had been recorded. As he looked over the disordered conference hall, the executive nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust record it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be unreasonable to send this through a live broadcast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This Asian man is\u2026 \u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a short amount of time, the Holy Maiden Melody became the center of attention for every American. However, this woman had knelt in front of the Asian man. No matter how anyone saw it, she had shown him the utmost respect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is going to be fun.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world will now focus their attention on the man named Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing what he had to say, Woojin walked back to the stage. In a flash, Minchan approached Woojin from behind, and he called out after Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Minchan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan looked at Woojin with a complicated gaze. Woojin had put his body in harm's way to protect him, and all the people inside the Hotel. Woojin probably didn't know if he would live or not, yet he had sacrificed himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for saving me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's fine. Follow me. I have to talk to those people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Titan Guild's guild master Deacon passed the duty of hosting the consortium to someone else. Then, he quickly disappeared towards the back with the Holy Maiden Melody. Minchan's face scrunched up when he saw the Holy Knights, who had recently begun to follow Melody.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn't you say you were friend with her?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, what? We are friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In what way?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how he saw it, he couldn't see Melody as Woojin's friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin and Minchan followed Deacon, the conference hall started to come to life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho's that Asian man?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he Ms. Melody's husband?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat kind of Holy Maiden had a husband?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou never know, since it's a different planet\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even amongst the uproar, Baek-dosong's face trembled a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSenior vice president Jung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI, I\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Please speak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems that I obtained a really interesting younger bro.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jongdo's eyes were sparkling with curiosity and excitement. Jung-chansung grabbed his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How was he interesting? Woojin was obviously a dangerous person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-chansung let out a deep sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The office of Titan Guild's Guild Master.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Deacon sat down on the seat of honor at the conference table, Melody approached him and she spoke quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should concede the seat to Alandal's Monarch\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon was momentarily panicked. Woojin, who followed behind them, waved his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it's fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sat to the right of Deacon, and Minchan naturally took a seat next to him. Melody continued to stand by Deacon's side, so he turned to look at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should also sit, Holy Maiden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI wouldn't dare\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Just sit..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026Yes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them spoke in Alphen's language, and it irritated everyone else's ears. Deacon furrowed his brows as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of relationship did these two have?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a translator, who was more proficient in Korean, arrived, Deacon's curiosity was answered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don't mind me asking, what kind of relationship do the two of you\u2026 ?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, she's a friend. A friend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon's expression indicated that he didn't believe Woojin's words at all. Melody's face paled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oh, my goddess. Why would you send me such a tribulation?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A friend of the Immortal\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her body shook from just thinking about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. We have something akin to an alliance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAn alliance?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe struck down Trahnet's army together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden didn't say anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was fudging the truth when he said that they had struck down Trahnet's forces together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had destroyed and killed anything that stepped on to Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The alliance sent an emissary to promise that they won't invade Alandal in the future, so there were little friction between them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet still went after Alandal's land, and Woojin had hunted down Trahnet's army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They fought together since they had a common enemy. However, her side hadn't closely cooperated with Woojin. So it was ambiguous to call it an alliance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone fought against Trahnet on their own, so to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's action could be characterized as hunting Trahnet. It was quite generous to say the alliance just held on. Basically, they weren't the ones being hunted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The translator passed on Deacon's words to Woojin once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know you are Korean. So how did you form a relationship with those on the Planet Alphen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was summoned there 5 years ago. I lived on Alphen for 20 years, and I have only recently returned. Are you trying to conduct a hearing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned when Deacon continued to ask questions. The nervous Holy Maiden spoke to Deacon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease, don't irritate him. You are being rude to the Monarch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The endlessly haughty and dignified Holy Maiden was a nervous wreck right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon couldn't get used to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know Woojin's identity. In his perspective, Woojin looked more like a human, and the Holy Maiden was more like a god-like figure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, he was very curious about this human named Kahng-woojin, but Deacon didn't need to get all the answered from Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed that the Holy Maiden was well acquainted with Woojin, so he would get the information from her at a later time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. Hmmmm. Why did you want to see me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When their conversation returned to the main topic, Woojin opened his inventory, then he took out an item. He placed it on top of the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary screamed, and the translator quickly turned his head away. Even Minchan scrunched up his face as he looked away. Deacon's eyes hardened, but worry started to fill his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What is the meaning behind this action?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the guild master of a large organization, his worries deepened. Surprisingly, the only one who didn't show any reaction was the Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her expression said everything that needed to be said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Alandal's Monarch brought someone's severed head.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was the extent of her thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wasn't surprised at all by his actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Woojin received Deacon's gaze, which was filled with unasked questions, he spoke in a nonchalant manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the bastard, who ambushed me yesterday. He led me into a Dungeon to kill me. I would like you to find out the identity of this man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Earth chose a different path to destruction to Trahnet... Someone on earth tried to assassinate the Monarch of Alandal...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Isn't that the absolute worst way to suicide?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, kingdoms were destroyed for using such similar methods... Several kingdoms...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if you come here to ask us, we didn't\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm not suspicious of you guys. I want you to find out this bastard's affiliation. There can't be many Rank AA Roused working as an assassin on earth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll look into it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon was going to negotiate with him, but the Holy Maiden quickly accepted the request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Titan Guild master. Thank you for all your cooperation up until now. If I'm to repay this debt, don't I have to be alive? I have to return to Alphen alive, so I can save countless number of people. Please don't agitate the Immortal any further.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden pleaded with her eyes as she looked at Deacon. He swallowed what he was about to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm going to go after the helicopter that shot the missile. I'm hoping that the helicopter didn't originate from within the US. If it is, conflict is inevitable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was not trying to foster a hostile relationship with the US government, but in the end, he didn't really care. He was sure that there were a couple of people in the government involved in the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe government is trying its best to locate the helicopter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey don't have to search any further. I already know where it is. I'll be leaving soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody, who had been standing still, suddenly stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will go with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do you want to follow me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's dissatisfactory reply, Jung-minchan stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt would be better if you work with the Titan Guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't doing this to perform a meritorious deed. He also wasn't doing this to ferret out all the terrorists. Woojin just wanted to take his revenge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan wanted to lessen the chance that any misunderstanding would happen with the US government. Titan Guild maintained a close relationship with the US government, so there was a lot of advantage in having them along.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The US was much more sensitive to terrorist acts compared to other countries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had stopped a terrorist attack from succeeding, so the US public was already treating him like a hero. Of course, it would be great if he was able to round up the terrorist at their base of operation. However, many US citizens would not like someone like Woojin carry out a hostile act inside their country, unless he was really some kind of a superhero.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be better to carry out this mission with the Titans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. When are we leaving?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-hmmm. I'll scrap together a response team. Five hours should be enough.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to ask why it would take so long, but he reminded himself that his enemies won't be running away anytime soon. Even if they did run away, it wasn't a problem. He had sent both Bibi and Ggaebi to keep surveillance on them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen, shall we talk a little bit about your homeland?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was curious as to how the situation on Alphen changed after he left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a saying that said if one meets a person from the same country in a foreign land, then it would feel like the other person was from your homeland. She thought the saying was spot on. Still, the Holy Maiden couldn't get used to the unusually friendly actions of the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat would you like to know\u2026 ?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's Kyle doing these days?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHero struggled with the injury he sustained 3 years ago. About a year ago, he passed away while fighting one of Trahnet's commanders.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, so that fellow died. That friend did have a bum leg.. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes. The leg that bothered him was the leg he shattered, while fighting a Necromancer named Immortal. Even when holy water and the god's blessing was applied in bulk, his injury never healed completely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about the wrinkly old man inside the forest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Gread Elder of the Elf is\u2026 \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody's words faded, and she looked at Woojin with trembling eyes\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he really asking, because he doesn't know?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did you stop speaking?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha. He really is asking because he doesn't know.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So how should she phrase this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018You killed him when you stole the World Branch\u2026 \u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how hard she thought about it, she couldn't come up with an answer that wouldn't ruin the Immortal's mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oh, my goddess. How can you give such an ordeal\u2026 \u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tears started to well in the Holy Maiden's eyes.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

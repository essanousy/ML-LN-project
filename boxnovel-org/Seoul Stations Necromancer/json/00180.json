One could see occasional rhino monsters that were larger than elephants.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected of something so large, a massive amount of luggage was hanging off their enormous body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On an exceptionally large rhino, a platform made out of wood was strapped onto the back of the monster. \u00a0An unusually handsome man, who looked out of place in this monster army, was lying on top of this platform.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oong, koo-ooh-oong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time the rhinoceros monster took a step, the wooden platform rolled as if it was on a large wave. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man vacantly looked up into the sky as he lay there. There was no guardrails to the platform, yet no one was worried about him falling off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wore his long black hair loose, and he had thin lips. \u00a0He was the 36th Throne Unon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was using his two hands as a pillow, and he had his legs intertwined. \u00a0If it wasn't for the sight around him, he looked like a farmer taking a break during a picnic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The small dot in the blue sky was getting larger, and something was approaching him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Harpy Queen Shirao. \u00a0She had black wings, and a sharp face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she dropped out from the sky, she gripped the edge of the platform with her bird's feet. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shirao?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This isn't the time to be lounging around, Unon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon discreetly opened his eyes to look at Shirao, then he closed his eyes again. \u00a0As if she was frustrated, the Harpy Queen puffed out her cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Those bastards cut off the road again, Unon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don't have to be in such a hurry. \u00a0They'll all die eventually.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Immortal is getting closer by the minute!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon unfurled the arms he was using as a pillow, and he sat up. The platform was made from ash trees. \u00a0It was his longtime hobby to smell the fragrance of the wood as he lie on top of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We'll have to fight that bastard eventually.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What if he goes back to earth?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't think he'll be able to. \u00a0He still doesn't have the key.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm. \u00a0How can you be so sure?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If he had it, it wouldn't take him this long to get here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The effect of the Thrash's set items were huge. \u00a0It was able to amplify the power of Undead army by several magnitudes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Immortal had Thrash\u2019s set, the Dimensional lords had no choice, but to give up a huge part of Alphen to the Immortal's army. \u00a0This was how powerful the effects of the items were.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if the Dimensional lords were focusing their attacks on him, the Immortal would have halted their progress already if he had those Items. \u00a0It was evidence that the Immortal haven't acquired all his qualifications yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren't you worried, Unon?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course, I'm worried.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I would have never guess that he was a human from earth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon smirked at Shirao's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"True.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had known the Immortal was from earth, he would have eliminated the Immortal immediately. \u00a0Many Necromancers pined for Thrash's set, and Unon had thought the Immortal was one of those Necromancers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he originated from Alphen, there was no way he could obtain the most important piece of the set. \u00a0He wouldn't be able to acquire the Executioner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You lived for a very long time, so you probably know about it. \u00a0Weren't you there when Thrash was sealed?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. \u00a0I wasn't alive back then.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess it happened in the far distant past.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Harpy Queen Shirao had already folded her wings, and she modestly sat on one side of the platform.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You aren\u2019t going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My heart has calmed down after talking with you, Unon. \u00a0Anyways, we just have to prevent the Immortal from getting back to earth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Immortal died, he would be revived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was now a Dimensional lord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The immortality was a rule and a promise that had to be kept for anyone that earned the Dimensional Fragments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if the Immortal had slyly entrenched himself by exploiting a crack in the system, and he was trying to pull a fast one on them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they couldn't eliminate him, they had to deny him the opportunity of reaching his goal. \u00a0Alphen would become that bastard's jail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So when are you going to earth, Unon?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Earth has only one code. \u00a0I'm not interested.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So you want to keep staying on Alphen?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn't too bad here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alphen still had four Codes left. \u00a0Only one Dimensional lord was able to earn the Code for this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only a single great lord of the 72 Thrones were able to get his hands on a Master Code of Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm. \u00a0Should I stay here with you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don't have to.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmph. \u00a0Even you are giving up on earth, so how will I be able to compete over there? \u00a0Moreover, that places hasn't gone through a proper synchronization yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The planet hadn't gone through synchronization yet. \u00a0Even if they did find the Code, it would be useless since the earth hadn't flowered yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, you can stay if you want to.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmph.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shirao let out a sullen sound at Unon's apathetic words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let me ask you this, Unon. \u00a0Do you think he'll really be able to acquire Thrash's Executioner?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is impossible.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her eyes turned round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why did they have to work so hard to kill him? \u00a0They even had to waste a lot of Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shirao saw Unon's most serious expression, since she started this conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Still, it is dangerous. \u00a0We have to keep Thrash asleep.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Unon....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We can never let the god of Destruction to appear once again.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She could feel the fear hidden beneath the surface, and she unconsciously shuddered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The great lord Unon, who had 36 Master Codes, was speaking this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like the story of old. \u00a0She felt the terror of the god of Destruction indirectly through him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Block them! \u00a0Aim for their eyes!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Saurus Colony was on fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldiers were were fighting a desperate battle, but the enemies were being pushed towards them like a wave. \u00a0Siege equipments weren't even necessary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses piled up like a mountain, and it acted like a ladder. \u00a0None of the defenders could stop the enemies from coming over the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before a proper siege could even take place, several hundred defenders were already killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This won't work.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The outer walls are at its limit. \u00a0We have to retreat to the inner walls.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their enemies were using their overwhelming numbers to send continuous waves of attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If we retreat to the inner castle walls, we'll be completely cut-off. \u00a0It isn't too late. \u00a0Let us charge through their lines. \u00a0We have to get away.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The opinions on what to do was split, so Tauric searched for Do-jaemin. \u00a0He was the only one, who was able to contact Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is almost here. \u00a0Please wait a little bit more...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...he has already exceeded his promise by two days.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. \u00a0We can no longer trust his words.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham and several other heroes revealed their foul mood. \u00a0They had trusted Kahng-woojin's word without a hint of doubt, and they had been waiting as they prepared for the defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, two days had passed since the promised time. \u00a0The enemies were much stronger than they had expected, and a lot of people had already died. \u00a0This was their lives on the line, so they were showing resentment now. \u00a0It was inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...but he really is almost here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin didn't have anything else he could say. \u00a0Woojin had promised that he'll be back in a week, but two days had already past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Sunggoo's remarkable activities were able to delay the army's progress by over a day. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enemies had started their attack only five hours ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In just five hours time, the outer castle walls were practically in ruins. \u00a0Moreover, the Dimensional lords still hadn't attacked in earnest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, there was no guarantee that they'll be able to last for a day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, Skia's Monk! \u00a0If we don't run away now, we'll all die.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric put on a pained expression at Archmage Graham's words. \u00a0He would be committing several hundred to several thousand lives to this decision. \u00a0Of course, he felt afraid and tormented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a flame erupted from the middle of the mountain where the research facility was located at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The burst of flame rose into the air like fireworks, and it exploded. \u00a0Rain of sharp fire started to drop to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-shoo-shoo-shoohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if several thousand archers were shooting fire arrows. \u00a0When the magic fell into the enemies, the effect was incredible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric gritted his teeth as he watched the sight in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn't for the Fire Spirit King from earth, they wouldn't have been able to resist against the enemy's advance. \u00a0They wouldn't even have a fighting chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They probably would have pushed the fight into the future, and they would have run away...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric's lips opened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even if we do manage to get away, we won't have any future. \u00a0If we break right now, we'll just be walking down the road towards destruction.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some will run, and some will stay to fight... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he no longer had full control over his men.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let us abandon the outer walls, and we should retreat towards the inner walls. \u00a0Let us focus on defense.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several people complained about Tauric's words, but they didn\u2019t argue against him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Graham. \u00a0I want you to put up a barrier, so our forces can retreat.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Understood.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Archmage Graham's magic was a necessity. \u00a0If not for him, they would have fallen in the initial moments of the battle as the dragonfly-like monsters had attacked from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric turned to look at Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Count. \u00a0you should inform all the heroes about the retreat.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin waved his hand once. \u00a0A flock of bats exited from his ripped sleeves, and they flew in all directions to deliver the news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let us make our last stand at the research facility and the barrier around the Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the barrier erected by the World Tree, and the research facility had the magic amplifier, which Sunggoo was using. \u00a0They'll be able to hold out for a little longer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since this was a fight they couldn't win, the only important thing right now was for Kahng-woojin to return before their losses got too big.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Please hurry up.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin sent his desperate desire towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Soul Spears, which had extended out from Woojin's body, was flying all over the place as they pierced through the bodies of the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took only a flash for the enemies to become corpses, and the corpses exploded in a chain reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an endless chain of Corpse Explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The advance of the Immortal was followed by blood, pieces of bodies, screams, and the crazed laughter of the Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh my goddess...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody trailed behind him, and she witnessed live the Immortal that had been a fixed concept in the minds of the Coalition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was cruel, domineering, and inexorably strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His army expressed their instinctual and unfettered anger towards the living beings. \u00a0It even made her feel sympathy towards the monsters being slaughtered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As she continued to follow behind him, she felt a sense of distance and dissonance with the Kahng-woojin she had recently come to know. \u00a0She wasn't confident as to whether she would be able to speak naturally with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The advance, which had been filled with poison, corpses and the cries of the souls, came to a stop. \u00a0They were only a day ride from the Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were monsters lined up in front of them, and there was a red-haired man standing in the front.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Koo-koo-koohk. \u00a0Who is this? \u00a0Im. mort. al! \u00a0The king of the dead!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He made invidious remarks as she slowly walked towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was thankful, since this being came to him on his own. \u00a0Woojin wouldn't be satisfied even if this being was killed over and over again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Celrak.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet's 27th Throne.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This bastard has been successful in clearing his Dungeon two days ago. \u00a0Kiba wasn't able to stop him from clearing Raht's Temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak let out a mocking smile as he looked at Woojin's angry face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you so angry? Isn't it your fault for leaving behind your Domain?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a better understanding now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never understood why the Dimensional lords rarely exited their Dungeons. \u00a0He understood why the exploration and hunt of the surrounding was done by the Domain residents and the forces of the Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true on a planet where one didn't have the Code. \u00a0One couldn't use the Return Portal, so one had to stay near one's Dimensional Domain to protect one's Dungeons and Colonies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Or one could put several trusted defenders to defend the location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since Kiba had fallen, it seemed he had consumed all of Alandal's Points in its defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't get you. \u00a0Why do you search for the whereabouts of the forgotten god of Destruction? Don't you have the means to become a god? \u00a0It is eternal life.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Celrak's words, Woojin changed the Warrior's Weapon into its axe form. \u00a0He wanted to split open Celrak's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak grinned at Woojin's murderous intent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems you really want to protect your home planet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn't that obvious?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are many ways to protect it. \u00a0You could become the god of your home planet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"On the day when my home planet was synchronized, the first thing I did was to kill my god. \u00a0Then I became the god of my home planet. \u00a0Koo-koohk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should forget about the god of destruction. \u00a0Just become a god. \u00a0This is the fastest way to protect one's home planet. \u00a0Those on my home planet are living very rich lives. \u00a0Sacrifice is only momentary, but peace is eternal.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My words won't fill your ears right now, but you should take my advice to heart. \u00a0There will come a time when you'll thank me someday.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let go of the rigidity he had expressed in his initial greeting. \u00a0He let out a broad smile.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

It really is Woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother grabbed on to him, then she cried for a long time. She had thought he had died, yet Woojin had come back alive after 5 years. She couldn\u2019t tell if this was a dream or reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be too long to explain it here. Anyways, where\u2019s the other family members? I went back home, and it was gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah is at her preschool. You father\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother started to speak, but she started to to cry again. He felt something was amiss, so his pounding heart turned cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go home and talk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Let\u2019s do that. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if his mother would disappear, Woojin held both her hands tightly as they left the staff room. While they rode the bus, his mother spoke despondently about their situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His father had been caught up in the Dungeon Shock as he left for work. As with the other tens of thousands of people riding the subway, he had passed away. They couldn\u2019t even find his corpse. His mother had lived on alone as she took care of Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After losing the head of the household, her son was also missing. The only reason why his mother was able to withstand everything was because of young Sooah. They hadn\u2019t been very wealthy in the past, and his mother had to take care of the whole household by herself. He could feel the difficulties she had gone through.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only asset they had was the apartment, but the price became dirt cheap after the Dungeon Shock. Moreover, his mother wasn\u2019t qualified for many of the jobs, since she had only been a housewife.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To make matters worse, Sooah became ill, so the household\u2019s wealth decreased rapidly. It was a situation where everyday was painful. She had struggled to hold on for the past 5 years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s fine since you are alive. Don\u2019 worry too much about it. I thought you had taken the subway.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother was thankful just from the fact that he was alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bus traveled for an hour before they approached the neighborhood where he used to live. They moved towards a block away from the Hammer Guild\u2019s headquarters, and they arrived at a run down neighborhood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust in case you or your father might come back we moved to a close location.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one disappeared during the Dungeon Shock, it basically meant the person was dead. However, his mother hadn\u2019t lost hope. Her son had returned after 5 years, so she felt rewarded by her efforts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother lead him through winding alleyways, then she headed toward a specific shack. It was a very small one room, and it was smaller than Jaemin\u2019s house. Moreover, there were a lot of luggage stacked inside, so it made the room look smaller.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStay right here. I\u2019ll go to the preschool, and I\u2019ll bring Sooah back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother left Woojin by himself inside the room, and she left the house. Woojin looked around the small room filled with boxes, then he opened one of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The box held none other than his old belongings. He opened the other boxes, and it was all the same. It contained his father\u2019s clothes and his clothes. There were even toys he had played with when he was little.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had kept all the belongings they had possessed when they lived in the apartment 5 years ago. She had forced it all inside this one room, so it wasn\u2019t inevitable for the house to become cramped. He could guess the reason why his mother couldn\u2019t throw away their belongings, and his heart felt like it was going to break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon, his mother returned home with Sooah holding her hand. Her wide eyed face looked up at Woojin. Her complexion looked pale, but her white skin just made her look cuter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 2 year old baby he remembered in his memories had turned into a 7 year old cute child.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah. This is your big brother. Greet him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBig brother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah grabbed on to the hem of her mother\u2019s clothes, then she warily looked over Woojin. Woojin made his most friendly smile as he looked down towards Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah. Could you play with your big brother for a moment? Mother will make delicious food soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Mommy doesn\u2019t have to go to the restaurant?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. It\u2019s my day off today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was only lunch, but his mother worked as if she was in a hurry. She prepared a sumptuous feast. Sooah became unusually animated when she saw the meat side dish. It seemed like she wasn\u2019t able to eat meat on a regular basis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother looked at him with contentment, so as to repay her, he ate the food with relish. After he emptied three bowls of rice, he stopped his spoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was said the act of eating food was a good way to lower the wariness in humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah seemed to have immediately adjusted to him. She called him \u2018big brother\u2019 easily, and she stuck to Woonjin\u2019s side. It was false to say she wasn\u2019t wary, but it seemed she was starved for attention. It made Woojin\u2019s heart hurt when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen Sooah plays by herself after coming home from preschool?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Mommy goes through a lot of troubles. I have to behave, and play by myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was proud of what the 7 year old said, so Woojin patted her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. You have to brush Mimi\u2019s head instead of mine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Ok.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah passed him her barbie named Mimi, then he brushed its hair with a brush as big as his finger. Woojin and Sooah played with the doll, and his mother\u2019s gaze was on them as she washed the dishes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had struggled so much in the past 5 years that it felt like she had become an old lady.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother, who was doing the dishes, picked up the phone when it rang. Then she hurried into the restroom to answer the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What\u2019s going on? Where did you go during the busy hours? Come back immediately.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cToday is a really important day. May I take a leave?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hey lady, what do you think this is? There is no taking leaves at this small restaurant. You even got out of work regularly by giving excuses that your daughter was sick. If you don\u2019t want to get fired, come in right now!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s senses were several times more sensitive compared to normal people, so it wasn\u2019t hard for him to hear the whispered conversation. Woojin roughly figured out the situation, and Woojin felt a heavy feeling. It felt as if a rock was pressing down on his chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother exited the restroom, then she quickly finished washing the dishes. Then she spoke to Woojin and Sooah with an apologetic face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah. I\u2019m sorry, but can you play a little bit with your big brother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. It\u2019s ok. I\u2019ll play with big brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though she didn\u2019t have any old memories of him, Sooah was already following after her big brother, and this made her very cute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this, Woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gave an ample laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Have a safe trip.\u201d\u2018</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his mother went out, Sooah let out the tears she had been holding back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe\u2019s always busy. Sooah is always alone. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes turned round when he saw her crying figure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Big brother is here now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCheh, I\u2019ve never seen you, so how can you be my big brother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. I\u2019m really your big brother. Don\u2019t you remember me from when you were young? I even changed your diapers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah don\u2019t wee any more!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tried to appease the grumbling Sooah, so he played with her. He had assumed his mother would return around dinner time, but she wasn\u2019t back yet. Therefore, Woojin started cooking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was used to sleeping out in the open when he was at the Planet Alphen. When he opened the refrigerator, there were several ingredients leftover from his mother\u2019s previous shopping trip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin simply fried an egg, then he shared vegetable fried rice with Sooah. His mother returned around 9 o\u2019clock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Mother is late. What did you eat for dinner? We\u2019ll have to buy you a hand phone tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother couldn\u2019t contact Woojin, so she must have felt frustrated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They laid down their bedding in the small one room, and he didn\u2019t even have space to roll over. Sooah had already fallen asleep in his mother\u2019s arms, but Woojin and his mother had a hard time going to sleep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m very glad you are back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother had already said those words multiple times as she laid down her tired body. Woojin couldn\u2019t sleep that night, and he stayed up with his eyes wide open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This isn\u2019t it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin felt a suffocating feeling as if he was buried within a fallen building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next morning everyone woke up in a flurry. Sooah had to attend preschool, and his mother prepared to go to work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWoojin-ah. Go to the borough office, and get your SSN reissued. After I get off work, we\u2019ll go shop for a hand phone. Don\u2019t go anywhere. If you are hungry then make and eat some ramen. No, if you are hungry, come to the restaurant located in the front. It is the Seungmi Restaurant located in front of the mart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When everyone left, Woojin was alone, so his mood dampened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a lot of things to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to cancel the missing persons report, then he had to be reissued a SSN at the borough office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was summoned during his 3rd year of high school, so he hadn\u2019t even graduated. He didn\u2019t want to be unemployed, so he also had to get a job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to make some money.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt pity for his busy mother, and Sooah who had to spend everyday by herself. He was the man of the house now. He had to become the pillar of this household.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to make a lot of money.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll have to study again. Moreover, he\u2019ll have to immediately get a temporary job. Woojin quickly thought of a way to make a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt like destiny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, it felt like a devil\u2019s claw drawing him in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Roused.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the three crumpled bills of 10,000 won, and he came to a decision. He opened the box with his carefully stored clothes. He wore his own clothes, then he exited the house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had received his SSN, and he had cancelled his mission persons report. He opened an account in his name at the bank, then he went into a phone store to purchase a hand phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is our hottest item, dear customer. It is very sturdy, so it is a model used by many famous Roused.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the phone salesman\u2019s recommendation, he purchased the hand phone. He entered in his mother\u2019s phone number, then he sent a message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There is a little brother that I know living close to our house. I\u2019ll stay there for now, and I\u2019ll prepare for the school qualification examination.'(TLN:basically a Korea GED)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother immediately called him when Woojin sent the message. He had to talk with her for a very long time to assuage her fears. She knew their financial situation wouldn\u2019t allow him to study, so in the end, she agreed to his proposal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. I feel bad about it, but I\u2019ll make it up later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin\u2019s house wasn\u2019t very far off from Woojin\u2019s house. It was a distance he could walk to. He had decided it was the ideal place to stay until he bought a bigger house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unfurled the folded paper, then he input Jaemin\u2019s number. He pressed the call button, and the ring back tone rang. Soon, a person picked up the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hello. This is the Dongjin Agency\u2019s Park-hweeso.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard a husky voice. He checked to see if he made an error in pressing the numbers. However, it matched the phone number on the paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hello. If you made a call, then please speak.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs this Jaemin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[No.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Click-</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying an annoyed voice, the phone call was terminated. Woojin clicked his tongue as he looked at his phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. What is this? Did he trick me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pressed firmly on his temple.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

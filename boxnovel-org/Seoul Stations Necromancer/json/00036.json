A guild wasn\u2019t some kind of a club. It wasn\u2019t something that could be made just on a whim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI probably won\u2019t be able to go outside since there are a lot of reporters out there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from them for the rest of your life. It would be better for you to get used to ignoring the attention early on, so you can get along with your life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? I thought hyung-nim didn\u2019t want to receive any attention?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI did?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a confused expression on his face. What kind of a person was Woojin at Alphen? His every movement, and whims were of great concern to everyone in the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was natural for everyone to be interested in him. This was why he didn\u2019t feel the slightest of excitement or repulsion from receiving exposure from the media.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he live the life of an average middle class citizen?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nonsense. Trahnet was digging an underground tunnel through the subway stations, and he was aiming to take over earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what if my face becomes famous? There are things you can prevent in this world, and there are things you shouldn\u2019t block.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, that is true.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally he seemed immature, but he always seems to come up with the right words for situations like like this. As hyung-nim said, they were already receiving a lot of publicity from the press.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hammer guild pressured the media, so the media hadn\u2019t released their information. Still, this caused public interest to almost explode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person was able to accidentally enter a 5 star Dungeon, but he was a monster who could solo the Dungeon. The Management Bureau admitted Woojin\u2019s Roused Rank was incorrect, and they said his Rank would be newly measured.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll go do some research.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTake care of everything before I have join the army.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I go to the army, aren\u2019t you the one who is lose out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, a high ranked Roused like Woojin would most assuredly receive preferential treatment\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was booting up his computer when Woojin\u2019s hand phone rang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHello?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes, Mr. Wooijn.

Why do they like me so much?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*4th Support Team. Team Leader Room.*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door opened in a rough manner, and Jung-minchan\u2019s face automatically knotted into a frown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich bastard is being so rude\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader! We did it. We did it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin ran in, and his face was dripping with happiness. It was as if Korea had won the World Cup.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His overwhelming attitude made Minchan drop the etiquette between a superior officer and his worker. Moreover, he also stopped using the deeply ingrained Korean cultural etiquette between a senior and a junior to start the conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2026what did you just say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Woojin wants to meet us. Mr. Woojin want to meet us about guild business!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan suddenly stood up from his seat. His butt tipped over his chair, but he didn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou got another one, team leader!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha, haha-haht!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had received a lot of stress recently, but could there be a more happier event? Jung-minchan quickly wore his jacket, then he spoke to Haemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s get ready to meet him immediately. I\u2019ll go make my report to the president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. Haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin started to run with elation. Minchan also couldn\u2019t hold back his joy as he headed toward the president\u2019s office. The female secretary pressed the intercom button when Minchan arrived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. Fourth Support Team leader is here for a visit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Aigo. Please bring him in.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan\u2019s ears picked up the small sound coming from the intercom, and it made him smile. Yes. Jung-minchan isn\u2019t dead yet!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan confidently entered the president\u2019s office, and Hammer guild\u2019s president Park-sahngoh greeted him near the sofa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo, our Team leader Jung. What has happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe were contacted by Mr. Kang-woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo! What a happy occasion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh grabbed Jung-minchan\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOur team leader Jung-minchan endured a lot of hardship. Huh huh huh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm hmm. I need to settle a matter regarding Mr. Kang-woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. Didn\u2019t I entrust my full authority to team leader Jung??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe previously talked about the vice presidency seat\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. If our team leader Jung wants to give it to him, then we have to give it him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh\u2019s enthusiastic and almost burdensome support made Jung-minchan throw couple of victory uppercut inside his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. Thank you for your efforts. Thanks to team leader Jung our Hammer guild would establish our foothold as the number 1 guild in Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three great Guilds of Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">None of the Hammer, Hwarang or KH possessed 3 Rank A Roused. If they were able to make Woojin their new guild member then the Hammer guild would rise up to an unrivaled position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan looked like a treasure to Park-sahngoh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo I\u2019m going to go knowing I have your approval.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh himself showed Jung-minchan out of the president\u2019s office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. Please have a safe journey. I\u2019ll be waiting for the good news.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to return with good news.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. Hey, secretary Kim. Prepare a guild-wide company dinner!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even when Jung-minchan got on the elevator, Park-sahngoh still shook Minchan\u2019s hand with a smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the elevator door closed, Jung-minchan made a fist, and he let fly an uppercut.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoot. If it wasn\u2019t for him, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to find a Rank A like Park-jinwoo. It was all thanks to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-hem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan felt his fallen confidence recover. Did healing feel like this? He had done it once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan wasn\u2019t dead yet. He was alive and kicking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gathered the contract, required documents, and his notebook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he arrived at the 1st floor, Haemin was already on standby inside his car. Haemin looked as happy as Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Sahdahng station\u2019s cafe. Angel Angel\u2019s business room.*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Did I hear you wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was suspicious as to whether his ears were really working or not. He didn\u2019t even have the chance to take out the contract. Woojin repeated his words once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want ahjushi to come to our guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of situation was this? He couldn\u2019t\u2019 grasp what Woojin was saying, because his reply was so unexpected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen you called, it wasn\u2019t about making a contract with the Hammer guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would I go there? I want Team leader Jung and Mr. Haemin to come to my guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was surprised. Kim-haemin was also surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jungminchan groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He already had a guild. Woojin was already affiliated with a guild. This was why he refused the temptation of joining the Hammer guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Where was he from? Hwarang? KH? Or some other small guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. What\u2019s the name of Mr. Woojin\u2019s guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s the Alandal guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? Alandal? This is the first time he had heard of this name. If he didn\u2019t know about it then it must be a very small guild. Haemin was quick to pick up on the situation, so he searched for it. However, the guild didn\u2019t exist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me. The guild named Alandal doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head if Haemin\u2019s words were reasonable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Haemin and Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou two have to come\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cand make it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did someone spike his morning coffee with drugs? Why did he keep hearing bullshit? So he wants to make a new guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow much do you make currently, Mr. Haemin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour annual salary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI make a little over 50 thousand dollars\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hundred thousand dollar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf that is too little, I\u2019ll give you an additional 50 thousand dollar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin\u2019s eyes turned round, and Woojin turned to look at team leader Jung. Jung-minchan beat him to the punch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not someone who will be moved by money. No. Moreover, isn\u2019t this a little bit too absurd?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are suddenly talking about making a guild. Moreover, you want us to change employment. I am a team leader of the Hammer guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Guild was where the Roused gathered, but it was also a company. It saw similar to a talent agency. Each Roused was in a contractual relationship with the Guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The normal people entered as employees to departments like the Support division. Jung-minchan was an old hand in the guild. He had joined the Hammer Guild late, but he had enough ability to climb up to the rank of Team leader.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So how could he change guild based solely on money? If he took the long term view of his future, it would leave a huge dent in his career.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGuild Alandal. Why don\u2019t you become one of the founding members?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan\u2019s eyes shook. The word, \u2018founding member\u2019, shook his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m trying to make a guild, but I know nothing. Why don\u2019t ahjushi come over and help a little bit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll just go to Pyongyang.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What did him changing his employment have to do with going to Pyongyang?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they headed back to the Hammer guild, Haemin and Minchan didn\u2019t speak inside the car. Angel Angel was next to an intersection near the Sahdahng station, so the Hammer guild was a walking distance away. Before they could blink their eyes, they had arrived in the parking lot, and the silence didn\u2019t last too long afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader. I\u2019m going to jump ship.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. To put it bluntly, isn\u2019t it great what he is trying to do? Mr. Woojin might be a Rank A Roused. No, I am sure he is one. Who else could solo clear a 5 star dungeon? Do you know how big his guild will become? If I stay in the Hammer guild, then how far could I climb up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hammer guild had grown as large as it could get, and the guild would have a hard time expanding any further. His seniors, who had entered the guild before him, was firmly entrenched in the top seats. The prospect of him advancing in the guild was quite hopeless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t Mr. Woojin already possess one 5 star Dungeon? To tell you the truth, if he manages just that Dungeon, he wouldn\u2019t need to renege on my annual salary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was right. Just by looking at the pattern in which Woojin attacked the Dungeons, he could tell the guild formed by Woojin will have a very bright future.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have the chance to become a founding member. To tell you the truth, I could probably become a head of the Support Division.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A position that handles everything that has to do with the Support teams. By the way he said those words, it seemed Haemin had dreamed of the position for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Where was his ambition? Where did he fit in the Hammer guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hammer guild\u2019s department heads, and the members of the board were all founding members. Even if he kept making serious contribution to the guild, Jung-minchan would never surpass them to become part of the management.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll also go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard Minchan\u2019s decision, Kim-haemin took out his resignation letter he always carried around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you always carry that around?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. All salary man do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan grinned, and he also took out his resignation letter from the pocket of his suit. Haemin\u2019s eyes turned round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou too, team Leader?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll salary man do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKooo. Let\u2019s toss the resignation letter in style, then we can go have some soju.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin headed towards their possible last day at the Hammer guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They took the elevator to the 11th floor where the 4th Support team was located at. The office lights were all turned off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The curtain was closed, and it was dark inside. He saw the members of his team standing around a cake with lit candles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t only the 4th Support team. All of the Support teams were assembled in the room. Moreover, president Park-sahngoh, and vice president Park-jinwoo was also present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader Jung-minchan! Congratulation on being promoted to the head of the department!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Minchan was being confused, President Park-sahngoh spoke as he laughed out loud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. I had my eyes on Mr. Minchan, and I find the team leader position to be lacking. You will become the head of the Support Division starting tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Minchan looked at them in surprise, his team members egged him on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader. Hurry up and blow out the candles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease don\u2019t forget about us after you become the department head.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. Congratulation on your promotion, team leader.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was too flustered, so only laughter leaked out of him. He blew out the candles in bewilderment, and the office filled with people clapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, he is back after finalizing an incredible deal. He is a genius of negotiations. Please clap once again for Department Head Jung-minchan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are so cool, department head!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh started a chant, and the continuous clapping assaulted Minchan\u2019s ears. Minchan and Haemin had pale faces, and they were just laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, president. The genius of negotiation went to negotiate, but he was negotiated instead.

Roused worked with their life on the line, and nothing was more dangerous than reckless bravado.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was going to catch one Dragon. \u00a0It wasn't a big deal, so he didn't need to take all of his companions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed 10 Death Knights to distract the Dragon. \u00a0Dolsae would steadily attack, and Bibi will use her mental attacks to cause confusion. \u00a0He would also be attacking. \u00a0He didn't need anyone else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the monsters had spread out far with Nasan as the staging point. \u00a0His familiars had to cover a large region, so they were all busy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Or I could just call on Jaenis.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His EXP was surging towards the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just needed couple minutes, and his EXP would be filled. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Potential EXP was all around him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was actually delighted that the Dungeon Breaks were concentrated around Seoul. \u00a0His Undead army was able to hunt down the monsters, and his EXP was stacking at a very fast rate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin ran into the battlefield himself. \u00a0He wanted to shorten the time it took for him to level up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin extended his hand, and the Bone Spears pierced through the monsters like they were made out of cloth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-ooh-oong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Spirit Spears shot down the swift bat monsters from the sky. The bat monsters kept dodging, but the Spirit Spears chased them down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After gaining the Warrior Class, his most frequently used weapon was the axe. \u00a0His axe split open the heads of the monsters.

Each of their levels were high enough to be close in ability to a Rank B Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each of their magic spells were dangerous. \u00a0The only shortcoming was the fact that their magic were simple. They could only use magic of a single element. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They could only use a single magic spell, but this didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t a variety of magic being used. \u00a0This was the case when several dozen to several hundred of them were summoned. \u00a0He summoned Skeleton Magicians able to use Fire, Ice, Lightning, Wind or Poison type magic. \u00a0He was able to create a diverse mage army. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBomb them!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-keek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons let out a hair-raising laugh, and they started to let loose their magic. The Death Knights had some room to breathe thanks to Woojin's active role in the battle. \u00a0The Death Knights moved the Skeleton army to surround the monsters. \u00a0They created a large perimeter around Namsan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">99.9% </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was almost there. \u00a0However, at that moment, the Dragon pushed off the Namsan tower to head towards Woojin. \u00a0It seemed the Dragon realized he couldn't just let this be. \u00a0When the Dragon left the Namsan tower, one could see vines encircling the entire tower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the Dragon was trying to make the Namsan tower his colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It still need a day to become functional. \u00a0Woojin had plenty of time to kill the dragon then destroy the colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon was high up in the sky, and its stomach was inflating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis might be a problem.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Will he be able to block the Dragon's Breath?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin would be fine. \u00a0His Spirit Armor would protect him. \u00a0However, the people around him.... \u00a0What will he do about the people in Alandal?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Level Up!&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a very welcome sound. \u00a0Woojin immediately called for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJaenis.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was his teacher, who had taught him the ways of slaughter and boldness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had helped Woojin with creating destruction. \u00a0He was Woojin's top advisor, who had helped him reign.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had once been called a great scholar and an Archmage on Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To save Alphen from crumbling, he had made himself a Lich, and he had been taken captive by madness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Deathless Magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahkkk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black smoke coalesced in midair. \u00a0He was a Skeleton wearing a black robe, and he had a black staff in his hand. \u00a0He wore similar looking clothes as the Skeleton Mage, but unlike the Skeleton mages, he had an oppressive presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His red eyes flashed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Master! Was Alphen saved?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His voice buzzed, and the sound had the power of shaking a person's heart. \u00a0The hair raising sound was akin to a train coming to an emergency stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin touched his itchy ears as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNot yet. \u00a0How about blocking that for me first?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pointed to the sky. \u00a0The Golden Dragon Rajakui had inflated to a massive size, and it was about to let out its Dragon's Breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Where did my power disappear to?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yeah.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin quickly opened his Skill Window, and he invested Bonus Points into the 'Lich Summon' skill. In a flash, the 1 became 99.

Just kill him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a Dimensional lord was killed, the corpse wasn't left behind. \u00a0It would just disappear as it let out a gray light. \u00a0Wouldn't one need the corpse to make a Bone Dragon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What about \u2018Thrash's Executioner\u2019?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI searched for it, but I couldn't find it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had searched through the Achievement Store and the Dimensional Store, but the Executioner was missing. Amongst Thrash's set item, the Executioner was the weapon. \u00a0The recipe was also missing, so he had no idea if it really existed or not. It was an odd weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis continued to tell Woojin that he had to continue his search for the weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the two were having a conversation, the Dragon slowly descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rajakui glared at the Undead Magician, who had blocked its Dragon's Breath. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never expected to find such a strong Lich on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The earth isn't synchronized yet. \u00a0How were you able to gain such power as a Roused from earth?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rajakui's words made Lich's red eyes gleam.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Disgusting!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis' anger toward Trahnet exceeded one's imagination. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll talk after you kill that thing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[As the lord commands!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Lich was willful as he switched between using master and lord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It couldn't be helped. \u00a0Woojin hadn't made this being. \u00a0The Lich had existed on its own for 200 years before he had become Woojin's familiar. \u00a0Woojin was just thankful and reassured by the fact that Jaenis followed his order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Burn to death by the Inferno!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A black fire shot out from Jaenis' staff, and it impacted on Rajakui's wing. \u00a0This was a fire comparable to the flames within hell. \u00a0It was a type of hellfire, and Jaenis' lightning quick casting time was almost unbelievable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oohk?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its wing caught on fire, and its summoned magic couldn't put out the fire.

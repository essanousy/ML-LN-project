I would believe it if someone told me this was a tomb.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026chet. Maybe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin swallowed dryly as he looked at the statues ranging from several hundred to several thousand in number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go there first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin returned ShingShing, then he walked with Bibi. Dolsae, the twitching ball of light, sat on top of Bibi\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCould these be used to make a golem?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The best way to find an answer to a question was to just do it. Woojin pointed with his finger. Dolsae flew towards a statue then he absorbed himself into it. The Statue shifted, and the body started to move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh, it\u2019s working\u2026 Nope.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae was flung out of the statue. Woojin frowned when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A dejected Dolsae was hugged by Bibi. The statue was already being controlled by something else, so Dolsae couldn\u2019t use the statue as its own body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust go eat some dirt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae absorbed into the ground, and he raised his body as a cloud of dust swirled around him. When Dolsae used the earth, his power was weaker than when his body was made out of stone, but the size of his body was twice as large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is going to be a bit annoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gooooong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One by one the Giant Golems started to wake up. It wasn\u2019t as if all the golems had woken up. Only the nearest golems to him started waking up. It seemed this was an trap that will automatically activate when one gets within a certain range of the golems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo only 5 awoke?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Five Golems awoke when they sensed Woojin\u2019s intrusion. There weren\u2019t any corpses or spirits around, so most of his Necromancer Class Skills were useless. However, he didn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it time to increase my Warrior Class Skills?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned his Warrior\u2019s Weapon, then he changed its appearance to a hammer. He was quite used to the heavy weight of the weapon now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin raised his hammer, then he charged the Golems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee was surprised. She had hidden her body inside a shadow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey were golems.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had made the right choice in turning back. Would she and her team mates be able to fight such a large number of golems? Maybe if they went in a straight line towards the altar, while defeating the nearby golems, then maybe it would have been possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, what if she had she had seized the Return Stone, and the worst possible situation had happened? What would her team had done if all the golems attacked them at once? Moreover, there were living giants guarding the altar so they would have also had to deal with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if Kahng-woojin was worried about such a scenario, he was killing all the golems first. He didn\u2019t head straight towards the altar. He destroyed the golems as he moved toward the center as if he was drawing a snail\u2019s shell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWasn\u2019t he a necromancer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seems Kang-woojin had many secrets. It was no wonder the only information known about him was that he was a Necromancer. However, once she saw Kang-woojin hunt, she was suspicious as to whether he was really a Necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was the Shadown Hunter yet she was suppressed with strength. It didn\u2019t make any sense. She had already been a Rank A Roused for 2 years, yet she was beaten in terms of strength\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat bastard\u2019s Skeleton Summon must be a smokescreen. I\u2019m sure he is a Warrior. Moreover, he probably only advanced his strength.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s appearance fit that image. He wielded a stupidly large hammer, and he bashed the Giant Golem as the Earth Golem held it in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he was quite simple. He only used one technique.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After defeating couple hundred golems, Kang-woojin changed his style. He use his hammer to contiuously strike the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW\u2026what the hell? Is he some kind of construction worker\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin moved further away, she advanced a little bit before she hid her body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was on an infinite hunting spree, and Lee-yunhwee crawled low to the ground for awhile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. Those bastards are getting on my nerve.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t too far from the altar with the Return Stone floating on top of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were less than 50 Giant Golems left, but the large giants surrounding the altar didn\u2019t even show signs of moving. With their backs to the Return Stone, they didn\u2019t budge an inch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the center of their heads, a single eye was rolling around. It meant they were observing Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t worry about the one-eyed freaks as he took care of the Giant Golems. It felt like he had spent over a whole day fighting the golems. Currently, the Return Stone was letting out a bright geen light as if it was about to explode. It probably meant it was almost time for the Dungeon Break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Warrior Class Skill level had increased drastically.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His repetitive movements slightly increased multiple Stats, and it was the result of the arduous time he had spent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had already reached level 49. He had defeated every single golem\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh,too bad. If master could have defeated one more golem, then you would have reached level 50. Then you could have played with your dolls.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll just have to defeat them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin headed towards the Cyclops, who hadn\u2019t even moved an inch away from the altar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kooh-oong, koo-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Behind Woojin, Dolsae formed his body by aggregating the pieces of stone from the Giant Golems. As always, Bibi was riding on top of Dolsae\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome down, Bibi. It\u2019s going to be dangerous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cyclops were dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were also one branch of a race descended from the Giant Race. However, one would be in trouble if one assumed they were comparable to the Ogres. Ogres had inherited the ferocious wild nature of the Giant Race, but the Cyclops had a larger body. Moreover, they had inherited the wisdom of the Giant Race, who once built a glorious civilization.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I know you.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stopped in front of the Cyclops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou know me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes. The Charging Titan of Destruction.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cyclop\u2019s gaze rested on the golem Dolsae, then it looked at the small Bibi next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Witch of Hallucination.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cyclop\u2019s massive eye headed towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I also know about your Dark Knights\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019m a bit famous?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cyclops shifted when the heard Woojin\u2019s silly joke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How could I not know you? Necromancer of Massacre.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cyclops moved both its hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Terror of the Living.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A golden mace was summoned on top of the Cyclops\u2019 hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[King of the Dead.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other Cyclops on the side also summoned their maces. They took one step towards Woojin as they watched him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Alandal\u2019s Monarch.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 3 Cyclops raised their maces, and they took one more step.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Immortal!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooooong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Cyclops\u2019 maces fell towards Woojin, but Dolsae was faster than them as he ran in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae stretched his body to block the attack of the Cyclops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahhhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Various parts of Dolsae\u2019s body broke off, and stone dusts flew everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin retreated slightly, then a smile formed at the corner of Woojin\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid Trahnet also send you guys??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You won\u2019t be able to block Trahnet\u2019s main army.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBullshit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The moment you decided to run away your defeat was determined.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned in anger. He hadn\u2019t run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your anger is the evidence of your defeat\u2026]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin transformed his Warrior\u2019s Weapon into a spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop spouting bullshit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s body shot forward like a missile towards the Cyclops\u2019 eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pooh-ooh-ook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Spear stabbed into the Cyclops\u2019 eye, but the Cyclop didn\u2019t try to avoid Woojin\u2019s strike. He instead grabbed Woojin out of the air. Woojin was caught in the Cyclop\u2019s hand, but he swirled around in place to escape the Cyclop\u2019s grasp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohng kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin dodged the Cyclops\u2019 indiscriminate blows, and he continued to attack. Each mace strike was deadly, and Woojin felt like he would rather face 100 Ogres. It was quite difficult to face off against 3 Cyclops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo. This is driving me nuts..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was having a difficult time avoiding each attack, and his occasional attack wasn\u2019t stacking any damage on them. It was quite useless. The Cyclops, who was stabbed in the eye, healed instantly from a light emitted by the altar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could use the Decisive Strike with his great sword to sever finger or the Achilles tendon, but it was all useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was almost of no help. It was only him and Dolsae. They were outnumbered, and time was running out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unknown power from the altar kept healing the Cyclops, so Woojin would eventually fatigue first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Lee-yunhwee appeared from a shadow cast by a pile of stone. Then she snatched the Return Stone on top of the altar. As if it was about to explode, the Return Stone emitted a bright light. However, when Lee-yunhwee grabbed it, the light calmed down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, the light from the altar that was healing the Cyclops stopped flowing out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, you son of a bitch. You can think of me as a small fry. This small fry is going home now. It would be great if you just died, you crazy son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smiled when Lee-yunhwee appeared. Even trash had its uses in the right circumstance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey Dolsae. Buy me some time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGooh-uhhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin immediately exited the battlefield, then he charged towards Lee-yunhwee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW\u2026what are you doing? You crazy son of a bitch!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time Lee-yunhwee saw Kahng-woojin struggle since he entered this Dungeon. He probably had enough, and he was trying to steal the Return Stone from her. It was probably why he was exposing himself, while he left the 3 Giants behind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe he meant to escape together with her using the Return Stone?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t seem that way. The spear in Kang-woojin\u2019s hand frightened her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cD\u2026don\u2019t come over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin struck with his spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahhhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was barely able to block it, and Lee-yunhwee\u2019s wrists hurt. What kind of strength\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou will be my final EXP.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin aimed the spear toward Lee-yunhwee\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Rank Roused Lee-yunhwee. With her agile body, she twisted to perform her special attack, Cutting the Moonlight. Woojin didn\u2019t even try to avoid the attack. He charged in faster, and he struck with his spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC\u2026crazy son of a bitch\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her eyes were filled with shock. The life energy within her eyes faded quickly. When Woojin pierced her heart with his spear, she had grazed Woojin with her sword. The attack was insufficient to cut his throat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Humans of blood and bones was much easier to deal with than the golems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin immediately learned the level 50 Restricted Skills and .</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One can control a dead corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpse can use 50% of its original ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It can only carry out simple directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic Consumption : 1,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses within the caster\u2019s 10 meter radius or the corpse in control can be detonated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power is increased as more magic is consumed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s magic caused Lee-yunhwee\u2019s corpse to suddenly stand up, and only the white of her eyes could be seen. Lee-yunhwee\u2019s corpse ran madly towards the golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Woojin ran, he increased his main skill, Corpse Explosion, to level 10.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-hyunhwee\u2019s body jumped, and the body attached itself to a Cyclops\u2019 head. A large amount of magic exited Woojin, and the corpse exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahhhhhg!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosion blew the Cyclops\u2019 head right off. Then the fallen Cyclops got up, and the corpse hugged the other Cyclops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gwaaaahhhhg!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was only two attack, but he had used up all of his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The last remaining Cyclops tried to retreat, but Dolsae grabbed him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, Woojin had approached the Cyclops and he was laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou said I ran away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you guys are confident, then tell everyone to attack me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pierce the Cyclops\u2019 eye with his spears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster. You aren\u2019t going to play with your doll-ahong??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he looked at Bibi\u2019s bright smile, it really drove home the fact that she was a demon. Woojin suddenly laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m no different from her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wiped the blood flowing down his face. He used Soul Extortion to heal his wound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSss-oop. I think I\u2019ll have to apply some salve.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yunhwee\u2019s attack had made a deep cut. He applied the Regeneration Salve on his throbbing wound. The scar will be completely gone after a night\u2019s rest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin picked up the Return Stone from the floor, then he quickly gathered the Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

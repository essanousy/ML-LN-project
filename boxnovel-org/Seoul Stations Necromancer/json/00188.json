She looked as if her soul had exited her body. \u00a0She just stared into the empty air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Nakamura hadn't answered the question, they were already well aware of the answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric looked at Nakamura as he raised both fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe need an ally. \u00a0We do not need a protector.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura let out a sigh as if he couldn't believe their answers. \u00a0He had already assessed the abilities of all the heroes. \u00a0The people from the Daken guild had made a perimeter, and they started tightening the perimeter. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the elite members of the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These men made up 1/3 of the high Ranked Roused of Japan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you really think you can hold us off with these men? \u00a0If the battle starts, people will gather towards us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric calmly berated Nakamura as he saw the members of the Daken guild gathering around them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could stop a internal conflict, that would be the better option. \u00a0He didn't know what prior friction existed between Alandal and the Daken guild. \u00a0Since he didn't know the history behind their conflict, Tauric thought it was better to prevent a fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal hadn't returned yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura was beaming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-kook. \u00a0I see you don't know the reason why I tried to buy some time. \u00a0\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened his two arms wide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u3008The capture of the Colony has been completed.\u3009</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An ownerless Colony greeted its new owner. \u00a0Nakamura's eyes turned wide when he saw the Points he gained by the capture. \u00a0He hadn't done much, yet he had gained an incredible treasure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He already possessed a Dimensional Domain through a subway station in Tokyo. \u00a0Therefore, he knew about the benefits of having a Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be able replenish new troops.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The list of what he could purchase in the Store was limited. \u00a0He decided to purchase several thousand goblins. \u00a0A black portal formed in front of the World Tree, and countless small green colored monsters started pouring out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC...crazy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kontz's voice expressed what everyone was feeling at that moment. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did they never think about the possibility of other Dimensional lords existing on earth?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura was basically a god in the Colony. \u00a0Kontz tried to turn back when large walls appeared to surround his group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-koo-koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A ground that held nothing suddenly pushed out castle walls, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call this phenomena as a miracle performed by a god.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-haha. \u00a0Capture everyone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Nakamura gave his order, the goblin soldiers started moving in perfect order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The castle walls that had erupted from the ground became their prison.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng. \u00a0Kahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dwarf King Raul, who had been pounding on the wall, threw down his hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had hit it several hundred times, yet it was showing no signs of breaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe fell in such a futile manner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His dejected voice expressed what everyone was feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is my fault...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She buried her head in her knees as Melody answered with a weak voice. \u00a0Tauric tried to console her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is no way this this could be your fault, Holy Maiden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI went against the word of the goddess....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She should have listened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She shouldn\u2019t have doubted...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, nothing would come from her belated regret. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The oracle had come true. \u00a0The Immortal lost his Gate, and she had lost her power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was no longer a Holy Maiden. \u00a0She was just a powerless woman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease don't punish yourself. \u00a0Since the goddess of Prophecy said it'll happen, wouldn't this have happened either way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody kept her head low even after hearing Tauric\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, Dame Haesol isn't doing so well. \u00a0It has been 3 days yet she isn't waking up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm pretty sure they used poison on her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we don't know what kind of poison....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they had Haesol's telepathic ability, they would be able to communicate to those outside. \u00a0However, she wasn't showing any signs of waking up, so they could only look on in frustration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Forest below the Saurus mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-joonyong had climbed to the top of the tree to observe the state of the Colony. \u00a0The goblin soldiers had ballooned into 20,000, and they were dispatched along the castle walls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could see some of the Coalition troops between the goblins. \u00a0Kim-joonyong wondered what lie the Daken guild had told to get the people of Coalition on their side. \u00a0He was frustrated by the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose Japanese bastards\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A rolling rock had dislodged the stone in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Daken guild had started a rumor that the Immortal had betrayed everyone. \u00a0The Phantom Unit quickly escaped, but Haesol, who was the leader of the Phantom unit, couldn't be contacted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was clear that she was either killed or she was taken hostage. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong ended his scouting of the Colony, and he descended the tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnit commander Blanka.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo how was it, Joonyong? \u00a0Do you see Haesol?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0I didn't see her anywhere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a disaster. \u00a0Haesol is in danger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka's face was full of worry. \u00a0\u00a0It was the same for the rag tag group of the Phantom Unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe president has to come back. \u00a0Or, we have to try to turn back the Skeleton Army.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wouldn't be easy for the members of the Phantom Unit to rescue Haesol. Their surplus troops were being lead by Jaenis, and Kahng-woojin had gone looking for Heres' Temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be great if either one of them were here, but there had heard no news from both of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong let out a curse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had risen to Rank A, but nothing had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether he was a low Rank Roused or a high Rank Roused, he was an insignificant human. \u00a0He still couldn\u2019t be of much help.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A mere Roused like him couldn\u2019t challenge a Dimensional lord, who possessed a Colony. \u00a0His opponent was too strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the foliage above them shook as something heavy fell from the sky. \u00a0The Phantom Unit, who had momentarily let their guards down, nervously vigilant against this object. \u00a0All of their eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped off the Phantom Steed, and he grinned at the people, who were excitedly greeting him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-hook. \u00a0We are in a bad spot, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka felt overwhelmed with joy at seeing Woojin, so he started crying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did \u00a0he have to be so late in showing up....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop crying. \u00a0Gather around me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin asked a question when all the members of the Phantom Unit gathered in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo who did this to us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? \u00a0You knew about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he knew. \u00a0His Status Window gave him an alert when his Colony was stolen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTell me who.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt was Nakamura from the Daken guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he received the alert that said he had lost his Saurus Colony, he had assumed it was one of Trahnet\u2019s great lords. \u00a0That wasn\u2019t the case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Colony had been taken away without suffering from any attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An person from earth had taken it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had never thought about this possibility, so he let out a big sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let's get it back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-joonyong became surprised, and he got up from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...we have to make plans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right! \u00a0Haesol was taken hostage. \u00a0It'll be dangerous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Blanka\u2019s words, Woojin nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let's hurry up and get there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo the plan\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong let his words of incredulity leak out, but Woojin was already striding well in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I'll follow you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t easy to be so confident in oneself. \u00a0Joonyong found it fascinating that Woojin was able to be so dependable under hardship.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin didn\u2019t have his Undead army, but none of the men thought Kahng-woojin would lose a fight.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Top of the Saurus Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A large palace had been built in front of the World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKahng-woojin is here, master.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHooo hoo hoo. \u00a0Kahng-woojin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura, who had been sitting on the throne, stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He now knew why Kahng-woojin was so strong. \u00a0He now knew why he possessed overwhelming power despite being human. \u00a0He understood it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dimensional lord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That bastard had put one foot into the realm of the gods. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How unfair was it for everyone else?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He acted all superior because of this fact\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll go. \u00a0Of course. \u00a0I have to go greet him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura laughed as he got up from the throne.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was also a Dimensional lord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Points wasn\u2019t just used to recharge one\u2019s troops. \u00a0It also allowed one to increase one\u2019s ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fifth Rank Roused?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His power was now on a different level, and he was brimming with confidence now. \u00a0He was in the same position as Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">King of Alandal?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Arrogant\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll kill the bastard to become the new king.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Nakamura exited the palace, his eyebrows twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you the one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura had decorated the large front yard of the palace in a Japanese style. \u00a0The garden \u00a0was completely devastated, and Kahng-woojin was standing in the middle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The imprisoned heroes of Alphen had been freed, and they stood around Kahng-woojin with gaunt expressions on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been only several minutes since he had received the report. \u00a0How was Kahng-woojin able to come here so fast?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he could \u00a0solve this mystery, Kahng-woojin walked towards Nakamura. \u00a0Each step made his heart beat fast, but Nakamura tried his best to harden his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no gap between him and that bastard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would be able to fight him on even grounds as a Dimensional lord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even he could clear out the the scrubs in couple minutes if he wanted to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura\u2019s face once again held a relaxed smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHue hue. \u00a0It would be best if you don\u2019t get any closer to me, King of Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't stop walking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura also didn\u2019t retreat, and when they were about two meters apart, Woojin stopped walking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura let out a laugh full of delight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-haha. \u00a0You touched it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour shadow touched my shadow.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin furrowed his brows as he looked at Nakamura. \u00a0The people from afar held their breath as they watched the two confront each other. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura\u2019s Shadow Bind was powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even Haesol was ensnared without being able to do anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin once again took a step forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura instinctively took a step back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow are you able to move?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His face showed how flustered he was. \u00a0As he was taking steps backward, something surprising occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH...how come I can't move?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t move his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if his shadow was bound....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really this weak?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he place his hand on top of Nakamura's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He possessed a Shadow Imp, yet this bastard had tried to bind his shadow....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho gave it to you? \u00a0Who gave you the Dimensional Proof?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be impossible for the Daken Guild could have gathered 3 Dimensional Fragments. \u00a0If they could gather that many, it meant several dozen Dimensional Fragments were already gathered by people of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span

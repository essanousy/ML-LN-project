Several dozen Skeleton Mages were swept away. \u00a0Woojin was hunting by himself, so fortunately, soldiers and his familiars weren't by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooooohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wrecks of the leftover buildings were swept up into the shockwave, and it was dispersed into the surrounding. \u00a0When the dust settled down, Woojin retracted his barrier then he approached Jaenis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow does it feel being released from the seal?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Do you think I had fun during the time I had lost?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shrugged his shoulders. \u00a0He'd never experienced being in the Room of Seal, and he never experienced death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou probably have a lot of questions for me. Let's tidy up the battlefield first.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[That sounds like a good idea.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should team up with Ramson.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll do so.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin quickly grabbed Jaenis, who was about to disappear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yeah. \u00a0Don't kill any humans.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your words make no sense.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't kill them.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026as the lord wants.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee-ree-reek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis disappeared as his body turned into black smoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Lich never went back on his spoken words, so he wouldn't harm the humans. \u00a0This will cause the eradication of the monsters to be slowed down. \u00a0However, he couldn't torch the entire cottage, because he wanted to catch the bedbugs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Woojin hadn't cautioned Jaenis, he would have indiscriminately bombarded the city of Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That would have been the quickest way to eradicate all the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall I check myself out a little bit?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was level 80 now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Warrior's Weapon had evolved over time, and he had just passed another hurdle where another evolution to his weapon would happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened his Skill Window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Steel Staff&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A warrior\u2019s weapon was basically one\u2019s best friend, and they are akin to one\u2019s life. The Warrior\u2019s weapon grew alongside the user.

The weapon repeatedly disappeared, and reappeared in his hand. He was also able to freely change the size of the Throwing Knives, so he could summon throwing knives ideal for the palm of his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are the skills I can learn?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened the Achievement Store to buy the level 80 Skills that had been unlocked. \u00a0He bought the Skills that was exclusive to the Warrior Class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Knife Fighting&gt;, &lt;Knife Throwing Technique&gt;, &lt;Battle Roar&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two weapon skills that was self explanatory. \u00a0However, he was curious about the effect of the last Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Battle Roar&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During a hard fight, the Warrior's yell will boost the spirit of one's allies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Effect : Increased Morale, Increased Battle Capability</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smiled when he saw the description of the Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's a Group Buff.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until level 70, the skills given to him strengthened the Warrior. \u00a0The first Buff skill appeared at level 80. \u00a0It had also been a Buff where his yell would affect the allies in his vicinity. It was an aoe buff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle was slowly coming to an end. \u00a0Woojin headed towards Namsan where he decided to try out his new weapon skills. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rajakui had planted vines, and it had grown all over the tower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be a problem if the colony gained a foothold here. \u00a0He had to quickly get rid of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stopped in his tracks when he suddenly felt a sense of danger. \u00a0He raised his head towards the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Doo doo doo doo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he focused his senses, he felt the air vibrate. The clouds were shaped a bit funny too. His focused eyesight couldn't see anything, but he felt some kind of presence. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis had an extreme hatred towards Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had deployed a meteor to destroy a functionless colony that yet to take hold here...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was already too late to stop it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo I'm the one, who will be responsible, for destroying the Namsan Tower again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The symbol of Seoul had been destroyed 5 years ago during the Dungeon Shock. \u00a0It hadn't even been several years since it was rebuilt... \u00a0He never expected he would be the cause of its destruction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Any action taken by the Undead Army was his sole responsibility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis might not end at the tower. \u00a0Namsan itself might be erased.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He still had time before the meteor struck the mountain. \u00a0Woojin looked around his surrounding. \u00a0He got on his Phantom Steed Shing Shing, and they galloped away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Doo doo doo doo. \u00a0Kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battlefield was noisy with the sounds of bullets being fired, and the explosions going off. In the midst of all of this, several cameras were taking in the sight of the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small monitor displayed the battle as if the battle was going on right in front of one\u2019s nose. \u00a0In truth, the camera was positioned about 1 kilometer away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. This is beyond a mess.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flying monsters and the quick monsters were only 1 kilometer away, and that fact worried them. \u00a0However, the army were at the final stage of the suppression, so the danger against them was a bit diminished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShale we get closer, producer?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. Let's wait here. \u00a0We'll go in after the gunfire dies down.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe world is coming to an end. End.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The producer reclined on a picnic chair, and he absentmindedly stared up at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no point in getting a scoop in this fucked up world. \u00a0If he crossed into the no-go area set up by the army, he might get unlucky and get shot by friendly fire. \u00a0If he died, he wouldn't be able to take up his grievances with anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Isn't something coming our way?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt looks like a horse.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Dude. We are on a roof. Do you think a pegasus exist or something.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I'm not lying\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. \u00a0Stop being a bitch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The producer unnecessarily glared at his junior once, then he stood up from his chair. \u00a0He put a cigarette in his mouth, and his face froze when he caught sight of what was on the other side of the balustrade of the rooftop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's a horse.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is it? \u00a0Who's riding it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh\u2026 I...it kind of looks like Kahng-woojin?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? I think you are right?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cigarette in the producer's mouth fell to the ground when he heard his junior colleague's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0Hurry up and turn the camera!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The camera had been zoomed-in to film the battlefield. \u00a0The camera was turned towards the sky where it filmed the sight of Woojin racing across the sky. \u00a0He was coming towards them on his Phantom Steed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Shing Shing arrived at the rooftop balustrade, Woojin jumped off the horse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan we broadcast this live?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pointed towards the camera as he spoke. \u00a0The producer mindlessly shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can't broadcast live. We send out a signal around every 10 minutes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat'll be too late.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin frowned, the producer spoke quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have some urgent need? \u00a0We can decrease the time to 1 minute.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head at those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a meteor coming down on Namsan. \u00a0Tell the nearby civilians to be prepared.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? A meteor?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow many news crews are around Namsan?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are four teams.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPass on a message for me. \u00a0Can you contact the army?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...if you wait a moment, I can look up the contact information....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. \u00a0It'll be faster for me to just go there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nearby civilians had all been evacuated when Rajakui gathered the monsters around Namsan. \u00a0When the meteor fell, the biggest casualties would come from the military.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heeeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Woojin delivered his message, Woojin rode Shing Shing towards the army. \u00a0The producer just stared after Woojin's back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cProducer! Should be broadcast this immediately?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Jaesung-ah. \u00a0Did I really just talk to Kahng-woojin?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! You did.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaesung, the junior employee, spoke. \u00a0The producer had a dazed expression on his face as if he was dreaming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSenior! What do I do with the newest footage!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The producer immediately made a call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cVice president! I got a scoop. \u00a0The footage I just sent should be aired immediately after being edited.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had disappeared from his sight, but the producer continued to stare toward\u2019s Woojin\u2019s flight path with the phone pressed to his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHero Kahng-woojin saw through the Dragon's plan. The Dragon summoned a meteor.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There wasn't anything Woojin couldn't do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would have happened to Seoul again if he wasn't here? \u00a0There had been several locations where the monsters had gathered, and Kahng-woojin's familiars had destroyed them all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The army was clearing out remnant of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe said the meteor will fall on Namsan soon. He said everyone should evacuate.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't even have to debate if his information had come from a reliable source. \u00a0Kahng-woojin wasn't someone who would lie. This was how the people perceived Kahng-woojin. \u00a0His words carried weight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The producer's voice was shaking from a weird sense of pride. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is this how members of the earth's defense force felt? \u00a0He had only delivered Kahng-woojin's words, but wouldn't that contribute in a big way towards saving Seoul? He never felt more pride at his choice of occupation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe has saved Seoul once again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can't retreat. \u00a0It is my job to protect this place.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shrugged his shoulders at the commander's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you insist on dying then I won't dissuade you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unfurled a finger, and he pointed towards the sky. \u00a0The clouds were rippling like waves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn about 10 minutes, you'll be able to see it yourself. \u00a0If you retreat at that time, you'll all die.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want to live, you have to retreat now. \u00a0However, if you have a death wish, I won't stop you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had delivered his intentions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't like the senseless loss of lives, but he didn't feel any moral obligation where he had to save everyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had informed them of the danger, and that was enough. \u00a0He wasn't their nanny....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we do that, the monsters will spread out into the city.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll block them.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll withdraw my forces.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and go.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After speaking those words, Woojin headed to the front line. If he wanted to help the army\u2019s retreat, he had to hold back the monsters. The soldiers saluted Woojin as they left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned his bone spears, and he threw it to various locations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwah-roo-roohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bones grew and they immediately intersected to form a Wall of Bones. \u00a0Since he was creating the Bone Wall across a large swath of land, a very large amount of magic escaped his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He mumbled as he drank the magic potion he bought from the Achievement Store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez, Jaenis. You created a lot of inconvenience for a lot of people.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he said not to harm any people, it shouldn't be a big meteor. \u00a0Still, the shockwave created by the impact couldn't be ignored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Jaenis' skill was so great that he was very accurate with his magic. \u00a0There weren't going to be any mishaps where the meteor would fall somewhere else. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Namsan Tower was almost a sure loss, and the nearby residents will be leveled. \u00a0There wouldn't be any human casualties, but the monsters hiding inside the forest will be annihilated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin surrounded the monsters with the Wall of Bones before they could escape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there was a strong resistance from the monsters, he wouldn't use his depleted magic. \u00a0He would fight them using the Warrior's Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was keeping back the monsters by himself after the army left. \u00a0At that moment, a black smoke coalesced into forming the Lich Jaenis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow come you called a meteor down here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ha-ha. It is me knocking on earth's door.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked as if he had just chewed on shit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you observe your manners one more time, earth will be completely decimated next time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ha-ha-ha. There won't be any casualties from this.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A sigh left Woojin's mouth. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it a small one?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is only a small rock that's being used as a greeting.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that the small rock contained an enormous amount of destructive force. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease put a barrier over Alandal's buildings.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Who cares about the buildings?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy family is there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026my bad.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis' body turned into black smoke, and he dispersed into the air. \u00a0Woojin let out a sigh as he stared up at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Twinkle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The small light was quite accurate as it headed towards Namsan. \u00a0After it became visible to the naked eyes, it only took several seconds for it to impact the earth. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggo-ah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the impact, the delayed sound of explosion rang out. \u00a0The ground shook, and Woojin's Soul armor activated. \u00a0It covered his entire body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground was so decimated that there wasn't even a trace of the Namsan Tower left. \u00a0Moreover, a big hole was formed at Namsan. The mushroom cloud rose up with the dust, and this wasn't happening only in Seoul.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

The colonies on the planet were basically like Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like Rashmode's Summon Magic Circle. \u00a0Instead of subway stations, these were artificial Dungeons built on the the surface. \u00a0It was called the Dimensional Gates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin slowly advanced, it was as expected. \u00a0The monsters that had been attacking in other directions converged towards him. This in turn grew the size of Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every point Woojin gained from the Level Up was put towards the Control.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Warriors were all under the command of the Death Knights, and each Death Knights required only 1 Point to be consumed. \u00a0He had Lich Jaenis, who had become level 99 in an instant, and 10 Skeleton Magicians were put under his control per level. \u00a0He could control a total of 990 Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The combined Control Points he needed to maintain the Undead army, the Death Knights, Lich, Golem, and the little devil was less than 100.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The rest of his Control was used on his other underlings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-oh-oh-oh. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-uh-uhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses were reanimated as puppets. \u00a0Their appearances were unaltered from their death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were over 2000 zombies marching toward the enemies. \u00a0They were a bit slow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Zombie army was a mixture of small and large monsters. \u00a0There were even ogres mixed in with the army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwhang, kwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Sssooohp. Ha-ah-ah. I'm excited. I'm really excited.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggaebi had possessed the corpse of an ogre, and he was rampaging like a madman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one revived a corpse into a zombie, its capability was diminished compared to when it was alive. However, when Ggaebi possessed the body, he was able to squeeze out ability that was superior compared to corpse\u2019s ability before death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gweeeehk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The possessed ogre ripped out a road sign, and the ogre swung it like a blunt weapon. \u00a0Ggaebi's performance was almost on par with Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These two were well-suited at causing chaos as they penetrated the enemy lines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undead army followed as the two opened up a path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After walking across corpses on top of corpses, Woojin was able to reach the Colosseum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's grown a lot.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tree's roots were spread as if it was encasing the Colosseum, and the tree was taller than most buildings one could find here. \u00a0When Woojin looked up, a Titan fell from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koooooohng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Titan was easily over 10 meters tall, and its size rivaled Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You are the bastards that defeated Rajakui-nim!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't dismount from his horse. He shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs you can see...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh. I am Nicktor. I'll avenge the death of Rajakui-nim!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour head is big, yet you don't have a brain? \u00a0Can you win against Rajakui?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh! Rajakui-nim is a Great Dimensional lord. He is stronger than me, so I follow him.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI killed that bastard, yet you think you can beat me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ooh-ooh-ooh.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nicktor of the Giant race raised his large hand, and it scratched its head. Then it raised a really big hammer in anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh! How dare you insult a warrior.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it retarded?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a dumbfounded expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This is why Giant races are...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKill it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[As the lord commands!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights jumped off their Phantom Steeds, and they charged towards the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-ooh-oong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ooh. \u00a0How dare you, you little flies!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nicktor was zealously swinging his hammer, but it failed to hit anyone. \u00a0The Death Knights were dealing deadly attacks, so it was false to compare them to flies. The Death Knights started mutilating the giant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssuh-kuhk, kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one excluded the two new Knights in Al Assad and Relick, all the other Death Knights were over S Rank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't even take 1 minute to defeat the giant. Rackto's spear pierced its forehead, and the giant fell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTidy up the surrounding.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[There is only death in front of the lord!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Clear away everything that is alive!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons and Death Knights moved busily to exterminate the remaining monsters. \u00a0As Woojin was looking up at the foothold, Jaenis appeared next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I've seen this unsightly thing too many times now.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think it'll come out?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Do you mean the Dimensional Fragment?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had cleared 9 colonies in Seoul and Busan. \u00a0He had gained three Dimensional Fragments out of the nine locations. \u00a0Those odds were pretty good, so there was a basis to his expectation. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It is an item with a lot of uses.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The link to Trahnet....] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis raised his staff, and flames erupted. Woojin raised his hand to stop him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. I'll do it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The zombies had been standing around doing nothing. \u00a0At his command, the zombies charged the colony, and they started to hang all over the tree. \u00a0He had to get rid of the zombies anyways....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The walking undeads blew up, and the colony was swept up in the explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Debris started falling from the sky as it littered the the surrounding. When the debris ceased to fall, he head towards the center of the Colosseum, which had lost its original form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A gem letting out a bright purple light was floating in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;You've gained a Dimensional Fragment.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from purchasing a Dungeon, the Dimensional Fragments had many other uses. Since he had more than three, he could make the Holy Maiden or someone else a Dimensional lord if he desired it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, they came out from Greece yet why did they make their colony here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It seemed the Titan liked the energy around this place.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm. Maybe it has something to do with the synchronization.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought about it as he stroked his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he chose the Seoul Station as his Dimensional Domain, he had to consider the synchronization rate. All the Dimensional lords were putting their colonies in historic sites or places where a lot of people gathered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now that he thought about it, one would be able to make a new Dungeon that was unlike the Dungeons seen up until now using a Dimensional Fragment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If a foothold akin to the one Rashmode made was created then it'll be problem.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn't it the result of a research carried out by a professor studying the Dungeons?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The professor he come across in the US had artificially created a Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be dangerous if there were people creating Summoning Magic Circle to call for the Dimensional lords. \u00a0It wouldn't be like this where the mob of monsters would give away the Dimensional lord's location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, there might already be a lot of them here\u2026.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, there were Dimensional lords on earth moving around stealthily. Woojin stopped worry about it, since it wasn\u2019t something he could prevent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted a permanent solution, he had to block further Dungeon Links from forming. \u00a0He had to stop it at the source.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Woojin had no idea how he should accomplish this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Let's clear this place, and we can head to Germany.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had earned a Dimensional Fragment, and he was able to kill several thousand monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was one colony in Germany, and there were two left in England.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaejoo Manjanggul Cave Ticket Office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were seven trucks with containers that approached the ticket office. \u00a0The employee stepped outside. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A group of people got off a sedan that had accompanied the trucks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The employee recognized a face amongst the group of people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ticket office employee spoke as if they were old acquaintances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is all this stuff?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, do you remember the official notice that you received?

This is manager Lee-sahngjoon. \u00a0He is in charge of the renovation.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ticket office employee headed towards the man wearing his sunglasses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a bit of a cold demeanor, and it was hard to strike up a conversation with him. \u00a0He was giving off a cold vibe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Lee-sahngjoon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm Kim-taesheek.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's do this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the greeting, Lee-sahngjoon ordered the workers to unload the trucks. \u00a0Numerous containers kept coming out of the containers. \u00a0The employee named Kim-taesheek asked a question as he saw the unidentified boxes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are all those thing?

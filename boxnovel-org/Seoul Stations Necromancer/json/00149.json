He would be moving separately from Woojin, but Sunggoo's goal was to train instead of hunt. \u00a0Moreover, Woojin wouldn't be too far from him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He turned his head to look at Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll see you in 4 days. Work hard until then.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin had a determined expression on his face. \u00a0He was overwhelmed by the burden placed on him, but in the end, he had to succeed. \u00a0Jaemin was victorious in his Dimensional Battle, and he had earned a protection period of 4 days. Woojin used that time as a deadline as to when the party would meet up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll see you later.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.

He didn't have a navigation system or a map. They had to fight enemies in a place where the placement of the stars were different, and the length of a day differed from earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, the problem was the fact that they had to find where the enemies were located at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol clasped a small bird to herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis guy will show us the way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-oh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol's ability was Taming. Moreover, she had focused on developing her telepathic ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was someone who had no trouble talking telepathically to 5 people at the same time. \u00a0It was an ability that went well with her base ability of Taming where she was able to communicate in some form with her animals. These were synergistic abilities. \u00a0Haesol could feel to a degree what the small bird had seen and felt in this world. \u00a0It wouldn't be too hard for her to discern the locations of the other Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStay strong, president.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll see you in 4 days.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.

Moreover, it was a level of magic where a human body wouldn't survive a direct hit. If this wasn't some trick, it was really trying to kill him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-hah. \u00a0Are you giving me a compliment?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Lich pushed his head through the smoke created by the explosions as it spoke. \u00a0Sunggoo had an appalled expression on his face. \u00a0Afterwards, Sunggoo didn't have much time to gather his thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk, kwahhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis didn't give Sunggoo the time to think.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a brief moment, Woojin was lost in old memories as he heard the sounds of explosions coming from the rear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHue hue.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had survived, and he had become stronger. \u00a0Sunggoo would do the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, isn\u2019t this a colony?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin narrowed his eyes as he looked at the city that was still in construction. There was a artificial colony built at the center of the city. With the colony at its center, the city was within a fixed radius where the Dimensional lord's power could reach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was like setting up a Dimensional Domain on a planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the words implied, this was a Colony City.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could use the Dimensional Store to buy buildings or dispatch additional troops after being purchased. \u00a0One could also populate the city with Domain residents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could see a castle built atop a hill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entire city looked as if the boulders and steels had harmonized with each other. \u00a0It looked like a mechanical fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the Skeletons advanced , large boulders came flying from the castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boulders weren't the only thing that was sent their way. A cannonball with spikes exploded when it embedded itself on the ground. Fragments were sent flying everywhere. The attack was strong enough to take down Skeletons with a single blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Countless siege weapons were being sent their way, and if Woojin reacted slowly, the loss would be heavy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDolsae.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if the summoned Dolsae knew what Woojin wanted, it gathered the fallen boulders and steel shrapnels to form its enormous body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ohhhhhhhhh!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOpen up a path.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's order, the enormous Golem started running.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each step shook the ground as the sound of the impact rang out. \u00a0At its charge, the boulders being sent from the castle started to aim for Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their aim was quite accurate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The boulder crushed Dolsae's head before it embedded itself into the ground. \u00a0However, Dolsae was still charging forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-goo-goo-goohng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The boulder embedded in the ground started shaking as if a force was pulling on it. It was pulled and integrated into Dolsae's body. \u00a0The broken head was replaced. \u00a0Moreover, its arms got longer and its chest got thicker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bigger Titan of Destruction charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-oh-oh!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A large chunk of magical energy exited Woojin every time Dolsae increased its body size. \u00a0However, he didn't care. \u00a0He could drink potions, and he could recover his magical energy by using Soul Extraction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, Dolsae's large body impacted against the castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The castle wall fell, and a gap was formed. \u00a0Dolsae absorbed the metal and rock from the fallen wall, and Dolsae grew even more. \u00a0Then it started to go on a rampage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCharge and sweep them away!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Charge!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-haha. Increase your speed!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights summoned their Phantom Steeds, and they charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was summoned, and she slowly flew above Woojin\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about we make our own Colony City here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0Mhmmm. It'll be good to have one here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI bet you want to decorate another castle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh heh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi let out a sly laugh as if Woojin had hit the mark. \u00a0There wasn\u2019t a place untouched by Bibi in regards to the Dimensional Domain of Alandal. \u00a0\u00a0The Points given to her as allowance had been used to decorate the castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn't the castle at Alandal big enough?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPi. It is too small.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How big of a castle did she want? \u00a0Woojin pointed at the enormous castle in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis castle....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is more fun to destroy it than to decorate it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026cheee.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's words, Bibi turned her back on him. \u00a0She played coy as she looked at the castle. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. I guess you are right on that point.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo level up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Heh heh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Illusion Witch turned into smoke as she disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Necromancer Immortal's strong power was directly related to his army. \u00a0Since he had a lot of familiars under him, he had to manage their levels. \u00a0War was the best stage for them, and there were a lot of opponents for them to fight on Planet Jaku.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as his Familiars leveled up, a portion of their EXP was sent to Woojin. He didn't even have to lift a finger, and his EXP would rise. \u00a0However, it was a much smaller amount of EXP compared to what he could earn if he moved himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall I start moving?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was mounted on Shing shing as it ran forward. \u00a0An announcement popped up when he approached the castle wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;You've entered Liah's Colony called 'Combat Fortress'.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;She is lost in the nothingness of death. It is impossible to choose Dimensional Battle and Duel.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;If successfully cleared, it is possible to choose 'Demolish'.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a dumbfounded laugh when he read the message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The city looked like it was from a mechanical civilization, and the city looked somewhat familiar. \u00a0This was Liah\u2019s Colony. \u00a0She was the Dimensional lord, who had requested a Duel with him, and he had gained much benefit from defeating her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he realized why a Dimensional lord's death was a terrible thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018She'll be robbed blind, while she is dead.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the pitfall to the 12 days of Protection Period.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It only exempted one from the Dimensional Battle and Duel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it didn\u2019t stop the Adventurers or Challengers from trying to clear the Dungeon or the Colony. \u00a0The Dimensional lord couldn\u2019t respond to the attack, and it was a fatal flaw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one didn\u2019t have a wonderful warrior like Kiba designated as captain of defense, one will have no choice, but to be robbed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if one cleared the Dungeon, it meant the link to this planet would be severed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It basically amounted to one losing a single Dimensional Fragment. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was also true for the Colony, since it was a gate set up at a location other than a Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo that means I can destroy this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a smile draped all over Woojin's face. How great would it be if he could destroy the Dungeons? If he could destroy all the Dugeons on earth, he'll be able to sever all the links possessed by the Dimensional lords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out his Warrior's Weapon as he charged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ahh-ahhk!

Those are essential buildings.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had bought several buildings from the Dimensional Store, and those buildings were being built on the deck. \u00a0There were new workers she had hired, and the Dimensional Domain residents of Alandal were naturally coming back and forth from the Colony and the Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you build all those buildings on the deck, what are we going to do about the planes?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the runway was taken over by the buildings, they would only be able to operate the several helicopters they owned from that space. \u00a0Minchan didn't know what Bibi was planning, so he had come looking for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0Don't worry about it. \u00a0Master decided to give the heli-whatever to Dolsae. \u00a0He prefers to use the Wyverns flying in formation.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi had already been told about Woojin's plans. \u00a0The Wyverns were able to take off vertically, so they didn't need a long runway. \u00a0The outer parts of the Colony city would be decorated by Bibi. \u00a0It was up to her discretion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm. I guess if we use the Wyverns...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After imagining it for a moment, Minchan nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, what did that have to with constructing these buildings....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you building a cafe and a dessert store on top of the deck.....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would understand it if she erected a Wyvern's Nest or a Training Facility. \u00a0Why was building a cafe the most important task on the agenda?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are very important.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan became momentarily speechless at Bibi's sure attitude. \u00a0Currently, restaurants, entertainment facilities and cultural facilities for the residents had already been built beneath the deck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Bibi was filling the top teck with buildings that had nothing to do with battle. \u00a0Moreover, the other races were crossing over from the Dimensional Domain, and the residents of Alandal wasn't used to this sight. \u00a0He worried there would be friction amongst these two groups.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"More importantly, our residents aren't able to communicate with the Dimensional Domain residents....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh yea. \u00a0I'll have to sell some of the Language Drugs.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was direct in her actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could there be such an easy solution like this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was at a loss for words. \u00a0Bibi immediately bought a store that sold Language Drugs from the Dimensional store. \u00a0She would build it right at the base of the control tower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, the Colony city was built through Point consumption. \u00a0If she could complete a \u00a0blueprint, it'll all be built within the day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want you to tell the Domain Residents to buy and eat the Language Drug. \u00a0Tell them to buy it with the Blood Stones.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal's Prime Minister Minchan spoke a long time with Bibi, who held authority over the Colony. \u00a0They discussed various issues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A city where the current Domain Residents and the residents of this planet could gather Bloodstones on earth was being made right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh? What is that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the deck below the control tower, a new portal was formed. \u00a0The eye-catching part was that this new portal was different in color to the red portal next to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems master has made a Colony in Alphen. \u00a0Of course, it hasn't been fully activated yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The aircraft carrier had several portals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the one heading to the Dimensional Domain of Alandal, Seoul Station's 1st exit and Necia's Pillar on planet Jaku.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the newly added portal was activated, a portal heading towards Alphen would be formed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I can head to Alphen if I pass through that one?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0However, you'll need permission from master.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So the king was successful in building his Colony.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn't that a given?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi's faith in Kahng-woojin was the deepest compared to anyone by his side. She was his first familiar, and she had aided him for the longest time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan spoke as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll go ready the second party.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't too long before Che-haesol, Blanka and the Phantom Unit would have to cross over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You do that.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi gave a general answer, then she opened the Dimensional Store. \u00a0She busily started decorating the aircraft carrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Point Total for the Domain was dropping at a rapid pace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A tree was planted on top of the Sauraus mountain. \u00a0Latasha was shocked when she saw how fast it grew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How do you have a World Tree....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tree of Life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mother World Tree communicated with the world, yet a Necromancer, who studied death, had planted it. \u00a0He was the most unlikely person to interact with the World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it was only a symbol chosen for the Colony, and it didn't hold much significance to Woojin. \u00a0However, each person felt differently about such symbols.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What did the crest of your Coalition look like?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alphen's heroes were surprised at Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you so surprised? \u00a0Do you think people will gather if I put up my flag?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to make it known, who is residing at the Sauras mountain. \u00a0In the first place, he hadn't picked this place with his enemies in mind. \u00a0He had placed the Colony here with the surviving Coalition members in mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y...yes, that's right. \u00a0We have to make it known that the Coalition is alive and well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shocking part was that those words had come out from the Immortal's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the person that was breaking down everything in a rational manner was the Immortal. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody made a suggestion as she looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should put up Alandal's flag.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm. \u00a0If I did that, wouldn't people avoid this place?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah...\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody let out a sigh. Just from looking at the expression on the heroes here she knew everyone held a deep-seated fear and wariness towards him. \u00a0She realized how much her way of thinking had changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Kahng-woojin-nim isn't a bad person.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he might be a bad person. \u00a0However, he wasn't the unbelievably scary Necromancer that she had vaguely imagined in her mind. \u00a0At the very least, he was someone she can converse with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had watched Woojin as she lived near him on earth, and this was her feeling on this subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0Let's put this out too.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out the flag that had been purchased by Bibi. \u00a0It had the picture of a cat that seemed to be roaring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was quite different from the symbols and imagery that had been associated with Alandal in Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is Lecia's high priest still alive?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He tried to resist against the Undead Army....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he had killed the high priest. \u00a0Woojin let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shouldn't there be a successor?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody had come back from earth with Woojin. \u00a0She didn't have the answer to his question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The answer came from Latasha's lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The high priest that received Lecia\u2019s Holy Item is staying in the north. \u00a0He is staying at the city of Litan.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ho-oh. \u00a0That's great. You should lead the way.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...why would I...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let\u2019s just go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha frowned, but she didn't have much choice. \u00a0She stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Colony will be activated in a day. \u00a0Do a good job and protect it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Colony had just been formed. \u00a0Until it activated, Woojin didn't have much to do here. \u00a0He'll be able to build a city later through the Dimensional Store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be better for him to go out and find the Items he needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm going to clean the surrounding. \u00a0You should rest a little bit. \u00a0I'll be back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Go-shoo-shoo's army had been annihilated, and he had even stolen Juliel's Colony. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Dimensional lords in this region was dead, but their underlings were still out and about. \u00a0However, Woojin didn't need to stay behind to clear them out of this region when there were no Dimensional lords nearby. \u00a0Sunggoo and the heroes of Alphen was sufficient in being able to take care of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most important part was the fact that he was forming a base camp here. \u00a0He needed either a Colony city or a town. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As time passes, monsters will start to gather around the Sauraus mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he methodically take over the Dungeons and Colonies of other Dimensional lords, they'll start to counter-attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, let's go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha looked at the World Tree once again, then she floated into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Follow me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her body was encased in a fierce wind as she accompanied a Wind Spirit into the air. \u00a0Woojin got on Shing Shing as he chased after Latasha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they left, Melody unfurled the flag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm? \u00a0Is that really the symbol of Alandal?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The combination of those two is a bit...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What sane person would think about Alandal when one saw a picture of a cat? \u00a0She had already seen it several times before, but Melody couldn\u2019t stop her laughter from coming out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's hang it up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We have to advertise the alliance between Alphen's Coalition and Alandal.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They put the two flags representing the two forces in front of the World Tree that was growing atop the Saurus mountaintop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So why is the Immortal trying to find Lecia's high priest?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When trying to predict a person's action, one usually thought about their past actions. \u00a0In the past....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal threatened, stole and killed all the time. \u00a0This was why everyone's expression darkened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal's relationship with the priests, who worshipped the gods, was especially poor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe... \u00a0I wonder if he is planning on stealing Lecia's holy object again...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric was god Skia's monk, and his face crumpled. \u00a0He had experienced it before too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gnashed his teeth when he thought about the time when the Holy Item called Skia's Boots were pulled off his feet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems his desire to collect the Holy Items is still present.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a subject that had been discussed for a long time in the past about the Immortal's peculiar collection</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He broke a branch off the World Tree, and he stole Holy Items from each temple.... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal's Army had been getting to become a serious problem when he started to gather all these treasures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric suddenly looked at this boots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected of being a god of adventurers, Skia's Boots allowed one to run without getting exhausted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Holy Item was newly made when a new high priest appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His boots were the 21st Skia's Boots to be made after the Immortal stole one. \u00a0The boots were a treasure that proved that he was the First Monk of the god Skia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why wasn't he covetous of my Item?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he still coveted the Holy Items, Tauric's Item should have been the first one he should have taken. \u00a0The fact that the Immortal left him alone made him feel leery.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm. \u00a0I have no idea.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn't know why the Immortal went to look for Lecia's high priest, but there was no way he would just unreasonably steal the Item like before. \u00a0They were allies now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were at the biggest lake in the northern region.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that the Litan's Lake?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is a city there?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the final city of the Coalition still left standing. \u00a0However, only the chosen people could enter this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Litan's Lake was large like the sea. \u00a0There was only a single green island floating atop the waters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have to be chosen?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Water Dragons bar intruders from entering the Litan's Lake.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why the city of Litan was able to avoid attacks from the Dimensional lords. \u00a0At the same time, there weren't many in the Coalition that had access to this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was their hideout, and it was also the final supply depot for the Coalition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The food from the Litan's Island provided the main supplies for the Coalition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha sat down at the dock, and she turned to look at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even I do not have permission to enter this place. \u00a0The lookouts at the Litan Island probably caught sight of us already. \u00a0A person will appear soon to talk to us.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's brows furrowed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We have to wait until that time?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the only way you will be able to meet the Lecia's high priest.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one couldn't go to the Litan Island, one had to wait for the people on the island to come out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Woojin smirked as he grabbed the collar of Latasha's shirt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...what the hell are you doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In this world, there is no such thing as an only method.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a binary choice. \u00a0There was a road or there wasn't.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of walking on the road, Immortal frequently made his own roads to travel. \u00a0He grabbed Latasha's back collar, and Shing Shing flew into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T...the Water Dragons will attack....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was dangling in the sky, and Latasha's face turned pale. \u00a0A whirlpool started forming in the lake. There were 17 of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Water Dragons readied their Dragon's Breath.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

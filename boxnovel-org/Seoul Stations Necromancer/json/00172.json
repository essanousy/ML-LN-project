No one here would dare to think of our lord as a pushover.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiba suddenly yelled out. Kiba continued to speak as he looked at the corpses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[They were intentionally sent here. \u00a0It looks to be a mercenary outfit that took a commission from Liah.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why does she keep aiming for me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Liah had failed in taking him down in the Dimensional battle and the Duel. \u00a0Now she was using subterfuge to take down his Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had said that he'll never be able to protect his home planet of earth. \u00a0Her words kept ringing in his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe she wanted to prove her own words. \u00a0This might be why Liah kept harassing him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he didn't have Death Knights like Kiba, he might have had his Domain stolen from under him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn't for his reliable Familiars, her relentless attacks might have worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Were they a bit hard to put down?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It wasn't too hard. \u00a0I barely had to replenish our forces.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then where did my Points go?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll be able to get a full accounting of how his Points were spent by sitting on his Throne. \u00a0He'll find out what had happened by opening his Domain Management Window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin was about to turn away, Kiba suddenly spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I want to run alongside the lord in the battlefield.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Kiba.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could feel a desperate longing emanating from the large Death Knight. \u00a0There were only a small number of Adventurers that attacked the Dimensional Domain of Alandal through the Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were the occasional uprisings, but Kiba could count those instances with a single hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the Defense Commander of the Domain, and his duties were boring him to tears. \u00a0Woojin thought he had neglected Kiba for too long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0I'll replace you with someone else.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll spread a carpet of blood on the lord's battlefield!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Undead Army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the strongest Death Knight. \u00a0The declaration suited Kiba, since he was the spearhead of the army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I like what you are saying.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he glanced at Kiba.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll replace you with a pinch hitter, so just wait a little bit more. \u00a0I'll ride into the next battle with you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I wait for the lord's command!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin returned to the Throne inside the lord's castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's see.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Points that was used to replenish the forces was significant, but this wasn\u2019t a problem. \u00a0He was collecting taxes through his Domain and Colonies. \u00a0He was bringing in more than he was in spending on replenishing troops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't take him long to find the source of the drain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's Bibi.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was in charge of earth\u2019s Colony city. \u00a0She had named it \u2018Bibi\u2019s Castle\u2019, and he had spent a massive amount of points on the city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it wasn\u2019t a problem, since his Points would be increasing as time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future, he\u2019ll be able to gather earth\u2019s Bloodstones through the Colony, so the amount of insignificant in context. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Woojin had just spent twice the amount of Points compared to Bibi when he built the Saurus Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll go see what's going on.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A massive amount of Points had been expended at once. \u00a0There was a small possibility that Bibi had to replenish all her troops in response to an enemy attack. \u00a0He was a little bit worried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had planned on returning to Alphen immediately, but he was curious as to see how much change had occurred at his Colony. \u00a0He passed through the portal to head to Bibi's Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pul-luhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flag with the yawning cat was billowing in the wind. \u00a0When Woojin came out of the portal, he titled his head in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It changed a lot.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The deck had been wide open, but now there were buildings obstructing the view. \u00a0One could call it a town.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were some buildings that looked modern, and there were also buildings that looked similar to the ones in Alphen. \u00a0It felt as if he was walking through an unfamiliar city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bibi.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Master!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's call, a puff of black smoke appeared as Bibi appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh heh. \u00a0How's everything going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, everything is progressing as planned.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh heh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought about how Bibi had remade Alandal, so he could guess at what the Colony would look like. \u00a0However, he hadn\u2019t given her the authority to use his Points, so Bibi could purchase cafes and stores.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How's our defense?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that this was a moving fortress was the most important point in making this Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was very important for it to have defensive capabilities, so it could keep everyone safe. \u00a0One couldn\u2019t half-ass it, and Bibi was well aware of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It burned a lot of Points.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was being boastful, so it seemed she must have used a lot of Points by going overboard on defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the aircraft carrier was much smaller than the Saurus mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It is small yet she had used half the Points needed to construct the Saurus Colony. \u00a0This was why his expectation was high.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Follow me, master. \u00a0I\u2019ll show you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi looked like a child that was showing off a toy she had made.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin followed her up the control tower, and he came face-to-face with Jung-minchan along the way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"K...king!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is wrong with you? Are you sick?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin worriedly asked the pale-faced Minchan. \u00a0Minchan\u2019s face crumpled up as he answered Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"M..motion sickness...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh. \u00a0You are sea sick?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin noticed the vibration beneath his feet, so it seemed the aircraft carrier was on the move right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I...if it was sea sickness, I would be ok, but....Ooh-oohk...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan covered his mouth, and he quickly disappeared down the stairs. \u00a0Woojin shrugged his shoulder as he asked Bibi a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where are we headed?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We wanted to do the move in one sitting, so we decided to head towards Seoul. \u00a0We are currently passing by Daejun.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm. \u00a0It\u2019ll be great if we could move everything at once\u2026 \u00a0Daejun?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. Heh heh. \u00a0I fixed what was broken, so we can fly again.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Broken?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This aircraft carrier was built a long time ago, but it hadn\u2019t been broken\u2026. \u00a0Woojin arrived at the top of the control tower, and he looked out the window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiehhhhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cries of the Wyverns was heard through the window. \u00a0He saw twelve Wyverns flying around the aircraft carrier as an escort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were beings from one of the other race riding the Wyverns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Ratick race are talented riders. \u00a0We decided to always have them deployed as guards. \u00a0They are also tasked to recon the surrounding area.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi started boasting about her accomplishments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I also built cannons, and it can fire in all directions. \u00a0\u00a0The engineer Nosam adapted earth\u2019s technology, so there aren\u2019t any official names for these weapons. \u00a0Why don\u2019t master name them?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi spoke as she pulled up a hologram in front of him. \u00a0She showed him the entire design plans for the modified aircraft carrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 120 openings from front to back, and it was all equipped with cannons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that the cannons weren't only equipped on the side of the aircraft carrier. \u00a0It was built along the keel and the hull.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked like a hedgehog turned over on its back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I also put aside a landing strip for the Wyverns. \u00a0They can be deployed immediately.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked beyond the window to look at the spot being pointed out by Bibi. \u00a0There was an empty spot on the deck, and there was something that looked like a strange looking hill next to it. \u00a0Woojin could see Wyverns coiled and resting on this hill. \u00a0He could see over 40 of them with his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How many?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If I include the Wyverns on patrol, we have 107 Wyverns.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked up at Woojin with twinkling eyes as if to say, \u2018Did I do good?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had tasked her to come up with the defense of the fortress, so he expected this level of defensive capability. \u00a0However\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So we are flying in the sky right now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s expression did not change, so Bibi tried to bring up some of the things she had been working on in secret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm. \u00a0I felt as if we didn\u2019t have enough weapons for offense, so we are developing several weapons. \u00a0Moreover, it would be a drain on our Points, but we are building a barrier that\u2019ll activate when our enemies attack...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0You can stop talking now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin placed his hand on top of Bibi\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This might be an excessive investment, but this was related to the safety of his family. \u00a0This was why he welcomed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You did very well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh heh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin patted Bibi\u2019s head, and he looked out at the view. \u00a0He looked beyond the flying Wyverns, and he could see sunlight peeking out through the clouds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no idea how she came up with the idea to make a flying fortress\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I really like it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn\u2019t it better to fly away in a dangerous situation? \u00a0They wouldn\u2019t be constrained by the sea now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi also laughed when she heard Woojijn\u2019s praise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Saurus Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the nearby monsters had been exterminated, and the survivors in the nearby gathered to grow the Colony. \u00a0As more people came in, Sunggoo and Jaemin had less things to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t needed for hunting down weak monsters. \u00a0It was the job of the inexperienced Phantom Unit and the people of Alphen to hunt down the scrubs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During the dangerous battle, they had always pined for free time. \u00a0Once they got their free time, they were bored now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0When will hyung-nim get back here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have no idea. \u00a0I guess Sunggoo hyung-nim is now accustomed to all of this.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No way. \u00a0I\u2019m not accustomed to it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo felt a chill at the tip of his nose, so he rubbed his hand against it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I read this in a book. \u00a0If a slave is suddenly made a free man, the slave would be unable to get used to the outside world, and he would put the shackles back on himself.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I'm the slave?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm not saying that, but...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Dude. \u00a0You\u2019ve come a long way if you can speak those kinds of words to me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin had an apologetic expression when Sunggoo spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn't say it to make you feel bad.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha. \u00a0Now that I think about it I do want to see Jaenis-nim.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">...he really was the slave in the story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was dumbfounded as he stared at side of Sunggoo\u2019s face. \u00a0He had been subjected to near-death dangers, yet he still wanted to see Jaenis\u2026 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he a masochist?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0I want to eat ramen and kimbap.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Seriously.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin agreed with Sunggoo's words. \u00a0It was as if Alphen's food wasn't edible. \u00a0Moreover, they were able purchase food through the Colony, and it was decent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Sunggoo and Jaemin were natives of Korea. \u00a0At times, they thought about eating rice. \u00a0Their mouths watered especially when they thought about ramen. \u00a0It was something they ate quite often.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Should we go to earth for a brief moment?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Woojin-hyung might discipline you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...let's just be patient.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Kahng-woojin returned to Alphen, he wanted permission to be able to frequently visit earth. \u00a0He was told to clear the nearby monsters, and now he felt like a student that had finished all his homework. \u00a0There was an empty feeling inside him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Elf Lord Latasha approached the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are the heroes of earth talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha was wary and abrasive towards Woojin. \u00a0However, her attitude was a bit better with Sunggoo and Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was actually quite favorable towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, Latasha. \u00a0We are talking about ramen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ramen?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. It is a noodle type food, and it is incredibly delicious. \u00a0It is an earth cuisine, so we aren't able to acquire it here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm. I heard the synchronization with the planet earth isn't finished yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard you\u2019ll be able to buy Items from earth when the Synchronization ends.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional Store had everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Synchronization hadn\u2019t ended, they could buy anything from earthy. \u00a0They could only buy Items from Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, there were similar Items, but....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh? Once the Synchronization ends, we\u2019ll be able to bring earth items through the portal.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Jaemin's words, Sungoo tilted his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow. \u00a0What would hyung like to bring here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want a car.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want a computer.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Latasha heard their conversation, she asked with curiosity in her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems earth has many wondrous things.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When the time comes, I would like to taste the cuisines of earth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At that point, I\u2019ll treat you to some ramen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh!

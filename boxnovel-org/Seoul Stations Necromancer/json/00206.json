It really was a living organism.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the being walking towards them looked humanoid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The earth was completely devastated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It was year 2529, and a person, who was not of the Moon World, had appeared on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This man of unknown identity wasn\u2019t wearing equipments that was needed to purify the air. \u00a0Moreover, he was wearing a cloak made out of a piece of a straw mat. \u00a0He looked like a vagrant seen in the old western films.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was walking slowly towards them, and \u00a0he looked very out of place on this current version of earth. \u00a0The sense of incongruity increased the uneasiness and fear felt by the men.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They couldn\u2019t assume it was human just, because it was walking on its own two feet. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, even if it was a human, not all humans were friendly and safe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Sound the alarm!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes,sir!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone on Leone\u2019s ship were excellent soldiers. \u00a0It took them mere seconds to arm themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Open the hatch.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pshhhhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Leone was wearing a helmet, which filtered the air. \u00a0He descended the spaceship with four armed men.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Stop.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Captain Leone\u2019s warning rang out through the speakers. \u00a0However, the unidentified lifeform didn\u2019t stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their opponent only stopped when they fired warning shots into the air. \u00a0There was only 20 meters between them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was close enough to discern the identity of this being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What the hell is it? \u00a0Is he human?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The Captain and his men kept the barrel of their guns trained on this man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man gave no answer, and Leone unconsciously gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt fear, a sense of vigilance, and wariness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This man wasn\u2019t showing any basic emotions even though he was in an unfamiliar surrounding. \u00a0His attitude was overly bold. \u00a0He acted as if he was the master of this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you human?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was no answer forthcoming in regards to his question. The only thing that had changed was the fact that the man started walking again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took one step after another.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This mysterious being was making Leone feel\u2026 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone was barely able to push down the feeling any human would feel in this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Stop!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone shot another round of warning shots into the air, yet the man didn\u2019t stop his advance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Shit! \u00a0Shoot.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Light erupted from the barrel of the guns held by the soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The charged lazer quickly dropped in power reserves as it shot out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tee-dee-dee-deeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of a blast, there was a strange sound of resonance as the lasers all missed. \u00a0No, it was as if the attacks were being deflected by a barrier. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What the hell!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone pulled out the pistol from his holster on his waist in an agitated manner. \u00a0\u00a0Instead of a laser, this gun was a primitive gun. \u00a0It used gun powder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tah-ahng, tahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bullets flew true, but it was deflected into the sky before it was able reach the forehead of the man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tah-ahng, tah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Eeek....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone had more bullets left, but he could no longer fire it. \u00a0The man was right in front of Leone. \u00a0The man pushed his face forward. \u00a0It was as if he was daring Leone to pull the trigger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone spoke as if a gun was pointed right at his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"W...who are you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Leone couldn\u2019t hide his trembling voice as he asked the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Are you guys from the Moon World?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew the language that had come out from the man\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Where\u2019s Toppler?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone carefully deconstructed the man\u2019s face in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had seen this man\u2019s face during a briefing. \u00a0This man was one of the targets, who was essential to their plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Kahng-woojin....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone didn\u2019t know how this was possible, but Kahng-woojin had appeared on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You really logged out through your own effort....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone mumbled to himself, and Kahng-woojin bared his white teeth as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It seems I\u2019m at the right place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people of Moon World had been phantoms to him, but now they were revealed in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could most definitely feel them. \u00a0He could feel Leone\u2019s\u2026 \u00a0He could feel the souls of the soldiers behind Leone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was tethered to an antenna that looked like a pole. \u00a0It had been four days, and he was hanging there like a corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unidentified Dimensional lord, who was now being called the Black Armor, razed China to the ground. \u00a0It had come straight towards Alandal, and a fight occurred above the Yellow Sea. \u00a0The fight was still ongoing after four days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-ahhhhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The water dragons were like the blue dragons from legend. \u00a0They flew through the air as they let out their Dragon Breath. \u00a0It was an imposing sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the fact that the Black Armor\u2019s power was beyond imagination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Koo-hahahaha]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fight\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard enjoyed the act of destruction. \u00a0\u00a0The Black Armor was laid back as he fought the 17 Dragons, and the Dragons were being killed one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard didn\u2019t have any monsters as underlings. \u00a0It fought alone, and the Undead army was gradually lessening in number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ironically, Dr. Toppler had the front seat in watching this fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Necromancer wasn\u2019t present, the Undeads had to draw their energy from the Colony. \u00a0This was why Bibi\u2019s Castle was never far away from the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Do I have to watch the destruction of earth like this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Reset was out of the question. \u00a0All he could do was watch the revived absolute being eventually acquire the Earth\u2019s Code. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They couldn\u2019t attempt the Reset anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would now be impossible to login to Trahnet from outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could no longer predict the fate of the tens of thousands of people connected to Trahnet. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything will now be in the hands of the absolute being. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Any change to this world would follow the absolute being\u2019s will.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I made a mistake.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The speaker\u2019s words were right. \u00a0There had been too many variables.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The council had travelled the well beaten path for a reason, and they had been right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had acted rashly in meeting Kahng-woojin. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had created a butterfly effect that couldn\u2019t be contained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The original plan was to conduct enough tests in regards to Terraforming. \u00a0Then Iello would be awakened, and the Earth would have been Reset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that Alandal was able to withstand the assault by the absolute being for four days was astonishing. \u00a0If Alandal fell, it would take less than a day for the earth to be razed to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were no other opponent that could stand up to the absolute being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wounded Bone Dragon landed on the deck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The control tower was the Colony\u2019s Symbol. \u00a0The vines encasing the control tower let out a light as it expended energy. \u00a0It quickly regenerated the Bone Dragon\u2019s wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Give me wings!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee-ahhhhhhhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After recovering its energy, Dolsae turned into a ball of blood as it encased the Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler had seen this sight for the seventh time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blood Dragon was no match for the Black Armor. \u00a0It could only prolong the inevitable. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it seemed the Colony\u2019s energy was about to run out. \u00a0The Undead army was being replenished at a much slower rate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"This is the end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The humans were exhausted, and there number of Undead had been reduced. \u00a0The VR Earth was the last incubator of humanity, yet it was about come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Mmmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler groaned as he saw his hands melt away into gray light. \u00a0It seemed his associates were going to attempt a force logout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I made a mistake.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was useless to feel regret over it. \u00a0His relationship with Trahnet would end now. \u00a0His role to save humanity had come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His faded consciousness returned, and his senses recovered at the same time. \u00a0He opened his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Mmmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could see the lid of his capsule had been ripped away. \u00a0When he raised his body, he saw a man, who was standing in front of him with his arms folded. \u00a0Toppler became frightened when he saw the man, who was letting out an odd laugh. </span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

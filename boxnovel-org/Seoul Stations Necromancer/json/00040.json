Accompanying a shock-wave, a virulent poison cloud started to spread to the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the indiscriminate killing started.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The poison had no effect on Woojin. Woojin had moved through the Naga as he took their lives. When the last Naga struggling from pain died, the Wall of Bones came down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The green poisonous cloud, which had filled the Wall of Bones, coalesced into a single location. Wooojin was in the middle of the coalescing poison, and the poison was being sucked into him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of the poisonous gas absorbed back into Woojin as it disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026insane.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was insanely strong. Were Rank A Roused supposed to be this strong? What did Woojin used to do? Why did he hide his strong powers to act as a Rank F Roused?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo felt like Woojin was a person from another world. Somehow, Sunggoo was able to form a bond with such a person. He felt a mixture of surprise, and fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo quickly closed the distance, and Woojin was walked out of the gruesome battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCollect all the loot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had already used his Marking Magic to point out which items had potential value.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? There aren\u2019t any bloodstones, hyung-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally Woojin marked the monsters with bloodstones inside their body, but he hadn\u2019t marked any of the Naga.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Anthropomorphic Race doesn\u2019t possess bloodstones.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust hurry up and pick up the items that are marked.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo started picking up spears, armors and other items that were marked. He would have to go through almost 100 Naga corpses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s \u2018Acceleration\u2019 Skill was first used on a stage where he had to collect the loot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Woojin headed towards the Naga\u2019s temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The building had a basic circular design, and an altar was placed in the middle. As if they were protecting the altar, there was a statue of a Naga Warrior on the right, and a Naga Sorcerer on the left. They stood there in an imposing manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Return Stone was floating in the middle of the altar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked to the altar, and he obtained the Return Stone. Then a box suddenly appeared below where the Return Stone used to be. When he opened it, he saw a single ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess there is only one since this is a basic Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he cleared it for the first time, he had earned 3 rings. However, this was a recursive Dungeon, so it seemed it only gives 1 ring now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took the ring, then he pried the red gem embedded on the pommel of the sword carried by the Naga Warrior statue. Then he took out the blue gem embedded in the forehead of the Naga Sorcerer statue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin used the Analyze magic on the 3 items.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Ring of Healing&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ring received by the Naga Princess as a wedding gift.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Equipped Heal +10</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Naga Warrior\u2019s Keepsake&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">You can earn the same strength as the Naga Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strength +3</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Seal of a Naga Sorcerer&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seal of a Naga Sorcerer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic +3</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNot bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One was an Artifact that adjusted one\u2019s Stat. The other two were consumable items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if this was a basic summons Dungeon, the loots here was quite good. Of course, it wasn\u2019t as good as the first rewards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had earned 3 Artifacts, and 7 consumable items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though the reward lessened, he could still make a tidy profit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow that I think about it I should have more main skills available for the Warrior Class.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">New skills were released every 10 levels for all classes. When Woojin reached level 30, he learned the main skills of a Necromancer. He could now use Golem Summon and Poison Nova. This was also true for the Warrior class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened the Point Store, then he purchased all the level 30 Warrior Skills he found.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Earth Strike&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strike the earth with a large hammer to attack the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Energy consumed : 3</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Whirlwind&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strike the surrounding enemy as you rotate your weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Energy consumed : 1 per Cycle</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Blunt Weapon&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As one trains in the using blunt weapons, one will become more proficient in using it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He also purchased several other skills, but the most important two skills were Earth Strike, and Whirlwind. They were the Warrior Class\u2019 first AOE attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin immediately summoned his Warrior\u2019s Weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Paht.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He read the Steel Staff\u2019s information.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Steel Staff&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Warrior\u2019s Weapons is basically akin to one\u2019s friend and life. The Warrior\u2019s Weapon grows with the user. It will always be with you, and it is always be ready for your call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Effect : Strength +15, Durability Recovery(During Canceled State)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Skill : Summon, Cancel, Change (Spear, Hammer)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The evolved Steel Staff added an additional +5 strength, and it was able to also change into a hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin immediately changed the staff into a hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoht-cha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The head of the staff enlarged into the size of a human\u2019s head, and it changed into a large Hammer. Even with his increased strength, the weapon was quite heavy. Woojin staggered when he first used it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooong, hoong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He swung the hammer, but the center of mass was towards the end of the weapon. It wasn\u2019t an easy weapon to handle. He swung it couple times, and he got the feel of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The passive skill, \u2018Blunt Weapon\u2019, was of big help here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBeing a Warrior is quite useful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he want to use it in an actual battle, he would have to practice using it over and over to increase the Skill Level. Still, it seemed quite useful even though he had just learned it right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin canceled his Warrior\u2019s Weapon, then he put the loots into his inventory. Then he stepped back outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo should be in the midst of picking up the items, but he wasn\u2019t there. Woojin started searching for him, and he found Sunggoo lying down between the Naga.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you sleeping on the job?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he approached Sunggoo, but Sunggoo didn\u2019t say anything. Woojin felt something was wrong, so he ran forward. Woojin saw the sight of Sunggoo on the floor, and his lips had turned blue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His eyes were flipped over, and he was shaking. It seemed Sunggoo\u2019s life was about to be extinguished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPoisoned?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin quickly pulled a Naga\u2019s soul, then he put the energy into Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh. Hy\u2026hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo regained some of his energy. He looked at Woojin with blurry vision, and he was barely able to open his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened.?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh. I cut my hand while I was moving a spear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Naga\u2019s spear was dipped in poison. Woojin looked at Sunggoo with an expression of disbelief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stood up, then he gathered more Naga Spirits, and he poured more energy into Sunggoo. His complexion improved, and he recovered some of his stamina. However, his Poisoned Status did not disappear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHy\u2026hyung-nim. What should I do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think? You\u2019ll just have to die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyung-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo flopped down on to the floor. Ah, so he was going to die like this? His life would come to an end in such a stupid manner?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin clicked his tongue as he looked at Sunggoo, who had fallen in despair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Will the Detox Magic work on him?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to use a proper detoxification or healing spell, he would have to be of the Priest Class or else it would be impossible. Woojin purchased a Detox Magic one could learn before level 10. He had to spend 30 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light started formed in Woojin\u2019s hand and it passed through Sunggoo. However, his Poisoned Status wasn\u2019t dispelled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. It\u2019s not working.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since it was a low level Detox magic, it could only deal with weak poisons. Weak poisons along the level of causing discomfort to one\u2019s stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened his Point Store then he purchased an Antidote. The Antidote suddenly showed up in mid-air in front of Woojin. He handed the Antidote to Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry drinking this. If this doesn\u2019t work, then I really don\u2019t have any other methods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ook, hook. Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo prayed as he opened the bottle\u2019s top, then he took a sip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell? How was it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOooh. I\u2019m not sure. It tastes like uncarbonated cola.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I\u2019m not talking about the taste. Are you being detoxed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh, I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a sigh. He took back the Antidote to inspect its information.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Antidote&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It can cure the Poison Status.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It cannot be given to others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess it won\u2019t work on you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin bitterly shook his head as he looked at the crying Sunggoo. He had become quite attached to Sunggoo, so it was a shame to send him off like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he died like this, he\u2019ll probably haunt him once again\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin faced was turning dark.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could buy the Detox Magic from the Point Store, but he wasn\u2019t of the Magician or Priest class. He had no way of using it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he had grown attached to Sunggoo, so Woojin couldn\u2019t just send him off without doing anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you have a will then tell me. I\u2019ll pass it on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. Hyung-neeeem! Please save me. Ooh-uh-uhng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo cried as he approached Woojin, and he grabbed on to Woojin\u2019s pants leg.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? Hey. I\u2019m not a god. How am I suppose to save you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Woojin was backing away, the content inside the Antidote Bottle sloshed, and it spilled into the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chee-jee-jee-jeek..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Antidote fell on a Naga\u2019s Spear nearby, and it let out a sound as it smoked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes opened wide when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, if he used it like that?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-uh-uhg, Hyungneeem. If you save my life, I will never turn on you. Ooh-uh-uh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had always regretted becoming mad at Woojin in his drunken state. Crazy. He had been crazy. He had lashed out against hyung-nim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pushed Sunggoo, who was tenaciously sticking to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Get off me for a sec.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo wrapped himself around Woojin\u2019s legs as if Woojin was his last lifeline. The only one he could believe in now was Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? I might be able to save you, so get off me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that true? If you can save me, I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen get off me first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I won\u2019t. I will never let go until you save me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Jeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Sunggoo, who was tenaciously clinging on to him. Woojin clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen open your mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo raised his head in surprise. Woojin spoke as he met Sunggoo\u2019s eyes. Sunggoo was told to do as Woojin instructed, then he would be saved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was wrapped around both legs of Woojin, and his gaze fell on that place\u2026. He said to open his mouth. Does that mean\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to either die as a man or live as a gay.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHook hook. Hyung-nim. You swung that way? Hoo-uhng. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you go mad from being at death\u2019s door? Your face is already blue. Hurry up and open your mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s recovered stamina was quickly dwindling in his poisoned state. Sunggoo was becoming dizzy. While he cried, he grabbed Woojin\u2019s belt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2026what the hell are you doing? Didn\u2019t I tell you to open your mouth??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHook hook. Don\u2019t I need to take it out first? Hoo-uh-uhng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo cried as he tried to unbuckle Woojin\u2019s belt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, this mother fucker is giving me a headache.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grabbed Sunggoo\u2019s head, and he forcefully pulled it back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhhhhhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As his head was pulled backwards, Sunggoo cried out in pain. Woojin poured the antidote into Sunggoo\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhhhk-gahhhk-gooroooook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a scream, and a gargling noise, the antidote disappeared into Sunggoo\u2019s gullet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-rook. Kuk, kuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the liquid went into his airway, so Sunggoo coughed as he cried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHook hook. Does hyung-nim like the rough stuff?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just shut your mouth unless you want to be beaten?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ve been detoxed..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ook, yes? What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was started touching his face in surprise. He didn\u2019t have any fever, and his sight had returned to normal. The pain in his head was gone, and he was now sure he had escaped his poisoned state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smiled when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Now I know how to use the consumable items.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The items bought from the Point Stores will lose its magical property at the same time as it was given away. When Sunggoo drank the antidote by himself, it had turned into regular water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed only Woojin could use it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he couldn\u2019t transfer it to someone, then he would just have to use it himself. He just had to feed it to the other person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was filled with joy from the fact that he would live, and a strong question popped up in his mind. This was the most important question in Sunggoo\u2019s life now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I don\u2019t have to do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did this bastard go mad from the poisoning?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This guy was uttering nonsense for some time now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim wasn\u2019t a homosexual?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Warrior\u2019s Rage have been activated.&gt;</p><br/><p>&lt;Your Stat has been increased.

\u00a0It isn't as if the Water Dragons can fly. \u00a0Can they?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They can.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...what?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was dumbfound as he looked at Latasha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They can fly?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...we have to take shelter...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-ah-ah-ah!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The whirlpool split apart as the heads of the Dragons surfaced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ah-ah!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the roars, the Dragons appeared. \u00a0They were so long that their tails were still within the water even though the Dragons had almost reached Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oohk!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin quickly shifted his body, and he avoided the sharp teeth of a Dragon. \u00a0The Dragons had long whiskers as long as its body, and it was reminiscent of a catfish. \u00a0Moreover, it was closer to looking like an Eastern Dragon from legend then a Western Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 17 of them, and they rose into the sky as if they were swimming through sky. \u00a0When they earnestly started to attack Woojin, he couldn't defend against it for too long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'My souls will dissipate first.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Soul Armor had enough souls in storage, it formed a barrier to automatically protect Woojin. \u00a0The continuous threats were quickly dissipating his Souls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had diligently gathered souls after he arrived at Alphen, yet he might regrettably lose all he had gained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time Woojin felt taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They quickly changed direction, and they escaped from the skies above Litan Lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They landed on the ground as if skipping across the ground. \u00a0The 17 Dragons, which had been swimming in the air, glared at Woojin, then they returned below the surface of the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chah-ah-ahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lake waters became waves as it wetted the land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kook. \u00a0What the hell?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin got up, and he looked at the sloshing lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kuhk. \u00a0What did I tell you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha had rolled alongside Woojin, so she scolded him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had pompously stepped forward, yet he had come up with empty results.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha was about to say something more, but she shut up when the furrows on his forehead deepened. \u00a0There was nothing good about unnecessarily getting on his nerves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, the Water Dragons were a disaster level power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was so bad that Trahnet's Dimensional lord left this place alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just because he was the Immortal didn't mean he'll do any better. \u00a0Latasha made this accusation inside her head as she check up on the Immortal's expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Laughter? Was he really laughing right now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is fun.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he laughed for a brief moment, he took out his Warrior's Weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he trying to attempt it again? \u00a0Was he going to go against the Water Dragons of the Litan\u2019s Lake?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y...you are being reckless!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We won't know what will happen unless I try it out.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, the first Dragon he had caught was hard, but it got easier as he hunted several more of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be a bit troublesome fighting 17 of them, but it wasn't as if it was impossible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't alone either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-shoo-shoohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black smoke coalesced around Woojin to form Death Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Are we hunting Dragons?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It has been awhile since we've seen Dragons.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I think this is the Litan's Lake....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the Death Knights were Woojin's familiars, but they were all from different races. \u00a0Moreover, they all had distinct personalities. \u00a0Their memories all varied, so several of them knew about the Water Dragons residing in Litan's Lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't matter what they remembered. \u00a0If Woojin ordered it, they wouldn't hesitate to charge forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ha-ha. \u00a0Are you trying to make friends for Yong Yong?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lich Jaenis was summoned besides Woojin. \u00a0It would be possible to hunt all of the Water Dragons at the same time if Jaenis was by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be possible with the help of a Lich, who was unrivalled at Debuff magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, they would be unrivalled if Dolsae joined the party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be best if Yong Yong was with him, but he had enough power to hunt down the Dragons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to confidently step forward towards the lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's do this ag....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to speak gallantly when he swallowed his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shahhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A boat was swiftly moving through the water towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of the boat, a 10 year old boy was steering the boat. \u00a0He was wearing clothes that were way too big for him. \u00a0Woojin tilted his head in confusion when he realized the clothes looked familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What the hell?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The boat docked, and the boy placed a ladder over the railing. \u00a0When he got off the boat, he approached Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were Death Knights lined up all around him, yet the boy didn't back down at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The boy stood in front of Woojin, and he gave his greeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A cowl was precariously hanging on top of his head, but it refused to fall off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you the Immortal?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's eyes twinkled when the clear voice came out of the boy's lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you Lecia's high priest?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I am.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I hadn't called you, so why did you come out here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn't invite you, so why did you come here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\".....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't say anything. \u00a0He silently stared at the boy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If the sacrifice of myself could protect the Litan's Island, it is worth it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why do you think I'm here to kill you\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aren\u2019t you here for the Lecia's Gloves?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The boy pushed Lecia's Gloves towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Holy Item that could grow a bud from all seeds, and it guaranteed the harvest of fruits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was Lecia's treasure. \u00a0He was the god of fertility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, a high priest's authority was diminished when one lost the Holy Item. \u00a0In certain circumstances, it was a worse offense to lose the Item than to die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was voluntarily giving away such a treasure....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he a plucky little guy? \u00a0Or was he being sensible?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll use it well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unhesitatingly took the gloves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Ingredient Item needed to make Thrash's Punishment. \u00a0The Holy Items were basically tokens of the high priests. \u00a0However, as Lecia's high priest, he didn't look bothered at losing the Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I pray that the oracle comes to pass.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The oracle...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What did Lecia say?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The boy let out a faint laugh at the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal was a being that had faced the gods. \u00a0He wasn't an insignificant being to the priests, who worshipped those gods. \u00a0He had received an oracle yesterday night.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I was told to give you the treasure. \u00a0She told me my wishes will come true if I do....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin blankly stared down at the gloves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gathered three Items that were crucial in making Thrash's Protection, March, and Punishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He only had two left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unsummoned his familiars, and he left behind the Litan's Lake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">New Colony on the Saurus Mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People were gathered in groups of twos and three around the World Tree. \u00a0They were building houses, and the two flags were planted in the middle of everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So that's what you were talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people kept talking about the identity of the flag besides the Coalition's flag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a roaring baby lion. \u00a0No, it kind of looked like a cute tiger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can't believe that is the Immortal's symbol. \u00a0What does it mean?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn't it roaring towards the world?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it is just yawning....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The common thread amongst these discussions were the Immortal's symbol. \u00a0They were guessing the meaning behind it. \u00a0The cute image didn't match up with the Immortal, and this incongruity fostered their curiosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sure it is a lion.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you saying! \u00a0It's obviously a tiger.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a topic that kept flaring up between the people. \u00a0The one that was the most curious was the young king of the Honshoo kingdom named Kontz.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had heard about the Immortal through oral history, and this was the first time he had seen the Immortal. \u00a0It was the first time he had seen the Undead army fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal was much different from the stories his father had told him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal's existence was sufficient enough to draw the curiosity and admiration out of the young ruler Kontz.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several dozen lookouts around the Sauraus mountain hastily made out of wooden logs. \u00a0Both the flags of Alandal and Coalition were hung out on these outposts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kontz had climbed up one of these lookouts, and he let out a bright laugh when he saw a fireball coming towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sunggoo-nim is back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heroes that had accompanied the Immortal was no joke. \u00a0There was a Vampire Lord and a Fire Spirit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weren't they worthy of being companions of the Immortal?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was very good at drinking alcohol. \u00a0His shoulder dance made everyone want to dance, and he was great at leading a party. \u00a0Kontz had never heard of a Fire Spirit that was great at drinking alcohol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sunggoo-nim is back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kontz had become fairly close with him as they shared alcohol. \u00a0Kontz quickly came down from the look out, and he vigorously shook his arms in greeting. \u00a0The arc of fire in the air located Kontz, and the fire landed right in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kontz.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you for your hard work.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh heh. \u00a0I have to practice a little bit more before I head back to training.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As expected.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so strong, yet he still thinking about training....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is something I always wanted to ask you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it? \u00a0Anyways, hasn't it been a day since the Colony was built? \u00a0Shouldn't it be done by now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmm? I think it should be done soon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kontz looked up at the sun in the sky, and it looked to be in the same spot as yesterday. \u00a0He nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let us talk as we walk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you want to ask me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The people are very curious about Alandal's symbol. \u00a0Is it a lion or a tiger?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo tilted his head in confusion as he looked at the flag. \u00a0The first person that came to mind was Bibi when he saw it....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is probably a cat.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don't know what a cat is?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I do, but...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sure.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kontz looked disappointed by Sunggoo's answer. \u00a0It looked as if his high expectation was stabbed in the back. \u00a0Sunggoo shrugged his shoulders as he looked at Kontz's sulking face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew the flag was hung around Alandal, but he had never asked about how it came to be. \u00a0This was why Sunggoo didn't know the story behind it. \u00a0The only thing he knew was that the picture made him think about Bibi. \u00a0That was what what came to his mind first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha. \u00a0I'm pretty sure the Holy Maiden knows the story behind it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course! I'll have to quickly go see Melody-nim.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In any case, all the heroes of the Coalition was climbing up the Saurus mountain to watch the completion of the Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had superior physical ability compared to the civilians, so they would be able to climb the mountain in a short amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin had gotten there before Sunggoo. \u00a0He approached Jaemin, who had a sour expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Jaemin! \u00a0Is something wrong?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh. \u00a0What's up?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you hear about the oracle?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo didn't know what Jaemin was talking about, so he tilted his head in confusion. \u00a0Jaemin discreetly pointed towards Melody, who was kneeling in front of the World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I heard the goddess Aria gave an oracle before Woojin-hyung came back to Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What about it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn't anyone, who went to school, know that gods and goddesses gave oracles? \u00a0Wasn't it a given?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Goddess Aria is the goddess of prophecy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he talking about a prophecy?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo's expression also got serious, and Sunggoo asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What did she say?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin opened his mouth with a dark expression.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

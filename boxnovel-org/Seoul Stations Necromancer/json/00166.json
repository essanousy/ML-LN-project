Yes..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody was taken back at Woojin's out of character offer. \u00a0She grabbed his hand, and she got on Shing Shing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heeeeeng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shing Shing didn't like the Holy Maiden being on it, so it let out a rough snort. \u00a0However, it didn't do anything rash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"After we look around Alandal, we can go to the coalition lands..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know if Alandal remained or if it was destroyed. \u00a0However, he would have to check up on it with his own eyes. \u00a0He'll have to check to see if a Colony could be formed there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh yeah. \u00a0Before I do that...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were welcome presents all around for his return to Alphen. \u00a0He couldn't just leave them behind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wake up!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhhhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magical energy flowed out of Woojin's body, and it swirled around the corpses nearby. \u00a0The corpses were raised as Undeads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-uh-uh-uh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ones that looked mobile were brought back as Zombies. \u00a0The rest were returned as Skeleton Warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shing Shing ran across the sky. \u00a0Sunggoo gave his body to the burning flame, and he flew across the sky like a rocket. \u00a0Jaemin chased after them after morphing into a bat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, several hundred Undead had been created, and they madly dashed after Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shing Shing was running at frightening speed, and Melody was afraid she would fall off the Phantom Steed. \u00a0She grabbed Woojin's waist tighter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous praying mantises, Vesics, were chasing after the people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Keh-roohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were dripping poisonous spit from their mouths as they tirelessly moved their legs. \u00a0If the Vesics caught up to the humans, it meant death to the group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Muster up your energy!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The leader was a big and strong man. \u00a0He yelled out loudly. \u00a0He was taking up the rear most position of the group that was running away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-ahhhp!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bald heroic man held a mace in his hand. \u00a0He swung it to break open the heads of the Vesics. \u00a0He had killed three with a single blow when one jumped high into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Look above, Tauric-nim!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the girl's shout, Tauric reflexively swung his mace. \u00a0He was able to strike the body of the Vesic. \u00a0The scythe-like appendage grazed across his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A shallow wound formed as a thin red line appeared on his bald head. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Jeez! \u00a0Hurry up and run away!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric turned his body to increase his speed. \u00a0He grabbed his bald head with the hand that wasn't holding the mace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a pure light, the wound on his head was completely healed. \u00a0When one of the girl that couldn't keep up with the group fell down, he ran while holding her by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-oohk, Tauric-nim.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't cry, my child.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wooooooong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light flowed out of Tauric's body, and it surrounded the twenty people that was running in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Muster up your energy!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They ran as if their lives were on the line. \u00a0They had to live. \u00a0Strength returned to their shaking legs. \u00a0Each of the adults were holding one or two children. \u00a0They hugged the children tighter as if they cherished them more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are we going to die?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the little girl's question, Tauric put on a smile that was always overflowing with energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't worry! \u00a0We just have to survive as we sincerely hope for a miracle. \u00a0It will happen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-hoohk. \u00a0Yes! \u00a0I can run by myself now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric put down the girl as he ran. \u00a0The girl quickly caught up to the back of the running adults.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 20 Vesics chasing after them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">More would gather at this location when they heard the sound of the pursuit. \u00a0However, the only thing they could do right now was to fight and run at the same time. \u00a0The people that were running right now were all that was left of their village.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they wanted to fight, they could. \u00a0However, the children would be killed or injured if they did so. \u00a0Even if it was a tough task, Tauric would whittle down the number of Vesics chasing them from the rear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What tenacious bastards!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Vesic died every time Tauric swung his mace. \u00a0If he was injured, he healed himself. \u00a0After killing two Vesics, he was about to run again when his eyes turned round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? Why did you stop...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people in front of him had stopped running. \u00a0When he joined the group, he didn't even have to ask the question. \u00a0There were 12 spider-like monsters with tentacles called Launchers in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Keh-eh-ehk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Vesics finally caught up to them, and they surrounded the group of humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tauric-nim...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone's faces were filled with despair. \u00a0The adults put down the children, and they grabbed the weapons on their waist. \u00a0They had no choice, but to fight even if they would most likely be wiped out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, they wouldn't all be wiped out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monk Tauric, who served the god Skia, wouldn't die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh Skia...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric spoke a quiet prayer as he grabbed his mace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, he wasn't swept up by despair. \u00a0He had travelled too hard of a road to give up now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His muscles expanded as the clothes on his body billowed around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a battle, he couldn't protect everyone. \u00a0Children would die in this battle, and sadness would seek him out afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He decided to use his Rage, so he could pre-emptively strike fear into the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooooooohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A radiant pink light surrounded Tauric's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tauric-nim! \u00a0Look over there!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the girl let out a shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwahhhhhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A fireball was falling from the sky. \u00a0It was heading for the spider monsters called Launchers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric's eyes widened in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwehhhhhhk! \u00a0Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An arrow pierced through the Vesic that had charged forward. \u00a0Tauric turned his gaze towards where the arrow had come from.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, my god...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only few heroes left in this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the heroes of the coalition. \u00a0They were the last hope of this land, and they were gathered to collect the Dimensional Fragments from the bases of their enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mage Graham and the Elven Lady Latasha appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are saved!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's Graham-nim!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's the Silver Arrow!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some in the group had fought alongside these heroes in battle, so they cheered when they recognized the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the two group joined forces, the Vesics and Launchers were defeated in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric greeted them with a happy face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You were right on time! \u00a0Well met!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You've done a good job. \u00a0What happened to the town?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric shook his head from side to side at Graham's question. \u00a0The hidden village had been found, and destroyed. \u00a0Most of the villagers had died. \u00a0The thirty people here were all that was left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, half of them were children.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit! \u00a0Those Vesic bastards are everywhere now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beautiful Elf Latasha had a delicate face, but she let out a string of cuss words. \u00a0Her forest had been destroyed, and there were no longer any Elves that prohibited themselves from taking life on this planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only the warriors were able to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What happened to the rest of your party that went to attack the Go-shoo-shoo colony?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham shook his head from side to side at Tauric's question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We failed to clear it. \u00a0The rest of our members have dispersed to save as many people as possible.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The news only held despair. \u00a0Tauric's face darkened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Go-shoo-shoo was the Dimensional lord that had newly built a colony city in this region. \u00a0The monsters that lived in this Domain was massing in numbers, and they were encroaching on the surrounding territories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the bastard's colony was destroyed, they would be able to stop the proliferation of the monsters. \u00a0It would give them some room to breathe. \u00a0However, they had failed. \u00a0They would have to abandon this land to find a new place to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The attack hadn't just happened at the town where Tauric was in residence. \u00a0Other towns had all been attacked, and the heroes decided to go in twos and threes to save the towns.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kieeeehhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a large life form appeared in the air as it let out a long screech.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit! \u00a0It's a Feris!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a massive stingray that could fly through the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was large enough to blot out the sun if it flew over you. \u00a0In terms of size, it was a flying monster that rivalled the size of a Dragon. \u00a0The true reason why everyone was afraid of this monster was the fact that it acted as a carrier for other monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-shoo-shoohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Vesics were on top of the Feris. \u00a0The Vesics unfurled their dragonfly-like wings as they flooded down from the skies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Doo-doo-doo-doo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These weren't the only monsters. \u00a0The ground shook around them as the mole monsters named Tudon pushed their heads out of the ground. \u00a0The Tudons were coming up all around them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hah. \u00a0It seems the offensive capability of Go-shoo-shoo's army is beyond imagination.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric, Graham and Latasha's faces darkened at the overwhelming number of monsters. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They could run away, but if they did, thirty people would die. \u00a0Even if they fought, they couldn't guarantee the lives of the people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most devastating part was that these children could become heroes and archmages in the future. \u00a0The lives of these children would be snuffed out, and it would have been all for naught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's retreat.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham nodded his head at Latasha's words. \u00a0Monk Tauric held his mouth firmly shut. \u00a0Tauric was about to open his mouth when he felt a delicate touch on his rough hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A child had grabbed his hand, and she was looking up at him with tear-filled eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are we going to die?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is there no miracles left?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the child, who was close to tears, knew what her future held. \u00a0Tauric turned to look at his companions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's fight.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's unreasonable.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then the two of you may escape to safety. \u00a0I'll do my best to save these people..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham spoke with great care at Tauric's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are Skia's Monk. \u00a0You shouldn't recklessly use your body like this. \u00a0You have bigger tasks to accomplish in the future. \u00a0I can't let you die in vain.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric's power wasn't weak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is my mission to save the lives of the children. \u00a0There is nothing more important than that.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham shook his head from side to side at Tauric's stubbornness. \u00a0To make matters worse, two more Feris had appeared, and the Vesics were jumping off of them too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sky was covered with the praying mantis monsters. \u00a0It wasn't a beautiful sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If dying in this place was arranged by Skiah-nim, I will not refuse it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric was firm in his words. \u00a0At his words, Graham raised his staff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess we have no choice then.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric was someone the survivors of Alphen needed. \u00a0He was essential to them. \u00a0The Holy Maiden was gone now. \u00a0There was no hero that was as well versed in Healing magic as Tauric.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no choice, but to help the Monk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they wanted to run away after defeating this swarm of monsters, this was their last chance. \u00a0They had to do it before the Dimensional lord Go-shoo-shoo made an appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were getting ready for battle when something extraordinary occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a large explosion, a Feris in the sky was suddenly falling in flames.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Doo-doo-doo-doo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually, they heard the ground ring out, and they saw a large Undead army appear from over the ridge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of this army, one could see Death Knights charging on their Phantom Steeds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My god.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha's face turned white.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's the Immortal's Army!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham's body trembled as he dropped his staff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was futile. \u00a0There was no point in struggling to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the icon of hope, Tauric shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is no miracle coming...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never would have expected to meet the Immortal's army here...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The towns people fell to the floor in despair as they saw the large Undead army charging towards them. \u00a0All that was left was to wait for their eventual deaths.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a child let out a shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's the Holy Maiden! \u00a0It's Melody-nim!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\".....!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric raised his head at the child's shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked toward the rear of the Undead army. \u00a0The Immortal was on top of a large Phantom Steed, and it was walking slowly towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unbelievably, the Holy Maiden Melody was riding behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit! The Immortal was the one that had kidnapped the Holy Maiden?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden had been their beacon of hope. \u00a0There had been no news of her for a long time. \u00a0They had endured enormous suffering during her absence. \u00a0However, they would have never thought that the Immortal had gotten in the way of the Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Tauric was glaring at the Immortal, the Undead army charged towards the Vesics that had landed on the ground.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

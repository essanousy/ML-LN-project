My free time will be decreasing drastically starting today. I\u2019ll have to push translating novels to a lower priority. I\u2019ll try to stick to the regular schedule. Also, since I have less time, sponsored chapter will probably take two days instead of one. I hope you guys understand. Thanks~)</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin got off the bus, then he took out his phone to launch the map app. While it was loading, he saw a round bar rotating forever. He wondered how he should get rid of that damn phone salesman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After 30 seconds had passed, the map finally showed up. Woojin used the navigation function to head toward his destination. After searching for the destination, he had to wait a long minute before it started to give him directions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Roused General Affairs Bureau]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin came to the General Affairs Bureau to register himself as a Roused. At the reception desk, Woojin wrote down his basic biological data and his ability. He took a receipt number, and after a brief time, he headed towards the examination room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The examination room had cameras everywhere, and two Roused from the Bureau was stationed there in case of any unforeseen event. Also, there was a public official sitting there to process the test results.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Oh-joonhwan, who had returned to the General Affairs Bureau, looked over Kang-woojin\u2019s file.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have a summoning ability? Could you show it to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin answered his very businesslike questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRight here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stood there blankly, so Joonhwan moved his gaze towards his monitor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Uh? Have I met him before?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been only four days since he had since his face, but Woojin\u2019s outfit differed too much from his current outfit. Oh-joonhwan couldn\u2019t recognize him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI need a vector.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, you have a mass summoning ability. What kind of vector do you need?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive me one corpse.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Joonhwan and the two Roused from the Bureau was taken aback. Woojin smirked as he added more words afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not talking about a human corpse. It could be a monster or even a dead animal. It needs to have bones. Ah, of course, human corpses are fine too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI..I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though Joonhwan was taken aback, he called the Support Division. Soon, the Support Division brought a corpse of a bunny, which had been killed during an experiment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spread his hand towards the corpse placed in the middle of the examination room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWake up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pak!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bunny\u2019s corpse exploded, and a Skeleton Soldier suddenly surged up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-kee-keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonhwan gulped as the Skeleton Soldier\u2019s producing a bizarre sound. He had seen all types of weird Roused abilities, but this scene was a new one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Joonhwan was only a rank 9, so it was his first time seeing this. However, it wasn\u2019t as if there weren\u2019t any Roused with such abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2026you are a Necromancer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused were given various titles based on their abilities like Magician, Warrior or Priest. Of course, there were Necromancers, who controlled the Undead. There were even some famous people amongst the Necromancers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs you can see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSummoner\u2019s ability is given a Roused rank based on their summoned being\u2019s battle ability. Why don\u2019t you try attacking that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the middle of the examination room, a hologram appeared, so Woojin looked around the examination room anew. There were numerous equipment installed around the domed examination room, and it was projecting the hologram.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThink of it as a simulated battle. I just want to see your summoned being\u2019s movement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hologram was kobold, and it had a small body. It was a monster as common as the Drabbit, but they were harder to hunt since they like to group together. Moreover, they behaved like a swarm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Soldier moved according to his will, and it started to fight the Kobold. It didn\u2019t have a real body, so his bone knife passed right through it. However, the machines installed around the surrounding picked up all the movements as it took measurements.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After five minutes had passed, Joohwan told him to stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have any other abilities?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any other notable abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm, Wait a moment. Could you follow me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonhwan directed him to a break room. He said he\u2019ll only take a moment, but Joonhwan took an hour before he came back with a black card. It looked like a high quality credit card, but it had his picture imprinted on it like his ID.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is your Roused registration card. It can be used as an ID and a debit card.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The card simply had his personal profile, and there was a rank F written on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs Rank F really that low?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. It can\u2019t be considered high. No, it it is the lowest. Summoner\u2019s battle abilities are weaker than expected\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course. He hadn\u2019t put his points into the lvl 1 Skeleton Soldiers. They could only exert half the strength of an adult.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. Well, if one\u2019s rank is too low, is there a restriction on which Dungeons you can enter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is no such thing. However, the party is distributed based on your rank when you are forming a party. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That wasn\u2019t a problem. He didn\u2019t want to form a party. He planned on using the Dungeon by himself. Woojin could sever a steel bar with his bare hands, and he could simultaneously move 14 of his summoned beings. Therefore, he didn\u2019t make a fuss out of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me. Have I seen you somewhere?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Oh-joonhwan\u2019s question, Woojin tilted his head in confusion. He didn\u2019t try hard to comb over his old memories. No, he thought it wasn\u2019t worth it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the first time. Have a nice day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin immediately left the Bureau, and Joonhwan scratched the back of his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I know I\u2019ve seen him somewhere\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he kept having an uncomfortable feeling. He was able to find the source of the discomfort only when Joohwan returned to his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! He was that guy from before. Gwachun Station\u2019s 1st Exit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the first day he returned from his temp job, Joonhwan had been berated by his superior. The reason being he hadn\u2019t been vigilant in controlling the access to the Dungeon. Joonhwan searched through his drawer, and he took out the access record to the Gwachun Station\u2019s 1st Exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Name : Kang-woojin, Affiliation : Planet Earth, Roused Number : 12345]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw the cheeky answer on the record again, his fists shook again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s a rank F and not a high rank? Moreover, he is a noob, who just registered today. Jeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonhwan was berated by his superior, because of this bastard, and he had been in a huff for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? He is only Rank F yet how did he clear it by himself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Gwachun Station\u2019s 1st Exit had Drabbits. They didn\u2019t drop any Bloodstones, but it wasn\u2019t a dungeon where a F rank could clear it on his own.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonhwan tilted his head, then he threw the file on the desk. He won\u2019t see him again, so why should he care?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving the Bureau, Woojin took out his smart phone then he opened the Dungeon Forum. He almost exploded from frustration when the loading screen took a while before the app started running.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he had learned from Jaemin, he set the search option to the entrance fee of 10,000 won. Then he selected a monster rank that was 2 ranks below his summoned monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the closest one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin checked for a bus line that goes to the [Shinrim Station\u2019s 7th Exit Dungeon], then he waited at the bus station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMan, this app is quite convenient..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past 5 years, the Dungeons born from the train stations weren\u2019t the only thing new. In the past, only few people had smart phones, but everyone had one now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there were a lot of convenient apps that were helpful in real life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he got closer to the Shinrim Station, the buildings\u2019 height became lower, and the surrounding became desolate. The area around the station wasn\u2019t thriving with buildings. There were occasional vacant lots at the intersections, and he saw a really big parking lot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt looks like the Dungeon Break happened here at least once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If not, he had no explanation as to why the perfectly fine buildings were shuttered. There wouldn\u2019t be any empty lots present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he previously headed toward the 1st Exit, there were army troops already deployed there. His current destination, the 7th exit, had a crowd of people in front of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had come here after reading a famous blog. It seemed many netizens had rushed over here. He shook his head when he saw the long line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The low entrance fee, and the 2 rank below monsters meant the risk was small, but the competition to make money at the Mine was fierce.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had no choice, but to get in line. Everyone was gathered in small groups, so it seemed like they were working together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when a man with sharp features spoke to him from further in front of the line.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

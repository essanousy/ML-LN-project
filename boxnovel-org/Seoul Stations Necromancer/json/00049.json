There were signs of a struggle, and he saw several corpses of monsters sparsely scattered about the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgee-rick!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He glimpsed the goblins between the trees, so Woojin quickly summoned his Bone Spears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-ooh-oohng, Puk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgueh-rook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Spear immediately flew towards the 3 hidden goblins, and it killed all three at once. He looked around the surrounding, and he expanded his senses. However, he couldn\u2019t feel any more living beings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The upper predators must backed off, and the goblins were left as scouts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the corpses in the surrounding was goblins, but there were also two trolls. Troll corpses were quite valuable. The fact that the previous groups weren\u2019t able to harvest it meant they had been quite hasty in their retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t they say the last team was from Japan?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tried to take out the printed data from his pocket, but it wasn\u2019t there. He searched his other pocket, and his hand phone was gone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I can\u2019t bring stuff from outside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s clothes didn\u2019t disappear since it was made from materials found in the Dungeons. The Roused, who regularly enters the high rank Dungeons, wear clothes made from materials from Dungeons by default.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No wonder Jung-minchan had bought several set of clothes, and he had given the clothes to him and Sunggoo\u2026 Jung-minchan was able to take care of even these little details. He thought Minchan was quite talented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the portal disappeared, and the last light from the portal disappeared. Then it spat out a person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After coming out from the Portal, Lee-yunhwee started to yell again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh! Crazy. I did it again!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s brows furrowed when Lee-yunhwee showed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What do you mean what? I\u2019ve gone crazy and entered the portal because of you. Why the fuck did you have to lose your mind in front of me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck. If you want to die, then you should just die by yourself. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why did you have to flip out in front of me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who told her to come in? She came in here by herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he withdrew his gaze from Lee-yunhwee, Woojin started walking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yunhwee grabbed Woojin\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou crazy son of a bitch. Where are you going to go by yourself? I\u2019ll lead from the front. Since you are a magician, just support me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked down at Yunhwee\u2019s hand, which was grabbing his shoulder. It had been awhile! It had been a long time since someone touched his body without his consent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned his head to look at Yunhwee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you want a beating?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned his body, and he looked at Yunhwee straight on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek, Jjak!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s hand slapped Yunhwee\u2019s cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t even have time to avoid it. Her cheek glowed red after she was slapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was confused and taken aback only for a moment. She immediately reacted in anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chang!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her ring suddenly changed into a sword. She swung it towards Woojin, but he had summoned his Steel Staff to block her sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bba-gahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s foot flew in, and he kicked her shin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her legs buckled. She screamed as she started to fall to the floor, but her body was lifted into the air faster than she could fall. Woojin grabbed the back of her neck, and he slapped her once more on her cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbahhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a dull sound, she was flung away, and she slammed into the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeeeek. You son\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeeek. Ggoo-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped quickly, and he brought down his Steel Staff. It grazed the end of her nose as it embedded itself in the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSee what will happen if you say one more word.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it\u2019s your wish, I can make you like the headless horseman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEee eee\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yunhwee gritted her teeth, and she growled. However, she couldn\u2019t\u2019 do anything. She knew the truth when she saw Woojin\u2019s eyes. He wasn\u2019t joking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ignorant bitch. Mother fucker. How can he beat a woman like this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To her?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He did this to her, Lee-yunhwee?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had never been hit by man in her life. She had been wounded until the brink of death fighting monsters, but she had never thought she would be assaulted by a human.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hate bitches like you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned his Bone Spear. He grazed her as he stabbed it into the ground. A chill crawled up Yunhwee\u2019s spine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop trying to push your wrong on to others.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who told her to enter the Dungeon? She came in here on her own volition, so how could it be someone else\u2019s fault? She basically came here to snatch his EXP away, and be carried\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou were beaten since you are weak. Don\u2019t blame others for not being able to protect you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned a second Bone Spear, and he pierced the ground on the opposite side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou soul reeks from it being filled with evil thoughts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stepped back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want another beating, then follow me. If you want to live, then stay here obediently. I\u2019ll take you out with me when I leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeee\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her lips wouldn\u2019t open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee bit her lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She yielded to him. She yielded to him!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It made her feel so dirty!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned when he saw her growl like a wild animal with a bit in its mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if he couldn\u2019t kill her. He just didn\u2019t want to add such a bitch to his collection of evil spirits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwa-jajajajahk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Spears on either side of her grew teeth, and it grew into a jail made out of bones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned his back on her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeek. You crazy bastard. What are you going to do by yourself! This is a 6 star Dungeon!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if answering her frantic shout, Woojin extended his arm. A considerable amount of magic exited him at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-pahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblin corpses strewn around the surrounding exploded, and a large quantity of Skeletons were summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee kee kee keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeh keh keh keh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A morbidly strange sound came out of the Skeletons, and they swayed after Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy bitch. When did I say I was alone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, Kang-Woojin. Your temper has died down alot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bitches like that wouldn\u2019t have been able to raise their head in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was allied warriors, kings, or a priestess, they wouldn\u2019t have dared to look up at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, that bastard Sunggoo. He must be relaxing since it is his day off? Ah. Fuck. Somehow that makes me vexed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Somehow Sunggoo\u2019s absence felt large today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A soul has to be clear and warm for him form an attachment. Also it made it more fun to order one around\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin led the Skeletons towards the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a large group moves, they leave tracks of their movement. If they are in enemy lines, then one should try to erase one\u2019s track to the best of one\u2019s ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was survival instinct for herbivores to erase the smell and track of their movement by moving carefully. Carnivores chased after the faint traces with stealthy movements. They had the hunting instinct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoong koong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two troll stealthily followed the various footprints. The tracks led them to a large cave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scent was everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was an intruder right in front of their noses. It was a quarry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two troll entered the cave. When they entered the dark cave, they saw a human cooking and eating meat over a camp fire. Moreover, red eyes were lined up deep within the darkness of the cave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Another one came. Hey guys. Go greet the customers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The magic spell appeared without any warning. It lit up the cave brightly, and it illuminated the Skeleton Magicians with red glowing eyes. Several dozen Skeletons were illuminated for only 3 seconds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-roo-rook. Puh-puh-puhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The outgoing magic ripped the troll\u2019s limbs apart as they were flung out of the cave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had forgotten about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had left tracks, but he was someone who didn\u2019t care about such things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBibi. Gather the ingredients.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPeeee. You are going to make me do this again? Hurry up and summon Dolsae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-huh. Hurry up and go get it. They are about to die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi had materialised in her girl form. She inflated her cheeks as she pouted, then she trotted out of the cave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The little devil started gathering blood in a bottle from the dying trolls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. It hurts a lot, right? I\u2019ll punish him for you guys in master\u2019s dream.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the trolls started to lose consciousness, there gazes landed on a human stretching as he stood up. He had a bone grasped in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh. Since I have a full stomach now, I should start leveling again..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t bother to hide his presence as the forest started to be soaked in madness as the upper predator felt the killer\u2019s instinct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-wuhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were one branch of a race descended from the Giant Race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The inhabitants of the forest ran away just from hearing their booming steps. They were the apex predator of the forest, and everyone was terrified of coming across them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a loud group chasing after the forest\u2019s predators.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-kehkeh\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Soldiers ran quickly as they faced off against the goblins and kobolds. Every one of them were cut down. The Skeletons opened a path for Woojin. He ran with Bibi hanging on Woojin\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Skeleton Soldiers in black robes followed after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ohhhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bba-gak, bbuck!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard a loud noise, and it seemed the advanced unit of Skeleton Soldiers had encountered an ogre. As the crowded forest road ended, an ogre could be seen in the wide open space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ogre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was around 4 meters tall. It wore a primitive garb, and it barely covered its sexual organ. It had hard head, and its headbutts were dangerous. They were descended from the Giant race, so their two fists were deadly weapons in itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it grabs a boulder, then the boulder became a catapult. If it grabbed a tree, then the tree became a large club.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a ferocious predator of the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve finally found one!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had high EXP and Achievement Points. This monster also held an incredibly large bloodstone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ohhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The predator let out a savage howl.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ogre\u2019s Fear couldn\u2019t stop the Skeleton Soldiers from marching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were existences that had forgotten about fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the ogre\u2019s tyrannical hands had enough strength to demolish the Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin couldn\u2019t match the large cry of the ogre, but he had a way to match its large body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Dolsae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s shout, his familiar Dolsae showed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Paht.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A handful of light let out a dim glow like fireflys, and it started to spin dizzily around the surrounding like satellites.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light increased and decreased like the beat of an animal\u2019s heart. The light overflowed with vivaciousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light was absorbed into the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo gooo gooo gooo gooo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground shook, and a pile of earth rose up. The head showed up first, and when it raised its arms and legs out, it let out a roar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoo-uhhhhhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi jumped towards the head of the clay golem Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDolsae-jjing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The golem\u2019s head was Bibi\u2019s favorite location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrush them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDolsae-jjing. Go! Go!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoo-uhhhhhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s order, Dolsae charged. The golem was taller than the ogre by 1 meter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everytime Dolsae took a step a clump of dirt with weeds and rocks fell off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooooong, Kwang!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae\u2019s fist struck the ogre\u2019s face. However, it was a level 1 Golem, so it was very weak. It was impossible for the Golem to inflict a critical blow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the attack was enough to draw the attention of the ogre entirely on Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ryahhhhhp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped on Dolsae\u2019s back, and he ran along it. When he leapt, Woojin transformed the Warrior\u2019s Weapon. He held a hammer in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGooh-uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae\u2019s enormous body hugged the ogre, and the ogre let out strange sound. Then Woojin\u2019s hammer dealt a blow to the ogre\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgguhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ogre swayed from the impact. Woojin landed on the ground, and he rested the hammer on his shoulder. Then he measured the distance he had to travel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHold on to him tightly, Dolsae. I\u2019m going to hit it one more time..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoo-uhhhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster. Use your strength a little bit more-ahong. Blow it away in one blow-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-jah-chah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He accelerated as he charged, and he used Dolsae\u2019s curved back as a jump stand. He added his jump to his momentum, and he jumped much higher than before. Then Woojin\u2019s hammer hit the groggy ogre\u2019s head again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwa-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of its skull breaking reverberated, and the ogre\u2019s body started to tilt. It had an incredible thick skin, so most sword couldn\u2019t penetrate it. It also had a high resistance, so the Skeleton Magician\u2019s magic would have only tickled it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current Skeleton Soldiers and Magicians weren\u2019t effective against the ogre. If he wasn\u2019t a Dual Class, then he would have had a very hard time defeating this monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBibi. Go guard the surrounding with Dolsae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Dolsae-jjing. Let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do you keep calling him Dolsae-jjing. How can you call our cute Dolsae that\u2026 Ah, I guess he is Hooksae now.\u201d (TLN: Dol = stone, Hook = earth/dirt)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI saw it on the tv-ahong. If you find something cute, you call it with a -jjing.\u201d (TLN: its a form of baby talk, usually used by adult female to adult male. It\u2019s a form of aegyo.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. The tv is ruining you. What did you watch?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt was Martian Virus-ahong. Master should also watch it-yong. I learned a lot about Earthlings through it-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll watch it with you next time. Hurry up and go look around the surrounding.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDolsae-jjing. Depart!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohng, Koohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin started to dismember the ogre\u2019s body since he needed it as ingredients for his medicine. It wasn\u2019t that hard of job, so Bibi could do it. However, Woojin decided to personally dismember the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I shouldn\u2019t have given Sunggoo the time off.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin complained as he cut the ogre\u2019s body into pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM\u2026master. Come over here quickly, and see this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put the harvested ingredients into the inventory, then he approached Bibi, who was yelling urgently. When he approached her, the end of the forest could be seen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The forest ended abruptly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An earthquake fault? Canyon? Cliff?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a separation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked down below. It was an endless cliff.

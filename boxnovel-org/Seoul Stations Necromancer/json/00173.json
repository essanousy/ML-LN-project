Many Dimensional lords lost their Domains through mismanagement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You keep this up even into the future. \u00a0You have to protect the Colony no matter what.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was for his family. \u00a0Moreover, his return to earth hinged on the existence of the Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Understood.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to get up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi yelled out when she saw the Hologram window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh? Master. \u00a0Another Dungeon just broke.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as her words ended, one could hear urgent steps as two people appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One was the captain of the aircraft carrier, Park-gilsoo. \u00a0The other was Nosam, who was in charge of maintenance and design. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is good to see you, king!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I give my greetings to the lord.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two had hastily appeared, and Woojin turned his head towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can we see what's going on below?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, sir!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-gilsoo immediately used the screen within the control tower to bring up the map of the region below. \u00a0When he zoomed in with the screen, one could see a live high-resolution footage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that three locations?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan still had a dark expression as he returned to the control tower. \u00a0He spoke to Woojin in a weak voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Recently, there's been numerous Dungeon Breaks. \u00a0There was no warning before they broke. \u00a0At the very least, Korea is in a better situation than the other locations.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Other locations?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The subjugation of the enemy forces never exceeded a day in Korea. \u00a0However, several countries had monsters take over key buildings several hours before they besieged it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's eyebrows arched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did another Colony form on earth?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Not yet. \u00a0However, there had been intermittent attempts to form one.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There are some in China, who are aiding the formation of a Colony.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is just a guess, but it seems they want to harvest the Dimensional Fragments.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tsk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin clicked his tongue as he closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already predicted this would happen. \u00a0People talked about world peace and the protection of earth, but humans moved based on greed. In the end, they'll find out it was futile to eat one's own flesh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to protect earth, so he could protect his family. \u00a0He was also motivated by his own self-interest....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt that he didn't have much time left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess I'll have to take care what is going on below.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Master is busy. \u00a0Please leave it to me!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a long time since Bibi had accompanied him to the battlefield. \u00a0This was why her level was still low. \u00a0If she unnecessarily went forward to subjugate the monsters, she might get hurt.....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just have to attack with the Colony City.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head. \u00a0This was a moving Colony City.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had decided on putting a Colony on an aircraft carrier, so they could escape from attacks they couldn't handle. \u00a0Unexpectedly, the aircraft carrier was able to traverse the sky instead of the ocean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The weapons and troops placed the aircraft carrier wasn't only for battle on sea. \u00a0Now it would be able to be used to attack the the enemies from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's a pretty good idea.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"May I be in charge of it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0I'll leave it up to you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unexpected Dungeon Breaks would continue to happen. \u00a0Woojin couldn't take care of all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had to do the deeds that only he could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Thrash's Executioner.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to solve this puzzle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to solve it, he had to regain his Thrash Set items. \u00a0It might give him a clue that he could follow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to be in Alphen instead of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bibi.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, master!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No matter what you do, don't lose the Colony.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Leave it to me!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He rubbed Bibi's head once more, then he passed through the portal as he headed towards Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hue hue. \u00a0Let's get started.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi laughed as she looked at the screen showing what was going on below the control tower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were at a snack shop near the Daejun Station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three high school students were eating stir-fried rice cake near the subway station. \u00a0They expressed their admiration as they saw a nearby group of Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hooo. \u00a0My life would turn around if I Roused to an ability.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Pfft. \u00a0Why are you talking about becoming a Roused? \u00a0You should buy a lottery ticket instead. \u00a0The probability of you winning is higher than you becoming a Roused.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bitch. \u00a0You never know in life. \u00a0Gyungsoo from class 4 became a Roused.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess you have a point.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a student developed abilities to become a Roused, it was a lucky break that even a winning lottery ticket couldn't rival.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no man that didn't have ambition. \u00a0Moreover, there wasn't a teen, who didn't have heroic aspirations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey. \u00a0The low Rank Roused are basically manual laborers.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why do you think they are called 3rd rate?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A low Ranked Roused was basically akin to an unpopular celebrity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there wasn't anyone, who didn't want a chance to become a star. \u00a0It didn't matter if it took backbreaking work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0If we are able to developed an ability, we can interview at Alandal. \u00a0They only picked the lousy candidates.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, that might be a cover for who they really chose.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. \u00a0Alandal isn't some factory. \u00a0You don't suddenly become a high Ranked Roused in a short span of time. \u00a0That doesn't make any sense.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was an obvious reasoning that could explain their actions. \u00a0What if they hired Roused with potential? \u00a0Maybe they just allowed the flowers to bloom?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minjae's dream was to become a Roused, so he just scratched his cheeks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey. \u00a0You are good at studying, so why are you trying to become a Roused?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the past, education wasn't the absolute ticket to success. \u00a0However, it was still the most basic requirement needed to advance in life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a world gone mad with monsters, the need for education was that much more important.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-ooh. \u00a0Let's just go to cramming school after we eat.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minjae and his friends inhaled their stir-fried rice cake and other fried foods. \u00a0They were about to leave the restaurant when they stopped at the entrance. \u00a0No, they froze in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters were a regular part of life now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, what would it feel like if one faced a monster that one had only seen through tv?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous monster held something that looked like a hammer or a steel club. \u00a0It was about to bring the weapon down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"R...run!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minjae was barely able to open his frozen lips. His shout was like a catalyst that made his friends move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koohng, koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous monster was domineering, but it was pretty slow. \u00a0Minjae and his friends ran as if their life depended on it, and they were able to distance themselves from the monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhk, huhk! What's going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The nearby Dungeon must have Broke.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where's the shelter?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hooo. \u00a0I have no idea. \u00a0I must have dropped my phone.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three of them had been lucky. \u00a0This was the first time they had encountered a monster. \u00a0While they were looking around in panic, more monsters appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Break just happened, so there was no way only one monster would have shown up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Four other monsters that had a similar appearance to the one before appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three humans weren't able to escape, because of fear. \u00a0The monsters surrounded them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"F...fuck.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His friends didn't even have the energy to give a reply to Minjae's curse word. The Break had happened recently, and they hadn't been able to find a shelter. \u00a0They were now preys that\u2019ll be hunted down by these monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are fucked.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey, Minjae. \u00a0What should we do?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you think? \u00a0We'll just die.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was funny. \u00a0When he realized he was about to die, he became more composed instead of being afraid. \u00a0In the end, he was going to die, so why should he be afraid?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he put aside his fear, he was able to take in his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The army isn't here yet. \u00a0We are the only ones nearby.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the army hadn't been mobilized yet. \u00a0The sound of gunfire didn't reach his ears, and he couldn't hear any sounds of battle. \u00a0He could only hear the scream of people, and the roar of monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the Break happened not too long ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only four monsters right now, but the numbers would swell. \u00a0The chance of their survival was non-existent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are dead.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"M...Minjae. \u00a0What should we do?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why do you keep asking me that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-ohhk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minjae wanted it with all his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had an ability, he could use his own powers to either fight or run away. \u00a0However, he was only a regular high school student, who had been about to go to his supplemental class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What will they say about him in death?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, he had stopped near the Daejun station, because he was hungry. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed eating stir-fried rice cake was going to be his downfall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wished with all his heart. \u00a0\u00a0If he really was a Roused, he wouldn't be powerless like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt like a frog in front of a snake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters kept tightening the perimeter, and they were about to bring down their large weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would die as a bloody mess. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shit!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grabbed the hands of both his friends in fright. \u00a0If this was a normal situation, his friends would have balked at such a gesture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A miracle occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Teeeng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An unknown power blocked the weapons, and the weapons were bounced away in midair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minjae's eyes was big from surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"M...Minjae!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...what the hell was that?

The Dungeon Breaks happened simultaneously around the world, but the most prepared city had been Seoul. \u00a0Mr. Kahng-woojin's familiars took an active role in suppressing the monsters early on....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Short videos that were shot and submitted by citizens were being replayed. \u00a0There was a video of the Iron Golem fighting the monsters. \u00a0There were also videos of several thousand Skeleton Warriors and Death Knights succeeding in killing the monsters. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The shockwave caused an earthquake that could be felt in Cheonan. \u00a0However, the Alandal guild's private land didn't suffer any damage from the meteor impact\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen showed a footage that was filmed from a helicopter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Namsan was leveled, and the nearby buildings were destroyed. \u00a0There were so much debris that one couldn't even find the roads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As one got further away from the impact zone, one could see relatively whole buildings with only their windows blow out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Alandal was within the demolished part of the city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if a massive tornado had missed the land and buildings owned by the Alandal guild. \u00a0The image looked like an island floating atop a dust cloud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the dust that had settle to the floor had missed only Alandal. \u00a0Only Alandal was clean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-Alandal's protector is none other than president Kahng-woojin. \u00a0What would have happened if he wasn't in Seoul? \u00a0What if the Alandal guild wasn't next to the Seoul Station? \u00a0What would have happened if they moved to Tokyo or even LA?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen showed a reporter with a very serious expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-The common convention has been broken regarding the Dungeons. \u00a0The Dungeons are Breaking every day, and the monsters continue to pour out. \u00a0Some countries have used nuclear weapons to eradicate the monsters. This is to all of our viewers. \u00a0There is one day left on the national referendum. \u00a0Whether Korea is placed under the shade of Alandal or they leave this country, the choice is up to you. \u00a0This is MBS' Park-sungyun. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan turned off the tv with the remote when the anchor finished his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The core members of Alandal was sitting inside the meeting room. \u00a0He spoke with a heavy expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe situation is in our favor. \u00a0However, we have to prepare for the possibility of the majority voting against us.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lawyer Lee-kahngjin had resigned his post as a prosecutor, and he had officially entered into Alandal. \u00a0He asked with a serious expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the revision to the amendment is considered void, then we have to leave Korea.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The content of the revision was to acknowledge the existence of a city state within Korea. \u00a0It was a very big issue that required the vote of the people, and the treaty could be finalized only when this hurdle was cleared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would complete the formation of a city state within Korea. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-kahngjin's speculation was logical, but all the founding members all shook their heads from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlandal is going nowhere. The property we occupy right now will continue to be our territory.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? If the worst outcome happens, don't we have to leave eventually?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Korea wasn't receptive to Alandal, then they would ask Alandal to leave to a different country. However\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident won't leave.

Woo-soonghoon understood what was going on, so he nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident said to never leave the Seoul Station. \u00a0We have no choice.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. \u00a0Still, the situation won't...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. \u00a0You have to get used to it, lawyer-nim. Just take it as a fact. \u00a0If the president says he isn't leaving, then he isn't leaving.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-kahngjin checked the faces of all the people present in the meeting room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the Alandal's vice president Jung-michan, support director Kim-haemin, chief secretary Woo-soonghoon, and the director of miscellaneous work Hong-sunggoo, who was known as the Flame man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was accepting this matter too matter of factly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the worst case scenario, there might be a clash between forces.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On one side, there will be the country that won't legitimize the other country within its border. \u00a0On the other other side, there will be the small city state exerting its right as a sovereign country. \u00a0The result from this two sides clashing was obvious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The small city state will win.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident might want to seize power from the entire Korean government. \u00a0We have to make a plan for such an eventuality.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one spoke as everyone was taken aback by Kim-haemin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you talking about conducting treasonous acts against Korea?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm trying to stop such a thing from happening.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't we just have to persuade the president?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think taking over a country is easier than persuading hyung-nim.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo, who had been listening to the conversation, spoke up. \u00a0Silence descended inside the meeting room at his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen is the president coming back?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe said tomorrow, but he might be back earlier.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it really possible to return from Britain within a day? He hasn't even arrived there yet....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he was on a fast plane, would it be possible to keep such a tight schedule?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident will use the Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-kahngjin's eyebrows twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs the Dungeon some kind of dimensional teleportation door?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe president uses it that way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was speechless. There were too many things he didn't know about Kahng-woojin. \u00a0Lee-kahngjin spoke after he thought on the matter. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs the Seoul Station the reason why he can't leave Korea?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are correct.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the reason why Woojin insisted on staying in Seoul. \u00a0Lee-kahngjin leaned back into his chair. \u00a0In the end, they were in a situation where they had to pray for the vote to pass the amendment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe public opinion is in our favor. I did a pre-survey, and the approval of the amendment was overwhelming. \u00a0There were even some people, who wanted to elect him as the President of Korea.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-kahngjin calmly read the data.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we don't leave Seoul, Alandal can just keep the status quo.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat if the Korean Government pressures us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-kahngjin smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho's the one that cut off the head of the members of congress? \u00a0Currently, the arrest warrants were issued for them. \u00a0The public opinions regarding the members of congress is low right now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was right. South Korea blocked the the businesses with ties to the dead congressmen from pestering Kahng-woojin. It was a move done to protect him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnless the threat of the Dungeon Break disappears, no one will bother our president.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan nodded his head as he listened to Lee-kahngjin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been a prosecutor, so he was probably the most well-informed person here regarding these issues. \u00a0If passed, Alandal and South Korea will enter into an agreement. \u00a0If the amendment wasn\u2019t passed, they'll just maintain the status quo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they were at a disadvantage or something threatened them, they could resolve the problem when it happened. \u00a0The knife was in Alandal's hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll we can do is wait.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything will come to a head tomorrow. \u00a0The main problem right now was the fact that Kahng-woojin was heading towards Britain. \u00a0When he left, he just said, 'Just take care of everything adequately.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan glanced at Lee-kahngjin, who was still kept in the dark about Alandal's situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Everyone will freak out if they learn the president was the one, who had summoned the meteor.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the founding members, and it seemed all of them had an idea on what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The news going around was in Alandal's favor. \u00a0It was spread that the Dragon had summoned the meteor, and Kahng-woojin saw it coming. \u00a0He had warned the people to evacuate. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh-hmmm. \u00a0I hope the president comes back quickly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was tasked to setting up the country, and he was its prime minister. However, there was a world of difference between the president being absent, and being here. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. \u00a0I wouldn't mind if he took his time in coming back.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin returned, Sunggoo would study magic from the Lich in earnest. \u00a0Sunggoo looked as if he wanted to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The number of Dungeon Breaks that had occurred this time was 212.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only difference from the past was that 19 Dimensional lord had been summoned to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters were dangerous on their own, but now they moved as if they were being ordered by someone. The pressure given by this fact was immense. \u00a0Moreover, there were some who felt fear from this development.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional lord that infested Russia had set up its colony near a forest in Siberia. \u00a0In North Korea, the Dimensional lord had taken residence inside the presidential palace. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">North Korea lost Pyeongyang and the lives of its citizens. Russia took out the infested region of Siberia. \u00a0Both countries dropped a nuke. \u00a0It neatly took care of the monsters, but the damage was massive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nine Dimensional lords had appeared in Seoul, but Seoul took the least damage compared to other locations in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seven had appeared in Seoul, and two had appeared in Busan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's quick action had killed all the Dimensional lords before they could get their operations running. \u00a0He had also eliminated the Dimensional lords in Busan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Overall, there were only 4 countries that were able to kill a Dimensional lord with their own power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">US killed two, Japan killed one, and China killed one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In these 4 countries, the Roused and the army worked together. \u00a0They were successful in their subjugation, and the colonies were also destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the Dimensional lords in Europe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were Dimensional lords in Greece, Germany and the UK.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters gathered around the colonies, and they had done nothing initially except defend their base. Since the monsters weren't doing anything, these countries thought they weren't in imminent danger. \u00a0They decided approach the situation with caution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their forces were gathered very slowly. \u00a0When the Roused and the army started their subjugation, a day had already passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monster had stayed calm for a day, and they all ran amok at the same time. The monsters had been waiting for their bases to be built. Then the Dimensional lords also started to run amok, so Europe immediately fell into a state of panic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heated battles continued, but the number of monsters didn't decrease. \u00a0The monsters kept popping out from the completed colonies...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional lord was on a different level as the regular monsters, so the subjugation itself wasn't easy. \u00a0The damage kept mounting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once the colonies were completed, the situation got out of hand. \u00a0They were actually taking more damage than Russia and North Korea, who used their nuclear weapons. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the reason why Woojin and the Holy Maiden were sharing a conversation on a plane as it headed towards Europe. \u00a0Thirty percent of Italy's peninsula was occupied by monsters, and the plane was about an hour away from arriving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHere. \u00a0Take this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden made rabbit eyes when she saw Woojin thrust a purple gem towards her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Dimensional Fragment, and it was a very rare and precious item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can you give such a precious item to me....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI borrowed one from you last time. I'm just settling the account.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, he hadn't been lying when he said he'll return it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She never knew the Immortal was this honest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't need it any more. \u00a0You can have it, monarch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked at the Holy Maiden's modest answer, and he put the Dimensional Fragment back into his Inventory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, all right. \u00a0I'll use it well.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did he suggest giving it back to her as some kind of trick?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she gave it back to him, he had agreed to take it too quickly....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, what do you think about all of this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm talking about the current situation. \u00a0Isn't it similar to what happened on Alphen?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The colonies had been completed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters were generated from those locations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet's underlings were endless no matter how many one killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt does bring up the horrible nightmare.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t it? It was quite tedious.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she heard his words, the Holy Maiden looked at him with a strange light in her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alphen's continents were taken inch by inch by Trahnet's underlings. Their personnel had been constantly reinforced, so it had been inevitable. \u00a0The surviving countries had formed an alliance, but their influence diminished each day. \u00a0The only one able to protect a large swath of land had been the Immortal. He had protected Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow that I think about it they don't have an unlimited supply of troops.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On Planet Alphen, he only killed those, who stepped onto his territory. \u00a0However, he was in a different situation right now. \u00a0He had to root out his opponents before they gained more territory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The colony was the key. \u00a0It allowed the Dimensional lord to be able to use their power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they had spare Energy, they could purchase as many monsters it allowed. Then the rampaging monsters would hunt down the humans, and the Energy would be replenished. \u00a0Then they could once again reinforce their troops....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know how I feel right now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked out the airplane's window. It was pitch black outside. This was why the window reflected his face like a mirror. \u00a0He had a broad smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt feels like I've been gifted a inexhaustible regenerating hunting ground. \u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They can attack him with all the monsters they could summon with the Energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll kill them all, and he'll gobble up all the EXP.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Anyways, was there something going on today? \u00a0I saw an entertainer here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You know... \u00a0It was Ms. Cindy from the Yuri Girls. \u00a0I even got her signature. \u00a0Heh heh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo fluttered the paper as he smiled brightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah... \u00a0She is a high school alumni of the king and Do-jiwon-nim. \u00a0She came over for a visit couple days ago.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow! Hyung-nim is friends with an entertainer?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes... \u00a0It is what it is.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That\u2019s big news. \u00a0Isn't her popularity on the rise as she transition towards acting?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0Well...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In terms of popularity, the King of Alandal received more public interest than an entertainer....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyahh. \u00a0It must be great. \u00a0It means hyung-nim ate at the same table with her.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm. \u00a0If you like her, why don't you ask her out on a date?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hul. \u00a0How could I ask out an entertainer?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon looked dumbfounded as he looked at the embarrassed Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did this guy have any idea what position and renown he held within society?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If it's director Hong, I don't think she'll refuse.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No way. \u00a0How could I? \u00a0Heh heh. \u00a0I got her signature, so it's fine.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this guy really clueless about how famous he is?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one said Flame Man, there is no one in Korea, who wouldn't know about him. \u00a0No, Hong-sunggoo was even known all around the world. \u00a0\u00a0Yet he had no self-awareness about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What about hyung-nim?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is in his office.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0I'll see you next time.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, director.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo carefully folded Cindy's signature as he put it away. \u00a0Then he started walking again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal King's Office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo entered after knocking, and he saw the people sitting on the sofas. \u00a0Woojin slightly turned his head to look at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are back?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, hyung-nim.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Jaenis said it is ok for you to go?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he mentioned Jaenis, Sunggoo instinctively frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, at the very least, he said I won't die wherever I go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked. \u00a0If Jaenis spoke that way, Sunggoo would be able to carry his weight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You did well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh. \u00a0So why are we all gathered here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should sit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo sat next to Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka and Che-haesol was sitting on the other side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We just have to wait for Melody to get here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo asked a question again when he heard Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So why are we all gathered here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why do you think? \u00a0This is the meeting before the expedition.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm. \u00a0Will this be different from going to Planet Jaku? \u00a0Don't we just have to go there and cause havoc?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It'll be different. \u00a0There are more formidable foes there. \u00a0There are countless Dungeons owned by the 72 Thrones.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who are they? \u00a0Are they suppose to be strong?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"These 72 beings have the most Points amongst the Dimensional lords.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are the Points proportional to one's strength?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's something like that. \u00a0The Points could be used to replenish their forces. \u00a0However, there is no chance they'll run out of Points. \u00a0They have too many Dungeons..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their Dimensional Domain was large, and they had many Dungeons. \u00a0Then there were the Points paid as taxes by the Domain Residents. \u00a0It was like a spring water that never dried up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the same as a wealthy person going on a spending spree, yet they don't put a dent in their wealth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess that's an apt comparison.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the door opened as Melody entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The only reason why the Immortal was able to fight against them was the fact that he could replenish the forces under him.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's forces had made up one-third of Alphen's forces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was the coalition made out of the indigenous people, Trahnet's Dimensional lords, and the unyielding Immortal, who occupied Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two of the three powers never diminished in power as the fight continued on, but the coalition couldn't replenish their dead as quickly. \u00a0This was why the balance of power had started to tilt. \u00a0While this was ongoing, the Immortal went missing, and the downfall of the coalition happened in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you are here, then you should sit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Melody took her seat, she bowed towards the people present here. \u00a0To be precise, she bowed towards Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to really thank you for being so forward in your help to save Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, we have to help each other.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody had helped in Woojin's work. \u00a0Moreover, he had to find the Thrash's Set Items, so he had to go to Alphen anyways. \u00a0However, Melody couldn't help, but be deeply moved by it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had never expected aid from the planet of earth and the Immortal. \u00a0The gift of foresight possessed by her goddess Aria was amazing. \u00a0She had predicted this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I'll start explaining the plan.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin told them the simple plan he came up with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I've finished establishing the gates that leads from my Dimensional Domain to Alphen and Earth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were occasional challengers, but Kiba defeated them all. \u00a0Kiba was doing a good job protecting the Return Stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin continued his explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The vanguard will be Sunggoo, Melody, Jaemin and I.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When are we supposed to head over there?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You guys come after two days. \u00a0That means 8 hours would have passed on Alphen. \u00a0During that time, we will find the coalition force that is still alive. \u00a0Then I will create a Colony city. \u00a0It'll be our headquarters as we attempt to reclaim Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll be able to use the Portal to directly connect earth and Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"At that point, Blanka and Haesol will bring over the new employees. \u00a0Afterwards, we'll divide the group into the Rescue, Extermination and Search unit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone listened carefully to Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Rescue unit will consist of Haesol, Blanka and Melody. \u00a0You guys will work with the Phantom unit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The synergy between these two groups were great. \u00a0Blanka had his Buffs, and Melody was powerful in her own right. \u00a0The Phantom unit will also show great strength under the control of Haesol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I'm in the reconnaissance team with student Jaemin?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You guys are in the Extermination party. \u00a0You guys will destroy the Dimensional lord's Colonies and Dungeons one by one.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It'll probably be hard with just the two of you. \u00a0You guys should combine forces with Alphen's coalition. \u00a0You guys are in charge of taking the lead with them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He planned on making a counter-attack force that'll contain the coalition's remaining forces. \u00a0Currently, Sunggoo and Jaemin were the only ones qualified to join in this unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then hyung-nim will...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to go on a treasure hunt.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he wouldn't be quiet in his search....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll destroy everything in my path.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As silence continued, Sunggoo raised his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I can play until the morning?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had been doggedly fighting for his life for ever minute and every second of every day. However...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have to get ready to move. \u00a0We are heading to Busan.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had just arrived from Planet Jaku. \u00a0Everyone knew about the move except him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then let's disperse.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol lead the still confused Sunggoo outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As everyone started to trickle out, Melody and Woojin was the only two left inside the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You aren't going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have something to tell you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I received an oracle. It seems I have to inform you of its content.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Talk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody hesitated. She let out a light sigh as she opened her mouth to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jeju Manjang Cave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A barricade had been formed at the entrance. \u00a0The construction was used as an excuse. \u00a0There was a commotion at this barricade.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey. \u00a0I'm just here to see the progress of the construction. \u00a0I can't even do that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are restricting access to this location.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I've worked here for over 10 years!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The employees were adamant in blocking Kim-taesheek, who was being unreasonable. \u00a0He had been at it for 30 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point in time, a black sedan stopped in front of the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the window was rolled down, Lee-sahngho's face appeared. \u00a0Kim-taesheek hurriedly approached him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Aigo, manager Lee-sahngjoon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It\u2019s nothing. \u00a0I'm just here to see how the construction is progressing, yet they are blocking me from entering.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why would you be curious about it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Isn't it natural for me to be curious about it? \u00a0I've worked here for 10 years, and I've never heard or seen a maintenance work of this scale. \u00a0Moreover, I keep seeing more and more stuff entering....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll show you. \u00a0Please get in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha. \u00a0It seems the president and I are on the same wavelength.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-taesheek got on next to Lee-sahngho. \u00a0After passing through the entrance, the car was parked at the lot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Lee-sahngho started to move, Kim-taesheek continued to press Lee-sahngho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I know manager Lee is good at his job. \u00a0Still, isn't this is a treasured protected site? \u00a0I'm worried there will be damage.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course. \u00a0I understand. \u00a0Let's head in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-taesheek was a bit daunted by Lee-sahngho's dark mood, but he willingly followed after him. \u00a0He had been coming to the construction site several days in a row to gain entrance. \u00a0They had stubbornly barred Kim-taesheek from entering, and this just made him more stubborn about getting in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Kim-taesheek thought he had the right to do this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had shut down the ticket office, and even the restaurant staffs were sent home the other day as they conducted this maintenance work. \u00a0He had never seen construction work be carried here by closing down the whole place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of suspicious things going on, yet he couldn't say anything in front of the man in charge of the construction...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to check if everything was going well with his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, let's head down.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-taesheek was heading down a stairway that lead towards the Manjang Cave. He shuddered when he felt some unknown dark energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiehk, kee-eek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard a sound coming from the cave, and the hair on his head was standing on end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"D...didn't you hear that sound right now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What sound?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm. \u00a0I... Was it a bat?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Lee-sahngho just shrugged his shoulders, Kim-taesheek scratched the back of his head before he started moving once again. \u00a0No... He was about to move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeeek! \u00a0Puh-uhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He lost control over his body as he felt himself become airborne. \u00a0Then he started rolling down the stairway towards the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the impact, the pained Kim-taesheek yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-uh-uhk. \u00a0Aigo. \u00a0I'm about to die. \u00a0Help me. \u00a0Please....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-taesheek put forth his hand to ask for help, but his expression soon froze. \u00a0Lee-sahngho had a wide smile on his face, and he looked deranged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You can't even take care of your body, yet you are trying to take care of this natural monument.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After speaking those cold words, Lee-sahngho walked past him to disappear into the cave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kieeehk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Lee-sahngho disappeared into the cave, a terrifying screech was heard, and a monster snatched Kim-taesheek into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-ahhhhhk!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek, Kwahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He let out his final scream as he became food for the monsters. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After leaving behind Kim-taesheek, Lee-sahngho headed towards the heart of the Manjang Cave, which was filled with cold air. \u00a0He arrived at a location where Iello was sitting on a throne made out of ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What about the Immortal?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is moving his base to a Colony city.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Colony city?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, an aircraft carrier...he is constructing a Colony on a boat.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Do you have any other news?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He plans on heading towards Planet Alphen for an expedition.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Planet Alphen!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. \u00a0He is heading out tomorrow morning.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hoo hoo hoo.

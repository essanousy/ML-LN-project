They secretly traveled across the continent, and they only opened their doors to their successors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Scholars and the long-lived races were the only ones, who knew about the existence of Heres.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The exclusive and secret order of the god was located on a land covered with ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too too too too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Phantom Steed was running above this land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha-ah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A white plume of breath came out of Latasha's mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Elf Lord was once again co-opted as a guide, because she knew the location of Heres' temple, and she had good eyesight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you sure we are on the right path?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I'm sure.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't see anything here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement, yet Shing Shing didn't stop running.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is located at the land of ice. \u00a0Heres' temple is located at the deepest and coldest location.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where is that suppose to be?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We can see it now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's eyes lit up when he looked at the location pointed out by Latasha. \u00a0One could see an enormous ice mountain towering over this flat lands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they got closer, his eyes kept getting larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ice Castle?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. \u00a0You are correct.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ice Castle was placed in a location where the cold made it impossible for any creature to live here. \u00a0However, the enormous castle was as big as the Saurus mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was beyond it being grand. \u00a0Its overwhelming size gave even Woojin a pause. \u00a0It was the same for Latasha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The information about this place was passed down through oral tradition, and this was the first time she was seeing this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, let's head in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They circled the castle once, and they were able to find an entrance halfway up the castle. \u00a0When the Phantom Steed approached it, one could see a very small door big enough to allow only a single person to enter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think it is locked.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha knocked on the door then she turned to looked at Woojin. \u00a0He stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Move aside.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw no doorknob or keyhole. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, when he \u00a0put his palm to the door, he could feel the coldness through the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...wait a moment...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she felt the nearby magical energy move, Latasha tried to stop him. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gathered his power into his palm, and he detonated the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a shock wave, the door flew inward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's open.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you so rude?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you want me to knock and wait for someone to come to the door?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't know why she bothered with words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal wasn't a good candidate for her to lecture about manners and etiquette. \u00a0Latasha's cheeks puffed out as she turned her head away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin ignored her, and he started climbing the long staircase made out of ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why is it so dark in here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please wait.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha elegantly waved her hands before cupping her hands together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small fairy made out of light appeared atop her palms. \u00a0It gave a bright smile before it flew in front of the party.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is a Spirit of Light.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I didn't ask for one.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh-whew...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha shook her head from side to side as she walked in front of him. \u00a0They climbed long enough that they were starting to get bored. \u00a0At the end of the stairway, a door appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike the one before, this steel door had a deeply recessed handhold. \u00a0Latasha pulled with all her might, yet it refused to open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you going to blow it up again?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin placed his palm on the door, and he gathered his magical energy. \u00a0However, the door opened before the explosion could occur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chweeek, weeeeng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After looking at the opened crack, Latasha looked towards the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What should we do? \u00a0Should we not go in?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We'll go in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eeeng, chweeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they went in, the door locked itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned, and Latasha was taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...what the hell happened? \u00a0I can't hear the voice of the wind.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The temple severed the inhabitants from the outside. \u00a0It seemed the Immortal wasn't the only one, who had his power taken away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha also lost her power, and she floundered at this alien feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"L...let's go back out. \u00a0This is too dangerous.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In an unexpected turn of event, an unknown power had made her lose her power. \u00a0The pitfall of such a situation made her feel agitated. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's all right. \u00a0It is always like this. \u00a0We'll leave after we find the Holy Item.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha frowned. However, she inferred from the Immortal's expression that this was normal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked as if he was used to such a situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn't shaped like a spaceship...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The light attached to the ceiling reminded him of the ones at the Aria's Temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't have to see Skia, Lecia, and Coor's temples to know what was in it. \u00a0Still, he wonder why these 5 gods held the Master Codes of Alphen....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they walked down the long corridor, they came to an intersection. \u00a0The space partitioned into sections, and they arrived at doors as they followed the walls. \u00a0However, none of them were open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toong, toong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tried punching the door, but he knew it wouldn't be easy to break through the doors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"S...shall we continue forward? \u00a0Since we came in without consent, maybe the god Heres is mad at us?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have no idea.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, it was the absence of her power, but she was unusually chatty right now. \u00a0She continued to speak as they searched the place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A high priest must exist somewhere, so they continued the hide &amp; seek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Jeez.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had his abilities... \u00a0He would have used Ggaebi to scout the surrounding. \u00a0It was very unfortunate that this option wasn't available to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He walked through the long corridors, while he drew a map inside his mind. \u00a0While he was searching, he came upon a door with a different looking door handle. \u00a0He tried opening it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He only put a small amount of pressure on it, yet the door opened automatically. \u00a0The sight across the door was familiar to Woojin, but it was foreign to Latasha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A pool table and a refrigerator...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a pretty large room, and at a glance, one could tell it was being used as a break room. \u00a0Woojin opened the refrigerator, and he saw the familiar sight of a cola.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng, cheeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened the can, and he started drinking the soda. \u00a0Latasha was taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...what if it is poisoned...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should try drinking it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He unexpectedly threw another can of coke towards Latasha. \u00a0She caught it, and she looked over it in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tik, tik.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't know how to open it, so she struggled to open the drink. \u00a0He smirked at the sight, then he looked at his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw a sofa and a tv. \u00a0Beyond the screen, he could see a locker room. \u00a0He saw familiar letters on each locker. \u00a0Woojin looked at it with narrowed eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could read some characters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Saurie, Iello, Gahng, Natamube....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were around 8 lockers, and the letters looked similar to english, but he wasn't sure if it was the same language. \u00a0He wasn't sure if he was reading it right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this was a spaceship, it would have had a crew. \u00a0If this was a building, it would have had custodians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened all the lockers, but it was all empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked through the items within the break room, and he was sure of one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'There's a connection here with earth.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had finished searching the room, and he was about to move on when Latasha was successful in opening the can.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked at it with a face filled with curiosity. \u00a0She took two gulps before she sprayed the liquid into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-ooh-ooh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-ook! \u00a0As expected, it's poison!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt her throat being tickled as the carbonation of the drink attacked her. \u00a0Latasha grabbed her white neck as she rolled around on the floor. \u00a0When she felt a pressure rising from her stomach, she gave into it by opening her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Burrrrrp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had been rolling on the floor, but now she lay perfectly still. \u00a0She was surprised as she stared at the ceiling. \u00a0Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stop playing around. \u00a0Let's go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What're you doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her face was bright red from embarrassment, but at the same time, her eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"There is movement over there!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked towards where Latasha was pointing at. \u00a0He saw a small camera installed on the ceiling near the kitchen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ho-oh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed someone was here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin approached the lens of the camera, and he had a wide grin on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Since you've invited me, should we talk face to face?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, he hadn't been invited. \u00a0However, Woojin sent a warning towards the unfriendly owner of the temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I saw some tools over there. \u00a0If you don't come out now, I'll destroy everything.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gave the camera a wink, and he headed towards the bags containing tools.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you doing? \u00a0You should carry one too.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out a long claw hammer, and he passed the bag to Latasha..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ughh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bag was quite heavy. \u00a0She was a woman, yet she wasn't laboring under the weight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her magical energy had disappeared, but it seemed her strength as an Elf Lord remained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, shall we start now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If all the doors were locked, he'll force it open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin exited the breakroom to force open the locked doors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when a light turned on in the corridor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, a guiding light in the shape of an arrow appeared on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ho-oh. \u00a0You should have done this in the first place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Latasha walked through the maze-like corridors as they were guided by the arrow. \u00a0Afterwards, they arrived at a pretty large hallway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chweek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A door opened from both sides, and they entered a small room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"T...the ground is shaking.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is called an elevator.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if taken aback, Latasha grasped at the guardrails. \u00a0This sight amused Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the door opened once again, they came out to a large hall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked forward with a long claw hammer that was as long as a baseball bat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could see numerous computer screens placed everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even at a glance, one could see a screen that was placed at the head, and the screen was on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bald man was standing inside the screen with a subdued smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What should we do? \u00a0I think he is trapped inside.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should go stand over there..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin distanced himself from Latasha, who was making a big fuss. \u00a0Then he addressed the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heres?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No, should I be referring to you as one of the crew members?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[...both aren't really suitable. \u00a0If you are asking about why there's no one here, they didn't exist in the first place.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't plan on humoring your riddles. \u00a0Just give me your belt.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hmm. \u00a0You should have a lot of questions. \u00a0Aren't you going to ask me about it?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you plan on answering it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Of course.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Does the ancient civilization of Alphen have any connection with earth?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I only record. \u00a0I don't have the authority to browse the records.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha. \u00a0Nothing would come from his cussing at it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rather than wasting his effort with words, it would be better to ignore it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, even if he hadn't asked about it, he wasn't too interested on finding those answers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Give me \u00a0your belt.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I can give it to you, but it isn't time.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What nonsense are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll give it to you when it is time.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm asking what time?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bald man inside the screen didn't answer him, so Woojin started to swear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you want to die?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[If you want to terminate my system, it isn't possible. \u00a0You won't be able to get close to my physical server.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a big frown on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Server? \u00a0What are your goals as gods?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We want to maintain and protect Alphen. \u00a0That is all.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh-whew.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook his head from side to side. \u00a0He never expected to find a god that was harder to talk to than Aria.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So basically the gods were like a firewall protecting and preserving this planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the gods always spoke in obscure ways, and this one in particular was speaking in stiff tones that made Woojin's blood boil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you won't give it to me, I'll find it for myself.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You won't be able to find...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took the sharp end of the claw hammer to the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pi-jee-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen let out a spark, and the screen next to it turned on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You won't be able to find it.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin once again smashed the lit screen, and another screen turned on again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Please be ready. \u00a0When the time come, I'll give you the 'key'.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I told you I'll find it!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin kept destroying the screens, and Latasha stared at Woojin from the corner with wide eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In all her memories, she had never seen the Immortal in such an excited state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Saurus Mountain's World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You rascals! \u00a0If you cook meat here, you'll be punished!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-ahk. \u00a0It's the soldiers.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol and the Phantom Unit arrived in front of the unquenchable fire. \u00a0It was called the Fire Spirit King's Last Breath. The children, who had been playing around the fire, scattered into the surrounding as they laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh-whew. \u00a0I wonder when our director will be back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After crossing over to Alphen, they hadn't spent much time with Woojin. \u00a0Moreover, Do-jaemin had already returned to earth, and Sunggoo had disappeared into this single flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The portal vibrated as it let out a subdued light. \u00a0It was right in front of them, yet they weren't able to cross it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who is it! \u00a0Uh? \u00a0Holy Maiden.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol smiled as she watched Melody slowly walk towards the World Tree. \u00a0Whether it was on earth or Alphen, her miraculous healing ability was an awesome power. \u00a0Everyone in the Coalition liked her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I came here, because I would like to have a conversation with the World Tree.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What? \u00a0Ah... \u00a0Well, please go ahead.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The World Tree was only a symbol representing the Colony to Haesol, but the World Tree held a special significance to the people of Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Could you leave me alone with the tree for a brief moment?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm. \u00a0All right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol and the Phantom Unit eyed Melody as they distanced themselves from the World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Holy Maiden was the only one left in front of the World Tree, she looked up at it with a heavy heart.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since he didn't have the breastplate, it was hard to tell the difference from his outward appearance, but Woojin could feel his Stat immediately increase. He also felt the the force limiting his Spirit Armor's Soul Storage disappear. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a satisfied laugh. \u00a0Pepio's two eyes widened, and he shook his head as if he couldn't believe what just happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow come the curse...\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, everyone who had put on the cloak had died. \u00a0However, the Predator in front of his eyes...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow... \u00a0How can this be?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke to the surprised Pepio.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll take this. \u00a0If you have any grievance, hurry up and tell me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he expressed his grievance, Pepio knew he would be killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust go.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.

Maybe hyung-nim is already back?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin also looked at the red fireball falling from the sky. \u00a0If it wasn\u2019t some additional attack from the enemy, it was most definitely an ally. As the fireball approached closer, they could discern the shape of the fireball.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I think it's Sunggoo hyung.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt really is Mr. Sunggoo.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdo agreed with Jaemin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was falling from the sky, and he dropped into midst of the Orc horde.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the loud sound of an explosion, fire exploded forth into the air. \u00a0The shockwave cause the hot air to sweep over the canyon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-oohk.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cL...look at that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol had a shocked expression as she pointed towards the front.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo-roo-rook! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heat was filling the canyon, and the Orcs were screaming as they ran around in chaos.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwah-kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flame moved freely as Sunggoo moved his hands and feet. \u00a0Everything in his surrounding was being burned. \u00a0Che-haesol couldn't believe her eyes. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mr Sunggoo is....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had become unbelievably strong.

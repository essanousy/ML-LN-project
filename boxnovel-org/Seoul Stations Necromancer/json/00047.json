She unconsciously smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s quite whimsical.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put on a mask all of a sudden, and he took her on a date.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a long time since she had fun without worry about anything\u2026 Her heart was still beating fast from the excitement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He seemed indifferent yet he also seemed to care. It somehow made her heart race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Don\u2019t shampoo for a day. The medicine will be washed away. Just sleep.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPfft. What the heck?.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is he trying open a beauty parlor? When the unexpected fireworks went off, and the people crowded around the two of them, Woojin gave her was some kind of medicine as a present. He applied it on her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, it stung like medication for mosquito bites. However, she felt a refreshing feeling afterwards, and now it cleared her mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon sent a reply as she laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes, yes. Thank you for the good time today. Beautician-nim should hurry on in and rest.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had come home fairly early, so when Jiwon arrived at the dorm, Haejin and Nayoung was about to head out for their night shift.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Are you guys going to work now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haejin and Nayoung didn\u2019t respond to Jiwon\u2019s word. They left after they got ready. Jiwon shrugged her shoulders at their cold reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was used to being ignored. Jiwon took a deep breath then she got ready to sleep. She washed her face, and when she exited the restroom, she saw a chicken box strewn across the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These dongsaengs look like they will be great at eating chicken legs\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPfft.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she remembered those words, the recently departed donsaengs\u2019 faces popped up in her mind. She wanted to know what the orcs and goblins looked like. They really looked like a orc and a goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tail end of her lips started rising, so Jiwon slapped her cheeks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ah. I shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She shouldn\u2019t judge a person by their appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She knew well how hurtful and wrong those actions could be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After putting on her basic beauty products, Jiwon\u2019s eyes caught the sight of her scar. It was a little bit less puffy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Maybe this medicine really works.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused had the chance to encounter amazing items, so he might have applied a pretty effective medicine on her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she return home next week, she\u2019ll have express her thanks in a proper fashion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon sat on her bed when she saw the small shopping bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yeah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the roulette prize, so it wouldn\u2019t contain anything amazing. Still, she was curious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon opened the box. Inside the box, there was a jewelry box with a plastic top.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Jiwon opened the small jewelry box, a ring was inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2026what the heck?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a roulette event hosted in the street, so they wouldn\u2019t give out a ring. Did Woojin prepare this? Now that she thought about it the whole day was weird.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The theater was empty, and she had received a ring. There was also the expensive restaurant and the unexpected fireworks, and people holding roses\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon\u2019s cheeks reddened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019 can\u2019t be it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was Woojin trying to confess to her? Eh-ee.. No way\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an unbelievable situation, yet her thoughts became chaotic. She was on the fence, but when she looked at the ring, her heart changed to \u2018maybe\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing that prevent her from believing it was Woojin\u2019s attitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon flopped on to her bed. She composed, and deleted several text to send to Woojin. In the end, she couldn\u2019t send the text.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had already received so much, and she would be without a conscience if she also accepted his feelings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon looked through her photo gallery.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She smiled at the selfies taken by Iron man and Spider man. It had been 5 years since she was able to take pictures of herself. She fell asleep as she flipped through the pictures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monday morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Guild Alandal\u2019s office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop being.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTwo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201ctoo nosy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sat on the sofa, and he tapped on armrest with his fingers. Every time he tapped, Woo-soonghoon did a push-up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Soonghoon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon abruptly stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust do what I say, and only what I tell you. What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI misstepped when I tried to express my loyalty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was well aware of that fact, and it was the reason why Soonghoon was still alive. If his action had held any malice, his head would have been sent flying instead of him doing push-ups.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo it in moderation. Moderation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere did you get all the money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI used the guild corporation card\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop being\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooghoon was semi-automatically doing push ups, and the person who saved him was Jung-minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh? President is already here? Huh? Mr Soonghoon is also\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI told you not come to work today. Did you get my message?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha. How could I rest right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had only been a week since they established the guild. He was the general director, but he didn\u2019t have many employees underneath him. This mean the work he had to do was getting larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a mountain of work he had to take care, so how could he rest on an off-day?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t stop Minchan, since he was the one returning his own off-days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen carry on with your work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. Oh yeah. Our business with the Ministry of National Defense was resolved.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Did they accept us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes,sir. When the Ministry of National Defense requests it, you have to participate 10 times in a joint operation. Your enlistment is waived if you honor the condition.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t need to make a plan. When the Dungeon Break happens, he\u2019ll travel to the region, and he\u2019ll mop-up the monsters. Or he could clear a Dungeon pointed out by the government.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did well, director Jung. Ha ha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gave a rare compliment, and Jung-minchan had a satisfied expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s have a company dinner soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Yes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s feelings improved, so he decided to stop torturing Soonghoon. Woojin let him go.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. It\u2019ll be too boring to go to the Dungeon without Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet wasn\u2019t going to invade any time soon, so Woojin decided to rest for one more day. He sank his body into the sofa then he turned on the tv.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He changed the channel several times, and he stopped on a show called \u2018Mysterious TV Surprise\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Dungeon Special. The program talked about the current mysteries regarding the Dungeon, and they showed several people with hypothesis on the subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Monsters are life forms from outer space. The Dungeon is a prelude to the destruction of earth. Soon\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a man touted to be a Dungeon expert, and several scientists were interviewed. They talked about what happened to the Dungeons in the past 5 years, and they were coming up with hypothesis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One talked about the Dungeons existing for longer than 5 years. The other one talked about extraterrestrial beings invading earth. They also discussed several wild rumors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[If we consider the invasion of the extraterrestrial beings as only coming from space, we are only approaching the problem from a 3D perspective. Dungeons are like tunnels. Basically, it is a platform or gate used by the extraterrestrial beings. Soon they will be able cross into earth.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin agreed with this foreign scientist\u2019s words. He showed several evidence as he lended support to his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Even if the beings make a gate, they won\u2019t be able to cross over immediately. It takes 30 days for the Dungeon Break to happen. Why is it 30 days? I\u2019ve formulated a hypothesis about the item called Return Stones. It is the only key that is able to dispel the barrier. I have a hypothesis where the monsters have to protect the Return Stone for 30 days. Then they\u2019ll be able to use the key for themselves\u2026]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? That sounds plausible?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why can monsters only come out 30 days after the Dungeon is made? Maybe the barrier doesn\u2019t exist to protect the Dungeon. It existed to protect Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The monsters from the early Dungeons were weak. They staggered as if they were on drugs. In the beginning, we received a massive amount of casualty, since we weren\u2019t prepared for the monsters. However, when we compare the current monsters to the ones back then, the past monsters were most definitely weaker.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Footage from the Dungeon Shock Woojin hadn\u2019t known about was played.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are small. I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t able to materialize because of the low energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This had already been proved through Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What was it like after the Dungeon Shock? At the time, we only had 4 star Dungeons. Afterwards, the 5 star and 6 star Dungeons started forming more frequently. If events accelerate in this manner, it won\u2019t be long before 7 star Dungeons would start showing up.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he knew it, Woojin was sucked in by what the professor was saying inside the tv.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hypothesis he was presenting was precise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dungeons with larger amounts of energy was being formed. The number of Dungeons increased steadily after the Dungeon Shock, and similarly, the number of Roused on earth was also increasing steadily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the beginning, the highest Rank Roused was Rank C. Now they were in an era where there was a line of Rank A Roused. If they waited a little bit more, a higher Ranked Roused might show up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, it was inevitable for them to show up. Woojin wasn\u2019t sure about everything else, but he was sure about this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rank A Roused were only on par with the 6th Circle Magicians. Of course, there were higher ranked beings in existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what was the cause of the increased number of Roused, and the appearance of the high rank Dungeons? In what way was the earth changing?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The professor inside the tv was giving a warning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Dungeons are not mines. The bloodstones we plunder may just be the bait they are scattering around.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if Woojin was hit on the head with a hammer when he heard those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bloodstones had energy in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The root of the energy was Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe mana concentration\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bloodstones were used to increase the Mana concentration on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would increase the number of Roused, and it would eventually change earth\u2019s environment to be more suitable for the activity of monsters\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of that professor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a moment, the professor\u2019s name popped up, and he wrote it down on a memo. His name was James Toppler, and he was from England.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was immersed in watching the TV when he heard a knock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. It\u2019s Minchan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan spoke to Woojin with a trouble face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMinistry of National Defense contacted us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Ministry of National Defense? They want to mobilize us already?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. He aren\u2019t required to participate. We just have to sent a explanatory statement\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Michan\u2019s job was to make up a believable explanatory statement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. We\u2019ll go. What happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Dungeon Break.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This will be the first time he\u2019ll be able to see the Dungeon Break with his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s in Daegoo. It is the Jookjun station\u2019s 3rd exit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid Soonghoon get off work?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s still outside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReady my car.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would be Alandal\u2019s first joint mission with the Ministry of National Defense, and it would start at Daegoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh mmm..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon\u2019s eyelids closed heavily as she looked at the clock, and she was surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pm 10:20</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She went to sleep at around 12, so it basically meant she had slept for a whole day. She hadn\u2019t had any alcohol yet she had slept for a very long time\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nayoung and Haeji, who was in the same night shift as her, hadn\u2019t woken Jiwon up. They must have went to work without her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon didn\u2019t have time to wash, so she started running in haste as she put on her hat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk, huk. Hello!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dorm\u2019s security guard was puzzled when he faced Jiwon, who had greeted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon barely arrived on time as she punched her factory\u2019s attendance card. She went inside the changing room, and she bowed her head towards her fellow employees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wasn\u2019t late for work. However, not being late for work wasn\u2019t everything. Everyone had already changed into their clothes, and they were in the midst of making instant coffees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone\u2019s gaze was simultaneously focused on Jiwon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ooh ooh. I slept too much.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She hadn\u2019t come in to work yesterday, yet she was almost late today. She wouldn\u2019t garner much sympathy. Their gazes made her feel uncomfortable, so she hurriedly change her clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon took off her hat to change into her uniform.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that really J\u2026jiwon??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cU..unni?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone became surprised when they saw her, and Jiwon lowered her head in embarrassment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry for being late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After saying those words, Jiwon put on her work clothes, and she patted herself down to make herself presentable. She was about to put on her work hat on in front of the mirror when she noticed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon lowered the work hat she was about to put on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was so surprised that no words came out of her mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah.

The skin on her head had been peeled off so the hideous scars had caused a permanent swelling and distortion. Now the scar was completely gone, and it was covered in luscious hair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The length of her hair was uneven, but she didn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon touched her face with trembling hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy face\u2026 My face\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tears fell from Jiwon\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Woojin.

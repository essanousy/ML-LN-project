Then, Haemin was tasked to help Minchan with his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The internet, TV news, and newspapers were in an uproar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that the negotiation hadn't been finalized wasn't a big deal, but the deal was revealed to the public ahead of time at the guidance of the government. Only after couple hours, Alandal had denied agreeing to the deal and caused a huge ripple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kahng-woojin Already in Negotiations to Immigrate to the US?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Korean Government Rejected.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Korea Lost an AA Rank Roused.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hwarang Guild Master. The 3 Great Guild is Enough to Defend Korea.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Japan and China keeping an eye on the situation. The need to find a new AA Roused.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">New articles kept pouring out within several minutes of each other, and it was almost impossible to sort through them all. Minchan didn't respond to any new articles published by the media. He only responded to his new contact from the government.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Our president is resolute in his intentions. There is nothing to reconsider.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They thought this was a negotiation tactic to draw out more favorable terms. However, Alandal's intention was firm. Woojin would never consummate a defense contract with the government. The only thing Minchan could do was deliver their intention of refusal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would have been great if the government just took the hint. However, every time he refused their offer, they kept coming back with better offers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. This is crazy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The benefits were so good that he wanted to accept the deal on the spot. However, what could he do when the president said no?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was really busy, but his dealings with the government weren't the cause. The endless Alandal articles and interview requests weren't the cause either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's already up to 1200 people today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. It keeps coming in. I don't have any time to rest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the number of resumes they received after sending out an official recruitment notice today. If Woojin had given them a guideline, then this would have been easy. However, anyone was able to apply, even the Rank F Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Realistically, those who had already distinguished themselves was already scouted by the other guilds even if they were of low rank. Most of the unattached Roused were mostly Rank F and Rank E.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Rank C and above Roused, who weren't associated with a guild, didn't want to join a guild. So there weren't many applicants in the higher ranks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the applicants were Rank F.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin, who had been promoted to Director, couldn't hide his astonishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt'll be a pain to set up the schedule for the interviews.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe still have to do it. How many applied to the Support Division?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's worse. There are 3200 people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026mmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was astonished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had to make the final decision on the Roused, so Minchan only had to set the schedule and clear a room for the interview. That would be the end of it. It wouldn't be so easy for the Support Division. He had to be very careful in picking his applicants, so he had to thoroughly review the applicants starting from their resumes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The real work would start now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo. It isn't as if we can abstain from picking them. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal had over 100 employees, but thinking about the number of Roused they will be adding soon, he would still be short on employees even if there were 10 times more the number of employees. A single normal Roused needed at least 10 Support members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin laughed even though he was buried under a pile of documents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cHa ha. Still, aren't you overflowing with energy? Vice president Jung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is true, director Kim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha ha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had left the Hammer guild only a month ago yet they were rapidly promoted to the position of vice president, and director.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, his old comrades from the Hammer guild called him quite often. They said they would change jobs if Minchan gave them a spot\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a massive size difference compared to the Hammer guild, but Alandal was much more prestigious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we consider the president's cultivation ability, we will probably surpass everyone in terms of quantity also.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo. Of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sungoo had been Rank F, and Haesol was as well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before they went to the US, Sunggoo had already become rank B. Haesol's rank hadn't been measured yet, but Minchan breathed more easily when he saw the car-sized saber-toothed tiger she brought yesterday.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The president only picked Roused with great potential.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was probably why the president wanted to interview all of the applicants himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, I feel a little bit worried about Mr. Soonghoon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is pretty quick on the uptake, so he'll do well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If viewed in a certain way, Soonghoon would be taking on the most important role. In the end, new Roused and the Support Division didn't matter too much. The main goal was for Kahng-woojin to keep clearing the Dungeons, and Soonhoon had to support him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why a room for a personal assistant was made next to Kahng-woojin's room, and Woo-soonghoon occupied this space. He took care of Woojin's schedule. He also took care of the small tasks, such as driving around Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 20 employees assigned to the personal assistant. This made Woo-soonhoon smile from ear to ear as he happily focused on his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let's work hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. Vice president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh huh. Quite, Director Kim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha ha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The relationship between the vice president and the director was amicable, so the mood inside the office was good. However, employees moved busily as mails kept coming in, and they answered phones that were soundlessly ringing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 5 star Dungeon of Leesoo station's 2nd exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it because the monster\u2019s levels were too low? Woojin finally filled the minuscule amount of EXP he had to raise, having to kill two thirds of the monsters in the field to accomplish this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Level Up!&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's nervousness dissipated when his level reached 70.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He learned the skills that had been sealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Death Knight Summon&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One can establish a master and servant contract with a Death Knight's(at least lvl 70) soul. It allows the Death Knight to be summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They have to accept the role of commander. They have to be treated right for one to earn their loyalty and obedience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They can level up through training and hunting. There was a difference in skills depending on the familiar's level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-------</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shared Skills</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom Steed Summon - Phantom Steed will charge into battle with the Knight after being summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Organize Army - Each level allows control over 10 Skeletons</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Command Troops - Excluding the Skeletons under the Knight's command, the Knight can command the Summoner's troops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> -------</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were the driving force behind why Woojin was able to command a large army numbering in the couple hundred thousands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Necromancer's Control stat was the main reason why one could control the undead, who were basically monsters, as subordinates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Death Knights were commanders, and they were able to organize the Skeletons. He didn't need to waste any Control stats regarding them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His troops wouldn't be controlled by Woojin now. They would be under the control of the commanders, the Death Knights. Woojin only had to manage the Death Knights. He didn't have to waste any brain cells in managing a large army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Lv 1 Kiba&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Lv 1 Rakto&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Lv 1 Viere&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Lv 1 Ramson&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Lv 1 \u2026\u2026.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fifty two of Woojin's reliable Death Knights were unsealed, and they took their place within the Summon Room. Woojin was connect to them telepathically, so when he felt their consciousness, he smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing lacking was their levels, which had been initialized, but he didn't care. It wasn't too hard to level up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This war wasn't ending anytime soon, and the enemies he had to kill were overflowing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if he had met his reliable friends once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that point, Woojin decided to end his hunt for the day. He yelled towards Sunggoo, who was gathering the monsters at a distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunggoo! I don't care if they all burn. Catch them all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggo had been swing his Flame sword to lure the monsters, but now he started slaughtering the monsters. Woojin looked on with satisfaction as flames exploded from various locations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe's grown a lot. Sungoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Sunggoo hunted down the rest of the monsters inside the Dungeon, he took out the Sealed Stone stored inside his Inventory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAl Assad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been lucky. The first level 70 soul he acquired on earth was a Warrior Type Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the exact ingredient he needed to to make a Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took out the corpse with its head separated from the body. Then he broke the Soul Stone to call Al Assad's soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Annihilate the target!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Al Assad's soul rushed forward when he saw Woojin. However, it was in vain, since his fist passed through Woojin. As if he didn't comprehend his situation, Assad's soul was trying every method he could think of to harm Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned. If the several hundred thousand evil souls acted in such a cute manner as Assad, then how great would it be?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gave a quiet command, which acted as an activation word.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Assad's soul stopped in place, and Woojin stood in front of it. The soul struggled as if it was in pain. It could only glance towards Woojin as if it was bound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBecome my slave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What a preposterous demand!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSubmit to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[No way\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKneel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ooh\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, unlike his spirit full of defiance, Assad's soul got on his knees in front of Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the god of Destruction Thrash's Champion, and he had been given authority over the dead as the Immortal. He was the King of the Dead!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Assad's eyes rolled around in its socket. Woojin used the Death Knight Summon skill as he looked at the soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A black energy coalesced in Woojin's hand, and it formed into a twin swords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the weapon used by Al Assad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the weapon the soul wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grabbed the twin swords and raised it slightly towards Assad's shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSurrender.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I s...suren...der.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he cut Assad's throat using the authority given to him by the god of Destruction, his soul would cease to exist. It basically was the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFollow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I...I will f...fo...llow you.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pushed the twin swords toward Al Assad. The soul used both his hand to grab the twin swords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnleash your rage towards my enemies.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[As my master wishes...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Assad gripped his twin swords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His soul started swirling in a whirlwind, and it started soaking into the lifeless body. The decapitated head reattached itself. The flesh started to rot away as it fell away, a skull dyed in black appearing in its place. Black smoke coalesced to form armor and a black cloth wrapped his head to form a keffiyeh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The twin swords formed as it was mounted on his hips. A new Death Knight was born.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou really look like an Arab assassin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He became subservient to become a Death Knight, but he didn't completely trust Woojin. One could feel something was off as his loyalty was absent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was being obedient, since he was being pressed by Woojin's power and authority.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Lv 1 Al Assad&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Immortal Kahng-woojin's 53rd Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was still rebellious. To keep him as a familiar, a considerable amount of Control was being consumed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shared Skill - Phantom Steed, Organize Army, Command Troops</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Innate Skill - Stealth, Ghost Walk, Sword of Death, God's Wrath (Berserk)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Command Troop - 0/10</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Needed Control - 312 (Affected by Trust, Loyalty and Obedience.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each Death Knights were unique, as they had their own preference for the weapons they used and they each possessed their own unique skills. Woojin let out a satisfied laugh as he checked his Death Knight's info. This was the first time he had seen a Assassin Type Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one complaint was the 312 Control Stat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to use Control Stat equivalent to commanding 312 Skeleton Soldiers to maintain his summon over Al Assad. It was an unreasonable number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As time passes, it would decrease. However, if he wanted to use Al Assad in battle, Woojin had to lower the Control Stat to a manageable level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he knew of a very good method to lower the Control Stat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He moved according to Woojin's order, but he didn't answer Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, he won't' act like this for long.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He called out his most loyal knight, and the comrade he had spent the most time on the battlefield with. He called out his friend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKiba.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee-ri-ri-reek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A black smoke was starting to coalesce next to Al Assad. His body was too big to call him a human.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wore a crude armor with a large axe secured on his back. His helmet had a menacing horn on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After several dozen years on the battlefield, the crimson haze around him had turned much more ferocious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-roo-roo-roo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Without realizing it, his breath leaked out, and it was as if a wild animal was breathing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the large body hit the floor, Kiba saw the new Death Knight standing around being insolent. So he kicked Al Assad's knees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be fine if his knees had buckled, but Kiba's enormous strength separated the leg from the body!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiba's rough hand pressed down on top of Al Assad's keffiyeh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oohk.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Al Assad fell flat on his face as if his body had been driven into the floor. Then his forehead and palms touched the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, Kiba bent one knee and pounded a fist on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[My lord, Immortal!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the orcs, he was famed for being the bravest.

He was reunited with his master, Immortal Kahng-woojin, after he was unsealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin automatically let out a bright laugh when he saw Kiba, tough as ever.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been awhile.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After returning to earth, Kahng-woojin regained his most hard and sturdy sword of death.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

There are a lot of swearing in this chapter.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His body was surrounded by light that flowed out from the Dimensional Administrator. His entire body was broken down at the cellular level, and then he felt the curious experience of his cells dispersing as the darkness found him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was in a faraway place, where he almost forgot about time. He tried hard but was barely able to hold onto his consciousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Gang-woojin! Wake up.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, but light grew from the darkness. The light approached him, and he was swallowed by it. Then, the world became bright and the smell of trash filled him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Oooh ooh.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He moaned, but he couldn\u2019t make any other noises. He was barely able to open his eyes, and all he could see was a battered slate roof. After a long time, he felt sensation return to his fingertips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt around his surrounding. He was on top of a recyclable burlap sack. The unidentified trash smell was emanating from there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ve returned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought he knew where this was. He remembered when he caught a glimpse of his memories, which had sank to the bottom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The school\u2019s incineration plant.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gone over to \u2018that place\u2019 twenty years ago at this location. Anyways, he had returned to the starting point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s been twenty years, but everything looks the same.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked a little big more worn down, but the incineration plant looked the same. As he slowly waited for his sense to return, he waited for his body to recover.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Fuck. Hurry up. You son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was barely able to turn his head when he heard sudden noises. Students wearing familiar uniforms descended upon the incineration plant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The uniforms are the same.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wouldn\u2019t have surprised him if the uniform\u2019s design had changed since twenty years had passed. However, it still looked the same so it was a welcoming sight. When he saw the people, he knew he had really returned to earth, so he couldn\u2019t control his emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, three uniformed students were dragging along another student. He looked too normal to be bullied. He was actually a handsome student.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou son of a bitch. Let\u2019s begin after I hit you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy should I get hit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? You son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their fists started to fly, and the two were entangled in a dog fight. The bullies next to them started to join in, and the fight became a one-sided beating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou fucking dick, dare to challenge me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are really a fucking eyesore. Just attend school quietly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was having fun looking at the three of them step on the one student. Somehow, it made him think of the past. Maybe it was because he went through a wretched experience for 20 years, but the childrens' antics were cute to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They beat him until he thought the boy might die. However, the group stopped as they gasped for breath. The student had covered his head with his arms. He was twitching and had various scrapes and wounds. However, his eyes were still giving off a fierce light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The group\u2019s leader, Lee-joonhyuk, didn\u2019t like the light in Do-jaemin\u2019s eyes. All of the students were afraid to look at him. They either avoided eye contact or looked at him with envy in their eyes. However, this son of a bitch was looking at him with such eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, fuck. Yo, Jaemin. Does it hurt? Does it hella hurt? Didn\u2019t I tell you to stop doing irritating things in front of me? Just go to school quietly, all right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBeat it. Fuck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Irritating things? Jaemin had been studying quietly and did nothing wrong. The problem was that he was too handsome. He was being beaten because a girl had a crush on Jaemin, and she was someone Lee-soonhyuk liked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. This son of a bitch hasn\u2019t come to his senses yet? He needs a good beating. Grab this bastard\u2019s body so he can\u2019t move.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bullies grabbed Jae-min in place and pushed him down. Soohyuk let out a dangerous kick into the air. By the look of it, it seemed like he was going to unleash a soccer kick to the other party\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, all of Woojin\u2019s senses returned to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the sudden sound, the kids began to look around their surrounding in surprise. They saw a man wearing strange clothes getting up from atop the recyclable burlap sack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck. What\u2019s your deal? How long have you been there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh, fuck? The only things these brats can say is fuck when they meet a big senior that is like the heavens?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin got off the burlap sack as if he had been riding it. Ah, the Earth\u2019s surface. It has been 20 years since he had been able to step on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if they were delinquents, they were just kids in front of an adult. They were taken aback, so they started looking around furtively. Usually, the delinquents were more strict in respecting the school\u2019s lineage\u2026 (TLN: Koreans are very respectful towards the alumni of their school)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck. Who cares if you are our senior?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026I guess not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop paying attention to us and go on on your way? I don\u2019t know why some beggar is fucking butting in. We high-schoolers aren\u2019t afraid of anything these days, Uncle. Just go on your way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soohyuk was very outspoken. His bluster dispeled his companions' uncertainty. Soohyuk had somewhat thought through everything. The man was here at this time in their school which meant he wasn\u2019t a teacher. Moreover, he was at the incineration plant. He was sure this guy was the neighborhood\u2019s idiot. He was also wearing very thread-bare clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Why are kids these days so rude, especially in front of a big senior with twenty years on you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now Sooyuk was sure after he heard Woojin mumbled to himself. At the very least, this bastard looked to be a college student and he should still be in his 20s. He was sure this guy had lost his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be hit, then get lost. You little bitches.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought these nitwits would runaway if he scared them a little bit. Instead of being afraid, they responded with expressions of disbelief at the threateningly raised hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. This won\u2019t do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pushed his hand forward, and Soohyuk flinched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was taken aback as he extended his arm again. Why wasn\u2019t the Binding Magic forming? Soohyuk frowned at the surprised Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. What are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Why is it being like this? Bind!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, who was taken aback, continuously extended his hand as he shouted. However, the magic didn\u2019t form. Soohyuk spat out insults at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. I got scared for nothing by this Otaku bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soohyuk was sure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been scared for a moment by the village idiot, so his pride was hurt. He reflexively ran forward and swung his fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Soohyuk\u2019s fist could land on Woojin\u2019s head, he tilted it and stepped to the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woosh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. You fucking avoided it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woosh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou son of a bitch. You're looking to die. Fuck this guy up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Soohyuk\u2019s outburst, the lackeys ran in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Huh. I can\u2019t feel the fucking magic.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was taken aback when the magical energy, which had basically been his hands and feet for the past 20 years, didn\u2019t respond to him. However, even if he did lose his magic, he wasn\u2019t weak enough to be hit by the fist of a mere high school boy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magicians were known to be physically weaker than the warriors, but this was only true in the other world. In this place, his physical ability would blow the Special Forces out of the water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to survive in a place crawling with monsters, his fitness had to be at such levels.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin evaded each of the annoying lackeys\u2019 punches. Then, he lightly punched them in the solar plexus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-puh-puk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOok.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three precise attacks made all three of them sprawl on the floor. It happened so fast that Do-jaemin forgot about his hurting body and stared on dumbly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAw..awesome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Woojin defeated the annoying people, he pressed his hand on his temple. When his thoughts became complicated, he had a habit of unintentionally doing this motion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I guess it won\u2019t matter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe it was a side-effect of the dimensional travel. He wasn\u2019t sure if he had lost his magic or it had been sealed. However, it might not have matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This place was Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters will no longer threaten him, and he wouldn't need to fight to the death to survive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe\u2026.?</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

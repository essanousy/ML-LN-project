It stinks\u2026 What happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pinched his nose then he took a step back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. He made a mess.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Haemin looked into the back seat of the car, he shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon was still asleep, but the smoothie inside his intestines was warming up inside of Sunggoo\u2019s car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve called for a chauffeur service, president. Let\u2019s go to the main road.\u201d (TLN: can hire someone to drive your car for $$)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was always quick to act. He looked at Woojin after he finished making a call for a car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Everyone won\u2019t be able to fit inside the car\u2026 I\u2019ll just take a taxi. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, director Hong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease take good care of Mr. Soonghoon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, Minchan and Haemin left side by side. Sunggoo looked at the back seat with tears in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-hook. I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Hoo-hook..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know if Soonghoon was in a drunken stupor or he was talking in his sleep. Sunggoo felt sorry for him, and he also felt annoyed\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy Boongboong\u2026 Boongboong\u2026.\u201d (TLN: nickname for car)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t been too long since he took out this car yet it was already in this state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo held back his tears as he waited for the chauffeur to come.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin got off on the main road in front of his house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president. Please head on in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin waved his hand then he walked into an alley. When he checked there weren\u2019t any people around, he called out Bibi. The black smoke coalesced, and a figure of a cat solidified on top of Woojin\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. We are already home-nahong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin\u2019s familiar was inside the Summoning room, they shared his sight and senses. From Bibi\u2019s perspective, it was better for her to stay inside the Summoning room instead of the house. She didn\u2019t like being separated from Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy? Are you worried?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. I am worried-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed as he picked up Bibi from his shoulder, then he held her against his chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah should be close to the dog now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, Sooah had wanted a dog. She might leave Bibi alone now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe secret code this time is\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin found the memo inside his hand phone, then he pressed the secret password to the front door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi ddi ddi, ddi-ri-reek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After returning home, the first one to greet Woojin was the dog. He came running towards Woojiin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWal, wal! Koo-rooh-roong.\u201d (TLN: bark bark growl)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been only gone for several days, but the dog had grown a lot. Woojin flicked his finger on the dog\u2019s forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s showing teeth after not seeing me for only several days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin lifted the fairly large dog, then he looked into the dog\u2019s eyes. He glared into the dog\u2019s eyes, and his eyes shook. The dog couldn\u2019t maintain eye contact, so he turned his gaze away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-oohng, ggoo-oohng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah was the one to rescue the whining dog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMom! Oppa is here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah bounded towards him. Woojin let go of the dog, and he opened both his arms wide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. My Sooah missed oppa?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After she gave a brief hug, she immediately went towards Bibi. She quickly grabbed Bibi into her grasp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Bibi. Didn\u2019t you miss unni?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of forgetting Bibi, her absence must have fostered Sooah\u2019s yearning for Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a bitter laugh. Bibi sent a gaze asking for salvation towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t like playing with the dog?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI play with Bokhwee, but I like Bibi better.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Bokhwee is his name?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOohng!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After she spoke in a bright manner, she ran into the living room, while she hugged Bibi. Then she searched for her laser pointer. His mother showed up around that time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are here, Woojin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s talk for a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin followed his mother into the kitchen. After he sat near the small dining table, his mother took out some water from the fridge. She placed the water in font of Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you drink alcohol?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Did you meet the president?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I was at a company dinner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the news said he was heading towards the Cheongwadae immediately after he returned from North Korea. Woojin felt a bit awkward, so he changed the topic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll meet the president soon. So why isn\u2019t Sooah asleep yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The company dinner wrapped up early, but it was already 11 pm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday tomorrow. She said she\u2019ll sleep after seeing her oppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If that was true, then why was she playing only with Bibi?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah still feels very awkward around you. You should be mindful of that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While she played with Bibi, Sooah kept sneaking glances towards the kitchen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now that he thought about it he had memories of Sooah when she was a baby. However, Sooah didn\u2019t have any memories of him. She had suddenly gained an oppa, but the oppa didn\u2019t come home regularly\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. Should we go on a family trip?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to steal time away from my busy son.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin suddenly felt embarrassed at his mother\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSooah\u2019s been sick a lot in the past. The hospital says she is doing fine, but she occasionally develops the same symptoms as before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though Woojin and his father had disappeared, Soohah\u2019s hospital fees were a big reason why their household\u2019s wealth had diminished so quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin started raiding the Dungeons, she had the money to purchase almost everything she wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Lee-soogyung went back to the hospital to treat her daughter\u2019s ailments. In the past, she couldn\u2019t afford to treat Sooah. However, contrary to her expectation, the hospital test result gave Sooah a clean bill of health.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe is so young, and when she occasionally has a seizure, mother\u2019s heart is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his mother\u2019s eyes started to become moist, Woojin\u2019s heart became heavy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe child is sick, but the hospital keeps saying nothing is wrong with her. I was so frustrated that I even visited a shaman not too long ago. The shaman said she was inhabited by ghosts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. She doesn\u2019t have any ghosts sticking to her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one with ghosts was Woojin. There weren\u2019t any evil spirits within the vicinity of Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had been very careful since he worried about his evil spirits sticking to his family. Even when they lived in a single room, Woojin tried to minimize the time he spent with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow would you know about such things?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How should he answer the question when she asked how he knew this\u2026 Mother. Your son is an expert about ghosts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven though I knew the shaman was trying to bewitch me, her words still made me wonder.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. The shaman sounds like a fraud\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m saying this, because I\u2019m upset. I can\u2019t even support my son who is doing big things. Please look in on your only sibling once in awhile.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyung saw Kahng-woojin appear daily on the television, so she knew he was busy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn\u2019t he succeed in pulling off some big job in North Korea?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t want Woojin to worry about the problems within the household. She wanted him to focus on his outside work, but this was about Sooah. Sooah\u2019s illness was beyond her power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The child was hurting yet there weren\u2019t any solutions. She was barely able to put the issue out in the open as she had continued to internalize the pain she had felt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll pay a little more attention to her.. I\u2019m sorry, mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tightly hugged the sniffling Lee-soohgyung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin went towards the living room, and he spent some time with Sooah. The cat acted as a bridge as he played with Sooah. There weren\u2019t any awkwardness as they played, and they had a fun time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was getting late, so his mother took Sooah, who had wanted to play more. Only Woojin, Bibi and Bokhwee was left in the living room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoon koong, koong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bohkhwee was having a hard time calming himself after running and playing around. His nose twitched, and he rubbed his head on Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng! Go away-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgeeeng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi swung her front paw. Bokhwee ran away after he was hit on the head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. Let\u2019s go bring a new cat-ahong. I\u2019d rather kill monsters. This is too hard-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou just have to play with her for a brief amount of time. What\u2019s so bad about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. It\u2019s more about me pretending to be a cat. It\u2019s very taxing-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026so, that\u2019s what stressed her out. Woojin also put on a serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease endure it for a little bit more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. I understand-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen stay a home for a while. You should keep a close watch on Sooah to see if any evil spirits approach her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t think Sooah was being tormented by an evil spirit, but since his mother had said it, he was leery of dismissing her claim. He thought about attaching Ggaebi on Sooah, but he was still a low level Shadow. He could have a bad influence on the host.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As of right now, Bibi was the best option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe child\u2019s soul is strong-ahong. A mere evil spirit won\u2019t be able to latch on to her-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should stay with her just in case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was his familiar, so she could feel Woojin\u2019s emotions. She knew how precious his family was to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi followed Woojin into his room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgeeng. Ggeeng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bokhwee was the only one left in the hall way, and he looked around nervously at the dark corridor. After a moment, the door to Woojin\u2019s room opened slightly, and Bibi walked out into the hallway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. You may come in here-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bokhwee wagged his tail as he followed Bibi into Woojin\u2019s room, and he laid down at the foot of the bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was Saturday, but Woojin came early to the office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother was curious about Do-jiwon, so they had made an appointment for lunch. In the evening, they had promised to meet the high school friends they were able to contact. Before all of this, he had some work he had to finish at the office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since it was Saturday, the new employees didn\u2019t come to the office. The founding members had come to work at an earlier time, and they were waiting for Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere\u2019s Haemin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s inside the storage room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s head over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan received an order from Woojin to buyout the floor. Minchan paid a premium to clear out the other offices on the floor, and he made contracts for the other office spaces. The current office they had was getting too cramped, and this also resolved the problem of security.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They decided to use a roughly 1800 square feet space as the office for housing the sales department, and a storage room for the Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The storage room held a small amount of Artifacts that wouldn\u2019t even fill up a 1 ton truck. Moreover, the normal items and large ingredients made up most of the pile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the first place, Alandal had only two Roused, Woojin and Sunggoo. It was inevitable for the collection to be small.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The drop rate for Artifacts were high only for the first clear of a Dungeon, so even if they had a low number of Roused, the guild possessed a relatively numerous amount of Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you a bit sober now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I\u2019m deeply ashamed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon was still hungover. He lowered his head .</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Minchan and Haemin had been hardened by company life. Their faces were fine. Sunggoo\u2019s body couldn\u2019t\u2019 be compared to before, so he looked fresh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019ll take it out now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone looked at Woojin with anticipation in their eyes. Woojin opened his inventory, and he started taking out Kim-jungun\u2019s collection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun wasn\u2019t a Roused, but he had gathered a lot of Artifacts and Skill books. Woojin had run out of Inventory space, so he had to waste a lot of Achievement Points to add additional slots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if Woojin was snatching items out of empty air. The items started pouring on to the floor like piles of clothes one saw in the market.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The amount of items far outstripped what one could earn clearing a Dungeon several times. Everyone\u2019s mouth fell open in shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you guys doing? Start sorting it out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSort out the item we\u2019ll be able to sell on the market. Then sort out the stolen goods we\u2019ll have to fence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026president actually acknowledged these were stolen goods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have been put in an awkward situation if Woojin unreasonably demanded him to sell all these items on the market for money. Minchan was thankful towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin poured out a lot of Artifacts, and it filled up an entire section of the storage room. They would need three 1 ton trucks to move it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Minchan\u2019s direction, everyone started sorting the Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The basic ingredients and Skill books that existed in high quantity wasn\u2019t of much interest. They looked for items with unique shapes and unique abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, they made a separate pile for items people would recognize where it came from just by looking at it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were some unique items with low value, but most of the times were high performance Artifacts. There were 10 Artifacts that would conservatively sell for 10 to 20 million dollars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019ll use these.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took a pair of earrings. It wouldn\u2019t be very noticeable even if he wore it. Then he put the rest of the Artifacts into his inventory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened his Advanced Skill, then he put all the Artifacts into the [Combination Box]. At the bottom, there were two options. The [Combine] button was off, and the [Extract] button started blinking brightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t hesitate to press the [Extract] button.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

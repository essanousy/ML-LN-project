When she looked around her surrounding, she was at Jaemin\u2019s house. Bits and pieces of her memories started to piece itself together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s dongsaeng named Sunggoo took the lead, and he started a crazy storm of games. It caused her to frantically drink alcohol. Sunggoo had wished in vain for her to take off her hat, and he was persistent in getting her to drink.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then everything became too dizzy, so she leaned forward on the table, and her hat had fallen off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey saw everything\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wanted to hide it. She met someone who only remembered her beautiful old self. However, she had shown all of her embarrassing personal matter now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s such a big deal. She\u2019s still pretty.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When her hat fell off, she didn\u2019t have the courage to get up. So she pretended to have fallen asleep. However, she did drink too much alcohol, so her memory was fuzzy\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She thought Woojin had carried her over here\u2026 Then her film of memory was cut for real, and she couldn\u2019t remember anything aftwerards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon put her hands over her reddened cheeks, then she realized she still had her hat on. She tried to take it off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOuch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon slowly pulled against her hat and several strands of her hair was pulled along with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzeeeee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On both side of the hat, several strands of hair came off with the scotch tapes. When she saw this, Jiwon could\u2019t help but laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She couldn\u2019t remember when he stuck it on her, but it strangely made her heart flutter. How could a scotch tape shake a person\u2019s heart like this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This person called her pretty even though she had changed into a monster. She had assumed no one would think such thoughts about her unless the person was crazy. However, Woojin had appeared in front of Jiwon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her heart fluttered, and she was hungover. After quenching her thirst with water, she tried to go into the restroom, but the door was locked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, uh? Noonah is awake? Wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you awake so early in the morning?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? While I was sleeping, I realized I didn\u2019t do the l\u2026laundry. I didn\u2019t want noonah to work too hard on my behalf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the heck. At least leave the door open.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? W\u2026wait a moment. I\u2019m almost done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was 5 in the morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door to the restroom didn\u2019t open for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin woke up from his sleep, and the first thing that greeted him was Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you sleep well-ahong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. What were those things chasing after me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s Pororo\u2019s friend-aohng. I saw it on the television-ahong.\u201d (TLN: It\u2019s a real tv show. If you are curious, google this. \u201c??? ???\u201d)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a long dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They chased after him with a bright smile\u2026 He could still hear the laugh of the animal friends circling around his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring me my hand phone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood-aohng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi brought the hand phone with her mouth. He opened the phone then he composed a text message.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hammer Hotel Room 1703. If you come later than 9 o\u2019clock then I\u2019m going to beat you up.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was 8 o\u2019clock right now. One hour was plenty of time for him to come here. Woojin\u2019s body was soaked with sweat. He got up from the bed to wash his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwaaaahhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He finished showering, and when he came out, Bibi was looking at a brochure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s the Room service guide-ahong. I want to eat this-nyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRoom service?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the guide, then he picked up the hotel\u2019s phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess they deliver food.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon after Woojin ordered the room service, the food picked out by Bibi showed up. It was spread out as if he was at a restaurant. Woojin was astonished by the food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Earth stacks up well against Alphen.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought the nobles of Alphen lived in extreme luxury. However, if one had money, one could live in comparable luxury on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. Woojin hadn\u2019t experienced being in the upper class on earth yet, so it might be more luxurious over here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the plates of food were spread out, Bibi quickly jumped on top of the dining table then she picked up a fork.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. I wanted to eat this-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi picked up a Tonkatsu, which didn\u2019t exist on Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. They fried the pig. The cooking methods of the Earthlings is fascinating-aohng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if it isn\u2019t pork, they fry everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that true-nyahong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alphen\u2019s cuisine didn\u2019t have any fried foods. Bibi started talking about various foods she saw on tv, and how she was going to eat all of them next time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin realized something, while he was looking at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I should also watch some tv.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the 20 year gap in his consciousness. He was gone for only 5 years, but Woojin had returned to earth after 20 years. It wouldn\u2019t be strange if he claimed the earth in his memory and the current earth were basically different worlds to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Excluding the time he spent in the Dungeon, Woojin decided to dedicate all of his time on watching tv. He\u2019ll be able to enjoy the popular culture, and it will allow him to quickly adjust to society.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the midst of the meal, the bell rang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBibi. Go back into the Summoning room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. I haven\u2019t had my fill yet-nyahng..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll buy you more later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right-ahong. You most definitely have to buy it for me-nyahng..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi turned into black smoke, and she suddenly disappeared. Woojin packed his belongings, then he opened the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was waiting on his knees in front of the door. When Woojin came out, he prostrated himself on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I lost my mind after I became drunk yesterday. Please forgive me, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Were you able to make an appointment for a 4 star Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he thought about the money he made per hour then quickly clearing the 3 star Dungeons was the way to go. However, the experience he earned was low.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If his goal was to level up, then it would be better if he attacked a 3 star Dungeon. The money he lacked in purchasing his house could all be earned before he moved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll find it soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go down and have a cup of cofee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo went down to the coffee shop provided by the hotel on the 1st floor. They made their orders, then they sat down in the chairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe coffee price here is really expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a hotel\u2026. Hotels are originally expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. Anyways, hurry up and find it. Since you are making an appointment, why don\u2019t you just book us for everything available this week.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was a bit different from the others. If one was a normal Roused, 4 star Dungeons were more profitable than the 3 star Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a monstrous clear time, so he was able to finish a 3 star Dungeon in a blink. He could make more profit per hour in a 3 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, if he became familiar with the 4 star Dungeons, then he could probably decrease the clear time. It would allow him to make more money per hour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 4 star Dungeons were very large and there were too many variables. The 4 star Dungeons were dangerous, so the Roused teams attempted it carefully. Still, there weren\u2019t that many 4 star Dungeons in existence, so there weren\u2019t many open spots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Sunggoo was busyily searching for a Dungeon, Woojin focused on the game on his hand phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pew pew, Pahng-yah!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook who it is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin heard a pleasant voice, and the voice wasn\u2019t welcomed by him. Woojin turned his head to see a smiling Jung-minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. You show up like a ghost.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Before I go to work, I always drink a cup of coffee here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was lying. Hammer hotel was managed by the Hammer guild. He had known since yesterday that Woojin had checked into this hotel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhjuhshi. This is another coincidence?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahahaha. I guess so. Maybe we are fated to meet each other?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shrugged his shoulder when he heard the sly words. Then he pointed towards a seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are here then why don\u2019t you have a seat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould I?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Jung-minchan took a seat, Woojin asked him a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you have some business with me then be quick about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. What business would I have with you? I\u2019m sorry about what happened yesterday. If you need anything, just say the word. I\u2019ll give you anything as an apology.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned. Why was this man so passionate about bringing him into the same guild as him? What did he gain by it?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs Mr. Sunggoo perhaps making a appointment for a Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Yes. I\u2019m trying to find an empty spot in the schedule for a 4 star Dungeon, but there aren\u2019t\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDungeon Forum has a number of uses, but it isn\u2019t specialized. Please wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan took out a notebook he brought on the table. He ran a program, and all the appointments to the high ranked Dungeons was projected on the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was surprised, but Woojin wasn\u2019t interested. He didn\u2019t care if a good computer program or his underling was used to make an appointment. If he was able to make an appointment, then either method sufficed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Guild Support Division is specialized to deal with such problems. Moreover, if a Roused like Woojin joins our guild, you will get free housing. Ah. If you prefer the hotel, then you could use this place indefinitely. A lot of Roused already use this place as their lodging.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin glanced at Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat does sound good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. Are you a little bit interested now? Look over here. This is the list of the empty slots for the 4 star Dungeons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Four slots of 11 am, 2 pm, 5 pm and 10 pm was empty. The Appointment fee, and Usage fee was all listed on the side. The program was most definitely better than the Dungeon Forum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what should I do? Should I make you an appointment? If you were in a guild, then you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about such cumbersome procedures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It really seemed he would be more comfortable if he had a guild. Woojin asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I take down your guild leader then will I become the guild master??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan couldn\u2019t speak for a long time after he heard such absurd words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I knew it. I guess he wants a high position?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan thought his prediction had been correct. Woojin was in the midst of negotiating with him. He acted uninterested, but he kept leaving hints.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he checked into the Hammer hotel was a signal being sent to Minchan. It was a signal saying I am staying here, so come find me.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have nothing that could reel this guy in. However, I have to catch a Roused of this caliber no matter what.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be best to accede to whatever he wanted. Adding Woojin to the guild would be a gain for the guild. Without the president\u2019s approval, it would be hard to give him the vice president seat. However, if Woojin was able to get the position of team leader for a Roused team, then would he accept Minchan\u2019s offer?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan\u2019s mind raced as Woojin pointed to the very top Dungeon listed on the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill I be able to make appointments with this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it ok to help people who aren\u2019t in your guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a favor. A favor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Minchan laughed, Woojin also laughed after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was too elaborate for this meeting to have been a coincidence. Kim-haemin was ready outside the hotel with his car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy car is in the parking lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. When you finish clearing the Dungeon, I\u2019ll bring you back here. Ah. Of course, this is a benefit provided to the Roused who join our guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As they listened to Minchan\u2019s guild promotion, Woojin and Sunggoo got into the car. Haemin drove two station down from the Sahdahng station. They headed towards the Seoul National University Station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was within walking distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve finished making an appointment. There is a little bit of time left before you can use the Dungeon. Why don\u2019t we come back after having some tea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was 1 hour left until the appointed 11 o\u2019clock time. This was a great opportunity for Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe descriptions of the Seoul National University Station\u2019s 2nd entrance is in the guide. However, would you give me some time to brief you on this Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seoul National University Station\u2019s 2nd entrance wasn\u2019t owned by the Hammer guild. However, the information about the high rank Dungeons were traded between guilds. This was why Minchan knew all the details about this Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was important to have a briefing before attacking a Dungeon. If one paid attention and acted on the information, the Dungeon attack becomed much easier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Knowledge was power! If one enters a guild, then one could clear a Dungeon comfortably! Minchan wanted Woojin to know this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. That\u2019ll be great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Minchan\u2019s face brightened at Woojin\u2019s assent, a bright light was emitted by the 6th exit across the intersection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? It\u2019s a Dungeon Reset.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had seen it on film, but this was the first time Sunggoo had seen it in person. He spoke out in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one reason why the Dungeon would glow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dungeon Reset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Mine\u2019s life span had come to an end, and it had turned into a new Dungeon. If the Dungeon couldn\u2019t be cleared in 30 days, then a Dungeon Break would happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJ..jeez. Hurry up and contact the guild, Haemin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin busily made a call. Woojin\u2019s gaze rested on the location across the intersection as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo a free Dungeon formed over there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dungeon Reset. The first one to clear the Dungeon went missing, so the Dungeon basically became owner-less.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, a Dungeon wasn\u2019t like picking up a coin off the floor. It would be reckless to attempt it\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s two eyes became fully alert when he saw the people busily moving around the 6th exit.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Woojin was slowly walking down a backstreet of the inner-city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard started to take a circuitous route. He must have realized that Woojin was following him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI've been found.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had nothing more to gain by following him. The man didn't seem dumb enough to go straight to his home base when he knew that Woojin was on his tail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin agonized over the decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already stuck Ggaebi on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he let the bastard go, so Ggaebi could gather information?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't like Ggaebi was undetectable when he hid inside the shadows. A Roused with great senses would realize that something was amiss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In fact, acts such as surveillance, tailing and eavesdropping wasn't his forte.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he was reluctant to kidnap, incarcerate, and threaten someone...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll just worry about it after I catch him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked quickly to close the distance with the bastard. When he turned the corner to the alley, Woojin saw a guy holding a large guitar case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's that bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin started to gradually close the distance, the bastard turned to look at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Both of them stopped walking, and their eyes met.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Lv 71 Al Assad&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard started running, and Woojin followed him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c7th Circle?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time he had seen a Roused who had past lvl70.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meant that his opponent was a Rank AA Roused. There were a lot of Roused in the latter stage of level 60. It would have been strange if there were no level 70 Roused to be found if one scoured the entire world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the future, more Roused would break through the 6th Circle wall and enter the 7th Circle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was in the future. He was currently chasing a Roused, who was arguably one of the top Ranked Roused of Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA bastard like that is aiming for me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's curiosity grew since he wanted to know who was pulling this man's strings. Maybe he might have to become enemies with one of the great powers of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin increased his speed, but the bastard was quite fast. It wasn't easy to close the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt feels like he is purposefully leading me on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His speed was just fast enough that Woojin couldn't catch up to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was always a fixed distance between them. Truthfully, the bastard wasn't in a hurry at all. Woojin guessed that he was a 7th Circle physical ability Roused. Moreover, he seemed to be well trained. Lee-hyunhwee couldn't hold a candle to to this guy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was a Necromancer, but he was also a Warrior. He used his Dash Skill and his speed increased by several magnitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI got\u2026 him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to grab the guitar case, but it seemed that the bastard also had a similar ability to the one he used. He suddenly sped up, and he created some distance between himself and Woojin once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Look at this cheeky bastard?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was there anyone on earth who had caught Woojin's eyes like this? Woojin was probably the first strong person that the guy had met on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After running away for awhile, the bastard stopped in front of a subway station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard wagged his finger as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only a 2 lane road between them, yet this bastard was taunting him. When Woojin saw this, a thought flitted through his mind. In recent days\u2026 No. In the past 10 years, he'd never seen someone be so daring and provoking towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Does the bastard think he is Bruce Lee?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After smiling, he immediately entered the Dungeon. Woojin clicked his tongue in dismay as he watched the man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is quite novel. It's cute.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't care about who was pulling the bastard's string. He was going to kill that son of a bitch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The barrier formed itself 30 seconds after the man entered the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin passed through the Dungeon's entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Al Assad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was born in Afghanistan, and his father had sold him to the militants at the age of 10.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The moment his eyes witnessed his father being happy as he grabbed a paltry amount of money for selling him, Assad decided become a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was quite good at using a knife and gun. The children his age were used as bait to absorb bullets, but Assad grew up to be a fantastic militant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world he lived in was constantly at war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon Break happened when he was 20 years old, and the world turned chaotic. The war was present before the Dungeon Break, and it still continued on afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing that had changed was his status as a Roused. He was no longer used as a grunt in the war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He caught the eyes of militant group's leader. Instead of being sent into a regional warfare against the government forces, he was given more sophisticated assignments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was given targets to assassinate, and he carried out terrorist acts. He was successful in all of his assignments, so he gradually made a name for himself. He was able to become a key member of the core personnel. At that point, he realized that he wasn't doing his work for his faith. He realized that he was doing it for the money, but it didn't matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't start what he was doing, because of his belief in his god.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His actions allowed him to punish others, and on top of that, he was able to make money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Money is what changed the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had never killed any monsters before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He only hunted humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Today, he caught a Necromancer, who was reported as being Rank AA.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Rank wasn't important.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had assassinated countless Roused, and he was well acquainted with their Ranks. He knew better than anyone that a high Rank didn't correspond with the person's combat power. He just had to quietly approach magicians, and cut their throats. Even if one were Rank A, one would die immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was very easy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he entered the Dungeon, he gave up his body to the darkness to hide. His ability allowed him to assimilate into the darkness. His specialty was sneaking up on his enemies, and killing them before they realized he was there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Hey. Come out. Are you trying to break bread with me inside the Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is he speaking Korean?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">According to the intel regarding his target, the bastard was Korean.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess you aren't going to come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of his steps grew distant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed this guy's luck was good. His steps steadily grew distant from Assad, who was hidden next to the wall. He moved deeper into the subway station using the staircase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Stupid bastard.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed that he didn't have any magic associated with the senses. Now he was sure that this person was a Necromancer. The bastard had carelessly come into the Dungeon after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The baiting of his target had been successful. Now he just had to follow him, and his hunt would start.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Al Assad assimilated into the darkness as he headed down into the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How far did he go?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was weird. His target had chased after him into the Dungeon. Assad had baited the other man into doing so. However, this bastard acted as if he had forgotten about Assad's existence. Or maybe the man had too much confidence in his own ability. He slowly descended into the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Al Assad was carefully walking forward, he came to a stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018There are no corpses here.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of blood stains in the surrounding, but there were no corpses. A weird sense of danger stimulated his senses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwahhhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A light lit up the interior of the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. You gave me time to recharge my souls. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Assad's target appeared in front of him, but the target wasn't flustered at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow, show me your abilities. Let's see if it is useful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his target said some words that Assad didn't understand, the Skeleton Soldiers lining up behind him rushed forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne, two\u2026 \u201c</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was useless to count them. There were enough to clog the Dungeon. Assad unsheathed his specialized weapon, the two-handed sword, as he charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-oh. You are quite good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Assad was at a numerical disadvantage, but the quality of the Skeletons were low. He methodically cut them down, but it wasn't an easy task. Each of his specialized skills for the two-handed long sword were put on display in front of his enemy. The information about him was being exposed to his enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are an assassin type, and you are quite proficient in using a two-handed sword. One on one fights would suit you more than fighting a group.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His target\u2019s Korean words kept grating against his nerves for some time. It sounded like he was being evaluated\u2026 The bastard didn't even lift a single finger as he watched from a distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hook-ook, hook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Al Assad let his hidden ability explode forth. He started breathing heavily, and his movement couldn't be compared to what it was before. Every time he swung his two-handed long sword, a large group of Skeletons fell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-oh. You are also a Berserker? You are both a Warrior type and an Assassin. Are you a Dual Class?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He leapt toward his taunting enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His final move was called God's Wrath. His anger towards the world poured out without reserve, and it helped power the move. When his two-handed long sword was about to strike the necromancer's neck, a steel staff was suddenly in the sword's way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou'll be useful. Quite useful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Necromancer swung his Steel Staff towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh, puhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was momentarily confused at the unexpected strength of the impact. Didn't the intel say that he was a Necromancer?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His target's foot kicked out at Assad's chest. He couldn't do anything against his target's strength, so Assad grabbed the other man's foot. He tried to lift it up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's see what'll happen when I turn level 70.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, the weapon changed into an axe, and it fell towards Assad's neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he was cutting wood, Woojin separated the guy's head from his body. Before the bastard's soul could escape, he purchased a Soul Seal Stone, and he put the soul inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard was only barely over 7th Circle. However, this was the first 7th Circle Warrior's soul that he had obtained on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was meaningless to torture the bastard to find out who was pulling his strings. When Woojin reached level 70, he'll make this bastard a familiar and he'll naturally find out everything that this bastard knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put the bastard's corpse and his decapitated head inside his inventory. Then, he gathered the surviving Skeletons around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did he have to come into a high rank Dungeon for no reason?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't locate the Return Stone. As he had predicted, a red portal formed when he returned to the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill I be late?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn't they say the consortium was at lunch time?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin quickly started to hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin came out of the Dungeon, he felt someone's gaze on him. Someone was monitoring Woojin from afar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Follow me, Ggaebi.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I obey master's will.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After confirming that Ggaebi had been absorbed back into his shadow, he started to walk. It seemed the people, who had attacked him, were in charge of this Dungeon. There wasn't anyone guarding the Dungeon. Woojin memorized the Dungeon's name, then he started walking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. Where the hell am I?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had mindlessly chased after the man last night, so he had no idea where he was. It would be great if he had his hand phone, but he left it at the hotel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe the store sells English?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin checked his Point Store just in case, and he looked over the Language drugs. There were drugs that allowed him to learn languages of Alphen... The store had English!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't only English. The store had all the languages spoken on Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was worth 200 Points. Woojin bought it immediately, then he drank it. It was akin to learning a new ability through a Skill book. Woojin learned the English language in an instant. Whether it was an ability or a new knowledge, it took root inside his head, and it felt quite miraculous to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His ears started picking up the conversations in his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He asked for direction from the people in the street, then he headed towards Manhattan's Titan guild headquarters for the appointed consortium.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It won't take long if I ride a taxi, but I don't have any money to pay for the ride.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If this was Alphen, he would have just stolen it...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, I did say that I wouldn't cause any accidents.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026he just started walking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The consortium started at 12, so he would be late.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what if he was late?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan had come to the consortium with him, so he would take care of it. Woojin just had to meet the Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Woojin was walking on the streets, he caught sight of the news being shown on a large screen mounted on top of a building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's about what happened yesterday.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed that someone had filmed yesterday's missile explosion with a phone. The sight of the missile exploding, and the large crater on the road was being shown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTerrorist Attack. Is it a repeat of the 9/11 nightmare? Humanity's enemy isn't monsters, but terrorists?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin read the subtitles on the muted news. The screen changed then an announcer and an Asian man was shown.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Minchan?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The familiar Asian man was Jung-minchan. He was scrunching up his face like he was a constipated dog. When Woojin turned his head slightly, he could see that the same news being shown inside the convenience store located across the street from him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddal-lahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin entered the convenience store, the employee behind the counter glanced at Woojin. After confirming an Asian male in a sweatsuit had entered the store, the employee's gaze went back to the TV.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It would have exploded within the hotel. During such harrowing situation, the Korean male, Mr. Kanhg-woojin threw his body to block the attack. Currently, the whereabouts of Mr. Kahng-woojin are still unknown\u2026 ]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the announcer's words, Jung-minchan butted in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[President. I trusted president from the start! Where are you, president? Please come back to me.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. That rascal. If someone saw him like that, one would think that he was trying to find a lost child.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, Woojin's heart warmed a little bit when he saw someone being worried about him to that extent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Don't worry, Minchan. I can speak English now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The US government will catch the terrorists. Please just return to us, president. I beg of you. Please before the incident become much larger\u2026 ]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI already caught him, you dork..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wooijn grinned as a missing person's report was shown on top of the screen. Then the news showed the footage where he charged the missile. The missile was deflecting upwards as it exploded, and he saw himself fall to the ground. The news was showing the footage in a loop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The eyes of the store's employee turned round, and he alternated from looking at Woojin and the TV.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

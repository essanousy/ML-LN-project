Several people were drunk, and their faces were red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was especially true for Woo-soonghoon. He had drunk faster than anyone else, and his eyes were already half closed.\u201cOoh ooh. President is quite strong against alcohol.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon, who had bragged about playing around a little in the past, couldn\u2019t hold his liquor. He wagged his tongue towards Woojin. Woojin drank his soju, and his expression didn\u2019t change at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he compared soju to Alphen\u2019s alcohol, it was like drinking water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHook hook. President drinks alcohol well, so why did you hit me??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Why are you being like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and Haemin tried to hold back Woo-soonghoon as they were mindful of Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt hurt. So what if I overpriced the hand phones I sold? It happens! Hoo-ook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he feel regret about not killing that bastard?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and Haemin saw Woojin\u2019s expression turn sour, so they quickly put Woo-soonghoon inside the car. When Soonghoon was leaned against the back seat, he immediately fell asleep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh whew.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo laid Soonghoon down, then he asked a question using his liquid courage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI worry you don\u2019t pay enough attention to the mass media every time I observe you. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of caring?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. Isn\u2019t it annoying? The reporters will flock to you\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could his words not get through to Woojin? Sunggoo couldn\u2019t coherently get his point across, so he was frustrated. Jung-minchan, who was listening from the side, understood what Sunggoo was trying to say, so he chipped in with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou will have problems with the law, and you might have to worry about international isolation. What is the benefit of making enemies?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m making enemies\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stroked his chin. After he drank a shot of alcohol, he looked at Sunngoo, Minchan and Haemin. They were all Alandal\u2019s guild members, so they would have to know about this eventually.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the past, I thought the same as you guys. I was mindful of other nations. I was scared about the public sentiment, and I was conscious of how others looked at me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What happened in Alandal that made him so unreasonable now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLaws exists right now since countries exist. How long do you think that will last?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone\u2019s attention was on Woojin when he asked such a ridiculous question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Dungeons will erupt. Moreover, it will explode soon. It isn\u2019t far away. It is imminent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t have evidence supporting his claim. However, he could feel it. The Dungeon Breaks weren\u2019t far away. Moreover, it will be a widespread Break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry thinking about what would happen if all the Dungeons on earth overflowed at the same time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An apocalypse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was too horrible to imagine, so no one opened their mouth. It felt as if the alcohol drained right out of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, we have a military. They\u2019ll be able to block it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin snorted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it\u2019s only 6 star monsters, they will be able to block them. What about the higher ranked monsters?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think this was the endgame? Mmm. Let\u2019s see. The 6 star monsters are like the dogs you grow in your house. The tigers, lions and carnivorous elephants will pour out soon. If it doesn\u2019t end there, dragons might also come out later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should they believe his word or not?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the Specters come out right now, the modern technologies would be useless. How are you going to block them? Are you going to hack them? It would basically be suicide. If the world falls apart, the border that make up nations would be meaningless. Ethics would crumble, and only the drive to survive would be left. It is in our instinct to do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scary thoughts made Sunggoo\u2019s body shake a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin continued to speak in a composed manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe entire world would simultaneously fall into anarchy. Do you know what will happen? All the crazy people will crawl out of the woodwork. Rape and pillaging will become the norm. Monsters are scary, but humans are weak. So humans will try to steal from other humans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be people like the ones you describe, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll unite our strength to fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes. There had been humans who acted that way. There were heroes, warriors, holy knights, and Holy Maidens. There were magicians in their towers, kings of the allied kingdoms, knights, soldiers\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be futile. They\u2019ll keep trying to hold out, but they\u2019ll eventually fall. They\u2019ll eventually be broken up. Then people will be tempted to turn their backs on the human race.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of races, who had submitted to Trahnet, and they became slaves. Goblins and Kobolds were all Trahnet\u2019s slaves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS\u2026so what do we do? Someone has to stop this\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was in mid-sentence when he turned to look at Woojin. That someone might be Woojin? If he thought about it, no one had soloed a 6 star Dungeon before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why we are getting ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Earth was Woojin\u2019s home planet. His mother, sister and friends lived here. This was why he was trying to protect this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want me to be careful and care about what other\u2019s think? The negative articles from the press? Requests to appear before the police? It\u2019s all useless. Instead, I have to let everyone know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was he trying to inform everyone?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want them to know how brutal, vicious and tyrannical I am..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care if the world talked about him as he became the focus of their attention. For the most part, Woojin didn\u2019t have a sense of justice or a conscience. The past 20 years was too brutal for those ideals to have survived within him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t care what they world says about me. I\u2019m not trying to be a hero.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A powerful sovereign.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo one ran away in my country of Alandal. Those who fought bravely found sanctuary in Alandal. The ones who ran away was turned into the Undead, and they marched against the enemies.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he saw everyone\u2019s serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the very least, humans didn\u2019t fight each other in Alandal. If they did, the king would assign them to a life-time military service. They all knew the score. They all knew how ruthless, and tyrannical the king was.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo swallowed his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPerhaps\u2026 Does the country called Alandal have something to do with our guild\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. I was the king of Alandal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No wonder he hummed a song even when he killed Bae-dohsooh\u2019s party. (TLN: 2 star Dungeon where he saved Sunggoo)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan, Sunggoo and Haemin shut their mouth tightly. They couldn\u2019t help, but put on a serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan asked carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be informing the world, and ask for help?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPoot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho\u2019s going to give us aid? The people of this world? Should I tell everyone to gather strength and get ready, since the whole earth will become a field for the monsters?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be prudent?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they won\u2019t do anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf they feel a threat, then I\u2019m sure we will all come together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin popped a piece of beef entrail into his mouth, and he started chewing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shit. It was undercooked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spat out the beef entrail on an empty dish, then he cleansed his palate with cider.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe still excavate fossil fuel even when we know it is destroying nature.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn\u2019t this a problem on a different stratosphere with destroying nature. The human race could become instinct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Minchan. Do you think you will be able to stop people from extracting fossil fuel just by saying, \u2018Let\u2019s protect nature?\u2019\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out his hand phone then he place it on top of the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe moment I saw this I gave up on that idea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat does the hand phone have anything to do with\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Crazy Red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a modern device using bloodstones as a new energy source.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat would happen if I immediately tried to stop people from excavating the bloodstones from the Dungeons? They can only clear the Dungeons, and they will have to come out empty handed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If there was no loot from raiding the Dungeon, no one would risk their life to clear the Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if the excavation of bloodstones were halted, the amount of mana on earth will still increase by a minute amount. It will delay the Dungeon Breaks. It will give humans the time to get ready. What do you think? Isn\u2019t it quite logical? Do you think the humans will be able to do so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan lost the words he was about to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wouldn\u2019t stop. There was absolutely no way people would stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon Business was already too closely intertwined with the way of the world. The rulers, and people with wealth would want the resource called bloodstones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The train filled with bombs had already left the station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW\u2026what should we do then?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The words spoken by Woojin seemed perfectly plausible, so even a logical person like Minchan was in a near panic. It felt as if a threat had suddenly crept up on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should we do? We drink soju like this, then we grow in power by clearing Dungeons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How would they be able to drink alcohol after hearing such serious matters? The effects of the alcohol quickly dissipated from the three people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin emptied another shot of soju, then he chewed on a crispy piece of beef entrails.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three of them looked at Woojin with serious expressions on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell? What? What do you expect from me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he asked everyone to protect earth, people wouldn\u2019t listen to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Humans didn\u2019t unite from being in danger. They united for profit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf they die, they die. If they live, they\u2019ll live. Those who will fight will fight..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even a Philosophy Professor wouldn\u2019t be able to talk in such a casual manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is some hope. The bloodstones brings the monsters over, but it also levels up the Roused on earth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time hopeful words had been spoken by Woojin\u2019s mouth. The three people looked on with anticipation in their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The power of the allies and enemies increased simultaneously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fight would vary depending on how those power would be assembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why I am very aggressive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had always wanted to come back to earth, and the situation here was very different from Alphen. This was earth. This was a place Woojin must defend at all cost. He didn\u2019t want to see Trahnet\u2019s underlings traipsing around freely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll probably continue to get into trouble. I\u2019ll never break the rules I established.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His actions was in line with Alandal\u2019s law.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Never show weakness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those who stab him in the back must pay a price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s rules took precedent over following earth\u2019s laws. In a world where law and morality was gone, his rules would restore order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the pandemonium arrives, people would search and gather around a pivotal figure. Woojin was readying himself to become this pivotal figure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll even become a ruthless demon to achieve it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is how it\u2019ll be, so do your best to keep up with me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A special command was given to the support division of Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, unlike before they felt a heavy sense of duty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf they mess with me, then they are fucked. I have to instill this concept.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to instill it into the people of this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had planned for this, and he was already erecting boundary of Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwarang Guild Headquarters President\u2019s Room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Di-ri-reek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hand on the mouse roughly scrolled down using the wheel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho grinded his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He became angrier as he saw more articles on Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.

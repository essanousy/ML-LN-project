Latasha was the first to laugh. \u00a0She saw that Jaemin had also put on a serious expression on his face when he heard her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo hoo. \u00a0So why were you looking for me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0Tauric is gathering all the heroes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Understood.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha accompanied Do-jaemin, and they walked towards the castle built near the World Tree. \u00a0The castle built by the Immortal was too large for only the ten heroes to occupy. \u00a0It felt empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Silver Arrow.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha queried when she saw the heroes gathered in one place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each of the heroes were put in charge of a team, and they were supposed to expand out from the Saurus mountain as base to clear the monsters nearby. \u00a0It was also the reason why this type of gathering hadn't happened in several days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A massive amount of monsters are gathering south at the Nero plateau.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...that's the worst news we've heard in recent days.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Actually, it get worse.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric spread a map on the table. \u00a0It was a map that specifically showed the details between the Saurus mountains and the Nero plateau. \u00a0It was a distance that could be traveled in around two weeks. \u00a0A human kingdom had once occupied that region, but it was currently ruled by a Dimensional lord named Unon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It isn't just Unon's army. \u00a0Shirao, Patu, Leia and Gong Gong are all gathering there.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha's eyes widened at Tauric's words. It looked as if her eyes were about to fall out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My god. \u00a0Are you saying the Dimensional lords are working together?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Unfortunately, that is what is happening.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dimensional lords never cooperated with each other. They weren't like blood enemies that fought constantly, but they did fight over territories. \u00a0This was a reason why the Coalition was able to exist on this planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional lords fought wars with each other, and the people of planet was merely their quarry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they cooperated with each other, it would have taken them 1 year to decimate the entirety of Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So what is behind this unforeseen move?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Coalition was on its last leg, and they were gathering their remaining troops. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Were they that big of a threat? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They should have been beneath the notice of the Dimensional lords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gathering of the Coalition hadn\u2019t even aroused the attention of the Dimensional lord Go-shooshoo, Juliel and their armies. \u00a0In the past, the Coalition had gathered their forces quite often in the past without such a severe response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm not sure. \u00a0If I had to guess, it might be caused by his return.....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Immortal...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one existence that was excessively burdensome to the Dimensional lords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional lords started working with each other when the Immortal suddenly showed up. \u00a0The cause behind their actions was obvious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even a single Dimensional lord was an overwhelming opponent, yet they would have to face 5 Dimensional lords. \u00a0The Coalition's forces were like a candle facing the wind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the existence that could block the wind was with Melody right now as they headed towards Aria's Temple. \u00a0They were in deep enemy territory beyond the Nero plateau. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If the Immortal isn't here, it will be too hard to protect this fortress. \u00a0We have to find a new hideout.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When king of Honshoo Kontz spoke up, the Archmage Graham agreed with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. \u00a0In the first place, the Saurus mountain was the worst place we could have chosen to defend an enemy's attack. \u00a0There\u2019s the risk that our enemies might isolate us. \u00a0We have to move our base first.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No way. \u00a0How could you throw away a Colony so easily?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Colony wasn\u2019t merely a place where they could purchase Items using Bloodstones. \u00a0For the people, who came over from earth, it was the location of the gate. \u00a0The gate would allow them to go back to their home world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Fire Spirit King is correct. \u00a0Also, I won't leave behind the World Tree.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm the the Fire Spirit King....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo mumbled at Latasha's words. \u00a0Graham tried to convince her with great care.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh, Elf Lord. \u00a0I believe it is a stretch to call it the World Tree.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. \u00a0It is the World Tree.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha ignored Sunggoo's words, and her answer was full of conviction as she spoke to Graham.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current Elf Lord said it was the World Tree, so how could a human magician say otherwise? \u00a0However, it wasn't a wise decision to stay here. \u00a0They would be slaughtered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What can we do? \u00a0Unon is a high rank great general. \u00a0He occupies the 36th throne.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...he built this city, so he'll protect it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hurt her pride to rely on the Immortal, but she spoke those words quietly. \u00a0Jaemin, who had been quietly listening from the side, stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can contact him.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh oh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin had been appointed to be the tactician of Alandal. \u00a0He could trade thoughts with the Dimensional lord Kahng-woojin. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He\u2019ll be able to come here immediately using the Return Portal if we are in a dire situation.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is good news.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gloomy atmosphere immediately improved. \u00a0The Immortal was only one person, but his existence was enough to wipe away the worry of losing the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone firmly believed the Immortal wouldn't have problem with these foes. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please inform him of our plight.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Graham's insistence, Do-jaemin quickly tried to contact Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Woojin hyung.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone looked at him with eyes full of hope. \u00a0Jaemin kept calling for Woojin, but there was no response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin nervously licked his lips when the anticipation turned into doubt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Will it not work if he is in a different Dimension?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was appointed to be the tactician, but he wasn't fully aware of the power and the communication capability possessed by a Dimensional lord. \u00a0Jaemin scratched his head as he spoke. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think he is clearing a Dungeon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm. \u00a0You can\u2019t contact him if he is in a Dungeon?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess so.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if they didn't believe him, the atmosphere was turning a bit weird when they heard his answer. \u00a0Tauric stepped forward to clear up the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Immortal and the Holy Maiden wasn\u2019t here, the First Monk of Skia became the psychological pillar for the people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know we've had some complaints initially about setting up here, but in the end, we agreed to it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We settled here, because it was the ideal place for a counteroffensive campaign. \u00a0We cannot run away at the first sign of the enemies gathering.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The great Orc Chieftain Kruegar had been quiet, since Latasha had spoken, and now he raised a closed fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Koo-roo. \u00a0I don't want to die while running away. \u00a0We shouldn't be fighting for our survival. \u00a0We have to fight for victory.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had always pushed and delayed their plans into the future. \u00a0How many comrades were left behind as they ran away? \u00a0Maybe the time they had been waiting for was at hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Alandal and the Coalition are allies. \u00a0If we can't defend a Colony from being taken over before he returns, there is no point to this alliance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dwarf King Raul stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let us fight! \u00a0If we build a fortress as we accelerate our pace in gathering our forces, there is no reason why we won't be able to defend this place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When everyone's opinions came into alignment, Tauric let out a declaration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's get ready to defend the Colony.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-oh-oh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There would be no retreat any more. \u00a0Since they had gained a sword they could use to counter attack, they couldn't let go of it even if it was heavy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They just have to wait until a sharp and dangerous sword named the Immortal came back to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The earth was so poor and sticky that it made one wonder if it was really dirt underneath their feet. \u00a0It gave off an unpleasant feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The large trees were rotten, and an unknown fungus covered the branches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a musky foul smell. \u00a0The air was poisonous, and there were no living creatures inside the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grumbled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why did noonim build a temple here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody was protected by a blessing she asked from her goddess. \u00a0She answered Woojin's complaint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The goddess did not shy away from penance. \u00a0She chose to be in this harsh environment....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin cut off Melody's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stop making shit up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...I'm not making it up. \u00a0It was passed down...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0Whatever. \u00a0There\u2019s a saying that says idle words can become law.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was full of counter-arguments she wanted to say, but Melody tried hard to hold back her words. \u00a0If it wasn't for Woojin, she wouldn't have be able to traverse through the enemy territories. \u00a0She wouldn't have been able to reach this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would have taken her two months to walk here. \u00a0They had taken down every Dungeon and Colony on their way here, yet it took them only a month.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they had just rode on the Phantom Steed through the whole journey, it would have halved the time further.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I never heard about such a bizarre place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook his head from side to side as he looked at his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Reeds, which was as thick as a person\u2019s thigh, had grown high into the air before they died. \u00a0There were only stumps left, and there seemed to be fossilized remains covering the floor. \u00a0It was creepy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could see a corpse of a Wyvern-sized dragonfly, skeleton of an eight-limbed bear, and dead trees. \u00a0They were all very large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a town was changed into giants and mutants, it would look like this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sniff. I don't think this is petroleum. \u00a0What is this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black and sticky liquid covered the floor, and it somehow felt out of place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are almost there. \u00a0It should be over there.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was being guided by her goddess as she walked the maze-like forest road. \u00a0In the end, they arrived at their destination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They went past the unpleasant forest and the ground boiling with the black liquid. \u00a0Afterwards, a large crater greeted them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if a meteor had fallen to make this deep crater. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the middle of the crater, one could see a small building covered in black moss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, it looked like a pointy rock, but the sight was strangely incongruous with its surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What the hell is that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is goddess Aria's temple.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You know I'm not asking about that.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin went to the edge of the crater, and he slowly descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pshhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground crumbled every time Woojin brought a foot down. \u00a0The ground was unstable as jagged stones kept catching on his feet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are these bones?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought they were jagged stones, but they were bones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know if they were from animals or people. \u00a0Several thousand...tens of thousand unidentifiable bones made up the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin silently walked forward. \u00a0Melody was following behind him, and her face had also turned serious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Have you been here before?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is my first time.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She would have needed to come here to become the official Holy Maiden, but this was Melody's first visit. \u00a0She was here to receive her Holy Item. \u00a0It would signify that Melody was the closest servant of Aria.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goddess of Prophecy Aria.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody had called it a temple, so he had thought....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Melody went to the heart of the deep and large crater. \u00a0They stood in front of a black building that looked like a pillar curved like a horn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Doesn't it look unbalanced?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't even have the words to answer Woojin's question. \u00a0She also hadn't heard anything about Aria's Temple. \u00a0She felt a tug from the goddess' revelation, and she only knew how to get to this place through instinct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zz-zz-jook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black moss started to rip away. \u00a0A rectangular outline could be seen as the door shifted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-shoo-shoong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The moss fell to the floor as the door opened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was silent as he saw what was across the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh goddess.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the door opened, a large amount of the goddess' energy flowed out into Melody. \u00a0Melody fell to her knees as she prostrated on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At her reaction, Woojin\u2019s sense of incongruity, which had bothered him, reached its </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It\u2019s a spaceship.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no other explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to know the reason behind all of this, he\u2019ll have to face this head on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took his first step across the door.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

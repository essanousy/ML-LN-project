She was able to see the world for the first time when she made a contract with her master, Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her master was strong, and his other familiars were also amazing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal\u2019s power soared high into the sky, and Trahnet\u2019s minions were no match for them. There were also a lot of followers who came looking for the Immortal\u2019s land.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, her master had learned of a way to contact the Dimensional Guardian, and everything ended after that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She waited for a long time in the Sealed Room where there was only darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was the first one to hear Woojin\u2019s voice again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t Alphen. It was earth, but she didn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wherever Woojin went, that was the place where Bibi wanted to be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was her master\u2019s new roosting place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She lived with the great female human, who had given birth to her master, and master\u2019s younger sister.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her master had left after putting her in the care of a young female human named Kahng-sooah. She had always been with her master, since she had to chase away the evil spirits that tormented her master every night. However, she wasn\u2019t able to follow him on his hunt anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If her master hunted with her than her level would rise. She\u2019ll be able to regain the power she had lost, but she was given a more important mission by her master.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had to protect this little human called Sooah\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This little human never left her alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been one day since her master had left her behind as he headed for the hunting ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCatch it, Bibi!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The little human called Sooah used a laser to move the point around in front of her eyes. Ah, what an annoying human.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPeeee. What is this? What kind of a cat is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The little human sighed from disappointment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi couldn\u2019t believe she had to participate in such a petty game\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She sauntered up to her feet, then she chased the point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPoo-haha. Try catching it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The laser point was quickly moved away from her, and it aggravated her. She quickly chased after it once again, but the laser point moved a distance away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahhhhhhng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The little human dared to irritate a being with succubus\u2019 blood flowing inside her veins?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That damn red dot. I\u2019ll catch it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She quickly chased after the laser point, but it was impossible to catch it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyah nyah nyah..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her butt wiggled in excitement as she ran, and she didn\u2019t see the leg of the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Are you okay, Bibi? \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The surprised Sooah approached her, but Bibi swiveled her head away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Chet. I can\u2019t believe I became absorbed in this game.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had been fool by this little human\u2019s tricks\u2026. It wasn\u2019t as if she had been enjoying herself. She played with her, since she had to act like a cat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She jumped on top of the sofa. After she got in position, she squatted on her haunches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBibi. Should unni give you a can?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahhng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The can of cat food was quite delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She hurriedly jumped down to rub her body against the little humans leg. The little human let out a trill of laughter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hah. Please come back quickly, master-ahong.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wanted to be with her master and Dolsae-jjing. Moreover, she wanted to hunt with her other friends.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seoul National University station\u2019s 6th exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a 5 star Dungeon, and it was the main source of income for Guild Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a map crawling with the Naga. The guide made by Kahng-woojin was shoddy, and the map was too large. It was also quite difficult, so the appointment schedule wasn\u2019t packed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin made appointments for all the empty spots in the schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he saw Sunggoo answer with a grim expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin used his Warrior\u2019s Senses, and he saw Sunggoo\u2019s level was 37. If he breaks through to level 40 then he\u2019ll be a 4th Circle magician. He\u2019ll be a Rank C.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Minchan was in the Hammer guild, he had forged Sunggoo\u2019s rank to be Rank D. Currently, he was Rank D, but he will surpass that rank soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had made an appointment for 12 hours. This meant 2 days would pass inside the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In two days\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are able to come back alive, you will be a Rank C.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could feel power within Sunggoo\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Woojin said he\u2019ll make a block of fermented soybean from adzuki beans then he would believe it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They headed into the Dungeon with Sunggoo in the front.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been over 4 hours since they had entered the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo fell over from a lack of breath. As he lay on the floor, his vision started to dim into darkness when some unknown energy entered him. His vision suddenly started to become brighter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time Sunggoo was about to die, Woojin used the Soul Extraction to recover his energy. Woojin raised him back up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is still impossible for me to solo this Dungeon. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it even if this was a 4 star Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, hyung-nim. Rank C Roused don\u2019t normally solo a 4 star Dungeon. Moreover, the Naga\u2019s Desert Temple was a 5 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook at them closely. You have to learn all the monster\u2019s special characteristics, and weaknesses. If you are short on strength, then come up with a good plan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even after Sunggoo overcame a deadly situation, he wasn\u2019t given a break. It felt like each word spoken by Woojin was engraved into Sunggoo\u2019s blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlmost everything that shows up here is poisonous. This is the only meat we\u2019ll be able to eat.\u201d\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had cut open a horrifyingly ugly Worm to get the Worm\u2019s meat, and he was cooking it over the fire. Also, they didn\u2019t need to gather wood for the fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They used the flame magic to quickly cook the meat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It tasted bland.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was dry and a little bit bitter. It was like chewing dried fish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They ate this food for survival not because it was delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t teach Sunggoo only about fighting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He taught Sunggoo how to survive. He was instructed on how to win when meeting certain monsters. If he couldn\u2019t face an enemy head on, then he was told to hide and wait for an opportunity to attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was teaching all the battle and hunting techniques he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrom here on out, the only troublesome opponents are the Naga. Don\u2019t be feeble minded, and don\u2019t be afraid. It is possible for you to defeat any monster in here..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Woojin said so, then it was so. Sunggoo recovered his vigor, and his fighting spirit burned once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, you could probably fight a one on one battle. If there are 2 of them, then you will most definitely be killed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Why do you keep giving me that constipated expression? I\u2019ll set it up, so you\u2019ll only have to face them 1 on 1.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin and Sunggoo arrived at the Naga\u2019s abandoned city of Ragrecia, the battle started in earnest. The Naga were scattered around the city, and they didn\u2019t gather in one place unless they were provoked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, the city was entangled like a maze. Woojin placed Bone Walls at every strategic point. He mad is so that Sunggoo would be able to focus on a 1 on 1 battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If two Naga showed up, then Woojin would kill one. He left the other one alone, so Sunggoo could defeat it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Naga Warriors were valiant and strong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Naga Warriors wouldn\u2019t ignore a weakness or a momentary lack of focus. Sunggoo was still very inexperienced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-ooh, pook!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh-ook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Empty air escaped Sunggoo when he saw his stomach be pierced by a spear. His thoughts turned yellow from the fear of death, and he could only think about the pain he was feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Naga Warrior put on the smile of a victor when it happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeek. Kwang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgweeeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Naga\u2019s head was crushed by a hammer swung by Woojin. Woojin indifferently looked at Sunggoo, who had a spear penetrating his belly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would a bastard, who will die soon, call out for me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s eyelids fluttered. His hands grabbed the spear piercing his stomach, but he was slowly losing his strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if a hole was made inside your stomach, you should have done everything to at least cut off your opponent\u2019s head. Did you already forget about the new technique you learned?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize to me. You are the one who is going to lose your life, so why would you apologize to me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one suffered an attack, then one had to do everything to counter-attack. If one dumbly stood still, it was basically waiting for the opponent finish the job. It was the action of a loser.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had his chance. He had hesitated for a moment, and he had been swept up by his fear. He had blown his opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want to live, then take out the spear yourself..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo looked at the spear penetrating his stomach. Woojin wanted him to take this out himself?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he ignored the fact that it will hurt, his intestines would spill out\u2026 Since he could endure the pain, it would be better if hyung-nim could do it\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you die, I\u2019ll give your soul as a snack to ShingShing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo grabbed the spear, and he put his strength into it. He was too scared to die like this. It was funny. Every time he thought about dying, he felt fear, but it also gave him an equal amount of courage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-uh-uhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time the spear moved a little bit, it felt as if his vertebrae was being twisted. He was subjected to an extreme amount of pain. Is this how having a hole in one\u2019s insides felt? The inside of his head turned white, and it made him wonder if his stomach had somehow disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgooh-ahhhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His knees automatically bent. The spear blade broke free, and he saw his insides fall out. He didn\u2019t know if it was his small intestines or large intestines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He supported his intestines with one hand, and he pulled out the spear with the other hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ahhk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the blade of the spear was pulled out, blood started to pour out from the wound. He tried to block it his hands, but it was of no use. The spear point had also exited the back, so blood was flowing out from both sides. He felt the blood flow down the small of his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His consciousness was quickly fading, and across his heavy eyelids, he saw Woojin grinning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin extracted a soul from the Naga, who died from a crushed head. Then it was absorbed into Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spinning world came to a halt, and his wounds started to quickly heal. It seemed one soul would be insufficient, so Woojin took two more souls from his Spirit Armor. Then he absorbed the two souls into Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t that hurt like hell?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Isn\u2019t that obvious?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want to live, then you have to become mean and tenacious..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew it. This was why he had become much more mean and tenacious. It was just that he still fell short.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happens if I suddenly disappear? What are you going to do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If hyung-nim disappeared, then Sunggoo wouldn\u2019t be able to come inside this Dungeon. He would have to make the rounds in the low rank Dungeons, and he would have to live out his life as a bloodstone miner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as if he had read Sunggoo\u2019s mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long do you think the monsters will stay inside the Dungeon??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin kept asking him questions even when he was in agony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry imaging it. What would happen if all the subway stations on earth had a Dungeon Break at the same time? Wouldn\u2019t that be quite the sight? Right??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was an absurd and preposterous story.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHunting? Bloodstones? I bet it wouldn\u2019t be easy to find food even for immediate consumption? The 6 billion global population? I\u2019ll guarantee it\u2019ll take less than 3 days to reduce half of the population.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo listened to the scary story. Woojin told it to Sunggoo as if he was calmly reading from a fairy tale book. This was the first time Sunggoo felt as if he didn\u2019t know who Woojin was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyun-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m satisfied with just protecting my family. Even if that bastard Trahnet invades this place, it would take time to eat the entire earth..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had lasted for 20 years time on Alphen. He knew he could do the same on earth. The era of peace right now would be like a dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t it make you mad? Someone\u2019s claiming your front-yard without your permission?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want to protect your family, then don\u2019t be so soft.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? Why did he suddenly feel this sense of crisis?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf those bastards invade us, I won\u2019t be able to protect you from the back. You will have to survive on your own.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s words held the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the war begins, there will be no one behind Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would stand in the front lines of the war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Sunggoo wanted to follow Woojin\u2019s back without dying then he had to become much stronger by a large margin. Moreover, he had to do it quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only person who could make this come true was Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After starting the Dungeon at 7 AM, they came out at 7 PM.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was utterly worn out, and Woojin had a smile like always. They headed towards the office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. You are here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woo-soonghoon\u2019s loud voice rang out, everyone got up from there seats. It seemed a good number of the empty desks had found owners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026how do you do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The new employees started giving their greetings. There were a mixture of experienced workers, and new workers. Jung-minchan probably chose good employees, and he\u2019ll probably keep them in line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were couple bastards with odorous souls, but\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you ready it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After hearing Woojin\u2019s words, Soonghoon confidently led Woojin to the lounge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a place where the employees could take a break. There were glass desks off to one side of the room, and the latest computer rig with large monitors was placed there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be exact, there were 5 computers decked out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt a special game room made for president. I investigated the new hires, and there are 2 Diamond players. There is even one platinum\u2026 Hehe. You won\u2019t have to worry about your team rank. We just have to be bused around.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon was a Silver 2, so he spoke with confidence. Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou do a lot of unnecessary things. Did you prepare the other thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon guessed he wasn\u2019t talking about this? Woo-soonghoon was momentarily taken aback, but he remembered the passing word spoken to him in the morning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Do you mean the dog?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve prepared it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon brought a steel cage forward from the corner of the room. The dog was about the size of his thigh, and at a glance, one could tell it was a puppy of a large breed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is a mastiff. His father performed very well in the dog fighting ring. I had a very difficult time getting him. His mother was also quite well built, so he\u2019ll probably grow up to be around 80kg. If he\u2019ll be president\u2019s pet, shouldn\u2019t the dog be of this caliber/\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ha-ah. Why does this bastard always over-do things?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to give it to my little sister. Are you sure this dog is suitable for a 7 years old.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon\u2019s eyes quickly shook. However, his 8 years experience as a salesman wasn\u2019t all for naught.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen the mastiff is the right choice. These brutes were used in warfare in the past. He\u2019ll grow up to be a very large dog. He\u2019ll become a reliable bodyguard for you little sister. When president is absent, he will loyally protect the house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026his explanation was oddly convincing?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stroked his chin.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

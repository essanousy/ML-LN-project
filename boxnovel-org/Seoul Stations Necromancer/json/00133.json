This was how it should be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I'm a monster now, Soolgi. \u00a0I'll cheer for you from afar.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin looked on with sentimental eyes, and he saw the Hot Girls leave the stage after their performance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had seen Soolgi, and he didn't want to watch the other singers take stage. He exited the station. \u00a0No, he tried to leave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what the hell?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koooo-ohhhhhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The roads were teeming with Monsters. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it a Dungeon Break?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had spent a good amount of time inside Woojin's Dimensional Domain of Alandal. \u00a0He wasn't surprised by the appearance of monsters, but he would have a hard time fighting them. \u00a0Jaemin's combat ability wasn't that exceptional.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to run away quickly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggiii-ohhhhhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He turned his head to looked at the source of the roar. \u00a0He saw monsters flying over the broadcasting station's roof. \u00a0Moreover, several of them dived in through the windows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cS...Soolgi!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was worried about Soolgi, so he once again ran back into the broadcasting station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. \u00a0Look who it is!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha. \u00a0It's good to see you. \u00a0How long has it been?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the start of the reunion party. \u00a0To some people, this was a walk down memory lane. \u00a0To others, this was an event to network with the alumnis. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had spent a good amount of money to rent the hotel's entire reception hall, and there were about 200 people in attendance. \u00a0It was an enormous reunion party where 90% of the graduates were in attendance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were all busy in real life, since they were newcomers to society. Still, they had shown up, because they wanted to see the famous Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as people greeted each other with a cheerful expression, they kept looking around for Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Jiwon. \u00a0Woojin couldn't make it here today?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I'm afraid not.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon answered chairman Nahm-jihyuhk's question. At that moment, Cindy came over to ask her question. \u00a0She still had her sunglasses on. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy couldn't he be here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe's busy.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. \u00a0Is that so?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin hadn't attended this event, so was there a need for her to stay here? \u00a0Cindy was about to walk out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I unnecessarily changed my schedule to come here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had intentionally left her schedule blank, so she could attend the reunion party. Currently, her popularity was on a full upswing, so every minute and second was money for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Cindy. Weren't you pretty insistent on making an appearance this time? \u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I haven't been to one of these meetings in a while.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy fixed her sunglasses with her hand as she listened to chairman Nahm-jihyuhk's flattery.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been nice seeing you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh?

That's too bad.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nahm-jihyuhk's inner heart trembled as he tried hard to hide his emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a twenty four year old young man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were classmates once, but he had only see her through the television for the past 5 years. \u00a0He couldn't help but be fascinated and terrified at facing a celebrity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHave fun.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. \u00a0I'll see you out.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy didn't turn down the offer as she left the reception hall. Nahm-jihyuhn followed behind her to escort her out. \u00a0Do-jiwon was left alone by herself, and she felt something was lacking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt would have been great if Woojin had come.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon knew how hard a life Woojin had lived through.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wanted him to spark his old memories by meeting his friends from the time he attended school. \u00a0Would he feel great delight if he could revive a little bit of his old memories? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was busily clearing a Dungeon at that moment. \u00a0She felt thankful and sorry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon's eyes turned round when she looked at the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A pale and frightened Cindy was running towards her with Jihyuhk. \u00a0It was as if they were being chased by something. \u00a0Soon a cluster of Spiders appeared, and Jiwon let out a scream. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhhhk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several hundred spiders crawling in, and the sight was quite unpleasant. \u00a0They were the size of a human's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYo-ho-ho. There are a lot of humans gathered here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spider-woman, Sharot, appeared as she hummed a tune.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She smiled when she saw the frightened antics of the humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Doo-roo-roo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The vehicles slid on its track as the tanks raced across the road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kieeeeeehk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bat-like monsters were occupying the sky as they let out a frightening sound. \u00a0The helicopters were useless against them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were able to freely maneuver between buildings as they concealed themselves. \u00a0It was very hard to decrease their numbers as the ground troops used anti-aircraft weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was that the bat-like monsters weren't the only monsters present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-ohhhhhh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying the roar, a large bear monster charged towards a tank. \u00a0The tanks fired its main gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the aftermath of the missed rounds, the explosion caused the road to be overturned and a building's wall to collapse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The large bear emerged from the plume of dust. \u00a0It's shoulder and arm had been blown off. \u00a0It was in a ghastly state, but it was still alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-uh-uhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bear, which was the size of a 2 story building, swung its paw, and it made the main gun bend as easily as a toothpick. \u00a0The bear swung its paw again, and the tank was flipped over. \u00a0The tank's track continued to spin with no traction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwahng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The second concentrated fire caused the bear's head to explode, and it fell to the floor. \u00a0They were barely able to kill it. \u00a0The problem was the fact that there were more than one or two monsters in the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit! What kind of mess is this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Hahn-sahngpil, who was in charge of the armored unit, cursed as he expressed his frustration.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been minimal damage from previous Breaks, since they've made preparations beforehand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they were given a warning about an imminent Break, they would be able to evacuate the surrounding civilians, then they would just have to lay down a concentrated fire on the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they hadn\u2019t been given a warning, and they hadn't been able to evacuate the civilians. \u00a0It was hard to attack properly. This was the biggest reason why the military units stationed at various parts of Seoul was making slow progress in their suppression of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck! What the hell are the guilds doing?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was impossible to eradicate all the monsters using just the fire support from the military units. \u00a0There were numerous people waiting for rescue within the buildings. \u00a0Moreover, the Roused was needed to defeat monsters where the guns and cannons couldn't reach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the Breaks in Daegoo, Gwahngjoo, Busan, Seoul and other places in Korea... \u00a0No, the Dungeons of the world was Breaking at the same time, and they were in short supply of troops. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Any Rank E and below Roused was useless compared to a soldier equipped with a gun. \u00a0At the very least, one had to be Rank D. \u00a0However, the number of Dungeons Breaking made this a moot point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since they didn't have the numeric superiority, one would have to use overwhelming firepower. \u00a0Of course, this made one think about a certain high rank Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were some countries, who were mulling the use of nuclear weapons, so the presence of this man was that much more crucial.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he still not here yet?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The roads and buildings were occupied with monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The alien nature of this event reminded him of the Dungeon Shock from 5 years ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The world was about to experience that hell once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC...Captain! Look over there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His aide desperately yelled out. Hahn-sahngpil grabbed the binoculars that had been around his neck. \u00a0He swallowed his response as he looked towards the pointed direction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmmm.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous Dragon was sitting on top of the Namsan Tower as it had its claws dug in. It sat there as if it was looking over Seoul. \u00a0It was like seeing a scene from a movie.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT...this is the first time I've seen such a big monster.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a first experience for Hahn-sahngpil too. \u00a0Soon, two fighter jets approached it, and they fired missiles towards the unknown monster atop the Namsan Tower.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosion was so large that the far away armored unit felt the aftereffects. \u00a0However, the Dragon wasn't hurt at all. \u00a0The monster had engaged a barrier that was as big as its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How great would it have been if this was a movie?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A monster that might cause a calamity in Seoul had appeared.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

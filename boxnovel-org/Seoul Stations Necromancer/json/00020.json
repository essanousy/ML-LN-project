Please turn of the adblockers if you are able to.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-songgoo let out a sigh after he ended the phone call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe 4 bills was actually $400,000.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It\u2019s no wonder why since he thought $20,000 was a bit cheap for saving someone\u2019s life. He really had been underestimating the price of his life too much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven someone like me is worth $200,000.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been saved twice, so it was 4 bills. It was $400,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, this isn\u2019t how I should be spending my time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo let out a sigh. It had been only 2 months since he had become a Roused. He had worked tirelessly during that time, but he had been only earned around $30,000. Even that wasn\u2019t enough, so he had to to borrow money from all around. How was he suddenly going to come up with a large sum of $360,000?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess this is the only way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had prepared this just in case. Sunggoo gathered a bundle of documents then he went outside to catch a taxi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he arrived near the Sadahng station, he hurriedly entered a large cafe named Angel Angel. He looked around, and he was able to find Woojin sitting near a corner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-him. How are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them had left the dungeon, and they had went their own ways around lunch. This occurred only couple hours ago, so why was he was asking how he was doing?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou came? So, why did you insist on coming here yourself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt was the right thing for me to do to come here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s all right. Just leave after you give me your account number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh-ook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s face turned pale from fright. Is he trying to return his money to him? Doesn\u2019t that mean he didn\u2019t need his money, and Woojin wanted to kill him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo thought about how Woojin looked as he killed Bae-dohsoo and his party members without any hesitation. It happened only couple hours ago, so he was still shocked by that event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo immediately got on his knees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Please spare my life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Why are you being like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI promise I\u2019ll pay back all the money I am short on. Just give me a little bit more time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s reaction drew the attention from the people in the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on? Is he a gangster?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt looks like he took out a private loan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk tsk. He must have took out a private loan then he must have used it all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned when he heard the murmurs coming from the surround people. What was he trying to accomplish by gaining the attention of his surrounding? Woojin\u2019s voice was filled with irritation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t want die, then why don\u2019t you have a seat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo immediately sat across Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I have no way of gathering $400,000 right now. If you give me some time, I promise I\u2019ll come through.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c$400,000?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin leaned back against his chair as he sighed. His fingers rhythmically beat against the armrests.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddok, ddok.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo swallowed dryly to the beat. Woojin frowned at Sunggoo, who sat there like a dog wanting to poop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had wanted $4,000, so he asked Sunggoo to send 4 bills. However, he must have misunderstood it as $40,000. If that wasn\u2019t enough, he had further misunderstood, and now he he was under the impression that he owed Woojin $400,000 now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Kids these days think in large scales.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could someone misunderstand 1 bill as $10,000 or $100,000?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he had thoroughly misunderstood his situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was under a misunderstanding, then of course he would\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long do you want me to wait for you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026have to take advantage of the misunderstanding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo spoke rapidly. He spoke so fast that one would think he had a talent for talking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease look here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s forehead furrowed when he picked up the paper documents pushed forward by Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Improvement of the Roused Ability and the Corresponding Income Report.&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his ability manifested, Sunggoo had recorded how much he had earned on the first day he became a Roused. As he became familiar with his ability, his ability slowly evolved, and his income had increased steadily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He even made a graph to accompany the numbers. At the bottom, he even wrote down the Dungeons he had attempted, and there was a detailed count on how many monsters he had face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was basically Sunggoo\u2019s own portfolio.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI earned $30,000 during the two months. From here on out, my income will continue to increase, and I will be able to obtain the rest of the money soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guarantee I will have it within 25 months.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t that too long?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s pessimistic words, Sunggoo replied quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When did he become so deft at wheeling-and-dealing? It felt like he had awoken to another taken when facing with a situation where his life was on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why I thought of a second method.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Dungeon Attack Business Plan.&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned as he threw the documents on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just talk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo immediately flapped his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWith hyung-nim\u2019s abilities, you will be able to attack a higher dungeon than the 1 star and 2 star dungeons. Moreover, you will be able to earn much more revenue per Dungeon Attack. If you form a party with me, I\u2019ll point out the highly profitable Dungeons, and I\u2019ll be able to repay the $400,000 in no time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From what Sunggoo observed, Woojin was most definitely not a Rank F on his Roused Rankings. He was capable of soloing a 2 star Dungeon, so how could he be a Rank F?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, the profit from the higher ranked Dungeons were fundamentally on a different level. One could earn $400,000 in no time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For Sunggoo, this would be the best method for him. He wouldn\u2019t dare attempt a high rank Dungeon by himself, but it was possible with Woojin by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just had one problem he had to resolve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes that mean you want to comfortably mooch off of me?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. This is why I thought up a third plan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo started laying out his third plan as if nothing had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDuring that period, I will work as hyung-nim\u2019s manager.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cManager?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. All Roused with a slightly higher rank travels with one. There is even a separate supporting department for them at the Guilds. The manager takes care of duties like selecting the Dungeons, making reservations, selling the bloodstones and more. The manager even drives the Roused around.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo they are basically servants.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Huh? He is speaking the truth, but why do I have such an unpleasant feeling?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour analysis is correct, hyung-nim..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had an amused expression when he heard Sunggoo\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Managers basically did the same work as a celebrity\u2019s manger. It wasn\u2019t a bad proposal for Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince you don\u2019t have the money, you want to work it off with your body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, he was correct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are spot on, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought for a moment before he opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. For how long?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim should decide.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne year. I would feel a little bit bad if you worked for free, so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of money on the side.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo abruptly stood up from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you. Thank you very much. Hyung-him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-ooh. No, I\u2019m the one who should be thanking you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could have just taken back the $36,000 yet he wanted to live the life of a servant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin woke up with a burning thirst in his throat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked around his surrounding with a dizzy head. He was on his bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bits of his memories started to piece itself together, and his memories slowly came back to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had waited a long time for Woojin, who had gone out to buy more alcohol. He started taking sips from his soju cup, and he had fallen asleep on the table\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So, why was he in his bed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He still had his shirt on. Jaemin hurriedly peeked underneath his blanket. He still had his pants on. He unnecessarily started touching his butt, but he didn\u2019t feel any pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thank you. Our Father, who art in heaven\u2026. Ah\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his nervousness melted away, he tried to get up since he had to pee. This was when he saw Woojin lying on top of a blanket placed on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw two bottles of soju on the desk, so it seemed he had fallen asleep after drinking by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess he really is a kind hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin felt relieved. As he was about to head towards the restroom, Woojin let out a moan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had curled up, and his body was shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs\u2026is he sick?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin stretched out his hand to touch the curled up Woojin. Before his hand could make contact, he felt a stinging shock on his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAht. That stings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was so surprised that he sat back down on his bed. Maybe it was the shock, but he started seeing a hallucination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gray objects were wrapped around Woojin, and they were slowly swimming around him. Some were black, but none of them had a defined form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin\u2019s eyes were out of focus, and he could only look on dumbly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ghost? A sprite? Or a hallucination?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt a thick hatred and resentment towards life. No, it was the source of evil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instinctual fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin\u2019s dilated eyes flipped into his head, and he fainted on to his bed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a moan, and his body was drenched in cold sweat. His face was screwed up as if he was in pain. It looked as if he was possessed by an evil spirit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He who oppose the laws of nature. He who denies death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eventually, he who become tormented by death\u2019s curse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin continued to moan.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

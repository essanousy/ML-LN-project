Thanks~)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung. Didn\u2019t you meet your mother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. My house is too small. I\u2019ll inconvenience you until I buy a house..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though the price of land in Seoul had dropped, it was still an unthinkable amount of money for a normal person like Jaemin. He is asking to live here, and mooch off of him until he could by a house?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin had a complicated expression. Woojin cackled as he looked at Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt won\u2019t take long for me to leave, so don\u2019t worry about it. Hyung made 1300 today. Moreover, I\u2019ll get an additional 400 soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat..that isn\u2019t it. My noonah comes here on the weekends.\u201d (TLN: male-&gt;older sister = noonah female-&gt;older sister = unni)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll call her tomorrow. Oh yea. Does hyung know my noonah? My noonah recognized hyung\u2019s name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? What\u2019s your noonah\u2019s name?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHer name is Do-jiwon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought about the name, Do-jiwon, and his eyes became wide when it came to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo-jiwon? The third class\u2019 Jun-jihyun?\u201d (TLN: google ??? if you want to know who she resembles)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. She\u2019s my sister, so it\u2019s a little bit weird to talk about her like this. However, she used to be call that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. You are Jiwon\u2019s little brother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked over Do-jaemin, and he nodded his head. He thought this guy looked handsome, and now he found out Do-jiwon was his noonah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They must have been born with superior genes as both siblings had good looks. It had been twenty years, but Woojin still remembered Do-jiwon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She used to be famous for being the prettiest in the entire school. Woojin had also had a crush on Jiwon, but he had been too shy\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he met her right now, he would have\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere does your noonah live for her only visit on the weekends?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe\u2019s at a factory.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? A factory? Do-jiwon is? If she needed money then she should have become a celebrity instead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin couldn\u2019t imagine Jiwon in a factory setting, so he turned his head in confusion. Jaemin replied with a slightly dark face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere\u2026there was an incident. Anyways, hyung switched your handphone?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. I swapped it on the way back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. This is a really expensive one. Can I touch it once?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so? Is it a good one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul. This is a Crazy Red.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCrazy Red?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt uses Blood stone technology, so it is really expensive. Hyung must have made a lot of money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood stones was a new material with an enormous amount of energy within it. After the end of a 5 year research, the technology was adopted for use, and it was slowly being used in actual objects now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battery technology using the Blood stones were a hot issue in the IT market.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe exchanged it for free.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? This was free?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it was an event. An event.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a once in a life time even where the salesman\u2019s life was on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul. You are lucky. This is really expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the phone salesman had a conscience. Woojin let go of the little ball of grudge he held against him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was more excited than the owner of the phone. He spent a while explaining to him about the new functions when a message came.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddrring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin looked at the line on top of the screen, and his eyes widened when he read the content.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;xxBank&gt;</p><br/><p></p><ol start=\"2015\"><br/><p></p><li><span style=\"\"> 9. 13. 21:13</span></li><br/><p></p></ol><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deposit 40,000</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Total 51,230</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">xxBank Hong Sunggoo</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. How many 0s are there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin looked at the figure then he looked at Woojin. It said he was a Rank F on his Roused card yet he was able to earn $13,000 in one day and now he earned an additional $40,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin couldn\u2019t help but look at Woojin in a different light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHy\u2026hyung. You are very capable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin snatched his handphone back, and he frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat bastard. I told his to send 4 bills.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin immediately gave him a call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The amount is getting on my nerve. It is getting on my nerve.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the single ring could pass, Sunggo picked up his phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[He\u2026hello? Hyung. Did you check the deposit?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, ass-hole. Do you think I\u2019m a beggar? Didn\u2019t I tell you to send just 4 bills? What is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Of course. When you said 4 bills, you meant that 4 bills.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he had put his hand over the receiver, the sound was muffled. However, Woojin had a sensitive hearing, so he frowned when he heard it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hy\u2026hyung-nim. I want to talk to you face to face. Please tell me your address.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Why do you want to find me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ll explain it once I get there. Where are you, hyung-nim?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s voice sounded desperate, so Woojin gave him the address in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[There is a large cafe called Angle Angel near there. I\u2019ll be there in 10 minutes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo hurriedly ended the call. At Sunggoo\u2019s reaction, Woojin stared at his handphone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat bastard. What\u2019s up with him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Sunggoo had just told him his account number, he would have returned the $36,000, so why does he want to meet up?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince we are out of alcohol, I\u2019ll briefly head out to buy some. Meanwhile, you eat the chicken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChange the front door\u2019s password to the original one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin decided he would buy more of the depleted soju, then he would meet Sunggoo and give him back his money. Jaemin was left alone, and he took another sip of the soju. He frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKkkkk. Why do people drink this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He popped open a cola then he washed the flavor out of his mouth. Then he started playing with his hand phone out of boredom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis should be expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin checked the cologne\u2019s brand, and his mouth dropped open when he searched for the model.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Two..two hundred dollars?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The price was too high for a high school student to use it without feeling a sense of burden. Moreover, he rarely used cologne. Maybe, if he smoked then he would have.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess h..hyung spends based on his emotions? He is spending recklessly since he making money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mood became restless when he saw the $500 given to him by Woojin. His noonah was probably working hard at the factory right now, but her annual income was less than the $53,000 Woojin made in a single day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was bored waiting for Woojin to return, so he accessed an online community he frequented. Then he wrote a post.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Brothers. I got a perfume for a present. About 3 days ago, I met an uncle by coincidence, and I let him sleep in my rented room for a day. He bought me a cologne and he also gave me $500. Isn\u2019t it a real windfall? Currently, I\u2019m eating chicken and alcohol. Hyung went out to buy more alcohol since we are out. He has a lot of money. ???(TLN: Just google it if you don\u2019t know) Let me boast about my present ???]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin uploaded a picture of the cologne as proof then he waited for the reaction from other people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddring, ddring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The replies were explosive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">(TLN: they are speaking in message board style. Sometimes they aren\u2019t even talking in full sentences.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[???. Nim. Be careful of your backside.] (TLN: XXX-nim. It is an honorific, but shortened to Nim here.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Perfume, rented room, success.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">? [Today real shared room ???]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">? [???? This hyung will move to your next door neighborhood.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[He isn\u2019t getting alcohol. He probably went to get condoms.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">?[Stupid. He won\u2019t get pregnant so why buy condoms.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">?[What, stupid. Then enema.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">?[????? He said enema.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Nim, It isn\u2019t too late. Throw away your rented room, and guard your behind.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[So who will be the bottom?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[?? The person who paid will be the top.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Congratulation on your anal\u2019s grand opening!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">?[What is anal?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">?[Your asshole, you stupid Mofo.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Request butt. Monitor ready in front.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk tsk. If they are jealous then they should just say so. Why do a gay ad lib?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin continued to read the posts being posted, and he glanced at the front door. Mmm, he wouldn\u2019t do that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He won\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The delicious chicken suddenly tasted like he was chewing on rubber. Is he deluding himself\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, he probably won\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

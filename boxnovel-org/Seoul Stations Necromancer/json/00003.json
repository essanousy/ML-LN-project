This dungeon is a real dungeon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought it was a slang, but it didn\u2019t seem like it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His head throbbed, so he pressed his hand onto his temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a sigh then he sorted through the message in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;This dungeon has already been captured. \u00a0The basic monsters will be summoned.&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a sufficiently shocking situation, but Woojin wasn\u2019t shocked. Instead, he felt a feeling of familiarity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t this too similar to the Planet Alphen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had fought fiercely to survive in that place. The planet of Alphen was none other than a game world. No. Should he characterize it as a new world with a game setting?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid earth change? Or is it only like this for me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin puzzled over it, but he couldn\u2019t come up with an answer. He just wanted to take a subway train yet he had entered a dungeon. By the look of it, earth must have gone through some kind of change in the past 5 years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go back out first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he can\u2019t ride the subway, then he\u2019ll just ride the bus. As Woojin tried to head back, an invisible barrier barred his way.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;You do not have the Return Stone.&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Jeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin scratched the back of his head. He had no idea what the Return Stone looked liked, so he was in a bind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess it was locked for a reason.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His curiosity made him open this place. He wanted to head back, but now he was complete stuck. He had no choice, but to find the thing called Return Stone to escape this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had lost his magic. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but his trained body was still the same. Moreover, he had over 20 years of survival experience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked through an out of business store, and he was able to find a coat hanger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-reeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He easily took out the pole from the coat hanger, which he made into a simple club. However, he was disappointed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is too light.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked around the adjacent store. In the middle of the mess, there was a hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boo-oong. Boong.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis might be useful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took the hammer, then he swung a chair onto the floor. He tore the back of the demolished chair out. After smoothing it over, he was able to make a decent shield that would be able to take a couple hit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould I depart?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know what the Return Stone looked like, but he had been told the basic monsters had been summoned. He wasn\u2019t sure about his level of preparation, so he felt a sense of uncertainty. However, it was a situation where he couldn\u2019t retreat backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no choice, but to go forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked as he relied on the blinking florescent lights. Then he felt a weird sensation coming from the subway\u2019s restroom. It was a sticky sensation as if someone was watching him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stealthily lowered his body. He picked up a piece of tile then he threw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-eng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It reacted at the sound made by the tile hitting a glass door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-rooo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It let out a grotesque shriek. It had a strange appearance, so much so that one wouldn\u2019t think this creature would exist on earth. It looked like a dog, but it possessed large ears like a rabbit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a creature that shouldn\u2019t exist on earth, but Woojin knew this monster well. He had faced off against this monster countless times at the Planet Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDrabbit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKwaah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Drabbit ran in as it threateningly revealed its twin fangs. It used its large hind legs, which composed half of its body, to charge by jumping. It was the Drabbit\u2019s specialty, and its only method of attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as he blocked with his shield, he swung the hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-rook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he struck the Drabbit, it rolled onto the floor as it let out a scream. Woojin didn\u2019t hesitate. He ran forward to press down on its neck then he used the back of the clawed hammer to pierce it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a familiar monster showed up, he didn\u2019t feel much threat from it, but he couldn\u2019t let his guard down. He had to go for the sure kill when he had the chance to kill it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the basic and essential rule one needed to heed in order to survive against a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Drabbit\u2019s body sagged as it let out a moan akin to a wind escaping. Afterwards, Woojin hurriedly checked his surrounding. The Drabbit had a characteristic where they traveled in a pair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, another Drabbit jumped out, and it flew toward him with its scary mouth open. The shield he made out of the back of a chair was already broken from the last attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin hefted his hammer then he swung it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwa-jik!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgueeeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The clawed hammer accurately pierced through the Drabbit\u2019s mouth, and it stuck out from the back of its head. He had timed it perfectly as he used an exquisite thrust to execute a counter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow come this feels like a deja-vu?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin remembered the first time he was summoned to the Planet Alphen. He was so shocked and afraid. However, his situation right now was more favorable than before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it possible for the monsters of Planet Alphen to show up here? Even this dungeon feels out of place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt an unknown sense of danger. The feeling felt too familiar to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The message that showed up in front of his eyes, and even the monsters starting to emerge were something that wouldn\u2019t have been strange on Planet Alphen. However, this was earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was this was a subway station on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019ll level up if this continues.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was one of the reason why Woojin was able to survive on Planet Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That place was like a game world. No, Woojin might have felt this way since he was a human from earth, who was familiar with games.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It might be that world\u2019s law of nature, but it had felt like a game for Woojin. The only difference was that the world wasn\u2019t a virtual reality. It was real.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Levels had existed, and Woojin had developed into a full level Necromancer. He hadn\u2019t reached the end of the road, but he had met the Dimensional Administrator. So he returned to earth without much regret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had lost all of the magic he had accumulated, but he hadn\u2019t cared. He thought his abilities wouldn\u2019t be needed on earth where he didn\u2019t have to worry about dying any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he found himself entered into a dungeon, and he could only desire after his lost abilities. If it was something on par with the Drabbit, then he could face them without feeling any panic. However, if there were stronger monsters here then it might be too dangerous for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most optimal situation was to earn the Return Stone without meeting a stronger monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf this place is similar to Alphen, a monster should have it or it should be emanating a distinct energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it was a stone or an item with an ability then its existence itself should let out an energy. He looked over the two monsters, but they didn\u2019t possess any unique mana gem called Bloodstone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese bastards are worthless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin left the corpses of the Drabbit where he searched them, and he hid himself next to a pillar. He thought it would be great if a nearby monster would come here after smelling the blood. Even if none showed up, he could restart the search after gathering himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQueereek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two Drabbits showed up, and they started circling around the corpse of the dead Drabbits. They looked like dogs, but their sense of smell wasn\u2019t that developed. They used their hearing to locate the location of other beings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Crack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin purposefully stepped hard on a piece of tile to reveal his existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cQweeeeee!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Drabbits simultaneously ran towards him, and they jumped towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grasped the hammer, and he performed a baseball swing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uk, puk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two Drabbit jumped with a time difference between the two. He crushed the Drabbit\u2019s head in succession. Then a message popped up in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Level Up!&gt;</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

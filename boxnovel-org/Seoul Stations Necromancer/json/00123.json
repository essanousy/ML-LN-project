He was confident in his 53 Death Knights.</p><br/><p>Even if they received a group consisting of Adventurers of Relick's level, he would be able to defend against them. \u00a0Since no one will enter his Dungeon on earth, he didn't have to worry about his Dimensional Domain.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo where should I go hunt\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>He had a lot of options, but what would be the most efficient method?</p><br/><p>If he gave up on his Protection period, he could request Domain Battles to the other lords. \u00a0Then he could ask for a re-match through Duel, and he could acquire the EXP by catching the Dimensional lords.</p><br/><p>Or he could use the 12 day Protection period. \u00a0It was 3 days in Earth's time, and he could hunt by clearing the subway stations.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm sure there are several links formed by now.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The more difficult Dungeons will start to link to Earth. There were probably several uncleared Dungeons that couldn't be resolved by the Roused of the world.\u00a0</p><br/><p>If it only contained the Dungeon owner, one would just have to dispose all the monsters. \u00a0However, if it was a Dungeon with a Dimensional lord, the link will finalize and the Gate would open...</p><br/><p>It wouldn't be a one time Dungeon Break. \u00a0The Dungeon will act as a spawning station, and it will continuously spit out monsters. \u00a0Moreover, monsters weren't the only ones that will exit the Dungeon.</p><br/><p>If being from another race like the Elves came out, and if they hunted the people of earth.... No, what if humans exited? \u00a0How will humans of earth react to hunting down fellow humans?</p><br/><p>\u201cI'll have to organize everything at least once. Protect the Domain well, Bibi. \u00a0If something happens, contact me.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cI'll do that. How about an additional 1,000 points....\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Woojin smirked as he increased the maximum amount of points he could assign to the Butler.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do whatever with the 1,000 points. I'm leaving the rest to you just in case you need it. Use it if you are in danger.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0I understand.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>With this much preparation, she should be able to sufficiently defend against all the Adventurers attacking the Necia's Pillar. If the worst case scenario of not being able to protect the synchronized Return Stone happened, he would just lose a Dungeon, and some Energy.</p><br/><p>It wasn't that big of a loss for him.</p><br/><p>He'll just lose a link to making the Planet Jaku a bigger hunting ground for him. \u00a0Woojin opened a portal to the Seoul Station's 1st Exit, and he passed through it.</p><br/><p>***\u00a0</p><br/><p>Alandal Guild's Vice President room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Minchan got off the phone, and he let out a long sigh. \u00a0Haemin looked on with a worried expression on his face, and he asked for the long awaited news.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. \u00a0They said to wait.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026isn't this a big deal? \u00a0We have to resolve this before the president gets here.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0I don't know what they are thinking.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Minchan and Haemin's face darkened. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t come up with any ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa. Shit. \u00a0How can the government change their word after one day?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cLet's stop talking about it.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>They were well aware of the reason why this had happened.</p><br/><p>It happened several hours after Woojin went into the Dungeon.</p><br/><p>A Death Knight suddenly appeared from inside the dark, and he left a present inside the Alandal's office.</p><br/><p>It was the head of 7 people.</p><br/><p>Eight employees had fainted, and fifteen employees threw up on the spot. \u00a0Minchan, who had been expecting the other shoe to drop, also felt a considerable amount of shock.\u00a0</p><br/><p>[Mission Complete.]\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Death Knight dropped the single phrase, and he disappeared as he turned into black smoke.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Everyone fell into a state of panic.</p><br/><p>Alandal's office wasn't the only place in turmoil.</p><br/><p>There was unrest across the entire country of South Korea.</p><br/><p>The news about the congressmen that had been responsible for the terrorist attack, and the news about Kahng-woojin was ongoing. This was when 7 headless corpses were found.</p><br/><p>The cream of the crop of the financial circles were assassinated. \u00a0This impacted everyone a bit differently from the congressmen, who had been killed after causing a huge disturbance at congress.</p><br/><p>The main suspect behind the assassination was surmised to be Kahng-woojin. The police raided the guild headquarters, and they had taken the heads.</p><br/><p>Soon, the news announced that these financial magnates were involved in the terrorist attack was reported, but the public opinion had soured.</p><br/><p>Kahng-woojin had occupied congress and he had selectively killed the congressmen. \u00a0At the time, everyone thought it was an urgent situation where this deed had to be done to stop the terrorists. \u00a0They were willing to overlook his actions.</p><br/><p>However, the latest assassinations were viewed differently. \u00a0Private citizens might be killed at the whim of Kahng-woojin.</p><br/><p>Kahng-woojin wielded absolute power, and the fear felt towards him caused ill feelings against him. \u00a0There were clear laws in this land, yet he had easily taken the lives of people. \u00a0It felt as if he was acting like a god.</p><br/><p>The public sentiment was smouldering, and it wasn't an atmosphere where the government could bring up the topic of amending the Constitution. \u00a0This act would have to be voted by the citizens.</p><br/><p>South Korea didn't recognize North Korea as a country, so how could they recognize Alandal as an independent country? \u00a0It would only be possible, if they made significant changes to the law. \u00a0Votes from the citizens were needed to make the changes possible.</p><br/><p>The status of their independence was unclear right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do? \u00a0Should we continue to make preparations?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026we'll continue.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Before they could even get past the preparation station, everything was coming apart, but they couldn't stop now.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won't be able to do anything without the government's cooperation.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cUh-whew. \u00a0We still have to do it.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, I'm afraid to go outside, since I might be hit by a rock.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Haemin sympathized with those words a hundred times over.</p><br/><p>The opinions amongst the journalists wasn't that great right now. The problem was the fact that journalist could sneakily sway the public opinions. Moreover, the companies related to the assassinated business magnates were also putting pressure on the government.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Since they didn't know when they might be taken out, the implicit fear they felt made everyone unite.</p><br/><p>Kahng-woojin displayed power and ability that was beyond the realm of humans, and he made the fearful citizens uneasy.</p><br/><p>If the situation worsened even by a little bit, Alandal itself might be ousted from South Korea.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh. Still, the rough framework is done thanks to Mr. Lee-kahngjin. \u00a0Since we don't have the cooperation from the government...\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The current Alandal territory was composed of the Seoul Station and the lands nearby. It was land purchased under the Alandal guild's name.</p><br/><p>The citizens consisted of the guild personnel.</p><br/><p>When one joined the guild, one was given citizenship to the country of Alandal. \u00a0The two nations shared both currency and communications.</p><br/><p>From one to ten, they need the cooperation of the Korean government.</p><br/><p>Every detail of the agreement was put in the treaty, but it was a mystery as to whether the treaty would be finalized.</p><br/><p>It made them wonder if this treaty was possible in the first place. The Constitution of South Korea considered the North Korean government to be an organization, who illegally seized a part of the country.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet's prepare thoroughly first.\"</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, vice president.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Minchan and Haemin exchanged complicated gazes. \u00a0How could this blow up so big? \u00a0They had just wanted jobs after leaving the Hammer guild....</p><br/><p>They had started out as a small guild with 5 members. \u00a0In just a couple month....</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least, we were able to bring our family.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThat's true.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The family of Woojin, Sunggoo, and Haesol was moved to Alandal. Any employee, who wanted to move their family, were allowed to do so. \u00a0Including the employees, there were almost 500 people in total.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill he be out before the Guild General Assembly?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The Korea's Guild General Assembly was being hosted by Hammer guild.</p><br/><p>It was being sponsored by the Hammer guild, but Woojin was the one, who wanted this General Assembly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would we be doing, if we stayed behind at the Hammer guild?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Jung-minchan frowned as he thought about Haemin's question. \u00a0Then he smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think we would be doing? \u00a0We'll probably be cursing Kahng-woojin, and we would be getting ready for the General Assembly. \u00a0I would be the team leader, and you would still be my deputy.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cKoo-kook. \u00a0Now that I think about it aren't we incredible? \u00a0Aren't we on a level where we could lead Korea...no, the world by its nose?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. \u00a0We have done well for ourselves. \u00a0We have been so successful that it is starting to scare me.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>This couldn't be called a fast track. \u00a0This was like a lightning promotion.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Minchan's handphone rang. \u00a0He answered the phone when he saw Woo-soonghoon's number.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, director Woo.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>[The president just came out right now. \u00a0We are heading towards the office. He wants a list of the uncleared Dungeons.]\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. \u00a0You bring him here with care.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>[Don't worry about it.]\u00a0</p><br/><p>The number of reporters waiting nearby was enormous. There were even several religious organizations that had come to protest. \u00a0He knew Woojin's personality, and if Woojin had a head on collision with the protesters, it might irrevocably damage the public opinion. \u00a0The public opinion would worsen to that extent.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident is coming here. \u00a0Hurry up, and ready the report.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The basic framework was set, so they hurriedly got ready.</p><br/><p>After a brief amount of time, Minchan and Haemin went to greet Woojin at the parking lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn't have to come out. Did anything significant happen?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Of course, something significant had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe public opinion isn't great right now. \u00a0Moreover, the government is also expressing their disapproval. \u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were not comfortable with the assassinations.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cI killed the bastards that deserved death. \u00a0What's wrong with that?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>It was a matter of degrees\u2026 He had gone past the line.</p><br/><p>One needed to follow the procedure of the law. \u00a0One needed a trial, and the punishment had to be decided. \u00a0Of course, capital punishment would never be given, but Woojin's action was basically murder. It's nothing more and nothing less.</p><br/><p>Woojin frowned as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let's not make a treaty.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Wasn't all of this done in preparation for raising a nation? He had never seen Woojin go back on his words, so Minchan asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are you cancelling the Declaration of independence?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cWe'll just forego the treaty with Korea.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThey'll feel the loss, not me.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>So what did he want to do?</p><br/><p>What did he want to do after setting up an independent country in the middle of Seoul?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don't need approval from those arrogant pricks.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026if you don't sign the treaty with South Korea, there is no deal.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The countless Dungeons within Korea will be off limits. \u00a0The modern amenities like electricity and water would be cut off.</p><br/><p>They would basically be refugees stuck in a small parcel of land within Seoul.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe I should just take over Korea.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you can't do that.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Minchan was taken aback, and he pushed back on Woojin's matter of fact words.</p><br/><p>Did extreme situations awaken the sleeping potential of a person? \u00a0Minchan desperately worked to come up with a solution to this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about using the US government?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cUS? I told you I'm not moving.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>He had to protect the Seoul Station's 1st Exit. \u00a0It was the Dungeon that was connected to his Dimensional Domain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can ask the US government to put pressure on the Korean government.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Woojin tilted his head in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill that really work?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will work\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Michan had a bitter expression on his face. \u00a0It sounded ridiculous, but that was the reality.</p><br/><p>Woojin could use the power of influence held by the US. \u00a0There was a person in Korea that could act as an intermediary.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere's Melody?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is with your sister.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cGuide me there. \u00a0Also, immediately print out a list of the Dungeons that hasn't been cleared yet.\"</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Woojin was guided by Soonghoon, who was the chief of secretary. \u00a0He led Woojin to the rooms being used as residents. \u00a0The entire 1st floor was decorated like the inside of a house.</p><br/><p>Several families of the Alandal guild members lived here. \u00a0Woojin's family was one of them. \u00a0They entered a door labeled Room 101, and they entered a living space that looked like a clean hotel room.</p><br/><p>Woojin's mother was sitting on the sofa with a restless expression on her face. \u00a0When she saw Woojin, she stood up abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoojin.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What's going on?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Lee-soogyuhng started to cry when she saw her son.</p><br/><p>\u201cSooah is\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat's wrong with Sooah?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Woojin was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cSooah had another seizure. \u00a0Hoo-oohk.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>He tightly hugged his crying mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere's Sooah?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cShe's in the other room. \u00a0The Holy Maiden is looking over her.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cIt'll be fine. \u00a0She'll be okay.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Woojin comforted his mother for awhile as he waited for Melody to come out. \u00a0After a brief amount of time, the door opened, and Melody stepped out. \u00a0She flinched when she saw Woojin. \u00a0She bowed, and gave her greetings.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sister's symptom has stabilized by a little bit.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. \u00a0Aigo. \u00a0Thank you.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Lee-soogyung grabbed the Holy Maiden's hands, and she kept thanking her. Woojin looked at Melody as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to talk to you for a moment, Melody.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Immortal.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to the president's room.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>He felt uncomfortable talking in front of his mother, so Woojin decided to leave first. \u00a0After exiting the room, the light within his eyes was filled with mixed emotions.</p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

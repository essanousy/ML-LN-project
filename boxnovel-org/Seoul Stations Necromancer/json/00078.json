If observed in microcosm, the Korean support teams were like mercenary bands and a large guild like the Titans were like Army units.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of a small number of Roused, the Titan's team relied on overwhelming firepower to deal with the Dungeon Breaks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it's fire power, that man's familiars is all we need.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden still couldn't forget how Woojin used his familiar Lich and the force of Skeleton Magicians. She watched Flame magic fall from the sky like rain. The scene had been too terrible of a disaster to describe it as a spectacular sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can't call Janice yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had been disinterestedly looking out the window when he said the words in passing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI also can't summon the Lich.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are sealed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden's eyes shook violently when she heard Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sealed? The Immortal's power? That vast Necromancy magic?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Death Knights\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSoon, their seals will be released, but I can't call them out yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The warriors that never shedded blood or tears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Commanders of the Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spearhead of the Undead Army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they were still sealed, then the familiar he had next to him was....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was sure the ball of light that took up a seat inside the helicopter was the Titan of Destruction. There was the alien energy within the shadows, and the Illusion Witch captured by Rashmode...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If it's only them\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as if he could read the Holy Maiden's thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? You want to take a shot at me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden was startled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The image of him grinning made him look very dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't know what you are talking about\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can see your eyes rolling around trying to size me up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be your opponent any time you want. However, even if you want to go against me, wait until a later time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't care if the Holy Maiden wanted to turn hostile against him. He knew what he had done in the past, so it would be a joke to expect her to look at him in a better light. The only reason why the Holy Maiden was being careful was because of the fear that blanketed her memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Holy Maiden did attack him, it wasn't as if Woojin was helpless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he had to rescue Bibi first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he weren\u2019t at Max Level, he could handle one Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm am merely observing the Monarch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's funny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTheir base is up ahead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the helicopter pilot's words, Deacon's eyes became round when he looked at what lay in front of them. The farmland was an empty plain. Still, how can a base like this be located so close to New York?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon let out a sound of disbelief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin started to track the trace left by Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he looked towards the demolished building, he felt Bibi's energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time, he felt a sticky and unpleasant energy nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRashmode.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's gaze became cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous farmstead held a helicopter, military vehicles, and even tanks....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, it looked like a private collection of a rich military enthusiast. In truth, it was a warehouse with weapons procured by the Mafia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From a room located inside the warehouse, a voice of a man swearing half the time was leaking out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahhng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi had been crouching within the darkness. She quietly approached the man and her ears twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Boss. He failed. The mark is still alive.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Say it again!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The target is alive. We are returning right now.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and come back here soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jack was the boss of the River's organization. After ending the call with the scout he had sent into the city, he let out a string of swear words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBoss. What's wrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAssad failed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He never imagined such a thing could happen. Assad was the best assassin in the Middle East, yet he had failed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis means he isn't an average Necromancer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the point of saying such an obvious statement?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An ordinary Roused of the Magician class would have a very hard time killing Assad. The fact that the Necromancer came out of the Dungeon meant he had killed Assad himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think our base is compromised?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEeek\u2026. I knew we shouldn't have worked with those Middle Eastern bastards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His stress continued to pile on as he thought about what could happen in the future. Since their target was still alive, a massive investigation would be under way soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's ok. We've already decided to abandon this base.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut we still have some research to do\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026We'll have to move up the timetable a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jack put on his vest. The tactical vest had two pistols holstered on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be back after I meet the professor. Beef up the security, then arrange it so that we can leave immediately.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, boss. How much should we pack?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou idiot! We are throwing it all away. We will gather the research results, then we'll blow the base up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Yes, boss.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were outdated tanks, missiles, and military vehicles. It was still a huge loss, but they had no choice. If they ran away while they took everything, then it would be too noticeable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of the organized crime syndicate started to pack up in a hurry, then started to install explosives in various locations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jack exited the office building and then entered a small concrete building placed at the edge of the farm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggi-reek, ggeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the thick steel door opened, a stairway leading underground was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the farmstead was the River organization's weapons warehouse, the underground bunker was the source of all their funds. It was the New Dungeon Research Facility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Rivers organization received backings from US defense industries to help in their research. They had found a suitable location for the research and they protected the research staff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rivers used to be a small-time organization. Their meteoric rise to becoming a large crime organization was mostly due to the strong backing they received from the defense industries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tuk, tuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jack's footsteps rang out in the underground passageway. He stopped when he felt something amiss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He quickly drew his pistol and aimed it towards his rear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jack saw a cat tilting its head, stopping after coming down from the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Fuck off.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw the stray cat, Jack lowered his guard and continued down the stairs. Jack tried to take loud steps to threaten the cat. The cat only paused for a moment before it continued to follow behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jack ignored the cat as he descended the stairs to the research facility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The research facility was deserted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the end of the stairway, there was a space where the research staff could sleep. There were only a couple of computers,as well as many strange looking machines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing remarkable about the space within the underground bunker was the fact that it had expanded in every direction like ant tunnels. Moreover, bloodstones were piled up inside the tunnels.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cProfessor Riola! We have to move our base.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Riola, the person in charge of the research, frowned at Jack's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm at the cusp of finishing my research. I can't move right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is a chance our base is compromised..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn't we plan on moving in two days?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If their original plan had held up, then that would be the case. They had fired a missile within New York, so the US Department of Defense would be looking for the culprits as if they were combing for a tick. After a certain amount of time, they planned on letting the DOD find their base. However, their target was still alive, so they had to change the time table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They could be caught much earlier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even their sponsors wouldn't be able to do anything if the US government retaliated. The government had the backing of the public, and they would be angered over the terrorist act.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to pull out as fast they were able to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a lengthy argument, Riola backed off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The calculations were already all done. They just had to conduct their last experiment and collect the resultant data.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Just give me 3 hours. We'll leave after I attempt my last experiment.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi quietly hid herself inside the darkness as she thoroughly explored the underground lair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Something's strange.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt a strange sense of danger and it was getting on her nerves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The research staff busily placed bloodstones in various locations. Professor Riola opened a black box and took out a bright purple gem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Dimensional Fragment!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi's eyes shown, since she had seen this item once before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Professor Riola arranged the bloodstones like a magic circle. He placed the gem in the center, then he turned to look at the other researchers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can head up now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jack's boring wait had come to an end. He went up the stairs with the researchers. When everyone disappeared, the Dimensional Fragment rose into the empty air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. Something very grave is happening here-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was the only one left inside the bunker. She had an uneasy feeling as magical energy swirled around the Dimensional Fragment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bloodstones placed around the surrounding let out a hum. One after another, the bloodstones rose into the air as it emitted Mana.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ook. Something bad is going to happen if this continues-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi felt something was wrong, so she started running up the stairs. Before Bibi could clear the stairs, the pillar of light shot out from the underground bunker and into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the amazing spectacle receded, the entrance of the underground bunker returned to its original appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and bring it over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With a pounding heart, Professor Riola activated the instrument that measured the Dungeon Energy. A fellow researcher was operating the machine and his eyes turned round when he saw the rising value.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? It seems we've succeeded.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's the measured value?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It's about 5 stars. Uh... It...it went past 6 stars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGreat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rioloa made a fist. He will overtake Toppler and be known as the world's top authority on Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He accomplished something no one else had ever done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to create a new Dungeon that wasn't located inside a subway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? The value is rising sharply. This value is... It's a 7 star Dungeon\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Riola was surprised as he looked over the numbers given by the measuring instrument. This was a value never before seen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A powerful shock wave came out of the Dungeon. The measuring equipment and the poorlu built ceiling of the farmstead collapsed. The shock wave pushed back the tanks within the warehouse, and the other vehicles were thrown backwards as if a tornado had descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Riola and Jack, who were near the Dungeon, was thrown to the floor and sent rolling away. Several unlucky people died immediately. The other, more unlucky people were at death's doo, letting out ragged breaths.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-hahahah. Which human summoned me, Rashmode?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bizarre phlegm-filled voice was heard as Rashmode squeezed through the narrow door to the Dungeon. His eyes twinkled as he looked at the cat within his grasp. Her hackles were raised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-oh. It's a succubus with a very familiar energy signature...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahhng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi glared at Rashmode, but she couldn't do anything. Ggaebi, who was in the shadows of the reconnaissance team inside the office, slipped out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The helicopter landed near the farm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked without any hesitation and a worried Dolsae followed behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon, the Holy Maiden, and the nervous Holy Knights brought up the rear. His eyes traveled up the rough unpaved road as he headed towards the collapsed farmstead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin saw the poorly equipped humans, who couldn't run away, looking towards Rashmode.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahahaha. It really was the Immortal's succubus.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode held the limp Bibi in one hand, and he roared with laughter. Woojin narrowed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess it isn't synchronized yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-kook. Earth is still unripe. I came out of curiosity. I wanted to see who had formed the summoning magic circle. I would have never guess it was the Immortal!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode seemed to be genuinely delighted by the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Immortal ran away and hid on earth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReturn Bibi to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ha. This little missy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode shook the limp cat in his grasp.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know the Immortal's familiars can't be truly killed. They are similar to us in that aspect.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes. Trahnet's commanders were like leeches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-kook. I know, better than others, the pain and despair of death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one is revived, it doesn't undo the death one experiences. The memory of going through death was truly frightening. As one remembered the experience, the fear one felt increased. Woojin didn't want Bibi to experience the pain and despair caused by death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess dementia has finally come to you? Didn't you die around five times by my hands?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, that's right. That did happen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode let out a cheerful laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, it was the version of you that hadn't been initialized.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode looked as if he was trying to see through Woojin. Woojin's face had already hardened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's see if you are confident enough to challenge me once again. Koo-kook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode glanced at the Holy Maiden and headed towards the underground Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's leave our minions out of this. Come at me. Let's have a fair fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode let out an unpleasant laugh then he headed inside the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Woojin could walk forward, the Holy Maiden grabbed him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's a trap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt always is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere's no trap that I can't overcome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal's track record bore this out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to head into the Dungeon when the monsters rushed out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-rah-rahk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of the Rivers organization ran away from the Dungeon when they saw the endless flow of monsters. Woojin laughed when he saw the monsters pour out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLeave all our minions?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode was sending all the monsters out from inside the Dungeon. The Dungeon Break couldn't happen without the express consent of the Dungeon's owner. Basically, the owner could create a Dungeon Break any time the owner wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the monsters from within the Dungeon was sent out. The Holy Maiden had a frightened expression when several hundred monsters came out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was Rashmode's choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rashmode didn't want to give Woojin any corpses, so he was giving up his underlings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDolsae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Dolsae's vibration was more intense, since he was worried about Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll rescue her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt Dolsae's sadness, worry, and anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese trashes\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin extracted all his magical energy, and he gave it to Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou sweep them up as you like.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened his Inventory. He took out a magic potion and drank it. Then, he started walking towards the monsters. As if they were trained dogs, the monsters held firm without making any moves towards Woojin as he walked past them. The monsters kept order as they unleashed a killing intent. It was like watching a horde before their charge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt a familiar feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed at this nonsense. He had fought Trahnet's army ad nauseam, and now he\u2019d have to fight them once again. So why was his heart beating faster?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin entered the Dungeon, the monsters immediately went into a frenzy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKwahhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what should we do? We should have brought backup...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon began to have late regrets about everything when a storm started to form around Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gi-gi-gi-geek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tanks scattered around the surrounding was pulled towards Dolsae. The helicopters, vehicles, and missiles was also dragged along. Even the steel framework of the barn and the thick steel doors flew towards Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-goo-gook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The helicopters were crushed and the tanks were being disassembled. The pieces then started to reassemble themselves. The missiles attached themselves to Dolsae's shoulder and the blades of the helicopters were attached onto his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGoo-ohhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Steel Titan let out a roar and the monsters flinched back in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden swallowed drily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Titan of Destruction\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This summoned being was rumored to be the most ruthless being amongst the Immortal's familiars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Steel Golem started running rampant.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Unlike his grumblings, his footsteps didn't cause any sound as it brushed by the surrounding vegetation. \u00a0His movements were stealthy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the sound of the trap's activation, Haesol's additional order rang out in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Rejoin the team by heading toward your 7 o'clock. You'll be participating in the close combat.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong hurriedly oriented himself towards the direction indicated. \u00a0The battle wasn't too far away from where he had set the trap.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kyahhhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His comrades will be there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ahp!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He let out a shout of concentration, and he started running with a low-grade sword in his hand. It was something he stole from a Lizardman. \u00a0It had a pretty good balance, so it was quite useful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDie...please.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was trying to extract the sword that was stuck on its thick hide. \u00a0Joonyong was frantically kicking at the Lizardman, and he gathered his magical energy to emit an Electric Shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jee-jee=jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he came here, he was a Rank E Roused that was able to use Telekinesis and Electric Shock. \u00a0He was most often sent to the rear of the party. \u00a0However, it was useless to have a strict structure in this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a role, but the work he had to do differed depending on the situation. \u00a0One had to swing a sword, cooperate with others, use magic and set down traps. \u00a0However, this wasn't special to him. \u00a0All the members of the group had to learn numerous skills, and they were now quite adept at using those skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only those who adapted quickly survived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only 7 comrades left around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh-ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-joonyong looked at the battlefield with a cruel light in his eyes. \u00a0Twelve Lizardmen had been ruthlessly killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood job.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span

style=\"\">Joonyong grudgingly lowered his gaze to the floor. \u00a0He could oppose her, but it would all be in vain. \u00a0He couldn't even measure up to the tip of her toes. \u00a0She was only a Tamer, yet she was very good at fighting....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0We'll end the hunt right now, and we'll head back to the camp. \u00a0Gather all the loot.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone wordlessly cut apart the Lizardmen to extract the Bloodstones. \u00a0They were used to doing this now. \u00a0Afterwards, they collected their weapons and defensive gears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had reached a point where it was more awkward to talk to each other through spoken words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol's Telepathic ability was most useful when commanding her own troops. \u00a0However, the actual people being commanded felt like puppets on a string. \u00a0It felt dirty to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are heading back.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ahhhhhng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol got on a puma that had been Tamed in a jungle. \u00a0Haesol led them to a hidden camp that was located within a cracked boulder. \u00a0Moreover, there were others already there.</span></p><br/><p><span

\u00a0Haesol had taken him away in the prior battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? \u00a0How\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His limbs had been cut, and he had received a wound that would have killed anyone in short order. \u00a0However, he....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Holy Maiden healed me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. \u00a0You are alive. \u00a0You are still alive.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Had it only been several days since they started working together? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had only been 6 days. \u00a0However, they had formed an indescribable sense of kinship and camaraderie from the experiences they shared. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They operated under the stress of battle, and the devilish Che-haesol kept pushing them forward. \u00a0Of course, a tight bond would form under these circumstances.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The comrades he assumed to be dead were all alive. \u00a0Moreover, they were in better shape than ever.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol threw cold water on top of this meeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet in a column of fours.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Haesol's command, they quickly moved to get in formation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the supplies sent by the king. \u00a0Only take the ones with your name on it. \u00a0Go to it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were numerous supply boxes stacked at the corner of the camp. \u00a0It meant the content of each box varied.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They all picked up pretty large boxes, and they returned to their original spots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAfter you absorb all the Reinforcement Stones and Skill Books, you will all put on your equipments. \u00a0Start!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet to it!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong's eyes widen when he opened his box.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He held up a Reinforcement Stone that was the size of his fist. \u00a0His eyes were spinning. \u00a0In the past, he had guessed that the Reinforcement Stones given to him were expensive. \u00a0However, he could now feel the immense magical energy within it now. \u00a0His magical control and detection ability was heightened as he experienced neardeath situations. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018As expected of our king.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was giving them such precious Items without any qualms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong absorbed all the Reinforcement Stones, and he learned 3 additional Skill Books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These Skills!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one inserts magical energy into a Skill Book, the knowledge contained within the book was absorbed. \u00a0He could see in his mind\u2019s eye as to how these abilities would be used. \u00a0Kim-joonyong's body was trembling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were all the abilities he had wanted to learn in the past. \u00a0These were the abilities he needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I'm sure of it! \u00a0He is looking over me!\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The media spoke about Kahng-woojin's overwhelming martial abilities, but they didn't look too kindly at his policy of ruling by force. \u00a0However, Joonyong knew the truth now, since he had experienced it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was a caring and thoughtful man. \u00a0Even the Roused on the lowest rung was getting personal attention from him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh. \u00a0I can't believe this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is everything I needed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same for his comrades. \u00a0They were all happy when they found out that the supplies were customized for them. \u00a0It wasn't just the Skill Books. \u00a0The equipments also differed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. \u00a0Look at this body suit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's a sword. \u00a0This is perfect for me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This sword couldn't be compared to the one he stole from the Lizardman. \u00a0He didn't know how his personal preferences were discerened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone held in their hands weapons that were perfect for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the armor that looked like a motorcycle suit. \u00a0It clung to their body, and the key parts of the body were protected by a reinforcement of metal. \u00a0This armor would allow them to avoid critical blows. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armor was a mixture of red and black. \u00a0Moreover, there was an engraving of a yawning cat on the shoulder and the chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the distinct emblem that represented the Dimensional Domain of Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from the equipments, there were all types of consumables in there too. \u00a0There were \u00a0expensive potions and antidotes one could use in emergency. \u00a0Then there were the artifacts that could be used for offence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The king's kindness is....\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong couldn't stop his body from trembling. \u00a0What other guild would support their members to this extent? \u00a0He was only a Rank E Roused. \u00a0He had never received such a treatment before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and put it on!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn't for the ball busting drill instructor Che-Haesol, who was also his immediate superior, he would have basked a little bit more in this ecstasy. \u00a0However, there were still 6 days before they were scheduled to return to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol had on a strict face, but she was smiling inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Everyone is happy.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol had kept track of all 23 new recruits. \u00a0She had come up with suitable weapons and Skills that would complement their battle styles. \u00a0She also assessed their abilities before she had sent a report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin unhesitatingly bought the equipments and Items from his Dimensional Store, and he had sent it to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In terms of worth, these Items was worth millions. \u00a0However, if one thought about the task they would have to accomplish in the future, it was a good investment for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll start the training again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span

style=\"\">The portal to the Dimensional Domain Alandal was opened. \u00a0The 23 Roused under the care of Haesol appeared. The look in their eyes and their auras were completely different than before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've finished our training.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin listened to Haesol's report from his Throne. \u00a0He once again purchased Reinforcement Stones from the Dimensional Store. \u00a0Every time the absorption standby period ended, it was best to provide the Reinforcement Stones on time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The development of abilities was important, but the advance of one's personal stats had a big influence on one's combat ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys all did well.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked indifferent, but he looked dignified. \u00a0When Woojin took out the Reinforcement Stones as rewards for their training, the new recruits became stunned. \u00a0This was very true for Kim-joonyong. \u00a0It looked as if he was about to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What a benevolent person! \u00a0He really is the king of our time..\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't even be compared to his instructor Che-haesol. \u00a0She was someone he didn't want to come across even in hell. \u00a0Haesol's actions were all done for the training. \u00a0However, Kim-joonyong had challenged her authority the most, so Kim-joonyong had been beaten the most by her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't burning with a sense of revenge, but he couldn't think favorably of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was mature enough to recognize the hierarchy of their poisitions. \u00a0This was why he was keeping silent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys should eat it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are worthless. \u00a0Are you sure you should be giving these Items to us so freely?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cInvestment. \u00a0It is an investment.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ah.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, he was magnanimous. \u00a0He was the king of kings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong was moved.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he killed them now, they would merely be corpses. \u00a0At the very least, if he could raise them to the 7th Circle or Rank AA, he could recycle them into Death Knights....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaesol.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, do you have a name for your team?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI haven't thought about it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the newly recruited Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, do any of you have a good idea for a team name?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Joonyong was the first one to pose a question at Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are always going to work as a single team?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. \u00a0Moreover, this team will be under Haesol's command..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's words, everyone including Joonyong frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Chet. \u00a0I don't like it, but it is an order from our king.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was deep within his thoughts as he started to tap on the Throne's armrest. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-joonyong raised his hand high into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow about Phantom?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPhantom?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe want to become your elite guards, who will protect the king, even in our death as ghosts.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he giving Woojin permission to take their souls if they died? \u00a0Their souls would cease to exist\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, all right. \u00a0The name is cheesy, but it fits.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at Haesol, who was standing in front of her unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's call it the Phantom Unit. \u00a0As their commander, you have the discretion to separate them into further teams.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol's eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am willing to give my life for Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy is everyone talking about serving me in death today?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they died, he would have to waste his Control Points on them. \u00a0It would be better if they worked for him in life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Baek-jungdo, Do-jaemin, Blanka and Melody appeared as they passed through the open portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-ooh. \u00a0The end is finally here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou all did a good job.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tension they felt dissipated when they arrived at Alandal. \u00a0They were patting each other on the back when they realized the new recruits were lined up in front of Woojin. \u00a0Most of the new recruits were slightly acquainted with the other group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they were at death's door, the Wyvern raced towards the Holy Maiden for treatment. \u00a0Several recruits expressed their thanks to her with their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys should greet each other at a later time. \u00a0Let's head back to earth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?

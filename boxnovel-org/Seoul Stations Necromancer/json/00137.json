After fighting in Dimensional battles for a long time, he had learned not to judge an opponent by their appearance. \u00a0It would be preposterous if he did.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The child was letting out a serious amount of energy. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia, who had been approaching, stopped his approach. \u00a0While they were glaring each other, the world started to change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Snow started to fall from the sky. He hated snow the most.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ice magic?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia vigorously shook his head. \u00a0This felt different.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't material magic. \u00a0It was mental...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia's yellow eyes flashed. \u00a0He bared his white teeth toward Bibi. \u00a0He knew this child felt a bit different from other humans, and he finally realized the source of the of deja vu he was experiencing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You are a Night Hag.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wasn't a human. \u00a0She was a demon. To be precise, she was a Nightmare Succubus, who was capable of controlling other\u2019s dreams.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Light shot out of Jupia's eyes, and it illuminated the world. \u00a0The snow disappeared, and the surrounding scene melted away. \u00a0Then Jupia was able to see Bibi, who had a broad smile on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. It seems my attack isn't too effective when I'm alone.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Parlor tricks.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The result might have been different if Junpia's thoughts had been occupied by a battle. \u00a0Since Junpia was in a relaxed state right now, Bibi's attack wasn't effective. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's your relationship with Jupiel?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Second Throne Jupiel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia's face suddenly crumpled when he heard the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[He is my litter mate.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh-eh. \u00a0You are a sibling of that crazy dog. Isn't that something?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Junpia looked at Bibi with incredulity in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[To my knowledge, planet earth doesn't have a Demon world. \u00a0So why are you getting in my way?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi had a bright smile on her face. \u00a0Her personality was completely different from Jupia's personality. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't mind talking to him, but what was Jupia's scheme?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She caught sight of the tree, which was rapidly growing every second and every minute. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy master love this planet too much.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Master?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou've never been to Alphen?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Alphen? Wasn't that the battlefield of the great lords?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0I guess you don't know anything about him.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy master is very scary.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was this little devil up to?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0Shall we get this started? I have a feeling it'll get annoying if I let the tree grow leaves.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was correct. When the tree was filled with Energy, it would become the foothold between the Dimensional Domain and the planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the tree needed another full day for the tree to mature and grow leaves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia turned his head, and he headed towards the tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fighting could be done by others. \u00a0He was different from his twin Jupiel, who was simplistic in his approach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roo. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All black panthers under him gathered from the surrounding. \u00a0At a glance, there looked to be over 200 of them. \u00a0It wasn't something a Nightmare Witch could handle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0Switch places with me, Dolsae-jjing!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Dolsae stepped forward, the cars in the parking lot was pulled towards the Golem's Heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-gee-geek, ggee-geek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cars were crushed and dismantled. \u00a0Then it was hardened to form the Golem's body. In the process, the fuel tanks were crushed. Gasoline and diesel flowed over Dolsae's entire body, and fumes started to emanate from him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ahng, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae\u2019s two fists banged against each other, and it charged towards the black panthers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As she observed the situation, Bibi spoke to Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStudent Jaemin. \u00a0We can go home after we uproot that tree.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soolgi and the idol group members had followed behind Jaemin. \u00a0They waited with their mouth shut. If they acted out of turn like Joonsung, they didn't know what she would do to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and Haesol was standing in a spacious training ground, and they were looking towards Namsan with worried eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think that'll fall?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think so.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Namsan tower had been destroyed during the Dungeon Shock. It had been rebuilt recently, since it was considered to be the symbol of Seoul. \u00a0However, it seemed the tower will be destroyed once again by the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo pointed with his finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think you can Tame that one?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026it will be very difficult.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How would she be able to Tame the spirit of such a large Dragon? At a glance, she knew it was impossible. However, she thought she would be able to subvert couple of the Wyverns hanging around the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. \u00a0We'll be at a disadvantage in an air warfare... \u00a0What will we do if they come towards us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo's worries were well founded. \u00a0Three fighter jets had appeared to bomb it, yet the Dragon had blocked the attack easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The missile attack couldn't get through the barrier formed by the Dragon, and the fighter jets were disintegrated when the Dragon's Breath was shot towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hoohng. Mere Dragons aren't a problem for us.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh! As expected of the Knights.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo's eyes twinkled at Ramson's manly words. \u00a0Three Death Knights had returned to Alandal, and the rest was hunting down the monsters in Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wouldn't be a problem if the monsters didn't mobilize until Woojin arrived. \u00a0However, if they do start to move, Sunggoo, Haesol, the three Death Knights and the Holy Maiden would have to combine their strength to defend Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For now, all they could do was wish for Woojin and the rest of the Death Knights to come as soon as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it really ok to put only Bibi and Dolsae in a single team?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden replied to Sunggoo's worried words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don't have to worry about them. The Titan of Destruction and the Illusion Witch is enough.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm. Is that so? \u00a0Still, what if a Dimensional lord came out of the Break? \u00a0Doesn't it mean monsters of the same caliber as the Dragon might be around?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo pointed towards the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't we have to send the Knights to catch monsters of that caliber?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody let out a gentle laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we are measuring the fighting power of a single entity, the strongest amongst the Undead Army is the Titan of Destruction.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo looked at Ramson with puzzled eyes. Sunggoo and Haesol had received instruction for combat from the Death Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had experienced their overwhelming fighting power with his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was Dolsae really that strong? He hadn't seen Dolsae train or do anything of the sort. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if Melody's words weren't wrong, Ramson broke his silence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We need that rock to catch the Dragon.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo shrugged his shoulders. \u00a0Woojin's familiar were all very powerful, but he never realized Dolsae was that strong. No, he knew Dolsae was strong, but he had thought Dolsae was mainly used to take out the small fries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Titan of Destruction is always the vanguard of the Undead Army.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody shuddered when she remembered the times she had faced it as an enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. I never knew.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it because the hunts he accompanied were too easy for Dolsae? \u00a0If he thought about it, the only time he saw Dolsae in action was when it stopped the Dungeon Break in the US by itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had always taken down the Boss, so Sunggoo had thought Dolsae was exclusively used for clearing out the small fries....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? Those bastard looks like they are getting ready to move?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wyverns were gathered around Namsan, and they were flying in formation. Sunggoo tried to calm his worried heart as he saw the Wyverns mobilize in a serious manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe president has to come back quickly\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh Immortal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesoo and Melody also wished Woojin would come back quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black parking lot had become much darker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The parking lot was covered with blood and the corpses of the black panthers. \u00a0There was a strong metallic smell of blood in the air. \u00a0Jupia didn't move an inch until all of his underlings were killed. \u00a0If he possessed Energy, he would be able to summon all of them once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The important fact was that his enemy was tired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It seems you are almost spent.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia languidly got up. \u00a0He wasn't like his sibling. He was able to fight rationally. He had decided to use his Energy to make his opponent tired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gee-gee-geek, ggeek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A very strident sound was heard every time Dolsae moved its body. \u00a0Some of the gas tanks had been lit by fire, so it wouldn't be wrong to call Dolsae a Fire Golem right now. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was true that Dolsae was moving more deliberately than before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hweeeeek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia's big body flew through the air as it pounced on Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everytime Jupia's front paws were swung the metal plate of a car was ripped away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ahng! Ggwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia lowered its head to avoid the fist swung by Dolsae, and Jupia immediately executed a headbutt. Unlike how he spoke, Jupia's battle style was straightforward and bestial.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-roo-roo.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae let out a roar as he made a desperate effort, but Jupia's power was too strong. \u00a0Moreover, Jupia was so fast that Dolsae couldn't even graze his opponent. \u00a0The problem was speed. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The difference in power was quite apparent to the people watching the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oohk. What should we do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are dead.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Dolsae died, then they were dead. For some unknown reason, the Roused and army weren't coming to save them. \u00a0There was no sign of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. \u00a0He should have formed his body with foreign cars.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man mumbled to himself as he watched Dolsae's body being torn apart so easily. \u00a0Jaemin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cButler Bibi. \u00a0Is there anything we can do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0Of course, why wouldn\u2019t there be?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bib still had a relaxed expression on her face. \u00a0This made Jaemin's worry ratchet down a notch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know why our cute Dolsae-jjing is nicknamed the Titan of Destruction?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBecause he is big?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's true, but why do you think the Destruction part stuck?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. I have no idea.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How would Jaemin know? \u00a0He wasn't even from Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh-heh. \u00a0Dolsae-jjing is very scary when he gets angry. \u00a0Do you know why I'm teamed up with him?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I'm not sure?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf Dolsae-jjing gets angry, I'm here to stop him.

That cat is in real trouble now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Bibi's words ended, a sound of a large explosion rang out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the two combatants were exchanging fierce blows with each other, Dolsae's body suddenly exploded, and the pieces of his body flew everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia laughed as only Dolsae's Heart was left floating in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Is he giving up?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those words were incompatible with the familiars of the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeeng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Golem's Heart spun at high speeds, and it started sucking up all the blood in the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shweeeee. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The red blood rose into the air, and it spun like a whirlwind as it clumped together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-roo-rook. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With the Golem's heart at its center, the blood coalesced to form a single doll. \u00a0It was much too small to think of it as Dolsae. \u00a0It was about 2 meters tall, and it had a humanoid shape.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a limit on how big it could get using the blood available in the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it didn't matter. \u00a0He would grow his body by spilling the blood of his enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ggoo-uhhhhhhh!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia narrowed his eyes as he felt a grave danger at Dolsae's roar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You aren't the only one, who can transform.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia's body started to shake. \u00a0His body crumpled in on itself. \u00a0His body was getting smaller, and a strange heat was released by his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His back legs straightened, and his paws became hands. \u00a0His nails lengthened, and his tail hardened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lycanthrope. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had turned into a half feline and half human form. \u00a0His fighting ability had increased significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Blood ball.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia started running. \u00a0His speed was much faster than before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahng. \u00a0Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, the transformed Dolsae was on a different dimension. \u00a0Jupia had never seen anything move that fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahng, ggwahng, gwah-ahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Consecutive punches landed on Jupia's face. Jupia was barely able to keep consciousness as he stabbed with his claws. \u00a0However, the claws passed through Dolsae's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the blood hardened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Oohk?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His hand and claws had entered Dolsae's body, and it was stuck now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lump didn't have eyes, nose or mouth. \u00a0However, he saw it smile. Jupia was sure he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahng, gwhang!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae's fist continued to plant itself on Jupia's face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[W...wait a\u2026.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How can there be such an unreasonable bastard?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to destroy the Golem's Heart. \u00a0His left hand was trapped, so he used the claws on his right hand to stab where the heart should be.. \u00a0However, he didn't encounter any resistance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He moved his heart.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia let out a groan when both his hands became trapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae laughed as he started headbutting Jupia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked like a roly-poly toy as he kept falling backwards and then he was tilted back up again. \u00a0His head kept folding backwards like a punching machine until Jupia's neck broke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jupia let out a gray light as his body dissipated. \u00a0Dolsae let out a roar when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-roo-roo.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to rip apart his enemies then drink their blood. \u00a0Blood. \u00a0He needed blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed living beings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae's gaze turned towards Jaemin and the survivors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ggoo-roo-rook.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koong! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae was about to charge as if he had found his preys. \u00a0Everyone tensed. \u00a0He couldn't discern who\u2019s an ally or an enemy? \u00a0Bibi got in the way of Dolsae, who was charging forward with stupendous force.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

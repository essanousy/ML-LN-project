I\u2019m over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next day morning Sunnggoo was waiting in front of Woojin\u2019s house on the appointed time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho\u2019s car is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is my mother\u2019s car. She doesn\u2019t use it a lot, so I usually use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head as he looked at the white Matiz. I guess it was better than not having a car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are the windows open?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe AC is broken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was almost the end of summer, so the morning was a bit chillly. It didn\u2019t matter if they didn\u2019t have an AC.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tilted his head in confusion when he saw Sunggoo, who was putting on his seatbelt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s your first day as a servant, so why are you in such a good mood?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Isn\u2019t there different degrees of being a servant?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou said we are going to a 3 star Dungeon today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat comes out over there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRakwi comes out.\u201d (TLN: bakwi is cockroach in korean. The author basically switch b with an r)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rakwis were basically large cockroaches. That\u2019s it. It wasn\u2019t as if the drop rate for the bloodstones were any better, but there was a large population of this monster in this dungeon. This is why this Dungeon contained a lot of bloodstones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo gave a briefing about the Dungeon, while he drove.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Maebong Staion\u2019s third exit Dungeon has a maximum limit of 10 party members, and the entrance fee is $300.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s damn expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one person wanted to use the Dungeon, then one would have to pay $3,000 for the entrance fee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Moreover, there are a lot of them, and the Return Stone doesn\u2019t drop until all of the Rakwis are killed. Normally, it takes around 2 hours to attack this Dungeon. If one is unlucky, it takes 3 hours.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou found the Dungeon to my exact requirement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Maebong Station\u2019s third exit was chosen as their next target, but it wasn\u2019t Sunggoo\u2019s idea. Woojin ordered him to find a Dungeon that fit a single criteria.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous monsters had to be summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was told to search for a Dungeon based on the monster regeneration rate instead of profit. He felt doubt, but he had worked hard to find it. Amongst all of the 3 star Dungeons, this place regenerated the most monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were way less cars on the road compared to Woojin\u2019s memory. It reminded him of the traffic he saw on the holidays. As expected, a parking lot was provided near the vicinity of the subway station. (TLN: Koreans don\u2019t get a lot of vacations, so they all head out to beach/mountain on the holidays. Therefore, you see less traffic in the city during holidays.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The biggest change that had happened to Seoul in the past 5 years was the subway stations. It used to be a method of travel one used to get to work, but now it became a place of work. Dungeon businesses brought in the biggest revenue for Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven the parking fee is damn expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo laughed lightly when he heard Woojin\u2019s complaint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think you\u2019ll be very surprised once you balance your account after attacking this Dungeon. There is a vast difference between a 2 star and a 3 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, we\u2019ll know once we get there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Money was important to Woojin. He needed a big house, so he could live with his family. At the very least, he wanted to be able to sleep in a different room where he could fall asleep in a defenseless state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a Dungeon where the profit was great, so the entrance fee was expensive, and there were many people in queue. One could only make appointments for 4 star Dungeons or higher.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They also restricted the Roused, who were below Rank D, from even attempting the 4 star Dungeon. A mule like Sunggoo could probably squeeze in, but a Rank D Roused won\u2019t even be able to become a Leader for a party when attempting a 4 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until the 3 star Dungeons, there were no restriction. One didn\u2019t need to make an appointment. The order of the Dungeon attempt was basically a first come, first served basis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the queue time was longer compared to the time it took to complete 1 star or 2 star Dungeons. However, it wasn\u2019t so for this 3 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had come early in the morning, so there were only two teams in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if everyone took 2 hours, they would have to wait 4 hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim should go rest in a cafe then return later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the main duty of a manager was staying in line as a proxy. Woojin looked around the surrounding, and he could see cafes and other convenient facilities. It made him doubt whether the development area around a subway station was really dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the resident area moved farther away, but the commercial facilities seemed more developed here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Dungeon was always open. The Roused converged here 24/7 to attack the Dungeon. Of course, a location where a lot of people gathered would flourish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I\u2019ll wait with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m moved, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s flattery came out almost automatically. He had also studied on his own, so he could talk continuously about what he knew about the Roused, their society, and the different types of Dungeons. He didn\u2019t want Woojin to get bored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pew, Pew, Pangya!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin found out why the Crazy Red was a popular smart phone amongst the Roused. The sturdiness of its build didn\u2019t even need to be explained. It was also able to run for half a month without one needing to charge it. The insane battery allowed one not to be bored during the down times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin waited 5 hours to enter the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin paid $12,000. He paid the cost for using the Dungeon for 4 hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo looked at Woojin, and he energetically gave a fighting pose. A stocky guy like him was doing all he can to act cute, and it made him look at Sunggoo with pity now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Fighting!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have to go too, you dork.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI, I have to?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho\u2019s going to excavate the bloodstones?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m moved, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo let out a soulless exclamation, then he quickly followed behind Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought you purposely suggested to become my servant, so you could follow me around. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When there was no answer, Woojin turned to look at him. Sunggoo had an expression of guilt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2026you are quite perceptive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed flattery came naturally to him now. Woojin smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDude. Do it in moderation. Moreover, just call me hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Life was a battle field.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was at fault for overreacting and adding the extra zeros to the $4,000. Woojin didn\u2019t feel the need to take back what he had offered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t Sunggoo\u2019s parent or guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Free money was free money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, if he still insisted on becoming his underling, he would repay him back the money he lost. As a Necromancer who had reached the pinnacle, Woojin had at least that much generosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe a good guide. Do my biddings well. I\u2019m not going to work you without giving any compensations. After we finish this Dungeon, you can have 10% of the profit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a 9:1 ratio. It was a unreasonable number, but Sunggoo\u2019s face was filled with joy. For him, the very act of attempting a 3 star Dungeon was difficult. Even if it was only 10%, it would still be more than he could make from attacking 1 Star Dungeons several times. He would be able to get his hand on a large sum of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you very much, hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo really felt thankful towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin seemed to prefer solo play, but it seemed he would be able to enter with him. He would be able to be carried by Woojin as his manager. He\u2019ll be able to experience a 3 star Dungeon and use his ability in relative safety.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He probably be able to train and practice his ability. It might even evolve. Sunggoo was aiming to become a high ranked Roused, so this was a opportunity of a lifetime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin knew all about this yet he acted like he had been fooled, so Sunggoo felt thankful towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go. Time is gold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was thankful towards Sunggoo, who had become a servant for just $4,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level up!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The moment Woojin gained another level he shook his head in a fierce manner</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are frighteningly a lot of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The floor was jam-packed with Rakwi corpses. These bastards barreled towards any life form in their vicinity. They had the tendency of using their number as an advantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could build a solid defense against them or one could kill them faster than they could gather. These were the only methods of dealing with them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s method was to use both.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou dare use your number against me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKekeke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He fought number with number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was surrounded by 19 Skeleton Soldiers. This was possible, because every time he leveled up he put all his Stat Points into Control.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin used his Search magic. When he felt magic within the Rakwi\u2019s corpses, he sprayed red paint on them. There were so many of them that it took a lot of time to tag them with paint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he was doing this, Sunggoo came down the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-him! I\u2019ve excavated them all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was hauling a bag as he descended, and he was soaked in sweat. He hadn\u2019t even used a single fireball since he had entered the Dungeon. The only thing he did was to excavate the bloodstones from the field of corpses left behind by Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin picked out which monsters had bloodstones, so he didn\u2019t have to open up an empty corpse. However, there were still too many of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s hunting speed was so fast that Sunggoo fell behind even though he only had to extract the bloodstones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. You\u2019ve done well. Now keep up the good work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggo saw the terrible spectacle created by Woojin on the last floor. He sucked in a sharp breath. At a glance, he could see couple hundred corpses. Amongst all of them, there were over 60 corpses tagged with spray paint.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How\u2026how much money is this?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The drop rate couldn\u2019t be compared to the 2 star Dungeons. Sunggoo put down the full bag, then he took out a new bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. I guess I\u2019ll take a little break.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin freed himself from the field of corpses, then he sat on a bench.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Return Stone would come out from the body of the last Rakwi he killed. While Sunggoo excavated the bloodstones, he sat on one side as he opened his character window. He put all the bonus points he earned from the level-ups to Control.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The number reached 24. He could summon 5 additional Skeleton Soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019m level 6 now.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked through all the skills he could learn at lvl 6. He was able to learn low ranked attack spells like making a small flame or a fist made out of water. Everything else had a class restriction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin purchased all the important magics under the low ranked magic. The cost was between 10 to 30 Achievement Points each. These weak magics were progressively unusable against the monsters he would face, but these magics weren\u2019t only used in hunting monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had many practical uses in real life, so he purchased and learned them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This cost 200 points.\u2019</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Skeleton Magician Summon&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Restriction : Level 10, Magic 20]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Corpses or bones are used as sacrifice to summon a [Strength 5 Agility 5 Health 5 Magic 5] Skeleton Magician. Range is increased when strength increases. Shooting Rate is increased when Agility increases. Attack power is increased as Magic is increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic Consumption : 1, Required Control : 1</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every Rakwi gave him 3 Achievement Points. There were too many Rakwis, so he had a lot of Achievement Points to spare. He was able to buy Skill Books, but he couldn\u2019t learn it since they had level restrictions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From level 1 to level 9, one didn\u2019t have a class. The low ranked skills learned during this period didn\u2019t have any class restrictions, and most of them could be purchased with relatively low Achievement Points. However, once one reaches level 10, one would develop a class, and most of the Skills became expensive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Now that I think about it I should work on my Stats a little bit.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were couple ways to raise one\u2019s Stat. When one level up, one gets bonus stats, and as the name indicates it was a bonus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two other methods if one excluded the level up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">First method was to train repeatedly to increase one\u2019s stat. However, this method wasn\u2019t used often since the increase was minimal compared to the time spent. If one did it without having much expectation, then one could increase one stat at a time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The second method was to use drugs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were reinforcement drugs that were able to give a temporary stat boost, but there were also magic medicines that could permanently increase certain stats.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned as he searched through the Achievement Point Store. There were reinforcement drugs that gave +1 stat points, but they cost 2000 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was too expensive for him to purchase it for consumption. However, it wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t gain anything.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Recipe \u2013 Orc Tendon Soup&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ingredient : Orc Tendon 3, Drabbit Tail 5, Rat fang 2</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Effect : Strength + 2</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought he did pretty well by using 150 of his Achievement points to purchase this recipe. The composition method was simple. He just had to used his advanced skill, Combination Box.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is all done, hyung-nim. I also found the Return Stone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he looked at the fat bags filled with bloodstones. At the very least, there were about 5 times more bloodstones compared to the previous 2 star Dungeon. Also, didn\u2019t Sunggoo say the bloodstones became denser and more expensive as the Dungeon\u2019s rank increased?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow many minutes had passed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s been 27 minutes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stood up as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll run it 7 more times. Hurry up, and gather everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Soldiers approached them, and they picked up the bags. Woojin and Sunggoo wanted to save time, so they practically ran towards the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The public employee assigned to this place by the Dungeon Management Bureau was surprised when they came out much earlier than expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When two Rank F Roused attempted the 3 star Dungeon that had a maximum capacity of 10 party members, he thought their actions were ill advised. However, it seemed he was wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if you\u2026you cleared it before the time ran out, we won\u2019t refund the entrance fee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked at the public employee\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to keep attempting the Dungeon within the time limit, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t have time, so don\u2019t ask me any questions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo grabbed the bags then they ran towards the Bloodstone exchange store. They converted it all to cash.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">$54,300.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used simple calculations to determine he could earn almost $400,000 in a day. Sunggoo would receive 10% of that figure, so he had an expression of disbelief on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018$5,430.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the money he had earned in 30 minutes. If one joined a full normal party attacking a 3 star Dungeon, 1 share of the profit would be equivalent to this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Sunggoo wasn\u2019t skill enough to attempt a 3 star or even a 2 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJ\u2026jackpot, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are calling me hyung-nim again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim is too great. I wouldn\u2019t dare call you hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked at his silly words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe still have 7 runs left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they went in 7 more times, then his share would be around $40,000. He had diligently went around 1 star Dungeons for 2 whole month yet he only made $30,000. Now he would make $40,000 in a day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and Woojin quickly ran towards the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Thank you~)</span></p><br/><p>A tiring battle ensued.</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease quit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can\u2019t quit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to earn any money. I\u2019m making a lot of money now. This is the money I earned in half a day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened his bank app, then he show his mother his account statement. However, she wouldn\u2019t budge an inch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou came back after 5 years yet how could a mother thrust you back into such a deadly situation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen do you want me continue to live by receiving allowance from you? Do you want me to stay unemployed for the rest of my life, and live off the money you struggled to earn?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin hit his chest as if he was frustrated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll make a lot of money. I\u2019ll make enough that mother won\u2019t have to worry about money ever again. Mother and Sooah is my responsibility now. I\u2019ve returned, so I\u2019m the head of this family.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWoo, Woojin. You\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother couldn\u2019t say anything. She just let her tears flow. The word, \u2018head of the family\u2019, swirled around her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her oldest son had gone missing and even her husband had died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The daughter she had late in life was only 2 years old, and she had always been a stay-at-home mom. Yet she had to live on with such a heavy burden. It wasn\u2019t apt to say she had lived, but she had just held out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tightly hugged his mother as a river of tears flowed out of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the tear-filled mother and son could have a conversation, the owner of the restaurant gave a fake cough. She was Soongmi\u2019s mother, Kim-soonohk. If it was up to her, she would have yelled at them for making a spectacle at someone else\u2019s store. However, her daughter Soongmi was giving her a signal. So she looked on without doing anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh-oom. I don\u2019t want to say something like this, but how can you just quit your job like this? I know what your situation is like, but you should have a conscious. You know our store is busy, so work until I can hire someone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s face stiffened at Kim-soonohk\u2019s words. He wanted his mother to immediately quit this arduous kitchen work, but his mother\u2019s answer was faster than his.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Even if I do quit, a responsible person can\u2019t act that way. This isn\u2019t about money, so don\u2019t say anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghh. Then please quit this place within a week. Sooah needs mother more than me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was only a 7 year old pre-schooler. She had always felt very sorry towards Sooah, so his sister might have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Husband. Our Woojin\u2026\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t know what skills he had acquired, but her son had suddenly showed up after 5 years. He said he would go away to prepare for the school qualification exam, but he came back after he earned a lot of money. For someone who worked at a restaurant, the money was quite the windfall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her tears wouldn\u2019t stop falling as she thought about her past arduous days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMother. Hoo-hook. This is so sad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soongmi also started crying, so Kim-soonohk passed her a handkerchief. She had never seen her daughter act this way, so she was taken aback. Even though Soongmi was her daughter, she wasn\u2019t a kind girl, and she could be a bit of a bitch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normally, her daughter would call the kitchen lady auntie, then she would treat her with a bad temper. For some reason, her daughter was acting like a chaste and modest woman today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After crying for a long while, Lee-soogyong reigned in her emotions, then she started to plead towards her boss, Kim-soonohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think I could get off work early today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t let you off, then just quit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s rejoinder, Kim-soonohk made a sound of indecision. However, in the end, she had no choice, but to allow it. It made a big difference for a single person to be missing from a busy restaurant, but she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be a bigger trouble if she didn\u2019t show up starting tomorrow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, mother. Please go in first. Have a nice time with big brother Woojin..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO..okay, Ms Soongmi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyung was bewildered by the restaurant owner\u2019s daughter Soongmi. She was responding in an amiable way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBig brother. Be safe! I\u2019ll see you again next time. Oh yeah. Here is my phone number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-soongmi snatched Woojin\u2019s phone away as if she was stealing it. Then she put in her number to call her phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. Have a nice day, mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After receiving her goodbye, Woojin and Lee-soogyong left the restaurant. Soon the dinner crowd will rush in, but she didn\u2019t feel like working on a day like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. Where are we going, mom?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was dragged by Lee-soogyong\u2019s hand towards a different direction from their house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ll know once you get there. Any ways, what kind of relationship do you have with Ms Soongmi?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, her? She used to be my junior in school. Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother didn\u2019t speak for a long time, then she suddenly stopped walking. She turned around to look straight at Woojin, and he could see traces of worry on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t plan on involving myself in my son\u2019s love life, but if you bring a bitch like her, mother will be against it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked at his mother\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t have any interest in her. I was wondering what you wanted to say to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The girl had given him a lot of stuff during Valentines day, but for him, 20 years had already passed. The only thing he remembered was her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the time, he didn\u2019t have any feelings toward her, so he doubted he would develop any feelings for her now. Moreover, he could imagine how she had treated his mother by her reaction. So he was disgusted by her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ll know once we arrive there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soongyong took her son, Kang-woojin, to a newly built apartment not too far from their home. The Hammer guild built their headquarters in the devastated region, and they had made a lot of progress there. However, a massive park was also built to one side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyung made her son buy a bottle of alcohol from a convenience store near the park\u2019s entrance. Then she bought a single chrysanthemum flower from the flower shop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They walked through a secluded path inside the park, and they arrived in front of a large monument located at the center of the park.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Sahdahng Station\u2019s Casualty Monument&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several hundred thousand people died during the Dungeon Shock. A lot more people died in the subsequent Dungeon Breaks, but if one had to pick the the day when the most deaths had occurred, it was the day of the Dungeon Shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had disappeared on that day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On that day, everyone who had used the subway system had died. A lot of parks were built near the stations since it was destroyed by the subsequent Dungeon Breaks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wordlessly placed the flower in front of the monument then he poured out the alcohol. He kowtowed with a heavy heart. Lee-soogyong could only silently watch him as she shed her tears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHusband. Our Woojin has returned. Our Woojin\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin finished his kowtow then he hugged his mother tightly. His mother couldn\u2019t\u2019 control her emotions, so she cried endlessy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Father\u2026\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin started thinking about his father, and his emotions turned melancholy. He hadn\u2019t had the time to spare since his mother had been struggling by herself, but he hadn\u2019t forgotten about his father.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin missed his father. However, the ache he felt towards his mother and Sooah was larger. Maybe, the past 20 years had desensitized Woojin from death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease tell me now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere and what have you been up to during that time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw his mother\u2019s earnest face, Woojin struggled for a long time, but he decided to tell her the truth. However, he was mindful of the shock his mother would receive, so he tried to downplay the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had overcome countless near death experiences, and his hands snatched away countless lives as he struggled fiercely to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been countless people afraid of him, and their gazes had been filled with fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want his mother to look at him like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, mmm. I think it was caused by the Dungeon Shock. I was summoned to a planet named Alphen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If everything was like before, she wouldn\u2019t have believed him. However, the world had gone through a change, and the impossible had become possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. What did you do over there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How should he explain this? Woojin thought about it, and he opened his mouth after he ordered his thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too dangerous. Ah. It was like a game . I leveled up some then I diligently hunted. I ordered around my summoned beings and I even participated in wars. However, mother shouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. I used my summoned beings, so I just watched from far away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s words, his mother\u2019s expression stiffened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHai-eego.(TLN:SFX, I guess it is like saying OMG) I was so worried about you , but you came back after playing some game?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Huh? That\u2019s not it.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

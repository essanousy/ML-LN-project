He saw the enormous octopus named Dread, and the Golden Dragon Rajakui.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he was sure that the previous Dungeon Breaks in Seoul was directed by Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis guy is worse than Ibrit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw a lot of Dimensional lords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were acting as middleman for controlling the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The death of great lord Iello wouldn\u2019t stop all of this. \u00a0Woojin would also have to kill the several dozen Dimensional lords under Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These beings were all gathered in Seoul, and they were making preparations. \u00a0It was obvious as to whom they were waiting for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were gunning for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had all their ducks in a row to face him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a

reach level 99 was all present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could this be words of a person, who should be worried?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he no longer had to travel to various locations to hunt. \u00a0This would make his task less laborious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, Jaemin was going all out as he continued the Dimensional Battles. \u00a0Thanks to Jaemin, he was gaining a lot of Dimensional Points. \u00a0Now his return to Seoul would allow him to increase his Achievement Points. \u00a0He\u2019ll be able to gain a massive amount of

\u00a0By his side, the Death Knights and Lich Jaenis was making preparations as they waited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The end is near.]</span></p><br/><p><span

before he headed towards the Blood Dragon. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it came down to it, the Dragon wasn\u2019t able to grant a wish, yet it kept asking the question. \u00a0It was his Dragon, who suffered under dementia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was Golem Dolsae, who had turned itself into blood for the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo whatever the hell you want. \u00a0Run amok to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It\u2019ll be my

standby. \u00a0They were readied just in case.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t going to be used in battle. \u00a0The king had ordered all of them to protect the fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to monopolize the EXP, but he also wanted to prepare for a possibility for a sneak attack. \u00a0Sooah had to be protected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat bastard is coming.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello was at the ice palace located at the

several Dimensional lords and the monsters capable of flight rose into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-gwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Gold Dragon and the Blood Dragon

to make up for the other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll do it by killing him\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span

hands as they stacked. \u00a0He formed an enormous saw blade sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello pushed off the floor of the ice palace, and the body Iello shot up into the sky like a needle in flight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggah-ah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin changed his Warrior\u2019s Weapon into a sword, and he blocked Iello\u2019s attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, gwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each attacks were increasing in strength, and the shockwaves started to ring out into the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">King of the Dead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knight respected their King more than any other being in existence. \u00a0This was why they went past Woojin to charge into the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cB...bastards!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho pushed both his

as he revealed his grotesque tusks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[My King has arrived.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The royal procession was occurring, so a march had to be present.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Scream louder for him!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous blade of the axe sliced open his

dance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fragments of ice was sent towards him like a hailstorm, and it impacted on his defense. \u00a0It was more annoying than the endless swords strikes flying towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are pretty good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello\u2019s transparent face moved at Woojin\u2019s invidious

was a mortal combat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one gained a Dimensional Fragment, one could be revived after time passed. \u00a0It would be enough. \u00a0Everything will end, and

\u00a0Did you forget who I am?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Toppler\u2019s baffled voice, the Gate Guard shook his head from side to side in a firm manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho doesn't know about Dr. Toppler?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I want you to immediately open the Gate. \u00a0Our future and lives depends on me solving this

Council. \u00a0The walls were like windows of a green house. \u00a0It was transparent. \u00a0Toppler could see bright stars across the ceiling..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the closest star.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a dying black planet, and the sight made his heart feel more desperate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldiers guarding the Council chamber became nervous when he showed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOpen immediately!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou need permission to enter\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pshh-oong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the soldiers could protest again, Toppler opened the door. \u00a0\u00a0He walked towards the Council chamber where he could find the council members. \u00a0Twelve council members were sitting in a circle. \u00a0They welcomed the professor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease allow me to use the space shuttle.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Toppler\u2019s determined voice, an old council member spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be

sentence. \u00a0A middle aged woman with a sharp face spoke. \u00a0She didn\u2019t hide her anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou dared to scheme such dangerous plans without our

man with red hair sat in middle seat. \u00a0He slammed his hand on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeaker Shelt\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour theory has merit, but the risk is too high.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, it was true.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had a plan, but he hadn\u2019t received permission to carry it out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Professor Toppler had secretly attempted to carry his plan. \u00a0He had attempted to contact Kahng-woojin away from the eyes of the Council members, because they opposed his plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is possible to carry out this plan! \u00a0There is no point in supporting the Recovery Admin. \u00a0We are just wasting our time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Professor Toppler spoke with fire, Speaker Shelt tried to convince him with a calm voice. \u00a0Toppler\u2019s ability was undeniable, but his actions tended to be extreme at times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can shore up the shortcomings in the professor\u2019s plan, and we can implement it next time. \u00a0I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be too late to do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Professor Toppler\u2019s face was filled with despair at the Speaker\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did the Moon World have a future? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their resources were almost depleted, and they couldn\u2019t survive under their own efforts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fear was preventing them from stepping forward, and they might die in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe might not have another chance if we don\u2019t act right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe professor\u2019s rash actions had already caused a change.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin hadn\u2019t acquired all the keys, yet he had met Iello. \u00a0The result of this meeting couldn\u2019t be predicted, so everyone in the Council had their nerves on edge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFor a short amount of time, let us place the professor in isolation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the Speaker\u2019s declaration, the soldiers grabbed both of Toppler\u2019s arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t a threat. \u00a0This is an opportunity.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust because the horse is exhausted doesn\u2019t mean we have to climb atop a lion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wanted to be rescued\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was still the Moon World\u2019s only hope. \u00a0\u00a0A despairing Toppler was dragged away, and the Speaker spoke into the microphone to finalize the decision made by the council.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease send Leone\u2019s ship to earth. \u00a0Please help Iello achieve victory.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The large number of Reset was proof. \u00a0They had to do as they always

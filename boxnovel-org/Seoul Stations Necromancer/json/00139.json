The Wyverns were using Namsan as a base. \u00a0The Wyverns were spread wide across the sky, and they had started an indiscriminate hunt. \u00a0Unfortunately, the sky wasn't the only place with monsters. \u00a0There were several times more monsters gathered on the ground. \u00a0Every time the Dragon let out a rough roar, the monsters spread outwards with Namsan as the center. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldiers had formed a rough battle line, while the monsters had been gathering. \u00a0The army started their bombardment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean what should we do. \u00a0We do what what we can.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo's word allowed Haesol to control her feelings. He usually looked few cards short of a full desk, and at times, he looked like a simpleton. \u00a0However, when an urgent situation like this cropped up, Sunggoo's words had a profound effect on her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't simple, because he was lacking in terms of intelligence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been trained to be like this by Woojin. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe just have to block the monsters that come here. We just have to do as much as we can, and hyung-nim will be here by then.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo raised his sword, which had been gifted to him by Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His sword was covered with flame. \u00a0No, his weapon weapon wasn't the only thing covered in flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo's entire body was swept up by fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoly Maiden. If I'm about to die, please save me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026leave it to me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could entrust his life to her. \u00a0The ever reliable lifeline of Woojin wasn't present, so the only person he could trust was the Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be heading out first.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Man of Flame Hong-sunggoo charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His battle style wasn't conducive to fighting with allies. \u00a0He was most effective when he burrowed into the enemy line and fight. \u00a0The flame he spread didn't differentiate between enemies and allies. He might unnecessarily harm his allies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, he was a specialized Roused in drawing aggro from a large group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe should get ready too.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol readied her Tamed Monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roohk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ehhhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She mobilized the Black Panther Jackson, the Knife-beak Crows, Iron Armored Alligator, and other monsters. There were Alandal emblem printed on their body, so everyone could differentiate them from the normal monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's show them our fighting spirit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol was nicknamed the Safari Owner. She would show today that her Tamed Monsters weren't just ornaments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters took their place with high spirits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[My soldiers!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The three Death Knights summoned the Skeleton Soldiers under their command. \u00a0They had already reached level 50, and they were allowed 10 soldiers per level increase. \u00a0Each Death Knight had 500 Skeleton Soldiers under them, so in a flash, a large army of 1,500 suddenly \u00a0appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Keh-keh-keh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a bizarre cry, the Skeleton Warriors appeared. As if they had choreographed their actions beforehand, they started to get into formation as they avoided getting close to the Holy Maiden. \u00a0The Holy Maiden realized what was going on, so she retreated to the back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll take care of the wounded.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was of no help to the Undead monsters. She could only work synergistically with Sunggoo and Haesol. \u00a0However, the two of them were used to fighting in a reckless style, so they didn't even think about receiving a Buff from her. \u00a0They had immediately charged into the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Charge!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Maintain the battle line!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton army divided it self. \u00a0A portion of the army charged forward, and the rest maintained their rear ranks. Sunggoo had returned after causing mayhem, and he had to hold the location until the Skeleton army could reorganize.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk. \u00a0Kwah-kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was like a fish that had found water. \u00a0He was everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every one of his move caused a trail of fire, and the buildings exploded and burned as he swung his flame sword.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, it wasn\u2019t as if he was attacking without any plan or thought.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo-roohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He raised walls of fire in between buildings, and he skillfully changed the routes taken by the monsters. \u00a0He was restricting the battlefield, so the Skeleton units could cope with the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oooooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His magic was being quickly expended, so Sunggoo let out a deep breath. His breath was full of hot air. The monsters were endless even though he kept burning them all. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he getting tired or nervous?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHue hue hue.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo laughed. \u00a0His body was shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't from fear. \u00a0His body was shaking with pure joy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis feels incredible.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn't been officially measured by the Roused Association, but he did get a rough estimate from within Alandal. \u00a0Sunggoo was of the 7th Circle. \u00a0He was judged to be a Rank AA Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't need to needlessly limit himself to Korea in this comparison. \u00a0There were only a handful of high Rank Roused like him in this entire world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had free control over fire when he waved his hand. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> His family had evacuated into Alandal's underground bunker. \u00a0He felt a lot of responsibilities on his shoulder, but the fact that he had enough power to protect them spurred him on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't powerless, and he didn't have to run away. \u00a0He had the power to fight, and he would boldly protect his family.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring it on!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwak-kwahng, kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time Sunggoo swung his Flame sword it caused an explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ehhhhhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a Wyvern dived towards Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-ah-aht! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo raised his hand towards the sky, and flame exploded forth from his palm. \u00a0The white hot flame turned the Wyvern into a blackened coal, but the corpse fell on Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOohk.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggo had been flattened by the enormous monster, and he tried to crawl out from beneath the corpse. In terms of strength, he was strengthened to the point where he was on par with the Physical Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-rah-cha!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stood up, and he pushed off the Wyvern's corpse to the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Countless number of monsters were attacking him, but Sunggoo's eyes were overflowing with confidence. He had soloed 6 star Dungeons quite often. \u00a0He had a limited amount of magical energy, but he learned a method to repartition his Stamina to his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They can all come at me. I'll be wildin on them.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With Sunggoo's active role in the battle, he had broken up the advanced party of monsters. \u00a0Now the Skeleton army under the command of the Death Knights took control. At strategic points in the battle, one could also see Haesol's Tamed Monsters doing their share of fighting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Dragon on the tower let out a roar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh-oh-oh! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound wasn't just loud. \u00a0It contained some unknown power within it, and the shockwave interfered with the army's communication devices. \u00a0Moreover, the Fear's effect didn't just end there. \u00a0It simultaneously gave Buffs to the monsters, and the monsters rampaged more crazily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters were acting crazy as they charged towards Sunggoo. \u00a0The number of monsters seemed to swell, and he briefly thought about retreating. His instincts were correct. The monsters had been unruly and disorganized, but the Golden Dragon\u2019s roar had directed all the monsters towards where Sunggoo was defending. \u00a0The Dragon had sent the monsters toward Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The human soldiers, who were defending from the other side, now had some room to breathe. \u00a0However, Sunggoo was losing his strength as the monsters launched a series of attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I need a little bit of time to recover.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A battlefield was different from clearing Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During his hunts, he could go to a safe place to recover his strengths. \u00a0However, he couldn't step back an inch in a war. \u00a0If he fell, his allies behind him would be in trouble. \u00a0Moreover, his family was in the rear, and they had put their trust in him....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What should I do?\u2019 \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Had he been too overconfident? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been squeezing out the last of his magic, and it was about to bottom out. A lot of thoughts were passing through Sunggoo's head, and his movement was becoming chaotic. \u00a0At that moment, a slab of concrete fell from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-ohhhhhhhh!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying an energetic roar, the pile of concrete rose up, and it started to clear out the monsters. Bibi appeared as she flew towards Sunggoo's side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0You did well, Sunggoo-jjing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBibi!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was very happy to see Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he turned around, he saw that the Skeleton Army had increased in number by several times. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The other Knights are here.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had received lesson from the Death Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew how strong they were, so he felt a sense of relief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs hyung-nim back?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster isn't here yet. \u00a0Go rest for a little bit.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I'll leave everything to you, Bibi.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the final stage of the battle. \u00a0There were still plenty of monster left. \u00a0Instead of getting in the way, it would be better for him to go recover his strength from the back then rejoin the battle later. Sunggoo quickly moved to the back, and he saw an exhausted Haesol lying down next to the Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome here. \u00a0I'll heal you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-ooh. Yes. \u00a0I'll be in your care.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were scratches on various parts of Sunggoo's body. \u00a0Moreover, he had squeezed out every ounce of his magic, so he felt nauseous and he had a headache. \u00a0When the Holy Maiden's hand touched him, his wounds started to regenerate quickly, and his magic stabilized.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt his magic recover much faster than his normal recovery rate. \u00a0He asked her a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen do you think hyung-nim will get here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe'll be here within 10 minutes.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden hadn't answered Sunggoo's question. \u00a0It was Do-jaemin. \u00a0He was late to join the party, since he had to take Soolgi to Alandal's evacuation shelter. \u00a0Jaemin was a vassal of the Dimensional lord, and he was one of the three people, who could speak to Woojin through his Will.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be precise, none of the three people were human. \u00a0There was a vampire, a small devil and a Death Knight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Student Jaemin.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's been a while.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha. How have you been?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm fine now.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. You have to keep up your spirits. \u00a0Who care if you aren't human? \u00a0Student Jaemin is handsome.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe sunglasses is really cool. \u00a0Ee-yah.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The conversation felt incongruous with the heated battle going on around them. \u00a0Sunggoo weirdly reminded him of Woojin, so Jaemin smirked. \u00a0Why did he feel so relaxed when he thought about Woojin?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, what should we do with all of them? \u00a0We'll defend our territory, but Seoul would become decimated.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't even comparable in scope to the previous Dungeon Breaks. \u00a0There were a lot more monsters here now. \u00a0However, the biggest problem was the fact that the monsters worked in an organized manner. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think Woojin-hyung can sweep them all away once he comes here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was being treated as he nodded his head at Jaemin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf hyung-nim gets here, he'll pull it off. \u00a0I heard not too long ago that he'll be able to summon his Lich soon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody flinched in surprise at Sunggoo's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a big fluctuation to the warm energy that had been helping him recover his magic. \u00a0Sunggoo turned to look at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? What's wrong?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0It's nothing.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour body is shaking a lot....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody's body was mildly shaking. \u00a0It had been a reflexive response, so Melody calmed her heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou said the Lord of Pestilence is coming...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Pestilence?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAmongst the Immortal's army, it was the nickname given to the infamous Lich Jaenis.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody shook as if she was vexed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat nickname is a bit....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know how many people died when the Black Death swept over Alphen?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">History had always been a weak subject for him, and this was regarding the history of a planet in a different dimension. \u00a0How would he know anything about it?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026how many?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTwenty million.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's a lot\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know how many people Lich Jaenis killed for the past 200 years?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was getting uncomfortable for him to ask her the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow many?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThirty million.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHis appearance was basically treated as a form of pestilence. It isn't that farfetched to call him the Lord of Pestilence.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo's face turned serious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What should he do? Hyung-nim said to learn magic from the Lich...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyung-nim had called such an incredible mass murderer his teacher, and he was currently Woojin's familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. \u00a0Jaenis-nim sounds like a more incredible person than hyung-nim.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden frowned when she heard Sunggoo's words. \u00a0Her fists were shaking. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know how many people died during the 20 year war fought against the Immortal's Undead army?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was afraid to ask when he saw the Holy Maiden's serious expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo started counting his fingers. \u00a0If the Lich killed 30 million in 200 years, 20 years should net....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThree million?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an incredible figure, but....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne hundred million.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. \u00a0Hyung-nim always exceeded his imagination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Apparently, there had been only three powers left on Alphen. \u00a0It was Trahnet, Alandal, and the allied coalition....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Woojin had been conducting a world war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT...that is a bit on the high side.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is only an estimate. \u00a0The actual number might be much higher.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had a complicated expression on his face. \u00a0He now understood why Melody acted like a scared dog, which was in front of a tiger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCatastrophe.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Immortal's steps itself was a catastrophe.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo's expression turned serious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyung-nim. \u00a0Is it okay for me to continue to revere you?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs someone talking smack about me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo.

(2)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwaaahk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous red body was flying through the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What is my name?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t remember previous name before it was named Yong Yong. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood was being pumped by the Golem\u2019s Heart, and it was a familiar sensation to the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ancient Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if the surging blood would allow it to regain its sense of self.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwaaahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon flew up into the sky at an incredible speed, and it barrelled into the Crow, who had been flying in circles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You are an odd one.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the Crow\u2019s short observation, Yong Yong opened its jaw in response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crow planned on dodging, but it couldn\u2019t. \u00a0After gaining blood and wings, Yong Yong\u2019s movements couldn\u2019t be compared to before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, his strength had become so strong that Yong Yong\u2019s teeth was able to plunge into Ibrit\u2019s wing. \u00a0It broke through the knife-like feathers and its leather.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a simple act of biting, yet the damage it dealt was beyond imagination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong gripped Ibrit\u2019s body with its claws. \u00a0While its teeth were lodged inside the wing, Yong Yong twisted its midsection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-ah-ahk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of destruction was loud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wing was ripped away as Ibrit writhed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-oong\uff0choo-ooh-oong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wouldn\u2019t have been strange if they plummeted to the ground, but Yong Yong\u2019s powerful beat of its wings kept both of them in midair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You brutish bastard!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong spat out the wing that filled its mouth, then it immediately bit Ibrit\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This doesn\u2019t make any sense.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit could smell a foul stench coming from the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The smell of blood gave Ibrit a headache. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black maw of Yong Yong had encased the whole head of Ibrit, and the Crows body started to burn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black body was on fire, and the flame ran along the feathers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wings were now made out of fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once the fire died down, Ibrit would \u00a0be able to regenerate itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heat was filling up Yong Yong\u2019s mouth, but there was nothing within its mouth that would be burned by the immense heat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-doo-doohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong bit off the the Crow\u2019s head, and he swallowed it alongside the scorching heat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-paht.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit\u2019s body turned into gray light as it disappeared, and the Blood Dragon roared into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your wish has come true.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once it finished what it had to do, Yong Yong started to descend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters, who had been madly charging forward, came to a halt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These beings had been blindly charging forward towards their target, but the battle ended when these monsters started worrying about their own lives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin saw the confused monsters, the tension left his body..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems Yong Yong has killed it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Once Ibrit was killed, these monsters were no longer an army. \u00a0The only thing left was for the monsters to be slaughtered by the Undead Army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if to confirm his conjecture, the Blood Dragon landed next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The waters of the Hahn river made waves, and islands of corpses started to form in some parts of the river. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had completed the Thrash\u2019s set, he might have been able to revive all the corpses here as Undeads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blood Dragon trampled over the corpses. \u00a0It asked a question as it brought its head towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked as he placed his hand on its horn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to fly with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He jumped on the back of Yong Yong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a powerful push off, the Dragon flew into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shelter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon and the employees could only monitor the outside situation through the enormous monitor and the radio. \u00a0They focused on the stations that were still able to broadcast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cThis is amazing. \u00a0The Prime Minister said before that all of Alandal\u2019s power resides within its king. \u00a0We had assumed it to be a lie. \u00a0However, before the situation could devolve into the worst possible situation, he saved Seoul.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. \u00a0I have no words to say.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. \u00a0Why did it take him so long to come back?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ah. \u00a0Dongmin-ah. \u00a0My baby\u2026 \u00a0Hoo-hook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some shouted with joy. \u00a0Others yelled out with words full of despair and complaint. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon and the employees quietly exited the shelter. \u00a0The surrounding was a mess as if a bomb had been dropped in their midst. \u00a0The soldiers and Roused were patrolling the streets as they took down the pockets of remaining monsters. \u00a0They also rescued the injured people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0Our king is incredible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt makes me proud to be a citizen of Alandal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The employees had been conscious of the people inside the shelter, but they started speaking their mind when they exited the shelter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Kahng-woojin went to Alphen, Alandal had received international pressure. \u00a0They had faced a lot of stress, because of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Koreans had been the strongest in their criticism. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They threw around words like traitors, deserters and even cowards towards the people of Alandal. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They kept trying to chip away and disparage Alandal. \u00a0The media scraped the bottom of the barrel in bringing out their criticisms, and it had caused the people of Alandal to become sick and tired of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? \u00a0L...look over there, chief!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woo-soonghoon looked towards the direction pointed out by the employee, he saw an enormous monster flying towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The being made the wide 10 lane road feel cramped</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monster landed, and it pushed through the cars on the street. \u00a0Everyone gulped at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It feels as if an apartment building is crawling towards us.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were frozen by the monster\u2019s overwhelming size and pressure. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Blood Dragon reached the group, it dropped its head towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin slid down the neck before he stopped on top of the Dragon\u2019s head. \u00a0The fear and tension on the faces of the employees receded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy king!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke stiffly as if nothing unusual was happening. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon quickly moved to comply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere should we get on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A single talon was larger than a person, and a regular person would have to climb up the Dragon as if one was climbing up a cliff. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin raised his hand, a soft magical energy surrounded the employees. \u00a0They were lifted onto the back of Yong Yong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh-uh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOohk. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was contrary to their expectations. \u00a0The smell of blood was thick, and the faces of several employees darkened as they gagged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin titled his head in confusion as he looked backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe haven\u2019t even lifted off, yet you guys are already suffering from motion sickness?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. \u00a0I...I guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon\u2019s face was also blue. \u00a0However, he let out an awkward laugh as he agreed with Woojin. \u00a0Woojin put up a barrier around them again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blood Dragon pushed off the ground, and while in the air, the employees didn\u2019t have time to worry about the smell of the blood. \u00a0The barrier was blocking the wind, but it was up to them to cling to the body of the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blood Dragon quickly left Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The news helicopter flew over the battlefield as the sound of the battlefield died down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKing Kahng-woojin of Alandal has left without giving any comments. \u00a0The army and the guilds are clearing the\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The camera panned the surrounding, and one could see beings that looked similar to humans amongst the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were people that looked too human to be called beings of a different race. \u00a0The camera also took in the sight of the enormous and unreal Symbol called the Thorn Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs this the moment when the invasions from alien planets hit their stride? \u00a0Koreans might have to abandon Seoul.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were too many Dungeons in Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would become the ruler.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juh-juhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground near Iello froze, and a pillar of ice extended from the ground. \u00a0It stretched towards the Thorn Tree..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the road of ice formed, Lee-sahgho surveyed the cluttered surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Isn\u2019t this place a bit too quiet?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was supposed to be the sight of a fierce battle, yet he felt a weird sense of dissonance. \u00a0He looked at the corpses and the broken buildings. \u00a0Every sign indicated that this was the site of the battle, yet it was too quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There no sounds of explosions or shouts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ring ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His handphone had let out an alert. \u00a0Lee-sahngho\u2019s face hardened when he read the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kahg-woojin has already pilfered that place. \u00a0Recommend retreat.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho\u2019s expression crumpled when he saw the text from his employee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He quickly searched the internet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw the breaking news informing the defeat of Ibrit, and the pacification of the wide outbreak of Dungeons in Seoul. \u00a0There was also a video showing an unknown red dragon fighting Ibrit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit. \u00a0We were a step too late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had implemented a plan with a fail-safe, yet Kahng-woojin had managed to return from Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose damn Japanese.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His expectation had not been high. \u00a0However, he expected them to stall Woojin for couple days. \u00a0However, they had only delayed Woojin for a day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle had already come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIello-nim. \u00a0Currently\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pillar of ice kept elongating as if water was being shot out from a fountain\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The pillar of ice was still growing, and it was approaching the Thorn Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An Ice Human had made his entrance on an already concluded battlefield\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wouldn\u2019t be viewed as a savior. \u00a0He would be perceived as a new invader.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous flying fortress wobbled. \u00a0The Wyverns had gathered at an empty spot on the deck. \u00a0However, they were chased away when the Blood Dragon landed. \u00a0The appearance of the Blood Dragon created a big fuss inside Bibi\u2019s castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ehhhhhhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn\u2019t have the energy to throw up anymore. \u00a0However, it seemed when the tension had left their body, they felt the need to gag even though nothing was coming up. \u00a0\u00a0Woojin jumped off the Dragon as he left behind his employees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a single bound, the succubus jumped into his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s expression stiffened at Bibi\u2019s hug.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t really care if she was wearing a risque outfit. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She could no longer be called a little demon. \u00a0She was in a form he became familiar with on Alphen, and there was only one reason why she would be in this form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs expected, the Synchronization has come to an end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I can use all my powers now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi spoke in a proud manner, but she didn\u2019t seem too happy. \u00a0The Illusion Witch was powerful now, but this also meant their opponents had regained their strength too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the Dimensional lords would be able to use their power as if earth was their home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for your return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan gave his greeting. \u00a0Sooah and his mother stood next to Minchan, and Do-jaemin stood behind them as a reliable guard. \u00a0Then there was Do-jiwon...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned at his mother\u2019s words. \u00a0Sooah held her mother\u2019s hand, and it seemed she felt awkward, since she hadn\u2019t seen her oppa in several days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMother is busy, so I\u2019ll see you later. \u00a0You do what you have to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She knew he was busy. \u00a0After she saw his face, his mother excused herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy king. \u00a0Shouldn\u2019t you go meet\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook Jung-minchan\u2019s hand as he cut him off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did you send the Daken guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? \u00a0They volunteered to be the advance group in using the Gate\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Minchan still didn\u2019t know about their betrayal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, we can talk about it later. \u00a0So how many locations had Dungeon Breaks like Seoul?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlmost every one of them suffered the same fate. \u00a0There are still a lot of cities that are unable to recover from this event.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, England was in the final stages of stabilizing the situation. \u00a0In the first place, most of the population had been moved to a enormous refuge where they were far from the subway stations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since they didn\u2019t have to worry about civilian casualties, the army would use their weapons with abandon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, the situation in England is almost stabilized thanks to Bibi-nim\u2019s efforts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin turned to look at her, Bibi had a bright smile on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI killed a Dimensional lord by myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood job. \u00a0So what\u2019s the closest country going through an on-going Break?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s Greece. \u00a0We were about to head there. \u00a0However, there is someone here you should meet before we do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi\u2019s castle was moving across the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their destination was Greece.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan answered in a careful manner. \u00a0After resolving the Dungeon Breaks in England, a person had come aboard Bibi\u2019s Castle in an attempt to meet Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s Kim-kahngchul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-oh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyebrows twitched. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He came here out of his own volition?</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

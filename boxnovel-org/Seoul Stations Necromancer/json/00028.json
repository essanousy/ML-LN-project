The two of them waited for the barrier to disappear. At the very least, they wanted to see the moment when the two had died as a courtesy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader. These guys are lasting quite awhile?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf they lasted this long, doesn\u2019t it confirm they were able to survive in the jungle?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026maybe they might clear it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Haemin\u2019s hopeful words, Minchan\u2019s face turned bright for a moment. However, he his face turned sullen soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is a Necromancer, so he\u2019ll have his summoned beings. Even if he was able to defeat the Krocodile using his summoned being as bait, he won\u2019t be able to escaped the swamps.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. When you say the swamps\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In various parts of the jungle, large swamps had formed, and the swamp was basically a death trap for close ranged fighters. The swamps limited one\u2019s movement, and there were two types of monsters that spawned at the swamps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fuco Monkeys and Swamp Anacondas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fuco Monkeys threw a very hard fruit named Fuco at their opponents, and it could deal quite a lot of damage. If one took a wrong blow to the head then one would be in danger of dying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hard to move in the swamps, so the only way to attack was using long-ranged magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan had too little information on the two. He knew the Roused named Hong-sunggoo had a Flame ability. However, Fuco Monkeys attacked in packs with at least 10 members. It wasn\u2019t something a single person could deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, when one is busy dealing with the Fuco Monkeys, the large anacondas would silently approach and attack. One would be too exhausted to fend it off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. That sounds difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is difficult.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one attacked a 4 star Dungeon, several types of abilities were needed. This was why a team was always formed. Minchana and Haemin went back to watching the barrier with dark expression on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-rook, boom!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several dozen fireballs flew towards the branches.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-kii-kii.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The surprised monkeys madly dodged the fireballs. During all of this, ice arrows flew in, and it struck the body of the monkey. It made their movement sluggish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssoo-ehhhhk! Boom!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKii kii kii.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the forest was burning up, an electrical attack came flying towards the Monkeys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-ji-ji-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgweek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was radiant as he saw the monkeys falling like leaves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-hahaha. Wipe them all out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s face was livid with horror as he looked at the horrible scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The forest was burning. If this was earth instead of a Dungeon, this event would have been the headline in the media.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin already had 40 Skeleton Magicians by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some were shooting Fireballs and some were sending out Ice Arrows. The rest were using Electricity magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At least he was comforted by the fact that his fireballs was a bit stronger than the Skeleton Magician\u2019s fireballs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had never seen such a violent and brutish hunting method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a retinue of Skeleton Magicians, and they were burning and destroying the entire jungle. It was an indiscriminate massacre.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a banquet of Magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-rook, Puh-puh-puhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKekeke. I leveled up again. Ooh-haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo wondered if Woojin had lost his mind. It seemed his mood was elevated to another level. It didn\u2019t suit a person who was madly destroying the jungle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggo had never seen Woojin be in a better mood. No, this was the most excited he had seen Woojin be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin leveled up, he put the 10 Bonus Stat Points into Magic and Control. He invested 5 points each.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow, come new recruits!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s call, 5 dead monkey corpses exploded, and new Skeleton Magicians were added to his troops..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Dual class is fucking awesome!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin got a taste of a new world when he turned from level 10 to level 11. Every time he leveled up, he received 10 bonus Stat instead of 5. The Bonus Stat had doubled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the Bonus Skill Point had increased from 1 to 2 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought it was a setup that allowed him to develop both the Warrior and Necromancer class at the same time. However, Woojin didn\u2019t even bother with the Stat and Skills for the Warrior Class. He put all the points into Control and Magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His current level was 14.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a bonus, he had received 40 Stat Points. He put most of it into Control and Magic. He also put several points into Recovery, which helped his magic recover.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic : 40 Recovery : 14 Control : 55</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the number of Skeleton Magicians increased around Woojin, the forest was destroyed at a higher pace. The monsters were too busy running away.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Achievement + 25, Achievement + 23\u2026.&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time Woojin killed one Fuco Monkey, he yelled out in joy as he calculated the Achievement Points. In the 3 star Dungeon, he had only received 3 Achievement Points, because the hunting ground didn\u2019t suit his ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s current level was 14, but the Transfer Bonus and other skills basically meant he could be seen as a level 40.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin swept everything before him as he advanced. From the rear, consecutive magic blast flew up like rocket launchers, and it landed in the forest. The only thing left was for the forest to burn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho ordered the jajangmyeon!\u201d (TLN: noodle + black bean paste + veggie/meat)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hamein took the two bowls of jajang from the delivery man then he approached Minchan, who was sitting on the subway station\u2019s stairs. The Dungeon employee, and the staff in charge went to a nearby restaurant to eat a meal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader. Our dinner is here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want Ganjajang.\u201d (TLN: same as jajangmyeon but the sauce is thicker)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis restaurant\u2019s jajang is tastier.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou bugger. This is the first time you are ordering from this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. Whatever. Let\u2019s just teat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan took the jajangmyeon, and he mixed it. He asked a question as he put a mouthful of the noodle in his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFour hours has passed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. So, 16 hours\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The structure of the 4 star Dungeon wasn\u2019t the only thing unique about it. The time there was 4 times faster then the real time. They had already spent over 16 hours inside the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon monsters quickly realized if there was an intruder. The monsters slowly converged on the intruders, so hiding wasn\u2019t an option.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could hide for a short amount of time, but it was almost impossible for one to hide from the monsters for 16 hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey probably came across a swamp by now. However, we don\u2019t really have much information about their abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s true. Uh\u2026. Then don\u2019t we have to worry about them coming back alive? We were the one who put them in danger\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Michan shook his head at Haemin\u2019s worry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s already been 16 hours, so they are probably starving by now. How well do you think they\u2019ll know about the ecosystem over there? The plants, animals and bugs aren\u2019t like the ones found on earth. They are all very different.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. If they mistakenly eat a poisonous plant\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the road.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe it was because of the words he were mumbling, but he lost the taste for his food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the future, don\u2019t order from here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The jungle was burnt to the ground\u2026 In the open space, Woojin was roasting something on a stick over the campfire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chi-ji-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the surrounding, Sunggoo had gathered fruits and mushrooms that wasn\u2019t damaged by fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I picked these up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, well done.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin picked up the fruits brought to him by Sunggoo. He picked each up one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can eat this if you peel the skin. You can\u2019t eat this. It\u2019s poisonous. This one is also poisonous, but we can eat it if we cook it over the fire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gave an explanation to Sunggoo. Sunggoo feverishly listened to Woojin like a student who was going to take the college entrance exam soon. The only regret Sunggoo had was the lack of notebooks. He wanted to write all of this down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. How are you so knowledgeable about this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, that is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he was knowledgeable about it. This place was basically like a mixture of the ecosystem and neighborhood he had lived at for 20 years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. Why don\u2019t you just listen without saying anything?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung-nim. I won\u2019t ask about it again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo cut some of that grass over there. We can crush it into a paste. It tastes fantastic when you slather it on the meat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. So what\u2019s the menu this time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSnake meat. It\u2019s fantastic. Also, I\u2019m getting tired of eating only meat. Let\u2019s eat some roasted mushroom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahh. My mouth is already watering.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To his surprise, everything Woojin cooked was very tasty. Sunggoo was really looking forward to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Michan favored the taste of Ganjajang, but he still emptied the whole bowl.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The current time was 7:45.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo had already been in the Dungeon for 4 hrs and 20 min.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin went to fetch a blanket, and he gave it to Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader. The day is getting cold.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, Team leader. What happens if we aren\u2019t able to scout Mr. Woojin and Mr. Sungooo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think? We can only begrudgingly let them go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t we need to report it to the president?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s already been sent. He was apathetic.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin\u2019s eyes became round. If it wasn\u2019t an order from the president, then why were they putting so much effort into this venture?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already ordered the employee to raise Kang-Woojin to Rank C and Hong-sunggoo to Rank D. The newly issued Roused Card had already been delivered to Minchan\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was to be blunt, it basically meant if those two died then their work would be much cleaner. They would lament the fact that they weren\u2019t able to rope the two into the guild, but the consequence would end there. The complication would arise if those two came back alive, and they took issue with what happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Haemin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, Team leader.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou know about me. In the past 5 years, my eyes have never deceived me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt makes sense. Team leader\u2019s evaluation of others had always been on point.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan had been involved in Dungeon related work since the Dungeon Shock. He was a veteran. He wasn\u2019t an founding member of the Hammer guild, but the work he had done for the guild was quite illustrious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t Team leader discover Park-jinwoo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hammer guild had two Ranked A Roused. One of them was Park-Jinwoo. Jung-minchan had recognized his potential, and he had roped him into the Hammer guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI get a powerful feeling from that bastard, Woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes that mean he has a similar potential?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Roused had potential, the Guild would bend over backwards to help the person grow rapidly. Haemin had asked if Woojin had as much potential as Park-jinwoo. Haemin shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have a feeling he has more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why I don\u2019t want to lose him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was telling the truth. He felt a strong sensation coming from Kang-woojin. It didn\u2019t feel like a sandalwood being fragrant even in seed leaf.(TLN:idiom) It was much more than that\u2026. It felt like he was looking at a large tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is why I want him to come back alive. I don\u2019t care even if he doesn\u2019t join the Hammer guild. If we lose a Roused like that, then it would be a loss for humanity.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT\u2026team leader\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin had to look at his boss, Minchan, in a new light. Usually he acted like an asshole, but today why was he looking so cool? No, he really looked cool.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe could pray together, Team leader. I\u2019m sure they will come back alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be tough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose bastards guarding the Return Stone are really difficult opponents.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he knew that. That is why he said they should pray for their safe return..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey\u2019ll eventually die\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weren\u2019t you hoping to see them come back alive?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took back the sentiment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wasn\u2019t his Team leader, he would have hit him. Haemin berated himself for thinking even for a brief moment that his team leader was cool.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim! The Return Stone is over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After burning down the entire jungle, Woojin stepped forward to use his Search magic. The Return Stone was in the middle of a large open space, and it was floating on top of an altar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the thought of being able to escape this Dungeon fraught with danger, Sunggoo was about to run towards it. Woojin roughly held him back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-uhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo fell backwards after the back of his neck was grabbed. Before Sunggoo could turn to ask the question, \u2018Why?\u2019, the ground he stepped on collapsed on itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A cloud of dust rose into the air, and he could see a trap with bamboo spears on the bottom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh-uhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had taken one more step, than he would have died. Sunggoo\u2019s heart flipped in his chest. He was about to express his thanks, but Woojin was staring at something with a serious expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sunggoo saw the beings that showed up, he lost the words he was about to say.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

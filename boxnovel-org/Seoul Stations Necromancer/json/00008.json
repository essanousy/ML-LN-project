You were alive, Woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His home room teacher from his 3rd year in high school looked as if he had seen a ghost. Woojin laughed bitterly. Numerous people had died during the Dungeon Shock, and it seemed Woojin was counted as one of the casualties.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In reality, it had been 20 years since they met again, so he didn\u2019t feel much emotions. The teacher looked for Woojin inside the student record.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Here is your phone number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rrring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The teacher immediately called the number. The number may or may not have changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would he be able to hear his mother\u2019s voice? Had the number changed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was sitting on the opposite sofa, and his heart was pounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hello?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The home room teacher heard a tired middle-aged woman\u2019s voice. He used a special tone of voice reserved for speaking to a student\u2019s parents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hello. My name is Lee-sangwoo. I\u2019m a teacher at Mido High school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What? Mido High school?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shaking voice seemed similar to the dimly remembered voice of his mother. Woojin\u2019s heart sped up, and it felt like he was out of breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Are you by any chance Mrs. Lee-soogyung?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes. You are correct. What is it you need? If its Mido High school, then it was the school our eldest went to\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin felt like his heart was about to stop when he heard the voice across the phone. Even when he was hit squarely by Balrok\u2019s Whip, it didn\u2019t hurt as much as this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin snatched the hand phone as if he was stealing it, then he spoke in a shaking voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMom.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were no words spoken across the phone. However, one could tell how surprised she was. She must have been shaking so much, since her entire feelings was conveyed to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMom. This is Woojin. Kang-woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was harder to speak the word \u2018Mom\u2019, then using a 9th Circle magic spell. His throat was tied up in knots, and he was barely able to hold back his tears. Instead of hearing words from across the phone, he could only hear the sound of weeping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[W\u2026Woojin? Is it really our Woojin? Are you really our Woojin?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the sound of her wails, Woojin couldn\u2019t even guess how much sorrow she had endured. The sadness turned into joy as his tears fell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve returned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Uhuh, uh-oong. \u00a0My Woojin.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had survived 20 years for this moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere did you move to? I\u2019ll go there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[No. I\u2019ll come over there. I\u2019ll be there soon, so don\u2019t move an inch from there.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard the sounds of hurried feet. Woojin gave the teacher his phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He let out a long breath he had held as he tried to swallow his tears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the teacher received the phone from him, he tried to calm the mother. He ended the call only after a lengthy conversation. At this sight, Woojin was reminded he needed to buy a phone soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe\u2019ll be here in about one or two hours.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. Thank you, teacher.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. I didn\u2019t really do anything. I\u2019m more thankful that you are alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you miind if I look around the school?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, do what ever you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought it would be boring to sit in one place for two hours, so he exited the staff room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. Let\u2019s go see Jaemin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his mother arrives, he\u2019ll have to repay the money he borrowed from Jaemin in haste. He felt embarrassed to receive money from his parent when he was already 24 years old. However, he had decided to repay her back by dedicating his entire life to being a good son.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just at that moment, kids crowded into the hallway since it was break time. He squeezed by people as he walked. He was boldly walking around wearing a white t-shirt and shorts one would only wear when going to sleep, so many students gave him a once over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wa, he\u2019s really handsome.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He\u2019s really tall. I heard he is our school\u2019s alumni.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn\u2019t for the other students in uniform, the female high school student would have exclaimed him to be their ideal type. They whispered among themselves, and they clapped their hands in delight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Wa. His fashion is so unsophisticated.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Shit. He\u2019s frighteningly thick. What did that bum used to do?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The male students secretly made fun of Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin ignored them, and he found Jaemin\u2019s classroom. Jaemin wasn\u2019t even able to go to the restroom during the break as kids surrounded him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Jaemin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin approached Jaemin in a friendly manner, and this surprised the gathering around him. Soo-hyuk and the other kids, who had suffered under Woojin, tried to avoid meeting his eyes. The other kids glared at Woojin, then they mocked him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is this bitch?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. Were you afraid of becoming the outcast, so you called in your big brother?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At most, there were seven of them. They looked at Woojin, and they grinned. Jaemin, who had a worried expression, met his eyes. Jaemin was slowly shaking his head from side-to-side when Woojin yelled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll of you playing as bullies follow me up to the roof.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With an obstinate expression, Woojin went in the front with the downcast Jaemin, and they headed towards the roof. The bullies followed after them with a dumbfounded expression on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWa. Let\u2019s give them a fucking beating. Hey, go call the kids in the other classes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soohyuk secretly followed after the kids as they headed towards the roof. There were over 20 kids following after them, so he tried to push yesterday\u2019s events out of his memory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That\u2019s right. I was careless, so I was hit in the vitals by mistake. That bastard probably can\u2019t do much against this number.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Including Soohyuk, over twenty bullies stepped on to the roof.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A haughty voice came out of Woojin\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bullies were lined up in a line, and they simultaneously lowered their body to the floor doing a push-up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTwo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJaemin\u2019s minions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Twenty five students were in a line, and they were doing push-ups at the same time. Even Do-jaemin, who was directly involved, couldn\u2019t hide his surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What did he learn at the Jiri Mountain?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He must have learned martial arts. If not, how could he defeat the twenty five large bullies in a flash by himself?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It really took less than 1 minute. He had already made them do 50 push-ups, yet the break hadn\u2019t ended yet. When the teens\u2019 arms started to tremble, Woojin gathered them in one place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, everyone come over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bullies\u2019 faces were considerably flushed, and Woojin grinned at this sight. He had held back since this was Earth. If it was Planet Alphen, then they wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He probably would have enslaved them after making their bodies Undead. Then he just need a little magic to damn their souls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think this is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a s..steel pipe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. Whoever brought this is quite hopeless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some bastard had brought a steel pipe to beat Woojin with it. He grasped the steel pipe then he easily bent it. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, he grabbed both ends of the bent steel pipe, then he pulled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzzzzt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The steel pipe stretched like a stick of caramel. In a moment, it couldn\u2019t take the tension, so it was ripped in half. The bullies looked at him as if their soul had been ripped away, and Woojin threw the broken steel pipe to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put an arm around Jaemin\u2019s shoulder, who was standing next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou won\u2019t bother Jaemin any more?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe won\u2019t bother him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll absolutely not bother him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head as if he was satisfied with the shouts in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t try to make him the outcast, and you guys should get along with him. All right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen go back to class.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, the bullies felt relieved that they were still alive. Then they bickered to be the first one to get off the roof. Jaemin looked at Woojin with a devastated expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow am I suppose to go to school now\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rumors of such a large incident would be spread across the school. Woojin smile brightly as he looked at his sour expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought you were only going to study? Now no one will torment you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Huh? What is this? His argument was persuasive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was only going to study, so why should he care if he didn\u2019t have some friends?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin patted Jaemin\u2019s shoulder, when he saw his flustered expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRight. I was able to contact my mother. Soon I\u2019ll be able to repay the money you lent me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN..no. It\u2019s ok, big brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was excited at the prospect of meeting his mother. Jaemin impatiently waited for the bell to ring, and he wanted to end the conversation with Woojin as quickly as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I\u2019ll repay your kindness. It couldn\u2019t have been easy to let a stranger sleep over for a night.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. No. Big brother helped me first. You even did so today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll be embarrassed in the near future, but it wouldn\u2019t be too bad. It seemed as if the bullies wouldn\u2019t bother him any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They\u2019ll probably torment him with petty and cheap methods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019m glad you think of it like that. If I buy a hand phone, I\u2019ll contact you. If those bastards bother you again, then you can call me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out the piece of paper from the pocket in his short, and he shook it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ha, he didn\u2019t lose it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fake number he had made up. He felt a bit guilty, so Jaemin laughed awkwardly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, big brother. Congratulation on reuniting with your mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha. Thanks. You should continue to study hard, and get a job in a great company.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the bell rung, Jaemin knew this was his chance. He bowed to say goodbye, then he ran toward his classroom. Woojin remained on the roof as he just grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe weather is quite nice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe it was, because there were less cars. The sky above Seoul looked very clear today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stood there for awhile, then he saw a taxi stop in front of the front gate. His heart felt like it was about to stop, when he saw the woman hurriedly head towards the school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMom\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin calmed his heart, then he head towards the staff room.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

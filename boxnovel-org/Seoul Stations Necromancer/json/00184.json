\u00a0If there is no roads, he'll pave one himself.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-ooh. \u00a0My mother sometimes appears in my dreams. \u00a0I'm really worried.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol calmly soothed Blanka, then she went to meet Tauric.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, Captain Haesol. \u00a0What can I do for you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric welcomed her. \u00a0Even amongst the freaks that came over from earth with the Immortal, Haesol and the Phantom unit was a bit special. \u00a0They worked very well together, and they were very good at carrying out missions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were a group that specialized in search and rescue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Have you found the Holy Maiden yet?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm... \u00a0We are trying our best, but we haven't found her yet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from the people from Alandal, the Phantom Unit was most familiar with Holy Maiden Melody in the Coalition. \u00a0She had already been missing for several dozen days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had left with Kahng-woojin to find Aria's Temple, yet she hadn't returned yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several cynics spread a false rumor that Melody had been murdered by the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the accused couldn't defend himself, there was no way they could completely dismiss such a claim...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tauric!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha lightly ran down the road leading from the castle walls, and she came to a stop in front of them. \u00a0There was an excited expression on her face as if she had met an old friend. Her face was flushed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Holy Maiden of Aria is back!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh oh. \u00a0Really?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"She is coming up from the base of the mountain.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems all the spirits within Alphen is trying to help us.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Holy Maiden was back, she would be able to cure those, who weren\u2019t recovering from their wounds. \u00a0She was basically like a savior sent by the gods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no one, who could rival Melody in terms of Holy Power. \u00a0Moreover, since she had acquired Aria's Holy Item, her power would have grown much stronger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The gathered heroes ran down to greet the Holy Maiden of Aria. \u00a0They went to greet her with a happy heart. \u00a0A big crowd was gathered around her to celebrate her return, but when they caught sight of her, Melody didn't have a bright expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What happened, Voice of Aria?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Skia's Monk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody's voice somehow sounded sorrowful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Immortal was short on time, so he went ahead of me. \u00a0I just followed behind...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh oh. \u00a0Is that so? \u00a0You went through a lot of hardship. \u00a0You did very well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as Tauric fiercely greeted Melody, he immediately ask her for a favor. \u00a0Since he was the leader, he had to deliver the difficult messages. \u00a0It was the right thing to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know you\u2019ve just arrived, so I\u2019m being shameless. \u00a0However, there are people crying out from pain. \u00a0Could you give them the Blessing of Aria?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Of course.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody let out a weak laugh as she followed after Tauric..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to welcome you back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I am so happy that you came back safely.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Thank you, Holy Maiden.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was being congratulated by the people, but she barely smiled. \u00a0Her smile indicated that she was uncomfortable with something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed as if Woojin would wake up in a short amount of time, but 20 days had passed. \u00a0He wasn't showing any signs of waking up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Many people wondered how a person could live without moving or eating. \u00a0However, if one thought about the Immortal's past exploits, this was nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, people were more worried about the state of the planet than him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The political landscape of this continent had gone through a seismic change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal had re-appeared, and the fractured Coalition was being rebuilt. \u00a0Moreover, the Dimensional lords, who had taken over almost the entirety of Alphen, were being taken down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undead army had swept through the battlefield, and they had already cleared a wide area. \u00a0They had cleared about one third of the planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In other words, even as this large area was being pacified, the Immortal hadn\u2019t woken up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He stayed in place to protect the waning flame of a life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A woman was watching the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Immortal.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody looked at the nearly melted Dragon's Heart, the small flame, the black evil spirits, and Kahng-woojin. \u00a0He was sitting in front of these elements, and she monitored the situation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Oh goddess. \u00a0How could you give me such a tribulation.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt resentment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After giving everything of herself to her goddess, this was the first time Melody felt resentment towards her goddess. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody couldn't understand the latest oracle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">-You have to burn the World Tree for Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were barely able to bloom this Symbol, which had become the hope of the Coalition. \u00a0Yet she had to burn it with her own hands? \u00a0Moreover, this was the last gate leading to Kahng-woojin's Dimensional Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the gate was destroyed, he'll be trapped in Alphen. \u00a0He'll be trapped here until he could gain another Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if she didn't know what her goddess was aiming for. \u00a0However, she questioned whether such an action was just.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt tormented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The feelings inside her heart fought each other to fill her with anguish and suffering. \u00a0It was a big burden for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you doing here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody was so surprised that her heart almost jumped out of her chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hic.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What's up?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin smirked when he saw the hiccuping Melody.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you a pervert? \u00a0Why are you spying on me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I...I'm not a pervert. \u00a0Hic.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody's face was red for no reason, and she couldn't look straight into Woojin eyes. \u00a0She was feeling embarrassment, guilt and sorriness. \u00a0Moreover, her heart was \u00a0pounding....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What made you move right now...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody took a glance behind him, and she couldn't locate the evil spirits nor the Dragon's Heart. \u00a0The only thing left behind was a small red and white flame. \u00a0It was lighting up the surrounding like a candle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I pretty much did all I can.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How's Sunggoo-nim doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is all up to him now. \u00a0Ah. \u00a0I hope he comes out ok.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\".....?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody's eyes turned round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you mean..?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He's being reborn without experiencing death. \u00a0He'll probably come out after remolding himself a little bit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody was still confused by his words, so her puzzled expression refused to leave her face. \u00a0Woojin changed the topic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Give me your Holy Item.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody hesitated. \u00a0As soon as he got up, he was asking for her Holy Item....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hurry up and give it to me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I...I lost it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin suddenly pushed his face towards Melody, and he looked straight into her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't have the courage to look into the fathomless depth of his eyes, so she lowered her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, all right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin backed off without making much of a fuss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want it found before I get back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He still had one more Holy Item to acquire besides Aria's Holy Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...where are you going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is he going back to earth? \u00a0What if he never returned to Alphen?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She looked at him with worried eyes, but Woojin spoke in an offhand manner. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where else? \u00a0I need to go catch Heres' follower.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The five Holy Items were sub-ingredients for the Thrash's Set Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just needed the ingredient for the belt. \u00a0Afterwards, his task would be complete once he received Aria\u2019s Circlet. \u00a0The other Ingredient Items were co across different Dimensions, so he could just use his Points to purchase it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0I want you to protect the Colony until I get back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why aren't you answering me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then I'll be putting my trust in you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin walked away, Melody was alone. \u00a0The strength in her legs drained out of her, and \u00a0she sat on the ground as if she was collapsing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh goddess....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her anguish deepened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-ahhhhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Wyvern's screech stabbed at her ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She would have preferred a Dragon's roar. \u00a0She was used to the sound of the wind brushing by her ears, so the sound of the Wyverns was painful to the Elf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"W...why do I have to go with you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The headwind was making her skin scrunch up. \u00a0The poor elf complained about her unfair situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You were the only one, who looked completely free.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal spoke in an off hand manner as if her troubles were over nothing. \u00a0Latasha\u2019s clenched fists shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...of course, I have things to do!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The one that has least to do has to become my guide.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....why do you keep insisting I was doing nothing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Am I on the right path?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The surface of the ground was passing by quickly. \u00a0When Woojin indirectly asked her a question, she looked around in a disgruntled fashion before she spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Over there. \u00a0You have to go past the rock mountain.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The one with the best eyesight has to be my guide.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She couldn't refute the Immortal's argument, so she kept biting at her blameless lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"God of time...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Five gods had the Master Codes of Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll have the last Holy Item in couple days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sizzle sizzle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The meat was spitting out fat as it cooked deliciously over the campfire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow.

It had been a while, since he had such thoughts before a fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmph.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if to chase away his anxiety, Woojin charged towards the large form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care if the bastard was made out of light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He just had to kill it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jee-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Warrior\u2019s Weapon penetrated the 72nd Throne\u2019s forearm. \u00a0The spear entered with no resistance. \u00a0When Woojin tried to take it out, it refused to come out. \u00a0It was as if it was embedded in concrete.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-roo-roohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was unsure as to how he should describe it. \u00a0He didn\u2019t know if it was a wound or a gap. \u00a0He could see its forearm wriggle. \u00a0He was pulling with incredible force, yet the spear refused to move an inch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhk, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard\u2019s fist struck Woojin\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He impacted on a dune as he was buried within the sand. \u00a0He erupted out from below as he rushed towards it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSummon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unsummoned then summoned his Warrior\u2019s Weapon. \u00a0He changed it into its great sword form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Warrior\u2019s Weapon could change its form freely, and he could recover it. \u00a0The battle style one could develop with such a weapon was endless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The great sword sliced through the enormous forearm as if it was passing through water. \u00a0However, the forearm reattached itself so easily that it made one wonder if it had been severed in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahng, juwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter if he sliced its neck or leg. \u00a0The result was the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hopeless, since he was swinging his sword at a being with no real body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he let his guard down for a brief moment, it punched him. \u00a0Woojin was sent flying. \u00a0He stood up as he spat out sand from his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t taken any damage. \u00a0The Soul Armor had activated, and the exact number of souls needed to block the attack was consumed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was neither a human nor a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a being made out of light. \u00a0It was basically an ethereal being, so how should he face this bastard? \u00a0Its body was a mass of light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat an annoying bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin changed his Warrior\u2019s Weapon into a bow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhng, shoo-shoohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He pulled only the string, yet an arrow made out light appeared. \u00a0It embedded itself in the bastard. \u00a0The arrow in flight acted as if it was caught in a magnetic field. \u00a0It slowed before it was absorbed into the Dimensional Admin\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-shoohk, shoong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed physical attacks didn\u2019t work, and the arrow of light was also useless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he call his familiars to fight this bastard?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll be wasting my magical energy.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how useful his Skeleton Army or his Death Knights would be. \u00a0He wasn\u2019t certain, but he was pretty sure Yong Yong would be much help either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought about calling for Lich Jaenis, but he gave up on that idea too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to conserve my magical energy.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if it didn\u2019t have real body, the bastard should have a soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He decided to bet everything on Thrash\u2019s Punishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When several throwing knives flew towards the Dimensional Admin, it punched the knives to block all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-ah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hand of light had held onto one of the throwing knives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Armor?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the ones aiming for its body went through cleanly. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if his weapons were passing through after creating a wound. \u00a0It was correct to say the Dimensional Admin was letting the weapons just pass through its body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is the armor covering some kind of nucleus?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a likely hypothesis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a being made out a specific element, and it needed a focus to act as a nucleus. \u00a0If this wasn\u2019t the case, it was either a soul or a ghost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was covering its only weakness with armor, so it didn\u2019t matter what it was. \u00a0Since the bastard had self-awareness, it possessed a soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The throwing knives disappeared, and in a flash, a whip was in his hand. \u00a0The malleable Warrior\u2019s Weapon kept changing its form, and the battle changed again in a free flowing manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The whip flew like a snake uncoiling. \u00a0It surrounded the Dimensional Admin\u2019s armor. \u00a0This was the only material that would allow him to restrict the Dimensional Admin. \u00a0It wouldn\u2019t be able to get out unless it strips off its armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he pulled the whip, the Dimensional Admin\u2019s body flew forward with no resistance. \u00a0It approached him quickly\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-oohk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional Admin\u2019s fist once again made him roll across the sand. \u00a0Woojin\u2019s lips split open, and he spat out the metallic tasting blood from his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His last batch of souls had been consumed. \u00a0Since he didn\u2019t have the Soul Armor, its fist was very painful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This opponent was on a different level compared to all the opponents he had fought before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is annoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From its appearance, Woojin had expected it to use an electric attack or an explosion created through pressurized energy. \u00a0He thought it would attack with magic, yet it only used its fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard\u2019s body ignored any forms of physical attack, and it felt as if its body wasn\u2019t even there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin charged again. \u00a0It would be great if he could use his magic to restrain the bastard. \u00a0However, he couldn\u2019t waste a single ounce of magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he did, he wouldn\u2019t be able to activate Thrash\u2019s Punishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know what you are trying to do.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he wiped the blood away from his lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry blocking it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toohk\uff0ctoohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sand flew into the air as he charged forward again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-oong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional Admin was getting into its stance, and one could tell it was serious. \u00a0The punches before were like swats trying to chase away a fly. \u00a0This time it would be for real.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His bones could be crushed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he had to worry about his life more so than his bones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t stop his footsteps, and he once again jumped towards the body of the Dimensional Admin. \u00a0He still had on a smile overflowing with confidence, but the Dimensional Admin was also smiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It tried to punch, yet its arm didn\u2019t move. \u00a0It was as if something was pulling from the back\u2026.. \u00a0It looked as if its body was stuck\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tuhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he held onto the armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was only an arm length away, and he could see the Dimensional Admin\u2019s face distort into an ugly expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if you know it is coming, you can\u2019t block it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a being made out of light, yet it was wearing an armor. \u00a0This meant it was casting a shadow. \u00a0Ggaebi was told to wait for this opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood bye.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gripped the Dimensional Admin\u2019s head with his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In an instant, his magical energy was drained, and he felt an absence within him. \u00a0This feeling of emptiness didn\u2019t feel great, but he was also filled with triumph at winning against the Dimensional Admin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgooh-uh-uh-uh-uh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw its soul get sucked into Thrash\u2019s Punishment, and Woojin gripped his fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tuh-ung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armor fell to the floor, and all the red light was sucked in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0This is the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His stored souls had stopped several punches, and now he was drained of everything. \u00a0If there were corpses or souls nearby, he would be able to absorb it to refill his magical energy. \u00a0However, he had come to an isolated region, so there were no souls to be found.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had blocked the absolute being from descending. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had stopped a being that would have been a big threat to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It probably needed a certain amount of time before it could revive. \u00a0He had to find a way to get to the Moon World before Iello or the Dimensional Admin revives to cause trouble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll be able to kill the god of earth on the Moon World. \u00a0He\u2019ll be able to take its Code.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a method where he\u2019ll be able to acquire the Code, while keeping Sooah safe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShing Shi\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to summon the Phantom Steed Shing Shing when he felt a large amount of magical energy emanating from the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armor floated into the air, and it started to be filled with blue light. \u00a0The being was formed again as it let out a blue light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It continuously gathered energy from the surrounding as its presence became large. \u00a0It made Woojin worried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unusual mass of light grew until it exploded forward. \u00a0It was as if it was trying to swallow everything near it. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-ahhhhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A large sandstorm rose into the air as it blocked the sun. \u00a0It obscured one\u2019s field of vision with darkness. \u00a0One couldn\u2019t see an inch past one\u2019s nose, yet the Dimensional Admin started to flash as it regained its red coloring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the end, the result hadn\u2019t changed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had exhausted its power, yet it had won and survived. \u00a0It had gathered all the Codes to the 72 Dimensions including earth. \u00a0It just had to finish its work.\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-koo-koohk. \u00a0How long have I waited for this moment?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A large eye formed within the darkened space, and it laughed as it looked down at the Dimensional Admin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Shadow Imp Ggaebi let out a wicked laugh as it circled the Dimensional Admin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I have been awoken from the punishment of death. \u00a0I will reveal myself to this world again.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggaebi swirled around the Dimensional Admin\u2019s body as if it was compressing into it. \u00a0The black shadow started to mix with the red light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The red light darkened, and at some point, it had been dyed completely black.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo koo koo koo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The darkness split into a wide grin as it laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A descent by borrowing the body of a corpse?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It couldn\u2019t be compared to this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a complete revival.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was no longer an unstable being summoned by borrowing the power of a Necromancer. \u00a0This was a perfect revival.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ha-ha-ha-ha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a being, who had created this world in the beginning\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a long time, the absolute being of the Dimensions had descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Saurus Mountain\u2019s World Tree, Planet Alphen</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Holy Maiden Melody let out a sound of sadness. \u00a0There was a man standing in front of her. \u00a0He had translucent skin that made his skin look pale. \u00a0She tried to push her hand forward\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man turned into black smoke, and it entered her hand. \u00a0It was as if it was being absorbed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ah\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She could see souls. \u00a0The dead were\u2026. \u00a0She could see souls letting out cries of deep sadness. \u00a0It felt as if their cries were filling up the world. \u00a0Melody wanted to close her eyes, but she stood firm as she tried to get used to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she wanted to help them, she didn\u2019t know how. \u00a0\u00a0He wasn\u2019t as nice as the goddess of Prophecy. \u00a0Moreover, he didn\u2019t send oracles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At some point, she was able to see souls. \u00a0She tried to embrace the souls, but they all turned into smoke when she did.</span></p><br/><p><span

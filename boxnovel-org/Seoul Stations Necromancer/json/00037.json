Everyone was in a cheerful mood, but Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin\u2019s face was turning darker as time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The department head, who would usually accept their letter of recommendation, had been transferred, and Minchan had been promoted to the head of his own department.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The president was sitting at the table reserved for the managers and directors. Minchan was surrounded by his team mates, and he was continuously receiving congratulations for his promotion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Kim-haemin pushed an envelope towards Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease accept my letter of resignation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt least I have to get out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut we are going to the same place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go there early and ask for a better position.

He was normally rude, but why was he so impudent today?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-ooh. I\u2019m uncomfortable in these kind of places, so the food won\u2019t even go down my throat. I\u2019m going to go first.

The resignation letters held firmly in Minchan\u2019s hand shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDepartment head. Please let me pour you a glass.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, all right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The employees were already calling him department head, and they were sucking up to him. Minchan kept receiving alcohol from the employees, and he knew he couldn\u2019t put this off any longer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he resigned, Minchan would probably never see them again, but the guild society was pretty small. There was a chance they would cross paths, so there was no reason why he should leave on bad terms. It would only make it more difficult for Woojin and his new guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know how many glasses of alcohol he had emptied already.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoooo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Michan stood up from his seat, then he headed towards the table set aside for the directors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. Congratulations on becoming the guild master of the greatest guild in Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh huht. What are you saying? It is all thanks to you all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan firmed his resolve as he saw Park-sahngoh, who looked as happy as Minchan had ever seen him be. It didn\u2019t matter what he said since he was fucking Park-sahngoh over. The possibility of a beautiful parting didn\u201dt exist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my. Aren\u2019t you the guild\u2019s number one star, chief Jung? Now now. Please come over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The directors looked at Minchan as the president call him over.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some of them were several prospects Jung-minchan had found in the past. They were all Rank B Roused. They were held in high esteem for their high Roused Rank and their history of attacking Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a common occurrence to have yesterday\u2019s comrade be given a higher position in a brief amount of time. This was why not many Roused bellyached at the other\u2019s promotion. They didn\u2019t become jealous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The positions were only words to be printed on a business card for the Roused. Guild was just a place for them to gather. It was a place where they could work together for profit. If the Roused didn\u2019t like the guild, they could leave after their contracts ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, even if the title was considered to be a single line on the business card, it was a target to aim for.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. I have something to say to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh oh. We have to listen to Department Head Jung\u2019s tale of exploits.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI failed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Minchan\u2019s words, Park-sahngho\u2019s smiling face froze in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI failed in making a contract with Mr. Kang-woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m deeply ashamed of myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh\u2019s face became turbulent. What kind of place was this? Wasn\u2019t this party thrown to congratulate Jung-minchan\u2019s promotion, and to celebrate him bringing in an almost verified Rank A Roused Kang-woojin in to the Hammer guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow could you say such a thing right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs this something you can get away with just by saying you are sorry? Do you want to be fired from the company?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Uh? If that happened then he would be thankful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know how much money you spent while you tailed after Kang-Woojin? Do you think an apology is enough?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had allowed Wooin to use the Dungeon for free. Moreover, he spent money to secretly manipulate Woojin\u2019s Roused Rank\u2026. A loss was a loss..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, he was wrong. He was wrong. He made a very big mistake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will take all the blame.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBlame? Is this how you take the blame\u2026 What is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is my resignation letter. I will take all the blame, and I will resign from the Hammer guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh glanced at the resignation letter, and he looked at Minchan with a bewildered expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou aren\u2019t a politician. Do you really think you are taking full responsibility by stepping away? Aren\u2019t you running away after making a mess?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What could he say? No. What words were needed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was going to quit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m leaving. Please take care of yourself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He placed two envelopes containing resignation letters on the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan gave a bow then he escaped the banquet hall in all haste.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat, that! That crazy son of a bitch!?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-michan heard Park-sahngoh fly into a rage, but he continued to walk as he closed his ears. His heart was jumping inside his chest. He was still nervous, but there was a faint smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had felt great and satisfying. Moreover, he was filled with anticipation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Michan had selected the seed rather than the fruit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he stepped outside, Haemin was already in the front with his car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOver hear, team leader.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. This is why he still liked that rude bastard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Sahdahng station\u2019s Angel Angel Business room. 8 PM.*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome to Alandal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan and Haemin grinned at Woojin\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am looking forward to working with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will treat you as my president. Please look out for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Minchan shared a handshake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFeel free to treat me in a way that is comfortable for you. I will use all my strength to establish Alandal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so? Then I can just call you Minchan?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Uh? Isn\u2019t he being a little bit too familiar with him? (TLN:he stopped speaking in the respectful form)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease call me team leader Jung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right, team leader. I\u2019ll leave the establishment of the guild in your care. Do what you consider is best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a saying that the people of the east being courteous is a thing of the past, yet\u2026 Jung-minchan was having a hard time adjusting to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you want to go have some soju today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His view on life seemed to be simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If someone else saw them, it would look like they were making a club instead of a guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if we get acquainted part to a later date\u2026 There is a matter president needs to address first. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe need at least 5 founding members to establish a guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were in need of one more person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould we put Jaemin in the guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t use an under-age youth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. An underage youth can\u2019t be one of the founding members.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan confirmed Sunggoo\u2019s words. Woojin nonchalantly opened his hand phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"><span>[Mother][Do-jaemin][Real Jaemin][4]</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. I really don\u2019t know a lot of people.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought his personal connection in this world was quite simple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When his mother saw Woojin falling into the Dungeon by accident on the broadcast, she had become bedridden. Moreover, the reporters kept bothering her at work, so she had to quit her job. Currently, she was just staying at home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mother isn\u2019t an option.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he excluded Jaemin and all the people gathered here, then he didn\u2019t have any more acquaintances. One was an unknown number\u2026 So the phone salesman was the only one left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo we just need a name to use?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Yes. We just need to fill the 5 spots.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan guessed Woojin was trying to use a family member\u2019s name for the position of Guild\u2019s founding member. Woojin brought up the phone salesman\u2019s number then he pressed the call button.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Doo-roo-roo-roo</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a long wait time, the call was connected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ah, hello?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, do you remember me? From that time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[O\u2026of course. I remember. I remember very well.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put his phone down for a moment, and he looked towards Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat documents are needed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? He just needs his ID, a copy of his ID, and if he has a seal, he should bring it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin held up his hand phone again, then he started talking again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome to Angel Angel near the intersection. Bring your ID and seal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026why do you need me to do that?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.

I just need to borrow your name for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2026I\u2019m going to call the police..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t care if you call them or not. Do it before I get mad. Do you want me to go there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[N\u2026no. I\u2019ll be there.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan asked a question after Woojin ended the call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. It\u2019s just someone I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he coming here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcellent. I\u2019ll fill out the required initial paperwork, and I\u2019ll go to the Management Bureau tomorrow to get an approval.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan took out several previously prepared stack of documents from his briefcase.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m liking how this had turned out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was trying to run a guild or a country, one needed at least one aide. One would be able to dump the annoying work on the aide. Woojin was pleased by the fact that he had made an offer to Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yea. There is a something we need to resolve with haste.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to create a guide for the Seoul National University station\u2019s 6th exit Dungeon. There is no information on this 5 star Dungeon, so it isn\u2019t an easy Dungeon to attempt. If there is no guide then we would be hard-pressed to get any appointments.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The very first team or guild to clear a Dungeon received a tremendous benefit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time the Dungeon is cleared, a 30% commission was taken from the price of the blood stones. Moreover, one could levy a usage fee for the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why it was required to disclose all the general knowledge of the Dungeon. Once the information is disseminated, the difficulty in clearing the Dungeon decreased, and it would become more manageable for the Rank B teams to clear the 5 star Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The large guilds, and the upper-tier average sized guild had numerous teams of that caliber. So this Dungeon would bring in a lot of profit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, are we required to receive the Roused who want to use the Dungeon? I could just use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDuring the times when president has to rest, wouldn\u2019t it be better if the Dungeon is put to use instead of keeping it idle?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have a good point.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t think too long on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll immediately head towards the Dungeon after a the required paperwork is prepared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had an idea, then Woojin acted on it immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go, Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2026you want me to go?

Everyone is gathered here.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had seen them on the news. Kang-woojin was the one who had accidentally fallen into the Dungeon.

A secretary brought in tea. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In recent days, the number of people visiting Alandal had increased significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Under the skies of Seoul, the safest land was considered to be near the Seoul Station. It was the private lands of Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though there wasn't any public recruitment going on, people and beggars came in droves to ask about jobs at the guild. \u00a0It seemed Blanka had been mistaken for a foreigner looking for work, and he had been detained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy were you so late?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe guard at the entrance prevented me from getting here faster. \u00a0It was a sad situation.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been treated as a foreign laborer, so Blanka had been very disappointed by his treatment. Woojin smirked as he looked at Blanka.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI bet you are lying. \u00a0You probably didn't want to come here from India.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN...no way. \u00a0I wanted to come here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka's flustered expression pretty much confirmed Woojin's suspicion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, it didn't matter. \u00a0It didn't matter what worries and lingering attachments he had before.

Moreover, he had promised to give 100% of the rights to running those Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From their perspective, the rights to running the Dungeon was an added benefit. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What they really wanted was the assurance that Woojin would save India twice from future calamities. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, all right. \u00a0I want to welcome you to Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease take care of me from now on.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the conversation came to a close, Jung-minchan shook Blanka's hand. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome. \u00a0My name is Jung-minchan.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is nice to meet you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour Korean is very good.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka was a famous Roused in India. \u00a0Jung-minchan already knew who he was. \u00a0Minchan had also been told about Blanka being scouted, so he was well informed on the situation. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow should we treat Mr. Blanka, president? \u00a0Is he part of Alandal now or was he dispatched here by his former guild?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you asking if he is a hostage or a slave...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's words, Jung-minchan let out a forced laugh as he wiped at the sweat forming on his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt doesn't matter if he was sold or loaned. \u00a0Just treat him how you like.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't care whether Blanka's allegiance lay with him or not. \u00a0The important part was the fact that he'll be able to use Blanka as a Buffer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After his work was done, Woojin didn't care if Blanka remained at Alandal or go back to India.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha. I'll take care of everything.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gave an adequate response, and he tilted his head in confusion when he saw Minchan and Soonghoon keep smiling at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do you guys keep smiling at me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe finalized the treaty today.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan opened his briefcase, and he took out a thick envelope.

This would lessen the worry felt by the employees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is thanks to the president. \u00a0Shall I call you your majesty now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDude.

There are more details on the internet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The explosion at the Gobi desert was a nuclear weapon level explosion, and the related information was being quickly uploaded onto the internet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was also a video being circulated aside from the satellite image.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cOh shit! \u00a0What the hell? \u00a0It\u2019s a pegasus.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person filming the footage spoke as he recorded the sight of the Phantom Steed streaking across the

ha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woo-soonghoon\u2019s words, everyone\u2019s expression relaxed a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster is alive. \u00a0I still exist.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A definite sense of relief was felt when they heard Bibi\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. \u00a0Recently, I don\u2019t know why, but every little incident makes me anxious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was barely able to calm his racing heart. \u00a0It was akin to letting a child play near the river. \u00a0Whenever Woojin went somewhere, he became anxious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo did he go to the Moon World or whatever?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At times, Woojin went to visit his Dimensional Domain or Alphen. \u00a0So his absence wasn\u2019t a surprise. \u00a0However, they were afraid of the piece of truth he\u2019ll bring back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so. \u00a0What happens if this place is really a virtual

either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the virtual reality disappeared, would only the Roused wake up in reality?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan, Soonghoon and Haemin weren\u2019t Roused. \u00a0They had a complicated expression on their faces as they kept their silence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cThis is breaking news. \u00a0The members of a Chinese guild called Limsum guild was dispatched to investigate the explosion that had occurred at the Gobi desert. \u00a0All communications with the team was severed. \u00a0This footage was sent before\u2026.\u300d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the anchor spoke, the footage filled the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dust clouded the field of vision. \u00a0It was as if one was walking within a fog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cI detect a strong magical energy in front of us.\u300d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cClear this away.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon understood Chinese as if he was a native to the language. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused used his power to stop the flow of air. \u00a0Afterwards, he gathered the dust in a single location, and he sent it away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the field of vision cleared, one could see a large doll standing in place. \u00a0It was wearing an armor that looked like a vest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it a Golem?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t look like a human. \u00a0Moreover, it didn\u2019t look like any of the analogous races. \u00a0It looked more like an inorganic object than a living being.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked like a Golem similar to Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unique characteristic of its body was the fact that the body was made out of a black substance that made it impossible to tell if it had a solid or a liquid body. \u00a0It was roiling as the substance moved like oil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked like a clump of oil. \u00a0It also looked like a collection of black clouds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the important part was what happened afterwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooooong. \u00a0Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The strange monster swung his hand, and all the members in front was sent flying after being hit by a force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cKoo-koo-koohk.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It let out a bizarre laugh. \u00a0The person holding the camera was dead, and the footage shook as the camera was dropped to the floor. \u00a0The camera was lodged in the ground, and the footage came to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cThe Chinese authorities are assuming that this being is a new Dimensional lord. \u00a0They are in the process of gathering a special task force. \u00a0Moreover, they are thinking about approving the use of a tactical nuke\u2026.\u300d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk. \u00a0What the hell? \u00a0They are thinking about using a tactical nuke over that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was showing his dismay over the news when an employee ran in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrime Minister. \u00a0The Chinese government is asking for our assistance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it because of that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A still image of the monster was filling the screen. \u00a0When Minchan pointed at it, the employee nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI believe so. \u00a0The situation is much worse than what the news is reporting. \u00a0The monster is bulldozing through cities as it destroys everything in its path. \u00a0\u00a0It has already reached the western region of Zhangjjakou.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026isn\u2019t it traveling way too fast?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe more important fact is that our king isn\u2019t here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin quickly minimized the news as the screen of the computer was projected. \u00a0His expression hardened after opening up a map.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is traveling in a straight line.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan groaned as he looked at the red line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. \u00a0It is almost at Beijing. \u00a0I can see why they are so nervous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, you should look beyond it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin spoke with a serious expression. \u00a0The flight path was was extended in a straight line, and the line came to an end at a city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan\u2019s expression stiffened as it turned cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeoul\u2026. No, is it aiming for us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an uneasy prediction, but he somehow felt he was right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAn incredible bastard appeared accompanying an explosion and the king went missing...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been barely able to tamp down his anxiousness, yet the feeling was getting larger again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A different employee ran into the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrime Minister. \u00a0South Korea is on the line. \u00a0There\u2019s been a large Break in Busan. \u00a0They are asking for help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrime Minister. \u00a0New York has...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Employees kept coming in with a phone in their hand. \u00a0Minchan massaged his temple as he watched them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe king isn\u2019t here, so what can we do\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was a one man army. \u00a0Kahng-woojin was missing, and it was as if the monsters all over the world had agreed to go crazy all at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This hell like world was a problem if it was the real world. \u00a0It was a problem if it was a fake world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if his limbs were missing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, was his entire body gone?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He started having auditory hallucinations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Help me.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Please don't abandon us.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">You could have protected them! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Don't go!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">I want to live. \u00a0Please save me.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Faces brushed by him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were familiar voices and shapes\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he dreaming again?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he being tormented by the vicious evil spirits again?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His vision was blurry, and he could see the despairing souls approach Woojin. \u00a0The souls were tangled up with each other, and it was a sight that could probably be seen in hell. \u00a0They started to touch his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt itchy and hot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The funny part was that he no longer had a body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was conscious, and he had self awareness. \u00a0However, he couldn\u2019t feel his body. \u00a0It was as if he had melted into the air, and the only thing he could see around him were the evil spirits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He watched them swipe at the empty air, and he felt some unidentifiable emotion. \u00a0Maybe this was a wish he had desired for all this time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s freedom.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if he had been freed from everything that had been put on his shoulders. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Release.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In this state, he felt as if he would be able to run away from the outcry of the evil spirits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll leave.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tried to leave. \u00a0He was about to leave, but\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwahhhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A butterfly flew in, and it landed in front of Woojin. \u00a0It slowly fluttered its wing as dusts scattered into the air. \u00a0Soon, the butterfly disappeared, and a girl took its place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her face was familiar. \u00a0She was the girl sacrificed in the terror attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thank you.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The armless corpse, who had crawled across the ground, had reappeared in front of Woojin. \u00a0She coalesced from dust, and the arms she lost in death was back. \u00a0She looked normal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It has been an honor to fight with you.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He remembered him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During his mercenary days, he was a free knight, who had fought with Woojin in the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The old man bleeding from the head solidified from smoke, and he bowed towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">I do not resent you.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His memory was fuzzy. \u00a0These were people, who had died by his hands....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tormenting evil spirits reverted back to the appearance they held at the time time of their deaths. \u00a0They appeared in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They all bowed towards him as they smiled. \u00a0Woojin was swept up by an unidentifiable feeling, and he had no idea what expression he should put on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thank you for not giving up on us.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each of them spoke similar words to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt sorry, because he hadn\u2019t been able to protect them\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the space of emptiness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The state of his body was uncertain\u2026 \u00a0He was unable to perceive himself in this space, yet the souls surrounding him confirmed his existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the lives, who he hadn\u2019t been able to protect. \u00a0They were all looking at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if they were protecting him\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone\u2019s ship landed at a desolate basin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Psssshk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door opened, and armed soldiers wearing gas masks descended the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are ready to wheel him out, captain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A cart was floating in the air. \u00a0It was akin to the ones that were used to transport patients. \u00a0It was questionable to call it a stretcher, but all the preparations were complete.</span></p><br/><p><span

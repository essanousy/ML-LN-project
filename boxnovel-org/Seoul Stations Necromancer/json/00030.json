I guess Krocodile leather sells for a high price?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI..I guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked through the presents given by Minchan. Among the several items, he was looking at the Gwachun City Hall subway station\u2019s 11th exit guidebook. It listed which monsters were present in the Dungeon, and the pattern they showed up in. It also listed the vulnerable points. There were a variety of information that were essential in attacking the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It listed how much a part of a monster could be sold for. It also described the valuable plants and what types of valuable ores could be found there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were easily found items. Woojin hadn\u2019t known it, but there was a robust market for these items in this reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s too bad, but I can\u2019t do anything about it now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin knew he hadn\u2019t been able to bring out a lot of things, but he didn\u2019t feel any regret over it. Also, in the future, he didn\u2019t have to think about gathering all those items by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey Sunggoo. You take care of it next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo would rather excavate the bloodstones. If he had to dismember monster\u2019s corpses to bring the valuable parts, it was a little bit\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah, my dream of becoming a flame magician\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The desire to advance his ability was as strong as the desire to make money. He really respected the high ranked Roused. After meeting Woojin, Sunggoo had more occasion to use the butcher knife instead of using his flame magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had become a master at extracting bloodstones, but his flame ability was in a standstill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he had made a contract, so he planned on being faithful to his job as a manager for 1 year. The amount of money he made was unimaginably larger than before. He would steadily save the money, then he\u2019ll buy a magic scroll to raise his ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBy the way, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes were glued to the guidebook, and he replied in a distracted manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo why did you give your phone number to assistant manager Kim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe said he wanted to have some soju with me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it that simple? Is he trying to act heroic? Maybe he is stu\u2026 No. Hyung-nim isn\u2019t like that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince assistant manager Kim knows your number, doesn\u2019t that mean Team leader Jung will also know your phone number?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019ll find out about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen why did you give it to him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, why not?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned his head to look at Sunggoo. Woojin answered in such a dignified manner that Sunggoo thought back to see if he asked the wrong question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Are you going to join a guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNope.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I thought you didn\u2019t like being bothered? That Team leader Jung seemed like a pretty persistent person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me ask you this. After you block spam mails, does the spam mails stop coming?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt shows up even if it is blocked.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. We just need to show moderate amount of interest. Then they\u2019ll introduce us to Dungeons like today, and they\u2019ll give us presents. How great would that be?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2026he was enjoying this. Of course, hyung-nim\u2019s heart is really\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it\u2019s inside the Dungeon, do you think he will follow in after me? How about when I\u2019m not in the Dungeon? I don\u2019t have anything else to do. I have a lot of time on my hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019ll eventually give up after he gets tired.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">E\u2026evil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo grabbed the steering wheel in silence. Woojin was absentmindedly looking out the window when his eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Isn\u2019t that Jaemin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? That\u2019s the student living with hyung-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. Pull your car alongside him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s car stopped next to the sidewalk. Woojin got out of the passenger seat then he yelled as if he was glad to see Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJaeminJaemin!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was taken aback. He had come out near the school to eat out with his sister. He saw woojin wave at him with a bright smile. Jaemin unconsciously lowered his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHello, hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*Top floor of the Hammer guild*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the 10 rank A Roused in Korea was here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Guild Master Park-sahngoh]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The intercom placed behind the his desk\u2019s nameplate rang. His secretary\u2019s voice came out when he pressed the button.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[President. The 3rd Support Team leader is here for a visit.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet him in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbbiiii.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The intercom turned off, then the door opened soon after. The passionate support team leader was the same age as him. He was 35 years old. He had joined the Hammer guild late, but he had made significant contributions in helping the Hammer guild expand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He managed the lower Dungeon, which were the main source of funds for the guild, with a steady hand. He also had the ability to find talented prospects, so he stood out from others in the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. I\u2019m hear to give my scouting progress report. It is about Kang-woojin, who I had reported to you before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHave you succeeded?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNot yet\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t I give you all jurisdiction regarding this manner? You don\u2019t have to give me progress reports. Perhaps, your negotiation isn\u2019t going well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would have been great if there had been an actual negotiation. The problem was Woojin didn\u2019t even think about negotiating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf Team leader Jung is keeping tabs on him, then I don\u2019t care about how much he wants. I\u2019ll leave it up to your discretion. Scout him if you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou will have to settle a matter regarding him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was already able to make a lot of money. No, he had found an amazing hunting method that allowed him to make as much money in the 3 star Dungeon as the 4 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed something more than money to entice him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh looked at the document he had to sign, and he frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo we really need give him the position of vice-president? Does he really have that much worth? Hah. The vice president seat is no joke\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh looked through the other files. Kang-woojin\u2019s background was written in detail</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe returned after he went missing for 5 years. As soon as he came back, he went to the 2 star Dungeon once and 3 star Dungeon once. Today, he completed a 4 star Dungeon once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I predict he is a Rouse possessing a very outstanding ability.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHave you seen it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said have you seen it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet, but my prediction\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh threw the documents, then he leaned back to bury his body into his chair\u2019s backrest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook here. Team leader Jung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were of the same age, but there was a large gulf between the boss and a subordinate inside the company. Minchan had the better educational background, but the gap between them was large. It was like the difference between a Roused and a civilian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf he was really that competent, then why would I spare the cost of giving the vice president seat? However, this is laughable. The position of vice president in the Hammer guild isn\u2019t some part time job. This guy is a baby who only cleared the Dungeons three times. He isn\u2019t a known quantity. How can we give him the position solely based on potential?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were additional problems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoreover, his potential is based only on team leader\u2019s hunch?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boo-dook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan gritted his teeth. He had brought in numerous outstanding individuals based on his hunch. Hammer guild was one step in front of the other guilds in terms of finding talents, and Minchan had a lot to do with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe has to display his potential in a tangible way. If that isn\u2019t possible, find out about his abilities. Then I will be able to decide if he is worth the investment the guild will have to put out for him. How long did you expect us to make an investment solely on Team leader Jung\u2019s hunch? It isn\u2019t like you are successful every single time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was right.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous Roused were brought in at Jung-minchan\u2019s strong assertion, and there were a lot of them who hadn\u2019t reached their potential yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, if the president would just think of all the times they made a profit, this level of investment shouldn\u2019t be too much\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t throw around the vice president seat easily. Everywhere we go people will look down on us. It\u2019ll bring down the Hammer guild\u2019s prestige. Do you understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbiiiiii.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The intercom rang just in time. He pressed the button and his secretary\u2019s voice leaked out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[President. The vice president is here for a visit.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Vice president Park-jinwoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the greatest talent found by Team leader Jung-minchan. He was a 27 years old with a handsome face. Recently, he made a lot of appearance on tv, so he was as popular as an entertainer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was also the only other Rank A Roused in the Hammer Guild aside from the president. His worth to the guild didn\u2019t even need an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-jinwoo was tall, and he was wearing a suit. When he opened the president\u2019s door to come in, he came face to face with Team leader Jung-minchan. Jinwoo\u2019s eyes became round, and he smiled as he gave his greeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Team leader Jung was here..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Well, please go have your conversation with him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the past, he had merely been a cub when Minchan had found. However, he was a vice president now. His station was markedly different from the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan walked passed him with a rigid expression, and Park-jinwoo shrugged his shoulders. By looking at this mood, it seemed he was chewed out by the president again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he had recognized Park-jinwoo during his noob Roused days. Minchan had also introduced him to the the Hammer guild, so he had an attachment towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Team leader?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. I don\u2019t know. He saw some necromancer, and he want to give the guy one of the vice president seat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-jinwoo laughed at the annoyed words of the president.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf Team leader Jung is advocating for him, then don\u2019t we have to try to catch him no matter what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean catch him no matter what. I think that guy\u2019s eyes have deteriorated. Every kid he brings in are mediocre now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Recently, the prospects found by team leader Jungminchan was very mediocre. They were talented, but they didn\u2019t develop fast enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe fact that Team leader Jung was able to recognize your talent was pure luck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. Still, don\u2019t be too harsh on him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. All right. Anyways, how was your work in the US?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-jinwoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had the wholehearted support of the guild, since he was a Rank A Roused. He was also the representative of the Hammer guild, so he had been elevated to the position of vice president.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Guild Conference opened in the US. As the representative for the Hammer Guild, he had to participate in it. He had just returned from New York.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-jinwoo\u2019s expression turned serious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI looked at the surrounding moods, and I think the rumor is correct..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s true?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">President Park-sahngoh also put on a serious expression. There was a very weird rumor circulating between guilds that started not too long ago. He had sent the vice president to the conference to confirm whether if the rumor was true.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn your opinion, who procured it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think it\u2019s the Titans.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Titans\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several large guilds in the US, but if one had to choose the best, one would pick the Titan. It was an obvious choice. If the rumor was true then the possibility of the Titan having the person was highly probable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA person who came out of a Dungeon\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh\u2019s face had turned serious. Should he call that person an alien? Should he call the person a new species? He hadn\u2019t seen this person, so he had nothing to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. It might be a rumor made up by Titan in the first place. The absolute truth would probably only be known to the top executive of the Titans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the rumor was true, this would be the first such incident since the Dungeons formed 5 years ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the heart of Manhattan, a limousine parked in front of an building that rose into the sky in an imposing manner. People who looked like security surrounded the car. They quickly moved to open the trunk and they took out a wheelchair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The limousine\u2019s door opened, and a brown haired middle-aged woman moved to the wheelchair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A blonde beauty in a tidy outfit approached her with a smile on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMrs Hamilton. Was there any discomfort in coming here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDiscomfort? This is the first time I\u2019ve traveled in such luxury.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had flown here by plane for 6 hours. However, there wasn\u2019t a single moment in the journey where she felt discomfort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for accepting our guild\u2019s request.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. If someone needs my help, I\u2019ll most definitely agree to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mrs. Hamilton was America\u2019s most respected psychotherapist. With guidance from the blonde beauty, they headed towards the top floor of the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMrs Hamilton. Before you meet the patient, you will have to sign this contract.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The contract given to her by the blonde beauty was a commonly seen contract. It was a non-disclosure agreement. Many wealthy individuals were her regular customers, so she was used to seeing such agreements as their psychotherapist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she signed the contract, the blonde beauty guided her to the patient\u2019s room. She was handed a concise summary of her patient. Hamilton asked in confusion as she read it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes she have global aphasia?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mrs. Hamilton didn\u2019t ask any more about the patient\u2019s diagnosis. The file only had information regarding the symptoms exhibited by the patient. It didn\u2019t have any person information on it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any name, birthplace, age or anything\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blonde beauty nodded her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe was rescued from a Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour job is to find her voice again, Mrs. Hamilton. It is your job to fill the empty personal information of the patient.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beautiful blonde secretary led Mrs. Hamilton to a room. When she entered the room after opening the door, she couldn\u2019t help but yell in surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my God.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had never seen such a beauty in her life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as a fellow woman, her almost unrealistic beauty surprised Mrs. Hamilton.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As befitting a 5 star hotel, the room was decorated in an extravagant manner. However, it didn\u2019t even register in her eyes. She could only look at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was simply a mysterious beauty with unearthly beauty. Moreover, she also gave off an unearthly feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a woman, who was rescued from a Dungeon, her face was too peaceful. Pyschotherapist Hamilton quietly approached her in the wheelchair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary stood by her side as she looked on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After calming herself a little bit, Mrs. Hamilton started speaking towards the unidentified beauty. While Hamilton was calming down, the unidentified beauty had put on a faint smile, and it made her look very alien.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHello. My name is Mrs. Hamilton.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beauty didn\u2019t respond at all to her gentle greeting. She couldn\u2019t speak, but her eyes was letting out a light as if she was yearning for something.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it\u2019s too difficult, you don\u2019t have to speak. Do you want to write to me? Or you could draw some pictures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if they had already tried this, the table next to them had a paper and pen on top of it. Hamilton smiled as she started to draw a picture first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She just had to go slow. Maladies doesn\u2019t suddenly get better in an instant. She couldn\u2019t suddenly make a hole through the barrier in her heart. She can only get closer to her a little bit at a time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most important thing was always having sincerity in one\u2019s heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m ready. I want to understand you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Can you hear me?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hamilton was surprised when a clear voice rang out inside her head. She turned to look at the secretary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you just hear someone speak?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t hear anything\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your trust allowed you to receive my voice.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hamilton\u2019s surprise-filled eyes turned towards the unidentified beauty. It was as if the light in her eyes were speaking to her. It was as if that was her voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I can hear you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I guess my god hasn\u2019t abandoned me yet.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy God.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beauty\u2019s lips hadn\u2019t moved yet she was sure the woman was speaking to her. Her voice was clearly heard by Hamilton\u2019s ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[May you grant me my request?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow\u2026how are you able to speak to me? Who are you? How can this be\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused secretary looked at the flustered Hamilton, who was talking to herself.

\u00a0Kim-kahngchul was the fastest to reach Rank A as a Roused in Korea. \u00a0He was an eccentric Roused, who had refused to establish his own guild, and he also refused to join the other guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a somewhat stocky body. \u00a0His hairline had receded halfway, and he had broad facial feature. \u00a0He was someone that gave off a favorable impression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMay I speak with you for a brief moment?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy? \u00a0You want to join us?\u201d

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul shut his mouth, and he dug in his heels. \u00a0The security guards could do nothing. \u00a0Kim-kahngchul used to have the title of being the best Roused of Korea. \u00a0The security guards were normal people, so they didn't know what to do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they hesitated, Woojin frowned. \u00a0Kim-kahngchul looked up to look at the man standing atop the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I last 30 seconds against this Death Knight, will you set aside some time to have a conversation with me?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are barking up the wrong tree. \u00a0I'm busy. \u00a0Come back later.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I don't talk to you right now, wouldn't it be difficult to get a hold of you later?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen we won't have to

Dungeon, Kim-kahngchul had no idea when he'll get to meet him next.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI just need a moment of your time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow annoying.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped down from the wall. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wasn't a small man. \u00a0When he faced Kim-kahngchul, he was very imposing. \u00a0When the crowd felt the volatile atmosphere, they stepped backwards to give the two men space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are turning out to be a headache. \u00a0What do you want? \u00a0\u00a0Do you want an interview?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's words, Kim-kahngchul shook his head as if he had been put in an awkward situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have something else I have to do, so joining your outfit might be problematic. \u00a0I just need a little bit of your time to talk....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cha-ahng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned his longsword and he swung it. \u00a0Kim-kahngchul reflexively withdrew a dagger from his jacket. \u00a0He parried as he retreated backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the start of a special interview that will be conducted by me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span

</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul couldn\u2019t protest any longer. \u00a0Woojin's swords strikes were getting very close to hitting him. \u00a0He didn't dare speak or breath wrong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, kahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sudden sword fight had everyone in the surrounding retreating backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He's really trying to kill me.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul felt the threat to his own life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin's eyes twinkled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He's pretty decent.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ten seconds. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's sword strikes changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-shoohk, chahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's movements was much faster. \u00a0Kim-kahngchul was moving his hands and feet in a dizzying manner, but blood was starting to erupt from various parts of his body. \u00a0However, these were very superficial cuts on his skin. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Is he taking it easy on me?\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When that thought entered his mind, he allowed a significant attack to slip through his defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword had pierced through his shoulder, and Kim-kahngchul stabbed back with his dagger with ill intent. \u00a0If he had known he was going to fight, he would have brought his main weapon. \u00a0He regretted not bring it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dagger swung by him couldn't even graze against Woojin's clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-dahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's kick, Kim-kahngchul fell over. \u00a0Before he could right himself, a low kick flew in to knock him down once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-oohk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The unfortunate part was that a sword had come flying in instead of a kick on the following attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suh-kuhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ah-ah-ahk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-khangchul's leg was cut by Woojin's sword. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis...this is insane.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm leaving.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was unrest amongst the spectators, and they were moving away as if they were running away. \u00a0The scene was a pandemonium. \u00a0Woo-soonghoon became mute, and Jung-minchan put his hand on his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The president had made another accident again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul was\u2026\u2026. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-oohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-uhk!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sword didn't stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He cut the tendons in Kim-kahngchul's sword arm, and Woojin planted his sword on the opposite shoulder. \u00a0The blade went through the shoulder, and it imbedded itself in the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh ooh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the blood was leaking out all over the floor, Woojin crouched in front of Kim-kahngchul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThirty second has passed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC...crazy bastard.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned at Kim-kahngchul's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a waste to kill you like this, so you pass the interview!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul displayed hostility at Woojin's bright words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoong! \u00a0Just kill me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, I will.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span

death....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gripped the sword that was embedded in Kim-kahngchul\u2019s shoulder. The sword had been placed in an excellent location. \u00a0If he used a little bit more force, he would be able to separate the head from the body. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...wait a moment!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? \u00a0Keep your last words short.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP...please spare me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hadn't he been the number 1 Roused in Korea? \u00a0Did he have no backbone?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he had read the intent in Woojin's eyes, Kim-kahngchul spoke quickly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll join your guild.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0You will join in your death.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...I want live and join.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou do?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul felt a sense of urgency. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned as if what he heard was disagreeable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more convenient to use a bastard like you in your death?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can't. \u00a0I have something I have to do to save the earth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. \u00a0Jeez. \u00a0Are you trying to feed me a lie?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin gripped his sword again, Kim-kahngchul revealed his final card. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm here to give you a message from Dr. Toppler. \u00a0\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere is that son of a bitch?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's reacted as if he was infuriated. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul realized he had been too careless in coming here. \u00a0He regretted his lack of preparation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He said I just needed to deliver a message.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, the situation had turned for the worst. \u00a0It seemed Kahng-woojin didn't have any good feelings towards Dr. Toppler. \u00a0No matter how he looked at it, Kim-kahngchul was in a bad spot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go in....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were still too many eyes in their surrounding. \u00a0Woojin pulled out the sword stuck in Kim-kahngchul's shoulder in an annoyed fashion. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-oohp.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unsummoned his sword, and he looked around his surrounding. \u00a0It seemed most people had run away, and only several dozen people remained. \u00a0They were hanging around with fear in their gazes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys over there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA...are you talking to us?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin's attention fell on them, the remaining people spoke out with trembling voices.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.

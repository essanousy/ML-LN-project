(2)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Were the gods always right?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she had this conflicting thought, the feeling of anguish arose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This matter was such a big deal that it shook her to the core.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha-ah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if she kept worrying over the problem, the only thing she could do was sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her goddess wanted her to set it on fire...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did her goddess give her such an oracle?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was she trying to prevent Kahng-woojin from returning to earth? \u00a0Or was she trying to oppose him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She couldn't discern the meaning behind the oracle, so Melody was tormented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time she had this feeling of doubt in her life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had always considered the goddess' words to be always right, and she always followed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was she the Holy Maiden of the goddess of premonition, or was she just a puppet on a string....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody stood still for awhile as she looked at the World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her expression kept changing by the minute, and she finally shook her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This isn't right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was the meaning behind burning the World Tree?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon, 'Raht's Temple', was cleared by Celrak, so Kahng-woojin only had the Saurus Colony left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she burned the World Tree, which was his Symbol, the connection point between earth and Alphen would be severed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, she didn't have the confidence that she\u2019ll be able to endure the Immortal's wrath when he learned of her action. \u00a0The Gate was needed for him to return to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn't come to the conclusion that the act of burning the World Tree was for the betterment of earth and Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the first time in Melody's life, she made her own decision instead of following the voice of her goddess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I can't do it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ramification of her choice wasn't small.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shooooooo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah ah...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is this what divine punishment felt like?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if the soul within her head was being shaken at its roots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was different from the sensation of pain. \u00a0She felt her body be seized by a sense of futility and powerlessness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if an something important was draining out of her. \u00a0When the feeling subsided, she immediately realized what was missing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a power she had always lived with. \u00a0It was a power she knew very intimately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I turned my back on the goddess...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She couldn't feel her Holy Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She feebly looked at her two hands. \u00a0Her goddess hadn't abandoned her, since she had abandoned her goddess first...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She actually felt grateful for the retraction of her Holy Power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had received a punishment. \u00a0This lessened some of the guilt she felt for going against the will of her goddess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is done.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now the Immortal wouldn't lose his way back home. \u00a0Her goddess' oracle was incorrect. \u00a0No, Melody had made it so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since Kahng-woojin could still travel back and forth from earth, he won\u2019t lose that important something within himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha-ah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She fell to her knees, and she looked up at the World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wind blew against the leaves, and the leaves moved like a wave. \u00a0It felt as if the tree was trying to console her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same for swaying flame of Sunggoo below...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the Portal let out a light as a person appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Immort...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody thought the Immortal had returned, so she had stood up to greet him. \u00a0However, someone else exited from Portal. \u00a0It wasn't just a single person. \u00a0It was several people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-ooh. \u00a0Is this place Alphen?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden approached them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who are you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0You are the Holy Maiden. \u00a0I saw you in a forum in New York. \u00a0My name is Nakamura.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She remembered him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had gathered the earth's Roused to ask of them to save Alphen. \u00a0She asked for an expedition force to be formed, but the Daken guild from Japan fought against the idea. \u00a0They had argued in terms of profitability of such a venture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, with the appearance of Kahng-woojin, the plans for the expedition group dissolved into thin air. \u00a0All plans were scrapped. \u00a0This was what she remembered...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems the cleanup party is here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. \u00a0We are the cleanup party from earth. \u00a0We are here to help rebuild Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura displayed his white teeth as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My name is Masuro Nakamura. \u00a0I am in charged of the expedition group sent from the Daken guild.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She shook his hand in the confusion of the moment, and she felt a weird sense of danger. \u00a0Even if she didn't have the blessing from the goddess of premonition, her instincts told her to be wary of this man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are the first wave of the cleanup party. \u00a0Soon, there will be a second and third group from earth crossing over to Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...this is good news.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn't this what she always wanted? \u00a0The Roused from earth would be coming over to fight for Alphen, so how could she not thank them?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, something was bothering her. \u00a0It was the greasy light within their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Could you explain the lay of the land right now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This region had already been swept by the Immortal's army, so there should be no forces left that could pose a threat to us. \u00a0However...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody held back what she was about to say. \u00a0She hesitated before she continued speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You should talk to the heroes of the Coalition.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah... We will. \u00a0I forgot there were heroes here. \u00a0So they are S Rank Roused...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nakamura turned to look behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had come with an elite force that was an equal of 100 warriors. \u00a0Moreover, he brought a research staff, who'll study Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, shall we start restoring Alphen?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Japanese from the Daken Guild, who had crossed over to Alphen, quickly started to explore their surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Beeep. \u00a0A variable outside of the prediction simulation has occurred.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The speaker, which had been frustratingly giving the same answer over and over again, broke from its patter. \u00a0It spoke something different. \u00a0Woojin frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What nonsense are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chee-jee-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's body was soaked with sweat from smashing the monitors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The god of Time was tireless, but a human got easily tired.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[A change that varies from the record has occurred. \u00a0A new branch point has started.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's face crumpled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't care if they were gods or some other form of life. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What were they? \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of questions yet to be answered, but he was sure of one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was useless to reason with them. \u00a0They only spat out words that they wanted to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were unfriendly, and he had no idea what their aims were.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So what is that supposed to mean!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is time.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Psssh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of air escaping was heard, and a hatch from the ceiling opened. \u00a0Something akin to an elevator descended. \u00a0It was too small for a person to ride on it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The very small space above the lift was encased in glass, and one could see what was inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The item was treated like a relic being displayed in a museum.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heres' Belt.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'm giving you the last key.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pshhhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The glass window opened, and Heres' Holy Item was within it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was the reason behind this move?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a causal relationship for everything. \u00a0It might seem like a coincidence, but if one looked back an incident, one could always find out what had caused it. \u00a0If Heres was giving up the Holy Item so easily, why did it waste his time like this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as he made a mess of its temple, Heres hadn\u2019t stop him. \u00a0It had been frustrating experience. \u00a0It kept repeating it wasn't time yet. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why did the situation suddenly change?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let me ask you one question.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This is the start of a new branch, so I have no data. \u00a0I just record. \u00a0Prediction is not my speciality.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to beat the hell out of the bald man behind the monitor. \u00a0He was so detestable that Woojin would automatically hit the man if he showed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who the hell said he wanted to know about the future?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, it isn't as if you answered my question when I asked about old events.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[True.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you playing with...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I cannot tell you about how the variable would affect you. \u00a0I just record. \u00a0I will not cause changes to your journey.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of stoking his anger, the god of Time Heres' words made Woojin give up. It had been giving such shameless answers for the past several hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I think you've done enough to change what I'm going to do.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was silent again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh-whew. \u00a0Forget I said that.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grabbed Heres' Belt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gathered all 5 Items he would need to make Thrash's armor set. \u00a0The rest of the ingredients could be bought through the Dimensional Store or it could be gathered at a different location. \u00a0He didn't have to be tied down to Alphen anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time to return to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he acquired the Holy Item, the door opened once again, and the long corridor was revealed. \u00a0He started to slowly walk out of the room, and Latasha, who had been waiting in the corner, suddenly appeared next him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha looked at the Immortal face with a dumbfounded expression. \u00a0How could a man, who had gone complete bat shit crazy for several hours, suddenly speak like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shouldn't you resolve some of your issues before you go?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you mean?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You have a lot of questions.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even if I ask them, it won't answer me. \u00a0What can I do?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He answered in such a dignified manner that she didn't know what to say. \u00a0Latasha's own experiences didn't prepare her for making sense of the Immortal's action. She couldn't help, but ask him another question. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn't you destroy his possessions to get an answer?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I did it just in case. \u00a0Also, I would have been bored if I had to just wait doing nothing.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, the Immortal was born with a propensity for violence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha once again had to reevaulate Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I've got everything I came here for.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn't come here to talk to Heres. \u00a0He just wanted to acquire the Holy Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought he would be able to find an answer to his stifling situation, yet it felt as if everything had become more complicated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Kahng-woojin was too thick-skinned to worry too much over it. \u00a0He wasn't overly stressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's hurry back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was just annoyed with Heres' unnecessary actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Elf Lord Latasha quickly got on behind Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chee-jee-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bald man appeared on all the screens except for the broken ones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I hope you will be able to complete your journey this time....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Chee-jee-jeek. \u00a0Kahng-woojin....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heres' voice sounded too earnest for it to be called a sound made by a machine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Phantom Unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were talents found through an open call...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Actually, these were the people, who hadn\u2019t been able to run away, when Kahng-woojin and Kim-kahngchul suddenly got into a fight. \u00a0They had all been low Rank Roused, but that wasn't the case any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rank B.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lowest ranked member of the Phantom Unit was Rank B.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a high rank where they would be able to be hired as a director in most guilds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been only several months, yet they had grown at a breakneck pace. \u00a0It was inexplicable to everyone else as to how this was possible. \u00a0However, Alandal was known for growing unbelievably strong Roused, so it wasn't something that happened only in a dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Reinforcement Stones were used to increase the base stats, and Alandal hadn't skimped on investing numerous Skill Book into them. \u00a0They had been only Rank E and F, yet they were given all these stuff.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol had become the leader of this newly made Phantom Unit. \u00a0It was thanks to her that the members of the Phantom Unit were well trained, and loyal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, they were weaker than the Undead Army, so they were given the role of rescuing members of the Coalition. \u00a0They were here to help the Coalition rebuild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of work to do at the Saurus Colony, but... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In recent days, they've run across a lot of trouble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't in dispute with the people of this planet, beings from different races or even the forces of the Coalition. \u00a0The problem arose from the people, who had originated from the same place as them. \u00a0The people from earth were causing problems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the top members of the Phantom Unit named Kim-joonyong looked at the people from the Daken guild. \u00a0He looked at them with disapproval in his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who the hell are they? \u00a0What kind of soldier looks like that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They aren't soldiers.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are they?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"They are researcher.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....so why would researchers come here when we have to reclaim Alphen?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well...they are here to research?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh-whew. \u00a0They are here to research what?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How the hell should I know?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know about it, so how would other members of his unit know about it? \u00a0He was being silly. \u00a0He let out an awkward cough at his fellow member, who had gotten angry. \u00a0Then Kim-joonyong started walking forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh? Where are you going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm the one, who is frustrated, so I'll be the one digging the well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm curious, so I'll just go ask them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was an inherently curious man. \u00a0When Kim-joonyong was curious about something, he wouldn't be satisfied until he could ask and solve the question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Excuse me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The researchers of the Daken guild looked at the man, who had suddenly shown up, with suspicious gazes. \u00a0They looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you researching?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...we are looking at the lay of the land.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was something he already knew even if the other man hadn't said it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a basic rule, the portal didn't allow items from earth to pass through it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the researchers had made a strange looking stethoscope, which used Blood Stones as an energy source. \u00a0They were using this device to poke around the ground in various locations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he was curious about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How else are we going to build a sturdy castle?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"But we already have a castle?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Saurus mountain already had castle walls as part of being a Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, jeez. \u00a0Why do you have to be so nosy? \u00a0They just told me to conduct a search up here, so I'm searching.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oh well.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the other man got angry, it felt awkward, so Joonyong retreated. \u00a0When Joonyong had moved away, the researchers of the Daken guild looked around before they whispered to each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do they suspect what we are doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No way. \u00a0If they knew what we are trying to do, they would have shown some signs.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm. \u00a0Anyways, the amount of oil deposit below ground is much more than imagined. \u00a0We might need help from the US.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's good news. \u00a0They usually don\u2019t move easily. \u00a0We'll bring in help from the US and several other guilds.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo hoo. We were fortunate that our guild was chosen as the first group.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why wouldn't we be fortunate? \u00a0This is his Majesty the Emperor's favor. \u00a0It is telling us to once again seek the glory of our empire.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want you record all the data carefully.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The researchers busily found the locations of underground natural resources, and they organized the information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The faction pining for Japanese Imperialism reared its head again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had traveled through the portal to a planet called Alphen. \u00a0They would use helping Alphen's Coalition as pretext...</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

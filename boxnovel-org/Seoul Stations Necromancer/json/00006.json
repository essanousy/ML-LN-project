The bus fee had increased by 300 won, but the most noticeable change that caught his eyes was the amount of cars on the road had decreased significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tv attached to the bus was talking about which subway stations and exits had been successfully attacked. It was going on and on about similar topics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If the attack on the Dungeon is successful, we will be safe for at least couple days, and couple months at most. If we fail, the Monsters will be unleashed.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The news continued to play incessantly. It started to narrow the gap between the reality regarding the past 5 years for Woojin. In the World News topic, they talked about the Monsters that had burst forward from the subway stations in Tokyo, and they had to mobilize their army to block them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The areas around the Subway Station are old news.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the capture of a dungeon failed, one had no idea when the monsters would burst forward. It was like living next to a bomb, so no one wanted to live next to the stations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rather than living next to the subway stations, people would joke it would be safer to live next to a Nuclear plant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, Seoul\u2019s population had significantly decreased, and the decreased population led to less traffic. The bus drove as if it was flying.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the bus stopped, it felt as if the world in front of him had turned yellow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe h\u2026house\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The apartment, which was Woojin\u2019s home, was gone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so shocked that he was having a hard time speaking. The apartment Woojin had lived in was gone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Originally, it was a 5 story high apartment. They always talked about rebuilding the apartment, but it had disappeared within 5 years. He would have never guessed an imposing building would take its place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even at a glance, he could tell it wasn\u2019t an apartment. The structure looked like an office building, and it authoritatively shot into the air. Woojin was looking at the building from close by, and the security guard deemed him suspicious. So the security guard approached him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The security guard abruptly questioned him, and Woojin had to push down his anger. Woojin couldn\u2019t kill him for not liking him, and he couldn\u2019t damn his soul for the heck of it. Those actions were only possible at Planet Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin forced down his anger, and he pressed his hand against his temple. After a moment, it felt as if his anger had somewhat calmed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened to the people who used to live here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe people who used to live in the apartment before this building was built!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, I\u2019m asking why are you asking me\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The security guard, who had been glaring at him, avoided his gaze in surprise. How could someone\u2019s eye become so scary?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI..I don\u2019t know. This place was in ruins before this building was built.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn ruins?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s forehead was bulging with veins. The security guard let out a cold sweat at his chaotic expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous people died 5 years ago from the Dungeon Shock. It would be correct to say everyone who was using the subway at the time had all died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a Dungeon can\u2019t be cleared within a month, the dungeon will explode and the Monsters would pop out. Countless number of people were killed or hurt when that happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seoul was too large and slow to deal with the sudden change. They even dropped missiles on locations where the Monsters broke out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen..when the monsters broke out, Jichun had been turned into ruins. So why are you making a fuss?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin controlled his anger inside when he heard the security guard\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Calm down. Be calm.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t the time to lash out at anyone. His family was alive. They were alive. At those thoughts, he was barely able to hang on to the thread of his anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be ridiculous for him to become unruly based on an assumption. It was unbecoming of an intellectual mage like him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. It\u2019s only been 5 years. There are many ways to find them.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought he had returned after twenty years, but only 5 years had passed. Yes, only 5 years. If he went to the borough office, their last known address should be there. He would know if they were still alive by looking at the family register.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah, I don\u2019t know my social security number.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was assigned his SSN during his 2nd year in high school, but he had no idea where it was any more. He could go to his alma mater to get his SSN.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll know it once he searched through the student records. If he was lucky, he\u2019ll also be able to find out the hand phone number of his parents, which he had forgotten.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As his thoughts connected to make a plan, he felt a calm sensation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes, all of his family was safe. He just hadn\u2019t found them yet. It was already past 6 o\u2019clock, so he couldn\u2019t go back to his school to make the request. He was stuck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t hard to prioritize what he had to do next.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll have to find a place to sleep, and\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Growl.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stabbed his hand into his pocket, and he touched the 5800 won he had. Woojin turned his head, and he was able to see a restaurant in a building across the street.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin crossed the side walk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. What kind of rice soup costs 6000 won?\u201d (TLN: You get a soup and a bowl of rice + banchan. You basically flip the rice into the soup. There are restaurants specifically catered to these dishes.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin complained as he drank the cup ramen\u2019s soup. Since he didn\u2019t have the 200 Won, Woojin was treated like a beggar, and he was chased out of the Rice Soup Restaurant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it wasn\u2019t the shortage of 200 won that decided it, but his beggar-like outfit had a bigger role in the decision to kick him out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. The darn grandma probably wouldn\u2019t give me rice soup even if I was freezing to death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin unnecessarily thought about the cold-hearted lady from the Rice Soup restaurant as he chewed on an onigiri. He felt sad since he didn\u2019t have any money. However, he hadn\u2019t had a cup ramen, and an onigiri in a long time, so it was delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, where do I sleep tonight? Do I really have to go to the police station?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, so why didn\u2019t he want to go to the police station? He guess he did couple of bad things\u2026several dozens of bad things. He had also killed a couple\u2026 He had kill countless number of people, but this all happen on the Planet Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Earth\u2019s Kang-woonjin was just a normal\u2026 He wasn\u2019t normal since he had disappeared during his 3rd year of high school He was a child, who had returned after a 5 year absence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I guess they would ask me all sorts of questions if I go to the police station.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Where have you been? What were you doing before you came back? Why didn\u2019t you try to keep in contact? His head hurt when he thought about the report he had to make up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He decided going to the police station was a last resort. Any ways, it wasn\u2019t as if he didn\u2019t have any other choice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though the land prices had collapsed completely in Seoul, and the population had decreased significantly, Woojin still didn\u2019t have a home to lay down in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was overjoyed at seeing a convenience store in 20 years, so he had bought hot bars, and drinks. In the end, all the money he had left was 300 Won. It was an amount where he wouldn\u2019t even be able to enter a sauna nor a PC room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, even the subway stations where the homeless go to are off limit now, so he had no choice but to greet the morning in the streets. At that moment, he heard the convenience store\u2019s door open, so he reflexively turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the convenience store\u2019s door opened, Woojin\u2019s eyes sparkled as he saw a familiar face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was fate. He was sure it was fate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin. The school junior he had helped out in the evening was picking out an onigiri.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin downed the rest of the soup left inside the cup ramen, then he stood up. He paid for his items, then Woojin quickly followed after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, student.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin turned his head, and he saw a pale ghost-like face. Woojin smiled from ear to ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. I was about to call you yet we meet again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW\u2026why? Why would you\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin haltingly took a step backward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs your parents home?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would you want to know that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin reacted in a sensitive manner. Woojin made a face indicating it wasn\u2019t a big deal, then he put on his most trustworthy smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIncluding the previous incident, I have a lot of things to discuss with them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy parents have passed away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? That\u2019s goo\u2026 No, that is unfortunate. Are you living by yourself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin nodded his head with wariness filling his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou lead the way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me stay at your place for one night.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin had a dumbfounded expression on his face. The strange uncle wearing a straw mat, who was frighteningly good at fighting, was trying to invade his home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it isn\u2019t for free.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He forced Jaemin\u2019s hand open to place something in it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">300 Won.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Isn\u2019t this the money he had extorted from him? Jaemin looked back with a dumbfounded gaze, and as if even Woojin was embarrassed, he grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. I\u2019ll pay you back anything I\u2019m short on. Huh huh. Why is there a fly here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He slyly let fly a fist into the empty air like a boxer. No, he was like a Roused where the sound of the air splitting apart was produced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin could only walk toward his house with a tearful face.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

such sensation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the heat he felt through his two hands couldn't be described as fire. \u00a0He was someone, who had digested the conflagration from hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't lose to a mere Dragon's Breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Red Dragon's Breath was made out of fire, so he'll be able to absorb it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I'm melting.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His two hands were disintegrating into a haze. \u00a0When he saw this sight, the confidence that had been creeping into his head disappeared. \u00a0His confidence hit rock-bottom. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'I...I'm dying.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The moment he felt fear he could no longer resist against the Breath's nature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-ah-ahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flames were consuming him, and it felt as if his hands, feet and hair would all burn away. \u00a0No, it might have already happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing his two eye could see was the red flames...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah ah...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flames was so strong that it felt as if his soul was burning away. \u00a0There was no way he would be able to gather his disordered mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The faint memories and past life events were passing in front of his eyes when he heard a voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Sunggoo.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a familiar voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it his parent's voice? \u00a0Was it the voice of an angel?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Hey Sunggoo!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know if he was hearing through his ears, or maybe it was a hallucination ringing inside his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His consciousness was fading away, and in the end, Sunggoo blacked out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-oohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The burning heat was spreading to the surrounding. \u00a0The air was so hot that most people couldn't get closer to the source.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Move!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lich Jaenis formed nested barriers as he blocked the Dragon's Breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sunggo!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had arrived in great haste, and he saw the mushy body of Sunggoo, which was melting away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard was dumb yet sweet. \u00a0Sunggoo was someone, who followed his order at all cost... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did he have to do such a reckless act?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's gaze headed towards the World Tree, which was rustling from the wind. \u00a0He saw the Portals in front of it, and the light looked especially profound and mysterious today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Colony had been safeguarded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hey Sunggoo.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no reply as Sunggoo\u2019s soul shook as if it was miserable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin cooled his heart. \u00a0He had worried for the past 20 years about dying on Alphen without being able to return to earth. \u00a0These memories flitted through his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first person from earth to die on Alphen shouldn't be Sunggoo. \u00a0There was no way he would let that happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't worry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sat near the fire. \u00a0His hand headed towards the body, which seemed to be melting away as it tried to reconcile with the flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want you to command all my Familiars, Jaenis.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Lord\u2026 \u00a0What do you want me to do?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Lich's body was currently existed as a flame. \u00a0It brushed by Sunggo, and it came to rest next to its master. \u00a0Usually his voice was filled with playfulness, but it no longer had that tone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want you to eradicate all the Dimensional lords and monsters on Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[As the lord wishes...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis turned away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he headed towards the outer walls, his robes trembled from pure bliss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll finally be able to save Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll also relieve the lives of the beings that stood against the Immortal....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"H..hyung....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin approached them with a face full of worry. \u00a0Woojin was terse with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll save Sunggoo. \u00a0You should return to earth first.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How can I be the only one to...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If this place is any indication, earth probably isn't in a great state either. \u00a0Go and protect them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y...you want me to protect them?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin was taken aback. \u00a0He had received the Vampire Lord's blood, but he wasn't at Kahng-woojin's level.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't have the power or the guts to protect earth. \u00a0Woojin looked at him with earnest eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Sooah\u2026 \u00a0No matter what, you have to protect Sooah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll be there soon. \u00a0Please just hold out until then.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, hyung.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin quickly headed towards the Portal. \u00a0When Woojin gave his approval, Jaemin's body was sent across the portal. \u00a0He was sent to Bibi's Castle. \u00a0He was sent to the aircraft carrier being governed by Bibi. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wanted to go to earth immediately to see what the Dimensional lords were up to. \u00a0However, he couldn't.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flame still refused to die down as it enveloped Sunggoo's body. \u00a0If one called him a Fire Spirit, he fit the description now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His entire body had melted away... \u00a0His soul was just boiling like a ball of flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Don't die.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he couldn't even save a single person, how could he claim that he will save earth?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee-ahhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The evil spirits, which circled around Woojin's body, started to crawl forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black evil spirits circled around Sunggoo as they restricted the movement of Sunggoo's soul. \u00a0It was as if they were trying to prevent Sunggoo's soul from escaping.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spread out his two hands, and he didn't move an inch as if he was frozen in place. \u00a0He concentrated then he concentrated again. \u00a0He was making sure the evil spirits couldn't harm Sunggoo's soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was tethering Sunggoo, who wasn't ready to depart from this world. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was when the Gold Dragon Fatooh let out a roar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Red Dragon Leia had died by the Immortal's attack. \u00a0The raging Fatooh landed on the outer wall as it let out a roar. \u00a0Its influence was immediate. \u00a0The monsters, who had been milling about in confusion, stopped for a brief moment before they started gathering around the Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the Dragon wanted to continue the siege. \u00a0It wanted to continue until the World Tree was destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[A mere Dragon dares to bark in front of the king!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis walked forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was letting out a black energy, and his unfiltered murderous intent was rushing out of him. \u00a0As Jaenis continued forward, the heroes of the Coalition was busy retreating from fright.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Black smoke were coalescing one by one behind the Lich as the Death Knights were summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Our lord has given us an order.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ramson accepted Jaenis' words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ah. \u00a0Did everyone hear that?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Is that Yong Yong?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We'll be able to fight to our heart's content.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each of the Death Knights said what they wanted to before they summoned their Skeleton Warriors. \u00a0Hundreds of thousands of Skeletons ripped themselves out of the black abyss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We'll have to kill the Dragon first.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From behind the Lich, several thousand Skeleton Magicians appeared. \u00a0These were the magician troops under his direct command.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Various types of magical spells were shot out at once towards the Gold Dragon Fatooh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-puh-puhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon had its Shield magic engaged, so these attacks couldn't hurt it. \u00a0However, the nearby monsters were hit, and they struggled in pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I won't forgive you, Immortal!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tens or hundreds...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Not much significance was placed on the number of deaths suffered by the Dimensional lords, who lived for a very long time....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leia and Fatooh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it meant a lot for these two beings. \u00a0Weak beings died in the tens or hundreds of times, but they were Dragons before they became Dimensional lords. \u00a0There were only a handful of times where they had experienced death. \u00a0Of course, Fatooh was pissed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fatooh's stomach became engorged as it took a deep breath. \u00a0It wanted to decimate all the Skeletons with its Breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enraged Dragon's mouth was about to head towards the Saurus mountain's peak when the ground shook. \u00a0A big body was running up the mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It's someone from my race!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong smashed through the forest as it jumped on Fatooh's back before it could let out its Breath. \u00a0It looked skinny, but Yong Yong wasn't light at all. \u00a0Its hook-like feet pressed Fatooh's head into the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-roo-roo.... \u00a0What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was probably how a prey felt before being eaten by a predator... \u00a0The two beings matched eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ancient...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Get off....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fatooh's head was crushed when Yong Yong's claws were clenched. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggooh-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Breath and magical energy were mixed within the body, and it exploded forth as if a dam had broken. \u00a0However, even if this maelstrom occurred beneath Yong Yong, it only briefly lifted Yong Yong's body into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Bone Dragon landed on the decimated land, it looked at the numerous monsters in its surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your wish has been granted.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they wished death, he'll grant it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Yong Yong's roar, the monsters started to run away in fright.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It's a hunt!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights summoned their Phantom Steeds, and they swept over the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It has come to an end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone had mumbled out those words, and it acted like a signal. \u00a0The nervousness that was suffocating them was washed away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters were running away... \u00a0Their roars were moving farther away. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there were their injured comrades...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let us sweep the battlefield! \u00a0Please gather the injured!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Skia's first monk Tauric yelled out the instructions. \u00a0Several people came to their senses, and they started gathering their injured comrades, who were moaning in pain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....in the end, we were able to protect this place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Elf Lord 'Silver Arrow' Latasha was already next to Tauric as she spoke. \u00a0He let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He protected it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Immortal had arrived right on time. \u00a0No, he might have been late, but in the end, he was able to protect this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Fire Spirit King... \u00a0Will he live?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm not sure.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was sitting in front of the World Tree as if he was meditating, and there was a flickering flame in front of him. \u00a0The size of the flame was getting smaller, and it seemed to portend the death of the Fire Spirit. \u00a0It was regretful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'He might already be dead...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal was trying his best to save the Fire Spirit. \u00a0The Immortal's expression was so serious that she couldn't express such sentiments.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha looked around her surrounding, and she tilted her head in puzzlement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did the Holy Maiden not come back yet?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric swallowed his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody had left with Woojin, yet he had returned by himself. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if he could ask the Immortal about \u00a0her....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was between a rock and a hard place, so he decided to wait for the Immortal to finish his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It isn't time.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'He is calling for you.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Be strong.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound tickled his ears, so Sunggoo opened his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he couldn't tell if his eyelids were open or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only certain part was the fact that his consciousness was awake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are awake?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[H...hyung.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. \u00a0It's all right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo tried to get up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh uh. \u00a0You should stay still. \u00a0Just look straight up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin quickly gave instructions, and Sunggoo just looked upwards towards Woojin\u2019s face. \u00a0He could tell that Woojin was genuinely worried for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hyung. \u00a0Am I still alive?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are for now. \u00a0However, you are slowly dying.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"First, let me put an insurance in place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Sunggoo was conscious, Woojin quickly made him a vassal of his Dimensional Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo would be the second vassal from earth after Do-jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Hong-sunggoo was appointed as a knight of Alandal.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I became a knight?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. \u00a0Still, you should avoid dying at all cost.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as he implied. \u00a0This was just insurance. \u00a0If things went wrong, Sunggoo could be revived using Points, since he was a vassal of Woojin's Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it wasn't a guarantee that Sunggoo would come back as his old self. \u00a0Moreover, when he died, Sunggoo would lose his inherent ID Code.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he was born, he was given an ID Code for earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was what allowed him to immediately re-enter earth. \u00a0He didn't have to wait for the Synchronization.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he lost his Code, he'll basically be in the same category as the aliens and monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll save you. \u00a0You have two choices.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What is it?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Before you soul is destroyed, I can revive you as a Lich.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why was hyung-him speaking those words with such a serious expression on his face?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[.....do I have another choice?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You can overcome it. \u00a0Your body can fight and win against Dragon's Breath and the curse left behind by the Dragon Language.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Isn't that the better choice?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"However, it'll be painful. \u00a0It'll be very painful, and there is a very low chance of it succeeding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of choices were those? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did his life always drive him into a spot where he had to make such difficult decisions?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hyung. \u00a0I've never been in a romantic relationship...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, who had a very serious expression on his face up until now, smiled for the first time. \u00a0Since he had the time to crack a joke, it seemed Sunggoo had found his equilibrium. \u00a0He was joking around even as his corpse was being destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you become a Lich, you won't lose your Code. \u00a0That is the safer...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[No way.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll do it. \u00a0I'll overcome it]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ll only die after I experience being in a romantic relationship. \u00a0How will I accomplish that if I'm revived as a Skeleton?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's expression hardened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2026 \u00a0He hadn't been joking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out the Dragon's Heart from his Inventory. \u00a0It was a treasure he had been lucky to acquire at Mivich's Laboratory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is only a Dragon's Curse. \u00a0You will overcome it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll overcome the lizard's curse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin placed the Dragon's Heart on top of Sunggoo's soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You'll be able to do it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he had to do it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted avoid becoming a pitiful Dimensional refugee looking for one's home planet Code, he'll have to do it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll overcome the Dragon's Curse even if he had to become a Draconian...</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

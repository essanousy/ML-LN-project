Mother worried about you so much\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Woojin\u2019s back was being slapped, he pondered about what to do. Should he just tell her the truth?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaigo. You spent 5 years playing a game like an addict then you came back!!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Huh huh. That wasn\u2019t it at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, I\u2019m thankful you returned in good health.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought about telling her a little bit more of the truth to resolve the misunderstanding, but he abandoned that idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who cares if she believed this or that?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">I\u2019ve returned home, and his mother was happy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tears flowing from his mother didn\u2019t have any resentment in it. If she held any resentment, it was towards the inhospitable years that had passed them by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hand that was hitting him started losing its strength, and her tear drops became thicker. Woojin cried with her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He cried endlessly as he tried to shed the past 20 years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-ah\u2019s eyes turned round as she asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Why is mother\u2019s eyes so red? Did you cry?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Why would mother cry?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. You did cry. I know why mother cried.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are happy since mother will also be able to eat beef. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Ho ho. You rascal. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m so happy that your oppa bought us beef, so tears came out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could see a glint of tear on his mother\u2019s eyes. It wasn\u2019t from sadness. It was a teardrop of happiness. Woojin grinned slyly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After they left the park, Woojin took Sooah to a meat grilling restaurant. It was rumored to be the best one in the neighborhood. The price was too expensive, so they had never been to the store before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chee-jee-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beef made a delicious sound as Woojin cooked it, and he placed it on Sooah\u2019s dish. While Sooah was chewing on her food, she picked up a piece of meat, and she placed it on her mother\u2019s dish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMom eat this. It\u2019s really delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk, ok. Since Sooah gave it to me, it is more delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother ate a piece of meat then she made a happy smile. Sooah grinned as she looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really like it since oppa came.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally? Do you like oppa since I bought you beef?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah! I like it a lot. Minsoo always make fun of me. He says he always eat a lot of meat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMinsoo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is the richest in our class. That is why he brags about what he eats everyday when he comes to pre-school. He has a lot of toys. His father is a Roused, so he is really rich.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Is that so? Don\u2019t be jealous of that. If Sooah wants something then just tell oppa. I\u2019ll buy it all for you. Oppa is also a Roused.\u201d (TLN:*cough* phrasing\u2026maybe I should have gone for Enlightened as someone suggested)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. Really? Oppa is the best. I like oppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah laughed merrily, but his mother looked like she hadn\u2019t let go of her worries.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m still not sure you should do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m not that weak. Moreover, I won\u2019t do something that is too dangerous, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOppa is in danger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Oppa isn\u2019t in danger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he started to seriously cook some more meat, Woojin took a bottle of soju, and he poured it into his mother\u2019s glass. As if she was still sensitive to such actions, her eyes started to water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy son, who was in his 3rd year in high school, has come back as an adult. You are able to drink alcohol with your mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so, but this is the first time I\u2019m having soju.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? This is the first time my son has drunk soju? You have to learn how to drink alcohol from an adult. Hurry up and take this glass.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time he had soju, but he had drunk a lot of other alcohol. Woojin took the soju cup with a pounding heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggol-gol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou father would have been proud if he saw you. Our son had already grown into an adult. You could drink alcohol with me, and you also bought us meat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they talked about his father, he became melancholy, but it couldn\u2019t even be compared to his mother\u2019s sadness. Woojin drank the entire cup of soju. There was a bite to it. It was quite good, but he was starting to feel the effect of the alcohol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a bitter after taste, and it was quite delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This is pretty good.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know about the other stuff, but the taste of alcohol here was preferable to the ones at the Planet Alphen. As time passes, he\u2019ll look fondly back at his experiences, but he couldn\u2019t do that yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had escaped that hell hole, and he was very happy to be with his family now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet us be happy, mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, my son.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMe too, me too!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In her ignorance, Sooah pushed her cup forward, but he poured her some soda. Then they made a toast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother seemed to be drunk as she kept thanking him. He took the happily smiling Sooah and his mother back home before he headed out again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had withdrawn money from an ATM as they walked the street, and he placed $1000 on top of the kitchen table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to give her all the money he had earned, but he need it for seed money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He needed a certain amount of money to pay for the entrance fee for the higher ranked Dungeons. It would allow him to quickly make money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wanted to move to a decent house soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. This is great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin accompanied his mother and Sooah home. Then he decided to walk the night street. It was 7 o\u2019clock. He taken Sooah to an early dinner, so it was still quite early.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time he drank soju, and the taste continued to linger. He wanted to drink more, but he didn\u2019t want to get drunk by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Twenty years had passed, so instead of thinking about his close friend\u2019s faces, the first face that came to mind was Do-jaemin\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat guy. I have to repay his money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He owed a lot of things to him. Woojin always settled his favors and grudges. He repaid good will, and he took revenge on those he had a grudge against.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was a big help in learning about the changed earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin visited a still open department store, and he entered to buy some presents. He wandered around in his thread-bare clothes, and he smelled of alcohol. Even seeing him like this, the kind salesclerk helped him out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He went towards the cosmetic counter, and with the recommendation from the clerk, he purchased something a high school boy could use.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spent a good amount of money, but he didn\u2019t regret it. While he carried the present, Woojin bought a whole chicken at a fried chicken restaurant. He bought a bottle of soju at the convenience store then he headed towards Jaemin\u2019s house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no response as he pressed on the door bell, so he opened the panel to the door lock mechanism.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dee Dee Dee, Dee! Dee! Dee!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat bastard\u2026 He already changed his passcode?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin could have immediately called Jaemin, but it was about time for Jaemin to come home from his tutoring school. So he just waited.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin flinched in surprise when he saw Woojin standing in front of his front door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are back?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHy\u2026hyung. You came?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let\u2019s eat some chicken together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin stealthily glance towards Woojin. He covered his finger with his other hand before he opened the front door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dee-ro-ri!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin acted naturally as he spread the chicken and plates on top of the kitchen desk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring some glasses.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, wait a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as he took off his backpack, Jaemin brought back some cups. He felt uncomfortable since Woojin came to his house every night, but his mouth watered when he thought about the chicken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was at an age where he liked to eat. Jaemin tried to pour cola into his cup, but Woojin stopped him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, you should have a cup.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Hyung. I\u2019m only a high school student?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSssoop. You can have whatever hyung gives you..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSh\u2026should I?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin filled Jaemin\u2019s cup with soju, and he also filled his cup to the brim with soju. They didn\u2019t have a soju glass, so they poured it into cups. The soju bottle emptied just from filling two cups.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk, let\u2019s drink.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin emptied the cup in a refreshing manner, and he bit into a chicken leg. Jaemin awkwardly turned his head, and he took a sip. Then his face scrunched up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKkkkkk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bitter. It was bitter. Why would anyone drink something like this? Jaemin put a chicken wing in his mouth as he asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWas your visit to the dungeons successful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. Hey, I got you a present.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin opened the shopping bag with a confused face. When he opened it, he saw a bottle of cologne. When he saw the brand, it was a very pricey item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHy\u2026hyung?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop being surprised, you little rascal. This is the money I borrowed from you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out $500 from his wallet. Jaemin\u2019s eyes became round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is too much. You only have to give me what you borrowed. No. To tell you the truth, I don\u2019t want it. Hyung has already done too much for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes. A person should repay kindness. Woojin nodded his head with a satisfied expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, is that why you changed the house\u2019s pass code?.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT, that is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned when he saw the flustered Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe rest is rent fee on top of the borrowed money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Uh? Does this mean he wants to continue to stay here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin couldn\u2019t believe his ears.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

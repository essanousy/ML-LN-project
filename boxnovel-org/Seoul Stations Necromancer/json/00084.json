Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exchanging formalities, Minchan entered the car. The man closed the door and got in the driver's seat on the other side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould I take you to your place of residence?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Please take me to my office.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess you'll have to move your office soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Not yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou just have to select a site for us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll have to listen to the the president's opinion on this matter. Moreover, the contract hasn't been finalized yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan looked at the employee from the Secretariat who had suddenly gone silent. He didn't give it much thought as he looked out the window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had negotiated a lot of the agreement at his own discretion. However, he needed Woojin's input on several issues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the government announced Alandal as Korea's official Defense guild, he would be promised enormous benefits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the benefits discussed was support and assistance in building the guild. This was only one out of the vast benefits that they would receive. Minchan couldn't help but smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u2018The president will like it. If we receive this much, he'll accept the proposal.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if the Cheongwadae had planned this, they had been ready to give the proposal. They promised to give Alandal vast benefits if Alandal could be counted as an organization that defended the nation. The guild would be placed at an unprecedented position in Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to tell others this great news as soon as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddoo-roo-roo-roo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan called Woojin's phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hello?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Why are you answering his phone, Haemin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The president went into the Dungeon with Director Hong and Ms. Che-haesol.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What the hell did you do, director?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. You called me director. I'm the vice president now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It isn't the time to make a joke right now. Korea's Defense guild? What's going on with that?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? How do you know about that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hah. What do you mean how do I know it? They cancelled the daily dramas to send out the breaking news.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan finally realized something was very wrong. He turned to ask the Secretariat employee a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid the press conference from before go out on a live broadcast?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat didn't happen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He responded with a calm voice, but Minchan could tell his voice was slightly different from before. Minchan put on a dismayed expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll head to the office right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes. Please don't sidetrack and go anywhere else. The President seemed to be in a pretty foul mood. How could you commit to such a big deal with only your authority?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think I'm crazy? I would never finalize such a large deal without the approval of the president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What? What are you saying?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan grabbed his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll talk to you when I get there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The press conference was a problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No wonder the Cheongwadae had rushed him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This isn't good.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was present at the dinner that the President and several high ranking officials had attended. He had to apologize several times for his president's absence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal was marked as a guild to be watched by the world. No, it seemed they made such an incredible offer to keep Roused Kahng-woojin in Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal guild would be under the army and would be officially acknowledged as the nation's guard guild. The incredible benefits would come hand in hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the dinner was over, he started discussing the various conditions, benefits, obligations, and welfare regarding the deal. Minchan was tired, but he also felt a thrill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was taking the lead on putting the framework around an incredibly big deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The government reacted in a friendly way, and the people involved were also cooperative. The deal presented to them favored Alandal so much that the actual negotiation didn't take too long. The only thing left was to wait for Woojin's decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the heart of this deal, it wasn't really about Alandal guild. It was about stopping Kahng-woojin from immigrating to a foreign power.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan thought Woojin would accept it if he received such overwhelming benefits from the deal. When Woojin had accepted the deal, they wanted a pre-recorded press conference to immediately send out to the media. He willingly obliged. When the contract was signed, most of the media organizations would immediately publicize the deal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was already broadcasted?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018They are intentionally trying to take the lead.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What the hell were they thinking?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did they think Woojin would have no choice but to accept the deal if they made it look like the deal had been finalized? Or were they being pressured by the neighboring countries?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018This has no chance of succeeding considering president's personality.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did the government have to create such a crude plan? Were they worried so much about Woojin immigrating to another country? Minchan had a headache, so he rubbed at his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to convince him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to find a way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin lived by a code. He gave back whatever he received with interest. Minchan had to work to avoid triggering this rule. If not, it was obvious what Woojin would do considering his personality. He'll probably ransack the Cheongwadae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to continue to live in Korea, then he had to stop such an event from happening. Minchan's worries deepened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Those mother-fucking government employees.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Those, who had always shat their pants, shat their pants.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan suppressed his anger. He started stoking his patriotism, so Korea would be at peace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I hope president is in a good mood.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, Woojin looked like someone who acted based on his feelings, but Minchan knew Woojin had a cold-blooded personality. If he was in a good mood, Minchan would at least be able to broach a subject. Whenever he wasn't in a good mood, Minchan was barely sneak a word in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even Woojin's dispassionate expression gave off a scary vibe. If he was angry, Minchan would be nervous to even speak to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Hoo. I must convince him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The government had made a mess and Minchan had to salvage the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan wanted to live in Korea for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gangnam Statin's 9th Exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a 6 star Dungeon run by a mid-sized guild named Abyss' Magician aka the Abyss guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin had worked quickly to guide the group to a high rank Dungeon with an empty spot in their schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Che-haesol stood in front of the Dungeon, she swallowed her saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With those words, Woojin was the first to enter the Dungeon. Sunggoo followed brimming with energy. Why was Sunggoo so excited at the thought of someone succeeding his post?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease go in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI really have to go in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin put on an incredulous expression at Che-haesol's response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease hurry up and go in. At this rate, the barrier will form.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Haemin's insistence, Che-haesol closed her eyes tight and ran down the stairs leading to the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mother, father, I'll definitely come back alive.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her first Dungeon experience in Alandal would be a 6 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol entered the Dungeon with a stiff expression of nervousness and soon, the barrier formed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIyap!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol balled her hands into tight fists, then looked at her surrounding with her guard up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sunggoo's question, Haesol finally came to her senses. When she responded, Woojin was nowhere to be found and only Sunggoo was left. She felt embarrassed. She awkwardly asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...where's the president?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe's already gone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn't they come in here for a lesson? So why did he suddenly leave Director Hong and her behind?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to move fast if we don't want to be left behind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo dug through his belongings. He took out a sharp short sword and gave it to her. It was sharp enough to pierce through clothing at even the slightest pressure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol's heart quickened when she held the dangerous weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are proficient with the sword?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm more used to a gun than a sword\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, Lieutenant! You are misunderstanding.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo let out a bright smile as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we push forward in a 6 star Dungeon, we will die. Even I can barely face off against couple of the monsters in here. We aren't here to take the lead in the hunt. We'd die in a flash. In a flash.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He is talking about his death, yet he didn't seem nervous at all?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen why are you giving me the sword...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they weren't going to participate in the hunt, and this wasn't some kind of lesson then why did they follow Woojin in here? Why did he give her a sword?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo laughed as he asked her a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou ever gut a fish?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI like fishing, so I've done it several...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh oh! An ace has entered our guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The favorable gaze Sunggoo had been giving Che-haesol intensified.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a brief moment, Haesol understood Sunggoo's reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssskuk, ggahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She sliced, then sliced, and sliced once more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she sliced and cut, the point of the sword would catch on something. It was a bloodstone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Where is\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the repetitive work, Haesol was confused as to whether she got a job in a guild or a construction site.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why am I\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her sore arms were moving almost mechanically now. It seemed like Director Hong-sunggoo was used to extracting the bloodstones. He was disassembling the monsters twice as fast as her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was quick and accurate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's speed this up. At this pace, we'll meet up with hyung-nim before we can reach the bottom floor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had just entered the second floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had no idea where Woojin went. He had disappeared without a trace. She only saw the monster corpses filling up the subway station. During all of this, Sunggoo disassembled the corpses marked with magic, and he took out the bloodstones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What method did the president use to hunt? Why is he so fast?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was rumored Woojin cleared the Dungeons at an amazing pace. If he wanted to, he could clear a 6 star Dungeon in couple hours. He was a monster-like Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector Hong. Where is the president\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow, now. We don't have time for idle chats. Let's hurry up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pook, sskuhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was able to unbend his back only once as he tapped at it. Then he went back to busily disassembling the corpses of monsters. Somehow, she felt pity as she looked at Sunggoo's figure. No, it felt as if she was watching her future self. That must be she felt sad and a little bit bitter in her heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Haesol could pump herself up at excavating the bloodstones, the sound of footsteps rang throughout the underground space. Haesol was very nervous as she gripped her short sword. Haesol had been graded pretty high in her individual combat skill and techniques in the army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh no. Hyung-nim is already coming up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even when she heard Sunggoo's words, Haesol still felt a little bit nervous. She fixed her eyes towards the bottom of the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he was dissatisfied, Woojin had an ill-natured expression on his face as several dozen Skeletons followed behind him....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee kee keek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The several dozen Skeletons all spat out a distinctive sound, a sound that caused goosebumps to form all over Haesol. Even though she knew these Skeletons were Woojin's summons, she froze in place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I'll quickly gather everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's all right. It isn't worth much. Just follow after me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was still one more floor below them, and it was filled with monster corpses. If they excavated every one of them, their profit would increase by several hundred thousand dollars. It wasn't a pittance. However, Woojin decided to choose time over money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Even if I kill all the monsters, I think it'll be impossible to level up?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He calculated how much of his Achievement Points and EXP rose as he cleared the Dungeon, and it wouldn't be possible for him to reach level 70. If he couldn't reach it in one run, then he had to clear the Dungeon again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As Woojin quickly headed towards the Dungeon entrance, Sunggoo tapped Haesol on the shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing? Let's hurry up and follow after him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? Yes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol couldn't help but be shocked at the sight of all the Skeletons following after Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The number of summoned beings controlled by a single person...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She gave a quick count, and she came up with a rough figure of 100.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She would have to take a look at the fighting capability of each Skeleton, but there were so many of them....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He hadn't been hunting alone.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if she had snuck a peek at the secret of Woojin's amazing Dungeon clear time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they arrived at the entrance, Woojin was placing his hand phone and any modern items to one side. As if Sunggoo was used to this, he took out his handphone, wallet, and car key. His personal items were gathered into a pile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol looked on with a confused expression. Sunggoo spoke as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe clothes Ms. Haesol is wearing isn't made out of Dungeon ingredients?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. They are regular clothes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen it won't be able to pass through the portal. Only your naked body would be transferred.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT...Then...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol recalled the information regarding the high rank Dungeons. Only the other world's items were able to pass through the portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWear this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin purchased the cheapest clothes in his Point Store and tossed it to Haesol. She had seen a similar robe in a movie. Woojin spoke as she changed into the outfit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunggoo, you should capture several suitable monsters and help Haesol practice her Taming skill.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be great to check on the result of Sunggoo's training, and Woojin would have liked to hunt with him. However, Woojin had to reach level 70 as soon as possible. It would be best to monopolize most of the prey to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go. Let's go fill our stomach over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't hesitate as he passed through the portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol had ears, and so she heard what Woojin had said. Her education would be finally starting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The high rank Dungeon started for real when one crossed the portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol swallowed her saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo we are going to start in earnest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Start in earnest my ass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if they go over to the other side, they'll be excavating bloodstones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why should he repeat his words a hundred times? She'd know when she experiences it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm hungry. Let's hurry up and go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo passed through the portal and Haesol followed after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The feeling of passing through the twisted crack in the dimension gave her a fresh shock. Her head was dizzy and she felt nauseous. It induced a typical reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-wehhhhhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. Please follow us when you've calmed down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo quickly jumped back since he was worried the vomit would splash on him. He quickly ran towards Woojin. Haesol continued to throw up several times, then wiped her mouth after spitting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh ooh ooh ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After her insides calmed down a little, her headache cleared a little bit. She looked around her surrounding as she came back to her senses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Heeyah.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was in a forest. It was something she would have never seen in Seoul, Korea. It felt as if she was dropped in the middle of the a nature preserve.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The high rank Dungeons were connected to a different world and she was there. She couldn't believe it. While she was reveling in this new experience, she saw something unimaginable unfold in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? If you've calmed down a little bit, hurry up and come over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol looked at Sunggoo, who was urging her forward, and rubbed both her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was she seeing things?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were camping at a Dungeon\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A mystery meat was being cooked over the campfire, the smell of which made Haesol's mouth water.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

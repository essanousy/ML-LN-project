These guys made an appointment at the Gwachun Station\u2019s 6th exit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich guild does the Dungeon belong to?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are owned by the Hwarang guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey are acting no better than poor noobs. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t possible for an F ranked Roused to attempt a 4 star Dungeon. How could they not know such a basic thing? They just blindly made an appointment. It seemed they were nothing more than amateurs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he hadn\u2019t verified their abilities himself, so it made him more curious. How much confidence do they have for them to attempt a 4 star Dungeon with only the two of them?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo we have a 4 star Dungeon near there\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe do. It is the Chungsa station\u2019s 11th exit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s right next door. Is there an appointment around that time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. It is scheduled for a training session for our new recruits.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTell them to go elsewhere. Empty the schedule over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want to catch a fish, then one has to throw in the chum. The bait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He always talked about fishing. Kim-haemin grumbled inside, then he started modifying the schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou come with me to Gwachun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d (TLN:lost in translation. Nae=yes. Haemin changed it to nae-ee)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSssoop. I\u2019ll go to the market. Prepare everything for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, Yes.\u201d (TLN: he change nae to Nwei)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin replied in a playful manner. Minchan hit him as he got up. Haemin was an asshole, but he trusted Haemin the most on his team. He was quick on the uptake, and he took care of business fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Haemin reached the Gwachun station at the appointed time. However, Woojin had bumped into a precarious situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAren\u2019t you only a F ranked Roused? Why are you here at a 4 star Dungeon? Moreover, there is only two of you\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Didn\u2019t I say it was all right? I am very confident that we could do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, you can\u2019t go in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take any responsibility for what happens to us. Just let us in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you want to suicide, then go to the Hangang River. Why are you doing this over here? No. The regulation says so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bureau employee blocked his way, and he wasn\u2019t budging. Sunggoo returned to Woojin with a hopeless expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyung-nim. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to go in. I\u2019m sorry. I should have found out everything about this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo blamed himself since he had been too excited about signing his car contract yesterday. His earnings had significantly increased, but that was only possible since Woojin had gave away his earnings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, we can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll cover the lost appointment fee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It cost him $2,000 just to make an appointment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person in charge of the appointment never thought that 2 Ranked F would try to raid this Dungeon. The employee thought Sunggoo was making an appointment at the behest of an organization. This was why he accepted the appointment request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a unique experience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to write-off today. I\u2019ll have to go to the Bureau to renew my rank. See if there is a 3 star Dungeon nearby.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had an apologetic face. He was about to move quickly when it happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh my. We meet again in such a place?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan had a surprised expression on his face, and he approached Woojin and Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat a coincidence. I\u2019m sorry, but what\u2019s going on? If it\u2019s possible, I would like to lend a hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo told Minchan about their situation. Minchan put on his thinking face, then he secretly glanced at Woojin to see how he was reacting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin could see through Jung-minchan\u2019s intent, so he grinned. Coinicidence? Bullshit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gestured with his chin towards Sunggoo. It basically meant for Sunggoo to talk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggo gave a detailed explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what if we do this? Our guild\u2019s Dungeon is located at the next station. I\u2019ll let you use that place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Hy\u2026hyung-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo turned to looked at Woojin, and he waited for Woojin to make a decision. Woojin nonchalantly asked a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sure you expect no return for the favor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust a favorable impression toward us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan put on a friendly smile. This caused Woojin to laugh with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll use it with thanks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are very straightforward.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan smiled as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His reaction was softer than yesterday.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, he might not be a psycho in the first place. Yesterday\u2019s reaction might be an exception to the norm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan yelled in delight inside his heart as he escorted Woojin and Sunggoo. When they left, the dispatched employee of the Hwarang guild quickly made a call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader. Jung-michan came here not too long ago. He took two rank F Roused away, and he treated them like royalty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What are you saying all of a sudden?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Recently, two ranked F wanted to enter the 4 star Dungeon. They were being unreasonable, and argumentative. Do you remember the Team leader from the Hammer guild, who tried to act all elegant? He took the two Rank F to somewhere else. No, he pretty much escorted them out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[If that bastard Jung-minchan moved then something is fishy\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRight? It seems those bastards have something up their sleeves? The F ranks tried to attempt a 4 star Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[First, let\u2019s end the call. I\u2019ll try to find out some information about them.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwarang guild\u2019s Support team leader also started to get busy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Gwachun Station and the Gwachun City Hall Station wasn\u2019t that far away. They walked for a short amount of time as they conversed, and they were able to arrive at their destination in no time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you join our guild, you could have prevented such minor things from happeing in advance. Moreover, you could raise your Roused rank in a flash with us. Our guild is well known for giving a lot of support to our Roused.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During the brief walk, Minchan had repeated numerous selling points of the Hammer guild. Woojin knew what was happening. This was the price for his favor. Woojin was expected to listen to him prattle on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So, he decided to just listen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. That seems quite convenient?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt really is convenient. If one needs money then money is provided. If one needs an artifact then an artifact will be given. You will be provided with any support you want. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin replied to humor him a little bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe members of the Hammer Guild must really like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. Thank you for acknowledging our guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He somewhat spoke the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, we are already here. Please be at ease as you use this Dungeon. You don\u2019t have to pay the fees for its use.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that also a favor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fees for the 4 star Dungeons were known for being very high. However, he said he won\u2019t charge us at all, so it was a pretty significant favor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t hesitated as he agreed to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll gratefully accept it. How about that public employee over there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll quickly work to adjust Woojin-nim and Sunggoo-nim\u2019s ranks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose are some welcoming words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s answer, Minchan smiled inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were no favors without a string attached to it. No. Even if he didn\u2019t want something back, the favor he gave would put a favorable light in their heart for the Hammer guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If someone bought you a meal, then you\u2019ll naturally wonder if you have to buy the other person a meal the next time. It was human nature to feel this burden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, Woojin would think more highly of the Hammer guild compared to the other guilds. When one builds a fire, one had to be sure to build a proper one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease wait a moment. I\u2019ve prepared a present for the two of you..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-ooh. You also got us a present?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t show any signs of refusing the present. Michan yelled in delight inside his heart. As a Roused, his potential ability was mind-boggling, but Woojin was still a 24 year old cub.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could tell Woojin hadn\u2019t had much of a societal life. He unhesitatingly took everything just because it was given. Minchan was sure now. This opponent had basically climbed on top of his palms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen please wait for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan went to the car he had parked nearby to pick up the present. While Minchan was doing this, Kim-haemin turned towards the two. He tried to start a friendly conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehe. Mr. Woojin seems very different from yesterday.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-ooh. I was too scared to start a conversation with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed at Haemin\u2019s brashness. His head was a mess yesterday, because he was thinking about Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYesterday I wasn\u2019t feeling so well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehe. You must be a man who act on his feelings. Now that I see you today it seems you have a good personality. Do you want to have some soju after this ends?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019ll be great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. He\u2019ll welcome soju anytime.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin tactfully praised Woojin and Sunggoo. He tried hard to match their moods.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo could only shake his head when he saw them act like this. They were trying hard to fawn over Woojin, but would he actually join the guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018These guys are barking up the wrong tree. Tsk tsk.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo felt sorry for Minchan and Haemin. They were purposefully trying to be on the same beat as Woojin. Woojin wasn\u2019t evil, but he didn\u2019t have a conscience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo thought his hyung-nim looked splendid when he acted that way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, I\u2019m getting bored waiting for him. Tell him to give me the present after I come back out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. You want to do that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll see you later. We\u2019ll talk over some soju.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehe. I\u2019ll take you to a great place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo quickly descended the stairway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe gave you plenty of time for your appointment. Fighting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned and he disappeared as he waved his hand. As he watched them disappear in to the barrier, Kim-haemin smiled brightly, and he waved his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, Haemin felt a terrifying sensation. His neck retreated into itself like a turtle then he turned his head to his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Waa, his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Team leader Jung-minchan was frowning as he glared at Haemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. What the hell are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m seeing them off?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A vein popped out on Jung-michan\u2019s forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I\u2019ll go get the present?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Weren\u2019t\u2026weren\u2019t you going to wait for them to clear it before you were going to give it to them? Just give it to them when they come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Haemin\u2019s words, Jung-minchan felt himself raise his hand in anger. He was barely able to hold himself back. He dropped the bag he brought on the floor. The large sports-bag let out a thump as it fell on to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was quite heavy, so the impact ripped the zipper open, and the content was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were water filters, first-aid kit, cloth and a seeker. Moreover, it held a map with the location of the Return stone, and a Dungeon guide with the location of the enemy\u2019s position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018A survival kit?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 1~3 star Dungeons were low level Dungeons. The 4~6 star Dungeons were high ranked Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t simply about the classification of high rank and low rank. There was a fundamental difference in the structure of the Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The present Jung-minchan had prepared was none other than a survival kit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe F ranked bastards came to attempt a high ranked Dungeon, but how much do you think they know about the high ranked Dungeons?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat, that is\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin\u2019s face was turning pale. The recommended team composition for attacking a 4 star Dungeon was to have a Rank C team leader. The rest of the Roused team had to be at least Rank D.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, only two of them entered without any information about the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t a favor any more. We basically cornered them into the jaws of death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A 4 star Dungeon with no information about it\u2026. It was a horrifying situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin spoke carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo\u2026do you think they\u2019ll come back alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey basically went into jungle barehanded.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin\u2019s face turned white. From the beginning, he should have said it was a survival kit instead of a present. Minchan and Haemin didn\u2019t speak for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExscuse me, team leader. What if they do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happens if they do come back alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had gone to the jungle barehanded. Moreover, if they returned alive from a place crawling with monsters, and it was only the two of them instead of a team\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the very least, they will be Rank B.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan\u2019s face turned dark as he spat out those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoreover, they\u2019ll probably be filled with animosity. They won\u2019t have any goodwill towards our guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had cornered them into the jaws of death without giving them any proper information. No, he wouldn\u2019t be able to say anything if they accused him of pushing them in a trap after digging it. They would also be reprimanded from the Roused Affairs Bureau.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the surface, it looked like they had thrown two rank F Roused into a 4 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. Hurry up and tell them to change their Roused rank right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan\u2019s sigh made Haemin more timid.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p>&lt;You have enter the Gwachun City Hall Station\u2019s 11th exit.&gt;</p><br/><p>&lt;This Dungeon has already been captured. The basic monsters will be summoned.&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo steadily went down to the lower floors. Woojin defeated the monsters, and he searched for the bloodstones. Then he marked the corpses with his Marking magic. Sunggoo followed after him, and he cut open the monster\u2019s corpses to bag the bloodstones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had been nervous since this was a 4 star Dungeon, but the monsters were much weaker than they had expected. It was on the same level as the monsters from the 2 star and 3 star Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really sure this is a 4 star Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not sure\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t fought against the monsters, so he had no idea. Even the 2 star monsters had been a tough opponent for Sunggoo. Therefore, he could\u2019t tell the difference. Woojin said they were weak, so he just took Woojin\u2019s words at face value.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaybe this Dungeon is more easier than the average Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, who knows? Let\u2019s quickly dispatch them then we could head out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin cleared the lowest floor where the subway train would be parked then he used his Search magic. For the first time since he had entered the Dungeons, Woojin was taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? The Return Stone isn\u2019t here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? That can\u2019t be\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo stopped extracting the bloodstones. He approached Woojin with a worried expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe my Search Skill level is too low?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he increased the Search Skill level, it would only increase the search radius. If an item was hidden in a secret location, he had to learn a higher ranked magic. This required one to be a Magician class.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. Well, let\u2019s search again as we head back. Extract the rest of the bloodstones.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was suspicious as to whether this Dungeon was really a 4 star. The quality of the monster here was subpar. He had a method that could accurately measure this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Achievement Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters of Rakwi quality gave 3 Achievement Points. The bloodstone drop rate wasn\u2019t that high, but there were a lot of them. He thought it would be better to attack a spot where a lot of Rakwis spawned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve excavated them all, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let\u2019s search for the Return Stone as we head toward the Station\u2019s entrance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Return Stone doesn\u2019t always come out from the monster\u2019s corpse. It could be hidden in various locations. This was why Woojin retraced his steps, and he used the Search Magic again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even as he approached the entrance, there was no trace of the Return Stone. He suddenly felt uneasy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we ascend here, it\u2019ll be the entrance\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo mumbled to himself. When they climbed the stair, a portal emitting a red light formed in front of the barrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeeee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It let out a strange sound. Woojin and Sunggoo looked at it with a queer expression on their faces.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

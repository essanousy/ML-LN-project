Everyday her workload increased, and each day felt more daunting as time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door to the dormitory opened. Her roommates, Haejin and Nayoung, came in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. Unni did a good job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. You guys also did a good job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haejin and Nayoung were both 21 years old. Jiwon was a 24 year old unni, but they weren\u2019t comfortable with the age difference. They might also be uncomfortable with her appearance. They got along well with each other, and they excluded her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnni. We will wash first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. You guys do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon opened her hand-phone to take a brief break. After a hard day of work, she always read webtoons for a brief respite. Then she read short romance novellas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon let her imagination run wild as she thought of herself as the protagonist inside her romance novella.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sudden Dungeon Shock kill her parents during the 3rd year of her high school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the Dungeon Shock, the subsequent Dungeon Breaks put Seoul into turmoil. Jiwon had almost died on that day, but she was barely saved by an unknown Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She remembered the Roused\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t have any way of meeting him again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the cost of being saved was high. She had lost too many things.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was called a goddess, and she was the object of everyone\u2019s attention. She had been haughty, and she had rejected every single guy, who had confessed to her. However, her life had crashed in an instant, and everyone looked at her as if she was a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Or they would look at her in pity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No man would ask her out just from pity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Jiwon had never dated before, and the novellas made Jiwon\u2019s heart flutter. After she got off work, it was her sole comfort.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, this one\u2019s fun. This author always ends it at the most entertaining part.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had finished reading couple tantalizing novellas, but her dormitory dongsaengs were still using the restroom. Jiwon had some time left, so she started reading articles on the portal site.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? It\u2019s Woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She clicked on the hottest news article. She saw Woojin\u2019s picture on the first screen, and Jiwon\u2019s face unwittingly became red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if he wasn\u2019t satisfied something, Woojin\u2019s sour face made her laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh. Woojin is incredibly famous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The portal\u2019s main page was half adorned with articles about Woojin. He was that hot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Kang-woojin\u2019s Guild Alandal registered.

Our 3rd year Korean history teacher spoke about him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was fascinating, and exciting to see someone Jiwon knew become famous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had shared alcohol with such a person couple days ago. It felt like she was keeping a secret the public didn\u2019t know. It was a novel feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After she read over the articles for awhile, she got up then she opened the closet next to her bed. There were numerous hat of various colors stacked inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hats were an essential item she couldn\u2019t live without.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst all of them, there was a hat that occupying the corner of the closet by itself. The hat had transparent tapes on the side with several strands of hair clinging on to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She thought about what happened couple days ago, and Jiwon smile automatically.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">People filled with prejudice always stared at her with pity and disgust. She had lived through it for the past 5 years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had met an alumni of her high school after 5 years, and Kang-woojin was like the protagonists inside the novellas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s about time Jaemin gets off school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon always called Jaemin around the time he got off. He was her only family member, and the only reason why she continued on living.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Uh, noonah.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Are you sick? What\u2019s wrong with your voice?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was sick. His heart hurt. Ha-ah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Nothing.

I\u2019ve arrived at the tutoring school. Do you mind if I end the call?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Study hard. I\u2019m busy this week, so I won\u2019t be able to visit you during the weekend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ok. I understand.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon ended the call, and her face was flush.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did he want to know? Why did Woojin ask Jaemin for her number?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s such a big deal. She\u2019s still pretty.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s words were still fresh in her ears. She was sure she had heard him say it. It wasn\u2019t something she misheard when she was drunk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe Woojin\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. No way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There are those that date ugly women, but there weren\u2019t anyone who would date a monster. She squashed the sense of anticipation that was trying to rear its head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Click.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door to the restroom opened. Haemin and Nayoung came out, and when they saw Jiwon in front of her closet, they were startled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, unni!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know we are in our rooms, but can\u2019t you wear your hat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right, unni. You should have some manners. We were surprised.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. Ok..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon hurriedly covered her face as she gathered her towel. She went into the restroom. Jiwon turned on the shower then she started to undress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh whew. That orc bitch. She surprised me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, really. When I save some more money, the first think I\u2019ll do is leave this dorm. Every time I see her my heart trembles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can she live with such a face? If it was me, I would have killed myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They spoke as if they intended for Jiwon to hear everything. Jiwon soundlessly undressed. When she took off everything, Jiwon\u2019s body was beautiful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of water from the shower wasn\u2019t enough, so she also turned on the washbasin\u2019s faucets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Swahhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She placed both her hands on the washbasin as she stood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had heard those words ad nauseam, but those words hurt much more today. It sounded like they were saying she didn\u2019t have the right to pursue anyone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddook, ddoo-dook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her sad tears joined the flowing water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one understood her\u2026\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monster inside the mirror cried more sadly today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Sunggoo finished gathering everything, he let out a sigh. Then he headed towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I\u2019ve gathered them all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, who had been resting, put all the loot Sunggo had gathered into his inventory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Your hunting speed is much faster than before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course. He had already almost reached level 33.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLess Artifacts are starting to show up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim. It seems we gathered most of the Artifacts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sunggoo\u2019s answer, Woojin cleared his palate in regret. He gathered only 3 Artifacts this run.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go out now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin and Sunggoo left the Dungeon, Woo-soonghoon was waiting for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector Jung sent me. I was told to wait for president to come out, then I\u2019m tasked to bringing you back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Jung-minchan had sent Soonghoon as a chauffeur.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere is Director Jung?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seemed the guild was approved, so he\u2019ll be back in the office after he visits the Management Bureau.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen, I\u2019ll bring the car around now, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon disappeared, and Sunggoo asked a question he had wanted to ask for awhile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. How did you get acquainted with Mr. Soonghoon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe sold me a hand phone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The parking lot was right next door. Soonghoon drove the car out, and he started honking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. The reporters in the front should get out of way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw Soonghoon disperse the reports with his honking, cold sweat ran down Sunggoo. He put someone who sold him a hand phone into the position of founding member?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin approached the car, Soonghoon got off to open the backdoor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease get on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin and Sunggoo tried to enter the car, the reporters charged forward like a swarm of bees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kang-woojin. I\u2019ve heard you aren\u2019t taking appointments for the Seoul National University Station\u2019s 6th exit yet. When are you going to open it up for the public?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kang-woojin\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the reporters\u2019 torrent of questions, Woo-soonghoon put on a menacing expression, then he started to shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Get out of the way. They just finished clearing a Dungeon, so they are tired. Please request an interview through the official channels in our guild. If you continue this close coverage, we will respond with legal suits against the relevant media outfits. We aren\u2019t taking any questions right now. Please step back. I\u2019ve memorized everyone\u2019s face. Even if you request an official interview, I\u2019ll remember you all. I\u2019m very capable of holding a grudge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters were already sick of Woo-soonghoon\u2019s rapid-fire words, so they retreated. Woo-soonghoon lightly got into the driver\u2019s seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector Jung said he is going to sue the media companies?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe won\u2019t, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? He won\u2019t?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI lied.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Uh, good job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s praise caught Woo-soonghoon\u2019s ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease allow me to serve you, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA\u2026all right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already folded his store. He\u2019ll give himself completely to the guild. Woo-soonghoon grabbed the handle as a sense of duty filled him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three days had passed. He had cleared the Dungeons 9 times, and the clear time recorded on the last raid was 2 hours and 49 minutes. This caused the reporters to busily write articles, and release them in droves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an unprecedented event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-woojin hadn\u2019t met the number 1 ranked Roused of Korea, but he was frequently being compared to Kim-gangchul now. No, he was being compared to the famous Roused of the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The person in question, Kang-woojin, showed no interest in the subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He sat on the sofa inside the president\u2019s room, and he was eating snacks out of a full basket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;\u2018Sound Mushroom\u2019 was ingested.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;\u2018Strength of Determination\u2019 was absorbed.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;\u2018Raenin\u2019s Blood\u2019 was absorbed.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The medicines that increased Stat couldn\u2019t be taken infinitely. The body needed time to accept the medicine, and the time needed increased every time a medicine was taken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took Raenin\u2019s Blood and Chen\u2019s Sagacity. They both increased Vitality, and he had taken them in succession. It would take a long time for the items to be digested.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin ate a variety of medicines, which increased other Stats. Some could be eaten again after 2 hours, and others took a whopping 17 days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo watched Woojin eat the Reinforcement Stones like candy, and he gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That one is worth 200 thousand, 170 thousand, and that one is worth 500 thousand dollars.\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was a money eating hippo. A money eating hippo was in front of Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin felt Sunggoo\u2019s gaze on him, so he spoke in a sly manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? You want some too\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN\u2026no. How could I\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The medicine called the Reinforcement Stones were being purchased by Director Jung in his spare times. There was a delay period in ingesting it, so he couldn\u2019t ingest all of them at once. Still, he could give couple to Sunggoo without feeling the loss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had to follow him, and do the odd jobs for him. If he became stronger, his survivability would increase. Moreover, Woojin wouldn\u2019t have to worry about him as much.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEat this, this and this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin picked the medicines that would increase \u2018Strength\u2019, \u2018Agility\u2019 and \u2018Stamina\u2019. He handed it over to Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT\u2026thank you, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was moved. He bowed to express his thanks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he became stronger, then he could carry more loot. If his Agility increased, he\u2019ll be able to pick up items faster. If his Stamina increased, then he could work more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll give you couple medicines you\u2019ll need.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI, Hong-sunggoo, realize it was a blessing to have met hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right, director of miscellaneous work. Hurry up and eat these.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, the title described exactly what he did, but couldn\u2019t he call him something else?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector of miscellaneous work will try it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo acted as if he had received the medicine from his king. He started absorbing each of the medicine with an expression of ecstasy on his face. Woojin grinned then he took out his hand phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened the Messenger program then he pressed the chat window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chat with Do-jiwon-nim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">1[It\u2019s me.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">1[Isn\u2019t this Do-jiwon?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">1[Why don\u2019t you answer your phone?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. She hadn\u2019t seen this either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The avatar had a picture of her and Jaemin. He was sure he had contacted Do-jiwon, but she wasn\u2019t picking up her phone or responding to his messages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. What the hell? Whether I give her the medicine or not, I can\u2019t do anything unless I meet her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke to himself, and Sunggoo replied back. Suggoo\u2019s face had turned red as he was absorbing the Reinforcement stones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes? What are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m talking about Jiwon. She isn\u2019t answering her phone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf she is on her shift at the factory, she won\u2019t be able to use her phone. Still, it\u2019s Saturday, so isn\u2019t she off today?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJaemin said she\u2019s too busy to come this weekend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.

D..did something happen that day?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat day\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned when he thought about the day when the three of them ate beef entrails.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWas she angry because of the tape\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe hat kept falling off so I taped it on her..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.

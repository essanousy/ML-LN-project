Thank you and enjoy~)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Come over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk, huk. Thank you for your hard work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mind and body was very tired, but Sunggoo still bowed first. Woojin grinned when he saw this. This is why he liked this guy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sungoo was hurt in various locations, and blood was coming out of the wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sent one soul that was part of his Spirit Armor towards Sunggoo to heal his wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s wound was healed. As his stamina returned, a little bit of color returned to his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin brought out two Skill Books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust learn these first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo received the two books. His eyes widened when he felt the quiet magical energy being emitted by the books.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Aren\u2019t these Skill Books?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s Accelerate and Steel Skin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accelerate increased one\u2019s quickness for a brief moment. He already possessed the armors with the Skill, yet he was lucky enough to pick up the Skill Book within the Naga Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he found the Steel Skin inside the Temple of the Giants.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you. Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed his dream of becoming a Flame magician was slowly drifting away from him, but somehow he had already learned several abilities\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me, hyung-nim. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if I focused on one or two abilities?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was asking an obvious question. As a Roused, there was a limit on how much energy(magic, vitality) he possessed. Even if he had numerous abilities, it didn\u2019t guarantee he\u2019ll be able to use all of it well.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s ok. If you want to live then you\u2019ll eventually learn how to use them..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and learn it. Let\u2019s go for another run after we sell the blood stones.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo injected his magic into the Skill Book. The Skill Book disappeared as it dissolved into light, and it was absorbed into Sunggoo. The knowledge and the sense of the Skill came into his head, and it made Sunggoo\u2019s body shiver.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry using it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo immediately moved his body. The sudden movement was so fast that it would be hard to track the movement with the human eyes. The consumption of magic was much lower than using an Artifact, so Sunggoo\u2019s face was filled with surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLearn this too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sunggoo learned the Steel Skin, Woojin spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive me your arm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sunggoo raised his arm, Woojin summoned a Bone Spear. Sunggoo\u2019s eyes widened in surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA\u2026are you going to hit me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry activating the Steel Skin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sunggoo activated his Steel Skin, it felt as if his entire body had stiffened. Moreover, it felt as if he was in a dream floating in mid-air. He had a harder time controlling his body. It was a temporary sensation one felt when one\u2019s senses became duller.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggah-ahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin swung his Bone Spear, and it rebounded when it hit Sunggoo\u2019s arm. Woojin smiled in satisfaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018At the very least, his survival will be guaranteed this way.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin dismissed all the Skeleton Soldiers in the surrounding as he spoke to Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet go out then come back in again. This time you are in charge of getting rid of all the goblins.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Stop being such a baby..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had merely been a month. No. It felt longer since he had spent a lot of time within the Dungeon. However, it had been only 1 month in real time since Sunggoo had met Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been a Rank F Roused, who had almost died from a single Electric Shock from a Hobgoblin. Now he had grown enough to take care of those caliber of monsters on his own.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be a Rank A within one month.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo didn\u2019t think of Woojin\u2019s words as a joke. Sunggoo suddenly felt some emotion surge up from his chest. Large guild? He didn\u2019t need them any more. The place he will bury his bones was in Kahg-woojin\u2019s guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo continued to clear the Dungeon for 2 days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were heading back to Seoul in Sunggoo\u2019s car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were large dark circles underneath Sunggoo\u2019s eyes. His hair was a mess like a magpie\u2019s nest. Two days\u2026 No, he hadn\u2019t slept for 8 days. The accumulated fatigue pressed down at his shoulders, but his eyes were overflowing with confidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had learned several Skill Books given to him by Woojin. Kim-haemin, who had been on standby in Daegoo, was ordered to acquire Skill Books as he was sent back to Seoul. It was to aid his growth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every one of the Skills would be learned by Sunggo. The Skill Books had already been purchased for Sunggoo yesterday, and it would be there when he arrived at Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Sunggoo had personally grabbed the steering wheel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt full even if he hadn\u2019t eaten anything. However, he couldn\u2019t help becoming sleepy. Earth was unlike the Dungeons where he had to fight with his life on the line. As the tension disappeared, the sleepiness he had been holding at bay came to him all at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahhhhm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was laying down in the passenger seat with his eyes closed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t blame Woojin either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to drive the car even if he wanted to. So it was all up to Sunggoo\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Seven Valley Rest Stop 5km Ahead]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo tried to shake off his sleepiness by making the rest stop his destination. He drove as he forcefully opened his eyes. When Sunggoo\u2019s car entered the rest stop, Woojin eyes opened as if he was some ghost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou weren\u2019t sleeping, hyung-nim?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was just closing my eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had thought Woojin had been asleep\u2026 Did he guess wrong?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you sleepy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I am a little bit. I\u2019ll go buy some coffee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ahm. Let\u2019s go together. Let\u2019s eat something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was middle of the night, so cold breeze blew across the rest stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The stores outside was closed since it was deep into the night. However, the rest area\u2019s convenient store and the restaurant was open for business. Woojin and Sunggoo ordered udon and ramen. They waited for their orders for a brief moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo kept nodding off, so he separated a single soul from his Spirit Armor. He sent it towards Sunggoo to recover his vitality. It immediately banished Sunggoo\u2019s tiredness, and it made him feel refreshed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it wasn\u2019t for Woojin\u2019s Soul Extraction Skill, Sunggoo wouldn\u2019t have been able to last for 8 days within the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you. Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His physical fatigue was gone, but Sunggoo\u2019s mental fatigue was still there. Woojin took a big bite of the udon. He spoke after he swallowed the food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou physical fatigue is gone. You won\u2019t fall asleep. Your weak mind is the one wishing for rest. I don\u2019t care if you use hypnosis or another method, but you need to overcome this at any cost. If there is a protracted war, it is common for one to not be able to sleep for 10 days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was there some reason why he would have to spend over 10 days awake inside the Dungeon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most Dungeon Breaks were resolved in one day using strong weapons to overwhelm the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin drank the udon soup, and he burst out laughing when he saw the tv mounted on the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe really resembles someone I knew before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrom where?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo turned around to see the tv, and his mouth fell open when he saw the elf woman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHee-yah. She is really pretty. She really is an elf.\u201d (TLN: I\u2019ll use lower case e if elf is used as a compliment.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe isn\u2019t an Elf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t she beautiful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNot all Elves are beautiful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In Korea, a pretty woman is sometimes called an elf. Sunggoo was going retort, but he swallowed his words. He looked at Woojin\u2019s expression, and it seemed Woojin didn\u2019t know about the term elf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Or maybe he knew a lot about the Elf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Sunggoo was swallowing his words, Woojin was busily moving his chopsticks. He ate the rest of the noodle then he downed a cup of water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and eat. The guys are waiting for us, so we have to get their quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. His title included being a Roused and a Director yet\u2026 He didn\u2019t receive any help from the Support Division, and he had to drive himself. The Support Division only had 3 people, so they were short on working hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even when supporting just two Roused, it required a decent number of employees from the Support group. Also, the Guild Alandal could afford to hire these employees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Let\u2019s hire some employee when we return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust eat the ramen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Sunggoo hadn\u2019t said it, Woojin had been thinking about it. If it\u2019s the Support Division, he would leave it to Minchan. However, Woojin thought about gathering the Roused, who might potentially become his comrades on the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll pick several promising candidates, and I could teach them.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then those Roused could teach the next new batch of candidates. Sunggoo will probably be the only one he had to attentively teach. The rest could be taken care by Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he saw Sunggoo hurriedly slurp down the ramen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEat slowly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. Yes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silly guy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he too kind to become tenacious? Now that he had tried teaching Sunggoo, Woojn was a bit surprised at how well Sunggoo moved. Sunggoo had a good sense for battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin retracted his gaze from Sunggoo then he looked at the rest stop\u2019s TV. The woman he had observed before was using magic. She made a cripple stand, and she gifted an arm to an arm-less man\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This woman was quite similar to the woman inside Woojin\u2019s memory, and she took similar actions to that woman. He stopped himself from unconsciously murmuring. Then he let out a sigh when he read the caption located on the lower half of the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Melody?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What? Why was she here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did she come here through the Dimensional Guardian like him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she had surrendered to Trahnet like the orcs and cyclops, then she might have come over to earth to\u2026. To him, she was merely a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Numerous questions started to fill the inside of Woojin\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then he came to a single decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to go ask her?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed he would have to go to the US.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ah. Thank you for your hard work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sunggoo parked at the office building, Woojin gave him another soul for energy. It was 2 AM, but all the guild members were waiting for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan greeted Woojin, and it seemed Minchan had been waiting to say something to him. However, Woojin was quicker in telling Minchan his request.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFind out about airplanes heading towards the US..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, how did you find out about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What nonsense is he spouting again?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan read Woojin\u2019s expression, and he spoke in a puzzled voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWeren\u2019t you talking about the invite to the consortium?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Give me the details.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Titan guild rescued a person from inside a Dungeon not too long ago. She is called the Holy Maiden Melody. Not long after president when into the Dungeon the video of her showed up on the internet. It has started a big conversation. The Titan guild revealed this information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin already knew about it. He had seen it on the rest stop\u2019s TV not too long ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Titan guild is requesting the guilds of the world to head towards this consortium to discuss this matter. I was going to ask you if you are going to accept the invitation, but it seems you are planning to go already?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, just purchase me a ticket. I\u2019ll have to go meet Melody.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard Woojin\u2019s words, he was worried Woojin would make another accident again. However, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He just had to pray that nothing would come out of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, did anything unusual happen? Did you acquire everything I asked for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, we acquired everything. Mmm. There are also several things I have to go over with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan hadn\u2019t gotten off work even around dawn, since he had information he had to tell Woojin as soon as he arrived at Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour mother knows now. I tried to block it from her, but it was such a large incident\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat does she know now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe knows president had successfully cleared the 6 star Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghh. What did she say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe worried a lot. Why don\u2019t you go to your home instead of student Jaemin\u2019s house? Ah, we finished the move yesterday.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was the best news he had heard of late. He won\u2019t have to share a small one room with his family. He wouldn\u2019t have to unnecessarily show himself being tormented by the evil spirits. He was a little bit worried about distancing himself form the amiable Jaemin, but he would be able to live with his family again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, is there anything else?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s question, Minchan handed him a single A4 paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell is this? Is this a summons?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned as he read the words to the request for attendance, then he looked towards Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey want you to come to the police station..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Hwarang president reported you for assault.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Oh, that mother fucker.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

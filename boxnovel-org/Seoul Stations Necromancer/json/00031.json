This is the hyung I was talking about, Woojin-hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile, Jiwon. You are still very pretty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon smirked at how shameless Woojin was being. She had firmly put on a hat. So, how would he know if she was still pretty?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had last seen him 5 years ago when Woojin had gone missing. It was the time when her life had taken a turn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are about to go eat some grilled beef entrails. Do you want to accompany us for some alcohol?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Grilled beef entrails?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jiwon hesitated when she heard Woojin\u2019s words. Had he been this aggressive in the past? Jiwon tried to comb through her memories, but Woojin\u2019s current figure was very different from the past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. She hadn\u2019t been that close to him in the first place 5 years ago. She probably just didn\u2019t know about Woojin\u2019s personality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Places with a lot of people is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. We just ate our dinner, so we are full.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned when Jaemin also stepped forward to make excuses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think food stomach and alcohol stomach is the same thing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, Jiwon turned to look at Jaemin. She wanted to talk with Woojin. She wanted to thank him for helping out her brother. Moreover, she had to give back the excessive amount of money he gave Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can we go to an establishment that serves alcohol with my brother wearing his uniform? Let\u2019s just go home and talk. I heard all about you helping my brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. This kid is good at drink alcohol.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, Jaemin had a guilty expression on his face. Jiwon whipped her head around to glared at Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou drink alcohol now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. Woojin was the one that made him drink it, so what was he doing? How cheap are you? J aemin\u2019s eyes looked at Woojin as if to say he wanted to be saved. Woojin grinned as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSend this kid home. Let\u2019s drink without him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the first time I met a high school friend since I\u2019ve been back. You can tell me all that has happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That\u2019s right. Woojin had gone missing. She had remembered Woojin in the first place, because Woojin had gone missing right before the Dungeon Shock. It used to be the hottest news in school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you like beef entrails?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. I also have something to say to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon was about to go when Jaemin grabbed his noonah\u2019s arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoonah. Don\u2019t drink too much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. You go home first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoonah. If you feel like you are getting drunk, call me immediately.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ee-gooh. Go home and study. You said your test is coming up soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon saw her worried brother off then she followed after Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that your car?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. It\u2019s the car of a dongsaeng I work with.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo opened the window of the front passenger seat to see outside. Then he bowed towards the passenger seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHello, noo-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes. Hello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon quickly lowered her head, then she pushed the brim of her hat down further. The large visor of the cap covered everything up to the bridge of her nose. However, one could tell she was a beauty just by looking at her slender jawline, and red lips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Jiwon sat in the back, Woojin followed her in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Where should I take you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere do you think? Weren\u2019t you going to take me to a delicious beef entrails restaurant?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to go to a beef entrails restaurant with such a beauty? Woojin didn\u2019t care if Sunggoo thought it was weird or not. He wanted to eat beef entrails today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNoo-nim. Are you ok with eating beef entrails?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. It\u2019s fine. However, can you find somewhere with sparse amount of people\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCoincidentally, there is a place I go to regularly. They aren\u2019t doing well, so there won\u2019t be any people there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned. He wanted to eat at a place where the beef entrails was delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026doesn\u2019t that mean it isn\u2019t tasty?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I guarantee it will be really delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was basically the chauffeur as he just drove the car. The two in the back seat didnt\u2019 speak for a long time. ?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo why are you going around wearing that hat? You didn\u2019t wash your hair?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo sucked in a breath at Woojin\u2019s word. Sunggoo had known Woojin had a difficult personality, but how could he ask a woman such a question?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Perhaps, his great hyung-nim was a virgin\u2026\u2026. (TLN:slang term was used. Mo-ssol=shortened from motel solo=single since mother\u2019s womb)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The way he treats women is too clumsy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN\u2026no. I just like wearing a hat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm. Is that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tried to think about the past, but he came up blank. He just remembered Jiwon had been the prettiest girl in school.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t remember her personality or even her appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, is that so? Any ways, I\u2019m really glad I got to meet you. I was surprised when Jaemin said you are his noonah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What was it? How can he treat a person in such a comfortable manner? Jiwon felt like she was falling into Woojin\u2019s pace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was also surprised. Jaemin doesn\u2019t talk too much about his school life, so I didn\u2019t know he was being bullied. I\u2019m really thankful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it was nothing. Jaemin helped me a lot too..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon remembered what Jaemin had said, and she spoke quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard you extorted money from him\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. I just borrowed it. I borrowed it. Why aren\u2019t you driving faster, Sunggoo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are in a school zone, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why couldn\u2019t this bastard read his cue?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Jiwon was laughing, Sunggoo\u2019s car left the main street into a construction zone where a neon sign was blinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. It seems a Dungeon Break happened here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim. This was originally an empty lot, but they started construction about a month ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a Dungeon Break happens, the area around the station becomes totaled in an instant. After the area around the station was organized again, the development plans varied on what kind of Dungeon formed near the station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy is there such a large construction site near this station?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. This is the housing complex where Kim-gahngchul will be moving into.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said who is that person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could he not know about Kim-gahngchul? Amongst the 10 great Roused of Korea, he was the most successful one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t know who Kim-gahgchul is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have no idea\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe was the very first Rank A Roused of Korea. If you look at the Roused Rankings, he is ranked 1st.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he trying to build some pleasure palace? Why is he building such a big house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hyung-nim was 24 years old, but how could he know less on how society worked than a 21 year old?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t all going to be Kim-gahngchul\u2019s house. It is a housing complex being advertised as where he would live.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The area around stations were dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Dungeon couldn\u2019t be cleared within 30 days then the Break would happen. As the word indicates, the monsters would flood out. It was the worst thing that could happen to a residential neighborhood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like living next to a ticking bomb.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, it was an entirely different situation if a high ranked Roused lived nearby. The Roused living nearby would help attack the Dungeon just from the fact that they didn\u2019t want their house to be damaged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why the real estate developers were desperate to have a high level Roused, so they could use the Roused as publicity models.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After listening to Sunggoo\u2019s explanation, Woojin understood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, if one could raise one\u2019s Rank then one could get free housing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026that\u2019s correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin started touching his Roused card . Jung-minchan was very quick in handling his business. Woojin was handed a Rank C card, and Sunggoo was made into Rank D.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Should I visit the Bureau to raise my Rank?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to enter high rank Dungeons as a Rank C, so he didn\u2019t really care about his rank. However, the numerous benefits a top Rank received was enticing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jiwon was surprised when she saw Woojin\u2019s Roused card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWooojin. You are a Rank C Roused?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Yeah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJaemin said you were Rank F.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it rose.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Didn\u2019t he know Roused Rank wasn\u2019t something that was easily raisable? Jiwon looked at Woojin in a new light. She had heard from Jaemin that Woojin was making a lot of money. If he was a Rank C then she could understand why.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet me ask you a question.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon became really nervous at Woojin\u2019s question. She hoped he wouldn\u2019t asked about her complex. Her heart started to beat faster from concern.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow was I in the past?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wanted to know more about his past self. He had lived a hellish life for the past 20 years at the Planet Alphen. It almost made him forget who he was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe weren\u2019t that close, so\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, is that so? Do you remember who I was close to?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought for a moment. Jiwon glanced towards Woojin. When she saw Woojin look outside the window as he frowned, her heart fluttered. Was that weird?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It has been a while since she had met someone who only remembered her from 5 years ago when she had been pretty. Moreover, he didn\u2019t show any sympathy or disgust. It had been awhile since she had a conversation like this, and she welcomed it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why she didn\u2019t want him to see it . Jiwon pushed her hat deeper on to her head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo drove past the construction site of the housing complex then they stopped on top of hill at the poor part of the city. This place didn\u2019t even have access to a subway, so it was an inconvenient place to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the affluent people had left Seoul. The people in the poor part of the city remained as they guarded where they lived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. My baby is here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGrandma!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. Are you friends with my Sunggoo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. It\u2019s just a hyung-nim and noo-nim that I know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-yoo. You are Sunggoo\u2019s seniors. Please have a seat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The restaurant was located in a run down building, and there were only 5 table there. Moreover, the store was empty. It seemed Woojin\u2019s party was the first customer of the day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this place really a delicious restaurant?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He came here with a very high expectation\u2026\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is your grandmother\u2019s store?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. This is the store of my friend\u2019s grandmother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou brought us here to increase revenue for your friends restaurant??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. It isn\u2019t like that. Amongst all the places I know, this restaurant has the best tasting beef entrails.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a skeptical expression on his face. However, as the food was being laid out, his rigid expression relaxed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beef entrails was delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. It seemed every food on earth was delicious to Woojin. The grandmother, who was the owner, was pretty skilled at cooking food.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the first time I am drinking alcohol with Hyung-him. I am honored.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFill it to the brim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo poured soju into Woojin\u2019s glass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is an honor to be able to drink with hyung-nim\u2019s alumni.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is this person in the mafia? Every word he says ends with hyung-nim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahh. It\u2019s delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the toast, he emptied the soju. Then he picked up a well-cooked beef entrails, and he ate it after dipping it in a sauce. The cool soju and the chewy texture of beef entrails was downright delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. This is tasty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time Woojin\u2019s glass emptied, Sunggoo immediately refilled the alcohol . Woojin was able to have a good meal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Woojin really just came to eat some beef entrails with no ulterior motive. This made Sungoo and Jiwon stare vacantly at Woojin. Jiwon looked like a fish out of water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Why aren\u2019t you eating? I\u2019ll pay. Eat it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo secretly glanced at Woojin and Jiwon to gauge the mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the beginning, he thought Woojin had brought Jiwon, because they were close school mates. However, it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case. By listening to their conversation, this was the first time they met in five years, and they were only acquainted with each other\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wa. If it was me, I would have avoided such an awkward situation. I would have just parted ways after giving a greeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Maybe hyung-nim isn\u2019t used to being around a woman?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe hyung-nim liked the pretty nonnah with the graceful jawline? Is that why he brought her here? What was Woojin thinking inside? As his manager, what was his duty?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018All right. I\u2019ll create the mood then I\u2019ll excuse myself.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe hyung-nim was trying to test his ability. As a Roused, he had cut short his college life, but he had a lot of experience drinking alcohol as a freshman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s wasn\u2019t placed under academic probation for nothing. He\u2019ll prove it here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then several dozen methods to break this awkward situation passed through his head like instinct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim! Let\u2019s do a game. A game.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? A game?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had left earth during his 3rd year of high school, so how would he know the drinking tradition of a college student?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo grabbed a bottle of alcohol in one hand, and he spoke in a regional dialect. Then Woojin experienced a new world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The situation developed too fast for Woojin to stop it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin experienced a diverse game.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the floor below the table, 12 empty bottles of soju was lined up. Jiwon was slumped over, and she was using her arms as a pillow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he looked at Jiwon, the red face Sunggoo stood up on his chair then he started to shake his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDrink. Drink. The alcohol is going down. Gulp. Slurp. Gulp. Gulp. Keep doing the shoulder dance. Look at my shoulders. Tal~\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s face hardened. He had come here to eat the delicious beef entrail and soju. However, why was Sunggoo trying so hard to make him drink alcohol?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit before I wrench your shoulders out of their sockets?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His voice held a murderous intent. Sunggoo\u2019s dancing shoulders came to a halt. It was instinctual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo neck retreated like a turtle, then his gaze met Woojin\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. He was waking up from the alcohol. Sunggoo quickly sat back in his chair. Both their eyes headed toward Jiwon. She had passed out after imbibing a lot of alcohol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon was already passed out, and when she moved a little bit, her hat fell away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo rubbed his eyes. He couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. However, he wasn\u2019t imagining it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The left side of Jiwon\u2019s head was bereft of any hair. On her scalp, there were lumpy scars that was unsightly. The injury reached past her forehead, and it reached her left eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo looked at Woojin to see his reaction. However, Woojin indifferently looked at Jiwon.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Thanks.)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin discreetly asked Sunggoo a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, do you hear that sound?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes? What kind of sound? The sound of the wind?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. The wind is blowing pretty hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He guessed only he could hear it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was closely related to the Dungeons and the Alphen Planet. So he realized this was limited only to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Let\u2019s get into position.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s words, 4 team members stepped forward. The four of them were all short ranged fighters, so they carried some pretty sturdy shields. Bae-dohsoo and the other teammates positioned themselves behind the four.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo was a Roused with an Ignition ability, and the other person had a bow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, the formation was a combination of 4 short ranged fighters, and two long ranged fighters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, the two of you are new to this, so please position yourselves in the rear. Let\u2019s try to be in sync. If we turn upcoming corner, 4 normal goblins will be summoned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time Bae-dohsoo attempted a 2 star Dungeon, but it seemed he had studied this place thoroughly. He knew this place like the content of a manual.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they turned the corner, four goblins rushed towards them. Goblins were small monsters with hideous faces, and they swung short clubs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tahng, Tahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The clubs were blocked by the shields, so it didn\u2019t do much damage. This was when Bae-dohsoo\u2019s Ignition ability shone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwaroo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flame suddenly sparked in front of their faces. The goblins lost their sight, and they became disorganized. At that moment, the closed combat fighters raised their weapons, then they stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssssskuk, puk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They mercilessly cut down the fallen goblins with their weapons. One goblin tried to run away when an arrow appeared like a ghost. It flew and embedded itself in the goblin\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssweeeeehk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t shot like an Olympic archer, but the archer was still a member of the Roused even if he was Rank F. It was an attack that would sufficiently threaten a monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They cut off the head of the goblin, who had become a bloody mess. Woojin and Sunggoo watched silently from the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had seen more gruesome sights, so it didn\u2019t bother him. Hong-sunggoo was also experienced from the 1 star Dungeons, so he just frowned. He didn\u2019t disgrace himself by doing something like dry heaving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are lucky. There are two blood stones. If it\u2019s only this size, then we\u2019ll at least be able to receive 20.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was surprised at Bae-dosoo\u2019s words. The blood stones were smaller than the size of a finge yet they were valued at 20. He thought he had done the right thing to come to this Dungeon even though he was risking his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I guess 100,000 won isn\u2019t too expensive.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Until a moment ago, it was a burdensome amount of money, but now it was laughable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Let\u2019s fight together at the next corner. What\u2019s your ability again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI can summon a fire ball. After I throw one, I can throw another one after 3 seconds. I can throw 6 in succession.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. How about you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo\u2019s gaze touched Woojin. Woojin looked around his surrounding then he raised his hand towards a goblin\u2019s corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKekekeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A single Skeleton Soldier showed up. Everyone was surprised, so they looked towards Woojin once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh. You are a summoner type. Well, do you have another ability?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin picked up the club dropped by a goblin, then he started swinging it through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I have enough power to keep myself safe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party was too busy looking at the Skeleton Soldier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen a Necromancer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoa. This is amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think it\u2019ll be great for searching or reconnaissance?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While everyone was admiring it, Bae-dohsoo decided on the positions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll keep the same positions, but Woojin\u2019s summoned being can act as a scout. Mr. Honggoo will let a fire ball fly when I give him a signal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, while carefully turning the corner, opened his Skill Window. Then he increased the summoned Skeleton Soldier\u2019s Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Lv 9 Skeleton Soldier Summon&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monster\u2019s corpse was given as sacrifice, and a Skeleton Soldier of [Strength 14 Agility 17 Health 14] was summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic Consumption : 1, Reguired Control : 1</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used 8 points to increase its Skill Level. The Skeleton Soldier\u2019s ability was increased in one sitting, and it was capable of exhibiting a powerful combat capability greater than a fully grown male.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Skill Level reached 10, the Skeleton Soldier\u2019s appearance goes through a change, so he only raised it to lvl 9. It would be annoying for him to explain the changed appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It should be able to pull its own weight.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin decided not to do too much. He\u2019ll just make a decent amount of money. He wanted to attempt the Dungeon by himself when he had enough money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe next corner will have 6 goblins!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s direction, the Skeleton Soldier drew the gaze of the enemies from the front, then the close combat fighters built a strong shield wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s fire ball was surprisingly effective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-rook. Boom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblins\u2019 formation collapsed when the head-sized fire ball flew towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo\u2019s Ignition ability couldn\u2019t directly cause damage, but it was good at creating a tactical advantage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The spark of flame would suddenly form in front of a goblin\u2019s face. While the surprised goblins were flailing about, the close combat fighters would run in and beat up the goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin also participated as he used the Skeleton to kill the goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe pile of bones is faster than I had expected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is also powerful. Isn\u2019t it better than most F ranks?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo\u2019s team acknowledged Woojin and Sunggoo. As the battle continued, they became more in sync, so the hunting speed increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At first, their goal was not to clear the Dungeon. They had decided to kill all the summoned monsters to extract the blood stones then exit the Dungeon. They didn\u2019t take the shortest route to the Return Stone located in the lowest floor. They hunted everything as they descended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They caught a good number of monsters, so Woojin leveled up once as he became lvl 5. The goblins also gave more Achievement Points compared to the Drabbits, so every kill gave him 2 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin used the Skeleton Soldier, so he didn\u2019t have much to do. The original team had grown experienced together in the 1 star Dungeons, so they worked harmoniously.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since this was a 2 star Dungeon, Bae-dohsoo was initially very cautious, but he was slowly gaining confidence. The drop rate of the Blood stones couldn\u2019t be compared to the 1 star Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had already acquired 17 Blood Stones. The Blood Stones came in various size, but if they exchanged it to money, they\u2019ll receive around 400 at the very least. If they split it between the party members, each member would receive money of over 100.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, this was only counting the Blood stones they currently have. They still had more monsters to kill, so they\u2019ll make more money in the end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018The 2 star dungeon is a jackpot.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the original team was taking an active role, but the danger level was decreased by Woojin\u2019s Skeleton Soldier taking the brunt of the attack. Moreover, the battles were also helped by Sunggoo\u2019s fireball.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had pretty good powers, so teams would probably covet after these outstanding individuals. Even Bae-dohsoo thought about giving them an offer when the Dungeon Attack was finished.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the last floor. Let\u2019s all work hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to clear the Dungeon and exit within an hour, so the break time was short. The party was in a hallway and they were about to step on to the stairs leading to the last floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 5 goblins and one hobgoblin standing at the entrance. One was much larger than the others, and it was holding on to a very large cane.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go forward in our basic formation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned his head in confusion at Bae-dohsoo\u2019s confident words. He had fought the Demon Lord\u2019s army at the Planet Alphen. He had crossed path with countless number of monster, and it included the hobgoblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This bastard was very troublesome compared to the normal goblins. It wasn\u2019t because its larger body. The bastard had the highest intellect amongst the goblins. It was a goblin magician. Moreover\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I don\u2019t think this will successful.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin clicked his tongue as he saw his teammates inch forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be a little bit more careful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo nodded his head at Woojin\u2019s word. Still, his face was filled with confidence. His continuous victories made him forget the fact that he was attempting a 2 star Dungeon for the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m well-acquainted with the manual. That bastard\u2019s main attack is magic. Jongchul\u2019s ability can be used to create a barrier. He can delay it by blocking it once, then we\u2019ll rush in for a decisive victory.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the shield carriers had an ability to make a barrier. Woojin shrugged his shoulder, and he decided to follow his lead. Bae-dohsoo was the team leader, and he was just a hanger-on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the team leader also held all the responsibility.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s coming. Block it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s word, the man name Jongchul activated his ability. A gray barrier spread out, and it collided with the lightning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-ji-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the barrier disappeared, the lightning also disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo immediately used his Ignition ability, and he messed with the hobgoblin\u2019s field of vision. Then the party members charged. Even Sunggoo threw a fireball towards the hobgoblin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It should still be dangerous.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hobgoblins had very high intelligence. It was high enough for them to cast magic. Moreover, magic wasn\u2019t the only reason why hobgoblins were dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgeee, ggeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hobgoblin let out a bizarre sound, and the goblins nearby bunched together. The goblins had crude shields attached to the hand grasping their clubs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had dismantled signs, newspaper stands and various items to make makeshift shields. Then they pulled out pipes that was hidden within their body, and they took aim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAttack! We just have to kill the hobgoblin first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s words, the archer aimed and fired at the hobgoblin. However, the bastard had already hidden its body behind the stair\u2019s balustrade. Moreover, the goblins should be in disarray from the fireball, yet the goblins stood in formation as they fortified their line of shields.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblins and the team collided with each other.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I think something is different about these bastards?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastards, who they were grappling with, had the same body and strength as the previous goblins. However, the difference was they were fighting in a shrew manner. The party felt a strange sense of danger, and the battle was basically shifting against them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pew-pew-pewk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblins, who were hiding, shot their unique weapon, paralysis needles. Some even used poisoned needles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it stings. What is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh, my body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their bodies weren\u2019t entirely paralyzed, but the region hit by the paralysis needle became rigid. Even if it lasted only for a moment, it became a huge source of danger where weapons were swung indiscriminately in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One person fell over after being hit by the club swung by a goblin. As if his heart was being strangled, Bae-dohsoo felt a feeling of suffocation. The bastards, who should be dead from one swing of his sword, was responding in an organized manner. It was very troublesome to fight against them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Tsk, this is why I knew they would fail.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hobgoblins were dangerous not because of their physical ability nor their magic. They were able to command other goblins with their superior intellect. The goblins stopped being a 1 star monster when they obtained a commander. The whole group should be looked as a single entity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cE\u2026scape. Get out of there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bae-dohsoo yelled from the rear, and the close combat fighters fought each other to be the first to run away. However, it was after one had completely lost his consciousness. If they continued to run away, the person would inevitably die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-rook, Puhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the cool time had ended, Sunggoo threw a fireball towards the goblins, who were chasing after them. Two goblins quickly retreated as they were set on fire. The close combat fighters used this time to quickly retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t think we can do this. Let\u2019s retreat first!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat about Jongchul?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s already dead! Can\u2019t you see it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s indignant shout, their faces became rigid. They felt sorry for their comrade. Moreover, they also felt fear and the desire to live, so their expressions was extremely gloomy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if they thought about it, their decision was obvious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nothing was more precious than their own lives.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRetreat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bae-dohsoo\u2019s shout, the party members quickly ran away. Still, it wasn\u2019t as if the band of goblins did nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jee-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hobgoblin regained its senses. It let out a lightning strike, and it directly hit Sunggoo\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t even let out a scream. Sunggoo\u2019s eyes flipped over as his mouth stayed wide open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet, hurry up and run away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo wasn\u2019t even part of their original team, so they didn\u2019t feel sorry for him. The Roused were basically beings hiding within death\u2019s shadow when they decide to enter a Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was just unlucky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKee-eek, keek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblins feigned chasing after them, but after awhile, they returned to the hobgoblin\u2019s side. Woojin, who was hiding behind a pillar, revealed himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since I hunted a group.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two casualties, and the rest ran away. Woojin laughed as he looked at the bunched goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had enjoyed being a spectator, but that had come to an end.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

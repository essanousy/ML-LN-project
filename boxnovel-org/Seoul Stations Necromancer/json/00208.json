style=\"\">The subway stations had become a means for the monsters to pour into this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Humanity had to fight for their survival, and they had done pretty well in the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, a population that was about to reach 7 billion was reduced to half its size in just 5 years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters appeared in the world, while following certain sets of rules.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Humanity explored the Dungeons, and they obtained a profitable result. \u00a0They started taking advantage of the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They went wild over a new resource called Bloodstones, but soon they were hit with a bigger tragedy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet and earth had completely synchronized.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, \u00a0the Dimensional lords, who were indiscriminate about their killings, had appeared. \u00a0They were on track to take ownership of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was rare to see a country, who hadn\u2019t lost their capital, and about half the countries of the world lost their government. \u00a0The people of these countries turned into refugees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One couldn\u2019t simply categorize all of them as monsters. \u00a0Many different types of life forms gathered on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were humanoid races like Elves, Dwarves and Orcs. \u00a0There were even humans\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tens or hundreds of new species had been about to fight an endless battle to take possession of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, all the Dungeons had been Reset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a clean Reset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeons, which had acted as Dimensional tunnels, disappeared. \u00a0Humanity once again had hope.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It looked as if peace could be achieved once the invaders, who were the Dimensional Refugees, were driven out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Dimensional war was over, the battle to seize earth remained. \u00a0A war where the Dimensional refugees would have to fight the original owners of earth remained. \u00a0It was a battle for their survival.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The population was being categorized as either being humans or monsters. \u00a0However, this identification of friend or foe was an ambiguous process, and it seemed another period of bloodshed was imminent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Alandal intervened to stop the war. \u00a0They forcefully brought about peace.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, not all countries and Dimensional refugees agreed with the decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Japan disagreed with Alandal\u2019s decision. \u00a0They started a war with the Dark Elves living in Hokkaido. \u00a0Japan lost in a brutal manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t a battle where each side poured their forces into all-out war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The minister of Japan was the first to fall. \u00a0All the members of the government, who pursued this war, were assassinated. \u00a0\u00a0The war fizzled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyone, who talked about starting the war, was killed the next day. \u00a0The battle never came to be.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if the Dimensional refugees were exempt from the violence. \u00a0If they showed any signs of invading a country, they received a ruthless punishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">God of Destruction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His name was slowly spread across the races, who took root on earth. \u00a0His name was carved into the consciousness of each and every one of them. \u00a0\u00a0Under his reign, peace returned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, not all the problems could be solved through controlled responses to those trying to start a war. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secret terrorist activities and land disputes occurred constantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The other intelligent races on earth was a problem. \u00a0\u00a0There needed to be an expedient way to solve the disputes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Therefore, it was a given that a United Earth Coalition was formed with its strongest country as the centerpiece. \u00a0Alandal was chosen to be the mediator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the one to spearhead this problem wasn\u2019t the king of Alandal Kahng-woojin. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first chairman of the United Earth Coalition, which would be pursuing world peace, was none other than Alandal\u2019s Prime Minister Jung-minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The amount of Dimensional refugees equalled the number of humans killed in the Dimensional war. \u00a0The peace was forged through a hard fought effort that spanned a year.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Destruction and Slaughter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people of earth was freed from the threat of war and terror. \u00a0This sweet period of time had been peaceful, and it was enough time for the name of the god of destruction to fade from the memories of the people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter how many humans and monsters he had killed. \u00a0It didn\u2019t matter how many beings were killed by his Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the reigning absolute being, who had severed the tethers linking earth to the different dimensions. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin wasn\u2019t the god of destruction. \u00a0He had become the hero of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was to be revered instead of feared. \u00a0However, his whereabout was unknown for the past couple months</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several thousand people were gathered on a sunny spring day, and they were looking up at the platform. \u00a0Several dozen camera drones were floating in the air, and the speech was being broadcasted to the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is unfortunate that I cannot share this historic day with him.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan looked as if he had aged 10 years. \u00a0It seemed he had received a lot of stress in the past year. \u00a0He spoke with a calm voice into the microphone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It has been an year, since we\u2019ve established the United Earth Coalition.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some called it the Dimensional Independence day. \u00a0Others call that day the start of a new era.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a year, since the new history of earth began anew.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Today is also a historic day where we will meet humans from the old world.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Michan stepped back from the podium as he pointed behind him. \u00a0The Seoul Station was behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The real world had overlapped with the VR world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no reason to differentiate between the VR and the Reality..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two very different world had merged to create a new reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of the Dungeons, humans were found sleeping inside the subway stations. \u00a0They were within capsules. \u00a0They dreamed as they waited for a new home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the past year, the United Earth Coalition brought order to the world, and they were successful in brokering peace between the different races.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had built centers on each continent that\u2019ll help people, who will awaken from stasis, adjust to this new world. \u00a0The people, who will be conducting the rescue operations, had also finished their training.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The humans from the old world, who were immersed in the fantasy of their dreams, would be called back into reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"We will now start this project. \u00a0We will be rescue the people of the old world.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Minchan\u2019s declaration, the people cheered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter that the creations would be meeting the creators. \u00a0It was merely humans rescuing other humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Vrrrrrrrrm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A van was racing down the road.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Click.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy turned off the tv screen, which was broadcasting Minchan\u2019s speech. \u00a0She leaned back into her seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Jiwon always has a knack for scheduling these events at odd times.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the one year anniversary of the start of the new era, and people were out to meet the people of the old world. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon decided to do a fan meeting on such a day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Shall I turn the car around?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Who will go if I don\u2019t go? \u00a0Everyone is busy today.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All their friends and acquaintances were busy today. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy was a world-class singer, but Jiwon\u2019s circle of friends were only full of incredible people\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Will Soonghoon oppa be able to come today?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Huh? I think Mr. Soonghoon is on live broadcast today.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the manager\u2019s words, Do-jiwon turned on her tv again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Click.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;World Variety Woo-soonghoon Show! \u00a0Today is a special day. \u00a0I\u2019m interviewing a very important guest today. \u00a0Please give an applause for the professor. \u00a0He is Dr. Toppler from the Moon base.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the screen, the panel gave an applause as Dr. Toppler appeared with a broad smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;You are our first alien, who arrived on our earth without riding in on a UFO. \u00a0Or should I call you the man from the future?&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woo-soonghoon\u2019s joke, the panel and the professor laughed. \u00a0Then they started exchanging stories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that it was a joke didn\u2019t mean it was a falsehood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler had been on earth on that historic day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;Please tell us more about what happened that day, professor.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;It was a unique event that will never be seen again. \u00a0In truth, I\u2019m still having a hard time believing it happened even now.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;Does this look like an illusion? \u00a0Do you want to wake up from this dream? \u00a0Have you been hypnotized?&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Dr. Toppler laughed at Woo-soonghoon\u2019s flippant attitude, and he continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;No way. \u00a0I\u2019m just saying having a closed mind is a scary thing. \u00a0We found out that the distinction between reality and illusion might be meaningless. \u00a0When one puts one\u2019s belief into a thought, it could be brought into reality. \u00a0On the flip side, forgetfulness might lead to the erasure of many things.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;You are very philosophical today. \u00a0How are the aliens on the Moon Base doing these days?&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;Haha. \u00a0It is the same as always. \u00a0They are showing a lot of interest in the project of rescuing the people from the old world. \u00a0Moreover, It is almost time for the probe to land on Mars, so everyone is focused more on that event.&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> &lt;How about you, professor....&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Click.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy turned off the screen, and she closed her tired eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> There were several dozen different races existing on earth now. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon was able to converse with all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was fast with his word so much so that he had been able to sell an old phone to the god of destruction. \u00a0He had used the Passive Skill he possessed to become a world famous talk show host. His success wasn\u2019t a fluke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh-whew. \u00a0Soonghoon oppa can\u2019t come\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Why don\u2019t you try asking your boyfriend?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the manager\u2019s words, Cindy furrowed her brows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh-whew. \u00a0Why would the world\u2019s busiest jobless person pick up my call?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Pfft..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her manager laughed at her reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddoo-roo-roo-roo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike her words, Cindy tried calling him, yet the phone kept ringing. \u00a0There was no sign that the phone would be picked up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng, doo-doohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, the car rocked and vibrated. \u00a0When she looked out the window, she saw the roof of a building billowing with smoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aigo. \u00a0It seems it is another terrorist attack.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The terrorists weren\u2019t affiliated with any specific country, so it was a problem that the United Earth Coalition was having a hard time solving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Kahng-woojin had hidden his whereabouts recently, and it had emboldened the terrorists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flames were burning black as it climbed up the building. \u00a0It headed towards the roof of the building. \u00a0Cindy\u2019s eyes turned round as her eyes laughed in amusement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Hwah-roo-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black smoke gathered, and it was sent away in a stream towards the sky. \u00a0The flames acted as if it was being sucked into a blackhole. \u00a0The flames gathered to form a phoenix.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"He really is the busiest one of them all.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The phone was still ringing, but Cindy ended the call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that he was in Korea made her heart race in an odd manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The man of flame fought the terrorists, and he didn\u2019t take any money for his services.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the world\u2019s hottest jobless person, and he was her boyfriend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seems she would be able to see his face today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want you to cancel everything from my schedule from tonight to tomorrow.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The manager was surprised, but she had requested numerous times before. \u00a0Therefore, the manager assented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took a peek at the black mirrors, and he saw Cindy smiling like a teen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ssssk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A deft hand was signing her name within the cover of the book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You are too pretty.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ha ha. Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> She liked the compliment, so she smiled as she shook the man\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The next reader in line came up to her as he pushed the book forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What is your name?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Spotted Dog.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The elegant movement of the pen came to a stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What did you just say?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019m Spotted Dog.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Huhk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jiwon shot to her feet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Y...you are the one in the comments\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I always planned on dropping your novel, but I always wondered about what would happen in the next chapter\u2026 \u00a0I kept reading it\u2026. \u00a0Again and again\u2026 \u00a0I entered into the fan meeting lottery for fun, and I was picked\u2026..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He scratched his head as he acted stand-offish. \u00a0However, Do-jiwon still had a bright smile on her face. \u00a0She had written 200 chapters to her book, and he had commented on every single one of them. \u00a0She had never expected to see him here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It is so good to meet you\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Really?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I was really curious about you. \u00a0Heh heh\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jiwon\u2019s smile was pure. \u00a0The man with the name, Spotted Dog, on his nametag felt awkward by her eager greeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I really wanted to say something to you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If she wanted to speak to him, why didn\u2019t she write it in the afterward of her book?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jiwon had a bright smile as she bowed towards the confused man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I'm really thankful to you. \u00a0You motivated me greatly..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hmm hmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was unnecessarily clearing his throat when he caught sight of Cindy. \u00a0She ignored the long line of readers waiting in line for their chance to meet the author.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Jiwon! \u00a0Congratulations on finishing your book!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh?

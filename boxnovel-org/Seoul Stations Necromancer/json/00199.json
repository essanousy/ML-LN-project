Aria\u2019s Holy Item into the Combination Box.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he pressed the Combination button, several dozen ingredients mixed to form a circlet. \u00a0It looked like a

Effect became active.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Control ability increased, and now he would be able to control an army five times larger than his previous Undead army. \u00a0He would also be able to summon the Death Field, which was the ultimate battlefield for the Undeads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aside from those powers, all the basic abilities he commanded in Alphen was also restored.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The desperate feeling he had was wiped away, but his expression eventually stiffened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s not

could feel Woojin\u2019s anger settle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis was Woojin\u2019s teacher, and it had witnessed him on the battlefield. \u00a0If not, Janeis would have needed to see

when he saw Seoul, which was razed to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was hell amongst hell for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were the corpses of beings, who looked similar to humans, mixed in with the monsters. \u00a0The corpses were everywhere, and there was only one being alive there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a bad feeling, but it was also a familiar feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s command, the corpses exploded as the Skeleton Warriors appeared. \u00a0He was now able to command more Skeletons than before. \u00a0He assigned the Skeleton Warriors to the command of the Death Knights, and he replenished his Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[My

style=\"\">Weeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood started to evaporate, and the blood surrounding the Blood Dragon sloughed off. \u00a0Dolsae, who was in its Golem\u2019s Heart form, revolved around Woojin before it disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the Bone Dragon dissolved into black smoke, and the only one left by Woojin was Bibi.</span></p><br/><p><span

towards the Flying Fortress in the sky. \u00a0The clue to the Executioner\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t found it yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, even if he hadn\u2019t acquired the answer, it didn\u2019t matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler\u2019s ship parted the black atmosphere, and it landed on dead

his wrist, and a hologram map appeared. \u00a0A bright dot could be seen. \u00a0Leone gave an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is the Seoul Station\u2019s 1st Exit. \u00a0The energy

right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let us start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The captain shook Toppler\u2019s hand before he went on his way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone\u2019s ship locked into the target, and Toppler used the space ship as a Dimensional Interface\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Flying Fortress Bibi\u2019s Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The serious atmosphere around Kahng-woojin prevented Jung-minchan from opening his mouth. \u00a0He decided to delay the report to another time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle between Iello and Kahng-woojin started not too long ago. \u00a0This was why Japan had already announced their alliance with Iello. \u00a0Now they had sent a strongly worded requests to Alandal \u00a0asking for an explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was in a bind, because Japan was showing signs of starting a war over this incident. \u00a0He had no choice, but to ignore it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he gave the report at an ill-advised time, Woojin might want to invade Japan. \u00a0They would be in a deeper mess if such a thing happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid something happen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

situation. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin arrived at the Flying Fortress, the first person he visited wasn\u2019t his mother or his sister. \u00a0It was Kim-kahngchul, who had been locked up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-eeeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul was just sitting in place, yet Kahng-woojin suddenly threw a punch in Kim-kahngchul\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gwah-dahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-oohk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul unceremoniously fell over. \u00a0Woojin grabbed him by the back of his neck, and he spoke as he grinded his teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow will I be able to meet those Moon World bastards.?\u201d

Holy Maiden of earth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he spoke about the Holy Maiden of Earth, Woojin grabbed Kim-kahngchul\u2019s neck. \u00a0Woojin easily raised Kim-kahngchul by his throat. \u00a0Hechoked as his legs futilely struggled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want to die?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-oohk. \u00a0E...earth\u2019s god is

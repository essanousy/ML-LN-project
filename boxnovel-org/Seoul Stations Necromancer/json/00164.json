(3)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Over half of the participants in the assembly were representatives from foreign nations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of them was from Japan. \u00a0He yelled out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the end, aren\u2019t you just saying you are going to monopolize the spoils of war?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The word, 'vanguard', might just be a pretty word to cover up the fact that Kahng-woojin was trying to monopolize all the glory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then you go first.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...what are you..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If there is someone willing to go before me, I welcome it. \u00a0I won't stop anyone. \u00a0I'll just go when everyone in front of me gets wiped out.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man had nothing to say. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin had overwhelming strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That was the problem. \u00a0The war itself broke down if Kahng-woojin was absent. \u00a0Still, he wouldn't gain much if he just followed behind Kang-woojin's back...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you being so greedy?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I guess no one is taking this situation as serious as me? \u00a0I'm estimating 90% of the world's population would disappear in a month.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin's words had caused a disturbance, but a heavy silence descended on the group.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's not get greedy. \u00a0Let us pool our strength together.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A good number of people became trouble at Woojin's words. \u00a0Several people became surprised at his words. \u00a0Melody had been watching from the side, and her surprise was beyond imagination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'The Immortal is trying to reason with others...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She never expected such a thing to happen. \u00a0If she told this story to anyone on Alphen, they'll think she was making a joke. \u00a0They would tell her to buzz off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please don't sugar coat it with your hopeful words. \u00a0Even if we do start a wasteful war, wouldn't destruction be waiting for us in the end?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A man's face alternately turned pale and red as he asked a question. \u00a0Woojin smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"In the end, Earth will probably be destroyed, but there is hope. \u00a0We have to find a way to permanently destroy the Dungeons. \u00a0We have to last until that time. \u00a0What choice do we have?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the crowd, and he gave a meaningful laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sure there are some of you that wants to take the easy road. \u00a0There will be those like Lee-sahngho. \u00a0You probably want to attach yourself to a Dimensional lord. \u00a0I'm sure there are traitors that would sell earth to save their own lives.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sure that it will happen. \u00a0Those bastards are the first ones I will kill.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stopped speaking, but none in the crowd was able to easily open their mouths. \u00a0Some were making calculations regarding profit and loss. \u00a0Some became resolutely determined on the course of action they would take. \u00a0There were also those that couldn't think in such state of confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is the end of the open data. \u00a0This is the end of the guidance I'm willing to provide before we have to act to save the earth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The topic was heavy and grim. \u00a0However, Woojin was speaking in such a cheerful tone, so hope started to sprout in everyone's heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All the Roused of earth should share in the task when the Dungeons Reset. \u00a0You all have to do your best to clear them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to lessen the number of paths the enemies could use to invade earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When a Dungeon Breaks, don't be cheap about using your resources. \u00a0Do your best to eradicate the monsters.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to defeat the enemies by being on the same page.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The best defense is offense. \u00a0Therefore, I'll be trying to find a way to demolish the Dungeons once and for all. \u00a0This is why I'll be going to Alphen, which had been encroached on recently by Trahnet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke as if he had repeated these words to himself before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll be taking a vanguard to Alphen tomorrow morning. \u00a0You all have to do a good job protecting earth until I get back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It did seemed like Woojin would gone for an extended amount of time....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you have any questions, I want you to direct it towards Prime minister Jung.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned around, and he left the stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan replaced the empty spot with a dark expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have a question!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let me ask one first. \u00a0How many members will be in this vanguard?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The rights to the loots one obtains from the Alphen expedition....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The questions were pouring out, and Minchan was a bit faint when he became bombarded with the questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to run away, but he was in charge of cleaning up after Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He started answering the questions one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exiting the KH hotel, Woojin immediately left towards Alandal. \u00a0He searched for his mother and dongsaeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah was playing with the dog, Bokhwee, which had gotten larger again. \u00a0His mother had only eyes for her daughter, and she couldn't tear her eyes away from Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are back?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. Hey, Sooah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, oppa?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah ran up to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even Bokhwee was shaking his tail as he whined.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you having any weird dreams lately?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Nope. \u00a0I don't dream any more.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After joining the ranks of the Roused, Sooah returned to being her normal self.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She would be able to use her Holy Power, and she'll probably hear the god's voice sporadically.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What about your abilities?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh heh. \u00a0I'm like a ghost.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah looked at her two hands, which was dyed blue. \u00a0When he saw the energy filled with Blessings, Woojin reacted like a magnet being repelled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Other people really like it when I do this. \u00a0It isn't working on oppa.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oppa is a little bit different from others. \u00a0Anyways, we are moving tomorrow.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? Why are we suddenly moving?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The one, who became agitated by Woojin's words, was his mother Lee-soogyung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I bought a boat. \u00a0We'll be living there.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How can we live on a boat?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmm. \u00a0It's a big one.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it something like a yacht? \u00a0Does it have a kitchen inside?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is something similar.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...all right.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You don't want to ask me any more questions?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyung shook her head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know how hard you are working. \u00a0I know how much you think about us. \u00a0I know you have your reasons for doing this.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin just smiled. \u00a0Sooah's ability had awakened. \u00a0If he wanted to, he could take Sooah to his Dimensional Domain. \u00a0However, his mother Lee-soogyung was different. \u00a0She was a level 2.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to reach level 10 if one wanted to develop abilities of a 1st Circle. \u00a0If one looked at her growth speed, it was very unlikely that she'll become a Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had bought the aircraft carrier, which can move in a time of emergency. \u00a0He was building the Colony city solely for Lee-soogyung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gathered a significant amount of Dimensional Points. \u00a0Even if he was absent from earth, the Colony could use the Points to defend itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I just wanted to give you a heads up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0If you are busy, you should go do your work.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyung had a look in her eyes as if she wanted more time to spend with him. \u00a0However, she couldn't take time away from him, so she couldn't look him in the eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin felt her feeling, and he felt sorry. \u00a0However, he just didn't have the time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One hand couldn't block all ten hands that was coming towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enemies were numerous, and there were over several hundred entrances that led to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be impossible to clear all the Dungeons in time. \u00a0The battle would start to slowly shift from the Dungeons to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to make it so that he could at the very least be able to summon Yong Yong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was curious about the goddess that had made Sooah her vassal. \u00a0However, he couldn't find out more about her until she appeared again out of her own volition. \u00a0He didn't even know her name, but she didn't seem like a malicious existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the Alphen expedition, he'll save the surviving allied forces. \u00a0Then he'll let Sooah learn everything about being a Holy Maiden from Melody.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin visited Jiwon's room next.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He entered after knocking. \u00a0When she saw Woojin, she scrambled towards him. \u00a0Cindy was with Jiwon, so Woojin glanced at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? She hasn't left yet?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"She received trauma from that time, and she knows this place is the safest location.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Safe......</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We are going to move.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Where? \u00a0Where are you guys going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The surprised Cindy asked Woojin. \u00a0He spoke in a nonchalant manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I bought a boat. \u00a0We'll be moving there.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huhk! \u00a0Is it perhaps the aircraft carrier?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Any news regarding Woojin was published in a matter of minutes. \u00a0His purchase of the aircraft carrier was a topic of discussion for the past couple days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's words, Cindy's expression darkened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is it? \u00a0If you have something to say, then say it. \u00a0Stop acting like a constipated puppy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you think I can go too?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Did you retire?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No... \u00a0I haven't, but...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is only for the employees of Alandal.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To be more precise, it was for the employees that took up the citizenship up Alandal upon their hire. \u00a0It was for their family. \u00a0He didn't want his employees to hesitate in going out to fight. \u00a0He had arranged it in a way that their families would be protected at all cost.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So I'm not allowed on it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What do you know how to do?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are useless, so why should I let you on the boat?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Cindy had received a significant amount of shock from his words. \u00a0She looked at him with a blank expression. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When had she ever been treated as being useless before?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Cindy's pride had taken a big hit, so Do-jiwon intervened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Cindy is under my care... \u00a0Can't she say until she gets a little bit better?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is she recuperating from?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked Cindy up and down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm. \u00a0She doesn't look like she is hurting anywhere.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The trauma her mind received from that event....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked when Jiwon advocated for Cindy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even a kid is coping better than her. \u00a0Is she being a little bit too whiny?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy bit her lower lips at Woojin's words. \u00a0She recalled Sooah, whom she had seen before. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was aware of it. \u00a0She knew there are a lot of people that were living a hard life on top of having mental trauma. \u00a0She knew she was speaking with a full stomach. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy's eyes turned red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, I was immature.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm glad you realize that now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wow... \u00a0His words were...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll be going.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"All right. \u00a0I'll see you next time.\" </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy was trying hard not to cry, and she strode out of the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Cindy!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon was about to chase after her, but Woojin grabbed her arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0Let me go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you going to do if you catch up to her?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did she really need comforting at this moment?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You were too harsh. \u00a0You could have told her in a more softer manner.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-woojin was too much of a straight shooter. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon's reproachful gaze slid off of him. \u00a0Woojin shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"For what purpose?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...whatever. \u00a0Let me go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon looked up at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When you act like this, I get really scared. \u00a0Will you throw me away like her if I'm useless?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. \u00a0The weight of your soul differs from her soul.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tears were about to be shed from Jiwon's eyes. \u00a0She turned her head away from him, and she headed towards the direction Cindy had disappeared to. \u00a0Woojin was left alone, and he shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You were a bit too harsh, hyung.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin suddenly appeared out of the darkness. \u00a0Woojin looked at him with a sour expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...how long were you there?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I saw the whole thing.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So you've grown a little?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin's camouflage ability was on par with Ggaebi now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh. \u00a0Anyways, when is Sunggoo hyung-nim coming back?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I don't know. \u00a0He'll be back when it's time.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll be coming back after he finished his training. \u00a0Woojin had no idea how long that would be, but Sunggoo would be coming back within a day. \u00a0He needed Sunggoo and Jaenis in the Alphen expedition. \u00a0The presence of both of them were a must.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-hook.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she exited the door, Cindy let out the tears she had been holding back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She knew it. \u00a0Her whining didn't suit this crazy new world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh uh? Excuse me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She ran outside as she cried. \u00a0The employee that had been passing by her tried to call after her, but she didn't look back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You evil bastard. \u00a0Hoo-ehhhhng\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She couldn't control her tears. \u00a0The fact that she had been attracted to such a cold man for even a brief moment made her that much more angry at herself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you go out right now.....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The employee was calling after her, but she continued with her walk of shame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah, this is so embarrassing!'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She planned on calling her manager immediately after she exited this place. \u00a0She headed towards the front gate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She followed the wall, and she arrived at the front gate. \u00a0Several dozen cameras started flashing at the same time. \u00a0They hadn't been waiting for her. \u00a0The reporters were on standby. \u00a0They were targeting anyone that was leaving this place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cindy had gotten herself caught in this maelstrom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Wow. \u00a0What the hell? \u00a0Isn't that Cindy?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Jackpot! \u00a0Why is she crying right now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is it a scandal with the king of Alandal?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Click, click!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her tears dried up when she heard the endless soud of the shutters being pressed. \u00a0She hadn't expected to run into this swarm of reporters, so she had a dazed expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Ah. \u00a0This is bad.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had regained her wits too late. \u00a0Her eyes became focused again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was embarrassed, taken aback and flustered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had to get out of this situation, but she couldn't come up with a solution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her unsightly look was secondary. \u00a0What would happen to her public image when the gossip tabloids print out stories about her?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had created a situation that was ripe for gossip. \u00a0Alandal was the hottest news around right now, and an entertainer had just exited the place in tears....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't know how to minimize the damage, so her eyes started to fill with tears again. \u00a0She turned her body away, but the sounds of camera shutters being pressed didn't end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt a panic attack coming on. \u00a0Her world started to spin in a dizzying fashion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a warm fire fell from the sky and it encased her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she turned around, there was a burning man there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh? Why are you crying?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...hoo-oohk. Ka-ah-ahng. \u00a0Hoo-oohk-oong. \u00a0That evil son of a bitch...hoo-ohng. \u00a0The reporters and their cameras...ooh-eehhhng.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hmmm. \u00a0Please don't cry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Human Flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flame that was surrounding Sunggoo disappeared, and it ignited somewhere else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-puh-puhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh uh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ahk! \u00a0What the hell!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The lens from the cameras all exploded, and all the memory cards started to burn. \u00a0Cindy was so surprised that she looked up at Sunggoo's face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh heh. \u00a0Are you from Yuri Girls? \u00a0Can you give me an autograph inside?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo's bright and untainted smile was reflected in Cindy's tears.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

She was also a human, yet she spoke those callous words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlanet Earth? You are from the most popular destination right now. Your name is Kahng-woojin? Shall we exchange pleasantries?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's brows furrowed at Liah's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Aren't you being a little bit too cold to a fellow human?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Liah propped the long rifle onto her side. \u00a0She took out a cigarette from her pocket, and she lit it with a flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A flame suddenly appeared on top of her finger. She was a magic user, who used guns and swords. \u00a0Woojin folded his arms, and he decided to observe her actions a little bit longer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat nonsense are you trying to pull?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh-eh. \u00a0I guess you aren't a mute.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She took a long drag on her cigarette. \u00a0She spoke as she let out the smoke from her cigarette.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe'll probably see each other more often in the future. \u00a0I'm just saying let's have an amicable relationship.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is killed or be killed. \u00a0Is there a need to become friends with anyone?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed at her nonsensical words. \u00a0In the end, they'll be enemies if they meet on the Dimensional Battle. \u00a0He had no reason or interest in befriending someone he would have to kill. \u00a0\u00a0Liah started laughing uproariously as if she found something to be funny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I can really tell you are a novice lord. Ha ha. \u00a0How's earth? \u00a0Is it a good place to hunt? \u00a0Shall I link my spare Dimensional Fragments there?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are better off not doing that.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The laughter on Liah's face deepened at Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-oh. What? \u00a0Are you the planet's guardian or something like that?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone wanted to to protect their home planet. That was a given.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Earth was a clean planet. \u00a0There were no flags placed there by any Dimensional lord. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGive it up. \u00a0You won't be able to protect them.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis noonah is giving you a warning. It is a fruitless effort.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin frowned when he heard Liah's words. She didn't care about how he took her words. \u00a0She took another deep drag on the cigarette, and she threw it on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0Shall we start?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Liah gripped the long rifle that had been resting on her side. \u00a0The point of the rifle was touching the butt of the cigarette. \u00a0The corner of her mouth lifted as she looked at Woojin. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really this naive? \u00a0You allowed me to load my weapon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had already realized why she was being so verbose. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She wasn't talking, because she met a fellow human Dimensional lord. \u00a0She wasn\u2019t curious about earth either. \u00a0She was just buying time, so she could get ready for the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had fallen for her plan so easily that it was no wonder she thought of him as naive. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chul-kuhk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She loaded the long rifle, and she aimed it at Woojin. \u00a0He stood there without moving an inch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Are you naive, dumb or bluffing?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dahl-gghahk. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small sound was heard from the gun, but the effect was quite surprising.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bullet didn't exit the muzzle. \u00a0Smoke started pouring out of the gun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-koo-koo-koohng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cloud of smoke started to grow, and it was hard to see even an inch in front of oneself. The smoke obstructed one's vision. \u00a0Moreover, the smoke seemed to be poisonous. \u00a0It stung the skin, and one could feel one's movement slow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha ha. \u00a0You were pretty good at the Dimensional Battle, yet you seem to suck at Dueling. Aren't you giving up a little too fast?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn't know where Liah was, since the smoke was covering her whereabouts. \u00a0Her voice also sounded as if it was emanating from all sides. \u00a0It felt as if his vision and hearing had been sealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho said I'm giving up?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo. \u00a0Now that I've deployed the Death's Cloud, you won't be able to win against me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her voice rang out like an echo, and the sound of a single bullet being shot was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tah-ahng, kahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin reflexively blocked the bullet with the Steel Staff he brought out. \u00a0He heard Liah's voice, and it sounded as if she was having fun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow long do you think you can block my attack? \u00a0Doesn't it feel like you're fighting couple dozen people?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death's Cloud hid her whereabouts, and she was shooting from all angles as she harassed Woojin. In the end, he would accumulate damage, and she would be able to kill him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death's Cloud took a very long time to load, yet if she was able to deploy it, she had a win rate of almost 90%. \u00a0It was a deadly technique.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt feels like fighting several dozen people\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhhng, kahng! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Liah ambushed Woojin with her sword, and he brushed off the attack. \u00a0For a brief moment, he saw her, but she immediately jumped away. \u00a0She was covered up once again by the smoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is fun.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned his Death Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee-ri-reek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The black smoke coalesced as the Death Knights were summoned. \u00a0Woojin couldn't see them, because of the smoke. \u00a0However, Woojin could feel where they were located at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cInstead of making it seem like I\u2019m fighting a couple dozen people, why don't you fight several dozen people instead?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoong! I'll just eliminate them one by one.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn't have much information on her opponent, so she had no idea he was a summoning type human. Liah snorted as Woojin put on a big smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The smile looked a bit evil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don't like several dozen, then what do you think about several hundred? \u00a0Or several thousand?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwee-ri-ri-reek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights correctly interpreted Woojin's order, and they summoned all the Skeleton Warriors under him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what the hell?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of Liah being taken aback was heard. \u00a0The Undead army was being summoned at a rate where the Skeleton Warriors completely filled the Death\u2019s Cloud. \u00a0He gave an order to his Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCatch that bitch.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[We will bring the Death's Blessing to our king's enemy!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights ran outward. \u00a0The sound of fighting lasted only a moment. \u00a0Soon, the smoke started to thin out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-roo-roo.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights' spears had pierced through various parts of her body. \u00a0She was being propped up in an awkward posture where she wasn't standing nor was she kneeling. Woojin approached Liah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWarning?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin changed his Steel Staff into an Axe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou worry about your own business.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's axe lodged itself into Liah's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fellow human? Protector of earth? She knew the end result, because she had tried it? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Such an insignificant Dimensional lord dared to give him a warning?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;You've won in the Duel.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Liah's Revenge has failed. \u00a0The Victor's Claim is being initiated.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Please choose either Loot the Storage Room or Loot the Domain.&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin chose to loot the Storage Room. \u00a0The Items that were stored in Liah's Dimensional Storage Room flitted across his vision, and several items were chosen at random. \u00a0Amongst them, a single item caught Woojin's eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Skia's Boots&gt; </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the Adventurer's god Skia's Boots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy luck is pretty good.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shoe itself was a good item. \u00a0However, this item was essential in making one of items in the Thrash's Set. \u00a0It was an essential ingredient in making the 'Thrash's March'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the other ingredients could be obtained on earth, but there were several items that could only be obtained on Alphen. \u00a0Skia\u2019s Boots was one such item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Adventurer's god Skia was one of the gods of Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already been planning on heading towards Alphen, but he might be able to obtain one of the Set Items before he did so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWait a moment\u2026.

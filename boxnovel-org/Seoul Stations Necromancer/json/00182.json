Bone Dragon (2)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beings, who were always the predators, felt an emotion only felt by their preys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-oh-oh-oh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their domineering roars sounded like wails now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several thousand Minotaurs in the Minotaur army was in panic, and they were running around in confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of the overwhelming marvel from space, they were merely a speck of dust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A very small speck....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was only a single meteor, but when it impacted on the surface, an incredible amount of energy and shockwave was released. \u00a0It turned everything into dust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ah-ah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The emitted shockwave swallowed even the farthest monsters running away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-ooh-ooh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a massive crater, and one couldn't even see traces of corpses in the aftermath. \u00a0It only left behind the traces of this incredibly destructive magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The mastermind behind the attack could feel the aftereffects of the shockwave even from within his barrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-she-she-sheek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the dust could settle, Jaenis' barrier started to fade away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon's kick was concentrated at a single point on the barrier, and it broke in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you in such a hurry?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon frowned at Woojin's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems I wasted my precious Points.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it completely pointless to bring a great army to hunt down the Immortal? \u00a0Maybe, it would have been better to form an elite unit like Celrak to clear the Immortal's Dungeon repeatedly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Your Points...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His loss didn't just end at losing his precious Points when his monster army was wiped out. \u00a0It also gave a new source of life energy to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can't you feel it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He spread both his arms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The air was hot from the heat, and it was full of dust.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon glared at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was dumbfounded at the fact that his army was wiped away in a single move, but the Immortal was in the same boat as him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he just had to delay the Immortal for a short amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragons, Fatooh and Leia, should be at the Immortal's Colony soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It seems you also lost all your subordinates.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Really? \u00a0I'm certain that hadn't occurred.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was the Immortal trying to trigger him into feeling nervous?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was nonsensical tactic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-choo-choo-choot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dust was moving in a strange way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bone dusts from the tens of thousand monsters were coalescing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could tell the Immortal's emotions hadn\u2019t changed much, so his response sounded out of place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Harpy Queen Shirao, who bas besides him, glared at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm pretty sure you'll have your hands full fighting us.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal's Undead army was in excellent health. \u00a0He could just re-summon them again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Unon and Shirao thought they would be able to delay him for a certain amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm not your opponent.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\".....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before she could answer Woojin's words, the bone dusts started to form a figure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A long spinal column formed from head to tail, and the ribs started to form. \u00a0Just by looking at its skeletal structure, one could tell that this creature had been massive in life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its wings were only made out of bones, and it was refined to sharpness. \u00a0The wing in itself would be a fantastic weapon. \u00a0Then there were two pits in its enormous head. \u00a0\u00a0Red lights flickered to life as it flared into large flames within the pits, and they started emitting light. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the Undead army's biggest problem child. \u00a0Yong Yong let out a long roar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The long neck swung, and its large head faced towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have summoned me. \u00a0What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked at the familiar voice. \u00a0If Bibi was here, she would have made a big fuss as she rubbed her cheeks against Yong Yong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Kill them, then follow me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong turned his head, and his gaze reached Shirao and Unon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I've received your wish.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll see you a little bit later.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned Shing Shing, and he got on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Heeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shing Shing galloped into the sky, and Jaenis flew beside them using Flight magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[That bag of bones. \u00a0It seems he still has dementia. \u00a0Goo-ha-ha.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's all good.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked. \u00a0Yong Yong was the first Dragon. \u00a0He had lived so long that he hadn\u2019t been able to escape the curse of forgetfulness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been awhile, since he had seen Yong Yong. \u00a0He was just glad to see him again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Phantom Steed and the Lich quickly escaped the battlefield, Shirao quickly tried to follow them through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Where are you going, my cute little bird?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Eeek. \u00a0Let me go!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shirao struggled, but she was in Yong Yong's grasp. \u00a0He moved her towards his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk, kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon desperately kicked him, but the Undead Dragon's bones were too sturdy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong took a bite out of the Harpy Queen as if he was eating a biscuit, and he moved to squash the being that was kicking him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Unon had trained his body to the extreme, so his movements was extraordinary. \u00a0There was no way he would be easily caught by Yong Yong's claws.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-roohk...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The angry Yong Yong let out a sigh, and he started to curl up. \u00a0The dry bones of his wings quickly covered him, and the Dragon curled up as if it was going to sleep. \u00a0Unon looked at the Dragon with disbelief on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...what kind of...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From one to ten, he hated everything about the Immortal. \u00a0He hated all of Immortal's Familiars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong wasn't showing any will to fight, so he turned to looked at Woojin and the Lich, who was flying far into the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a brief moment, but Unon had took his eyes off of Yong Yong. \u00a0A long bone that looked like a hook was protruding from Unon's stomach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong took a bite out of Unon, who was stuck on his claw. \u00a0His sharp canines separate Unon's body from its head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong licked his chops when Unon disappeared into a gray light. \u00a0He once again looked at Woojin flying into the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Your wish has been fulfilled.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oohng. Koong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon, it started running after Woojin. It looked clumsy running on all four feet, but it was so large that the sight was scary rather than it being funny.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Too bad. Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong flapped his bony appendages.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His wings had lost the ability of flight, so it looked pitiful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fatooh and Leia.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were similar to the Gold Dragon Rajakui, who appeared on earth. \u00a0They were Dimensional lords from the Dragon race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the Dragons, Fatooh and Leia were the only great lords, who possessed Codes. \u00a0They enjoyed ruling over other beings, and they would rather accept a bribe rather than pillage. \u00a0These two beings had come out of their Dungeons, and they were aiming for Woojin's Colony....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is Thrash really worth this much fear?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet's great lords were pooling their strength for this all out attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis and Woojin could see the pointy peak of the Saurus mountain, and they could also see too large creatures approaching the mountain from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were so big that Woojin could see them from afar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Is it more useless Dragons again?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis looked a bit wistful. \u00a0A Dimensional lord's body was never left behind after death, so Jaenis wouldn't gain much from killing them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't a Dragon Slayer, but Dragons left behind pretty useful ingredients.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Who cares if it is a dragon or a person?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were great lords of Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fact that they had to die wouldn\u2019t change.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This isn't good.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis felt the resonance of magical energy, and it alerted him to the danger. \u00a0The Dragons were arched like a bow, and their stomachs were bloated. \u00a0It seemed they were about to let out the Dragon Breaths from mid-air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were already too late.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...you should Blink us above them.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a short distance teleportation spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could move anywhere where one could see, and the range was dependent on one's control over magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had the best magician by his side, but Jaenis was also the worst magician for this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[That is a good idea.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was riding on top of Shing Shing, and Jaenis placed his hand on Woojin's shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hurry!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'm not in range yet.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's face was filled with anxiousness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The engorged stomach of the Dragons looked very large.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are we there yet?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[A little bit more...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon that had been lagging behind the other one brought down its head as red flame erupted from its wide open jaw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It headed towards the Colony's Symbol. \u00a0The Dragon's Breath shot towards the World Tree like a laser, and Woojin felt his heart lurch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It he lost the gate, he couldn't return to earth. \u00a0He would be able to gain another Dungeon, but he had to wait for the Synchronization...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hurry!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying his shout, Jaenis and Woojin disappeared at the same time. \u00a0However, they appeared above the Dragon's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was in freefall as he brought out his Warrior's Weapon. \u00a0After changing its form to an axe, he brought it down on the Red Dragon Leia's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Block it!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out an order, which was filled with desperation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hoped Jaenis' barrier would be able to protect the World Tree....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Too late...]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had Blinked across a large distance, so his magical consumption had been quite significant. \u00a0In a flash, Jaenis had run out of magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He quickly tried to gather more, but Jaenis doubted he would be able to block the Dragon's attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Leia had been defenseless, since it was about to let out its Breath. \u00a0Woojin had brought down his axe in anger, and Leia's head was split open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Koo-ah-ah!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leia let out a roar as she plummeted to the ground with Woojin and his axe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's gaze headed towards the World Tree. \u00a0If his Colony took a direct hit from the Breath, it would burn....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn't.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is a miracle.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Coalition had blocked it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a sigh of relief, and he pulled out the axe embedded inside Leia's head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Drop Fatooh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[That won't be difficult.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis started to pour out the magical energy he had gathered towards the Gold Dragon Fatooh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-ooh-oong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The meteor fell a long distance away, but the aftershock was felt at the Saurus mountain. \u00a0It even made the monsters, who had be tirelessly attacking the Colony, to pause.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's Jaenis! \u00a0My teacher is here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His teacher was the only one, who could used Delay, on a meteor summon spell of that caliber. Sunggoo let out a shout filled with joy. \u00a0Graham's eyes became round when he saw Sunggoo's behavior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Didn't you say your teacher was dead?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is dead, but he is still very energetic.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was there a difference in definition between the word from earth and Alphen? \u00a0Graham had a frown on his face as Jaemin laughed from the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tension and the oppressive feeling that had been suffocating them vanished just from the appearance of Woojin. \u00a0It felt as if the sense of responsibility they felt was lifted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Jaenis is a Lich.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Lich?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A single eyebrow twitched on Graham's face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was referring to a Lich, it was understandable to refer one's magical teacher as dead...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Li...Li...Li...Lich?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham became startled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one Lich, who traveled with the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Y...your teacher is the Sovereign of Pestilence?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the worst, the strongest and the best magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His existence itself was a calamity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My god....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo let out a broad smile at the shocked Graham.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Heh heh. \u00a0It seems teacher is quite famous over here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was famous, but he was known for being bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"When he comes here, I'll introduce you to him.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\".....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he run away? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Graham mulled over useless worries, Jaemin pointed towards that sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that hyung-nim?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Mmmm. \u00a0It is.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo nodded his head when he saw Woojin streaking through the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Lich was trailing behind Woojin using Flight Magic. \u00a0Sunggoo had seen Jaenis in flight, so he was able to identify Jaenis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One was Shing Shing, and the other one was the Lich in flight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We just have to hold out a little bit more.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was back. Since the Colony was intact, it would be trivial for him to recover the destroyed castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he would be able to replenish their troops. \u00a0The monsters running across the outer wall wouldn't be a problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This also held true for the two Dragons in the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh uh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had unintentionally looked up towards the sky, and they became surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's a Dragon\u2019s Breath!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first one to come to his senses was the Archmage Graham. \u00a0He reflexively put up a barrier, but it was broken too easily by the Dragon's Breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leia's Dragon Breath was heading towards the World Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo ran forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they lost this location, they would lose the ability to get back to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Will I be able to do it?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn't confident he could do this. \u00a0No, he was a little bit confident that he'll be able to pull this off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'It will work out somehow.'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His running body was engulfed in flame, and Sunggoo quickly stood in front of the World Tree. \u00a0When the Breath arrived right in front of him, the burning Sunggoo opened both his arms wide.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

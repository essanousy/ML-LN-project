When Woojin took a step out of the entrance, the soldiers took a hesitant step backwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTell that pig bastard to come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s words, the North Korean officials, the members of the South Korean delegation, and the foreign reporters all thought of a single person in their head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, they felt shocked by the conviction behind his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s words were basically a declaration of war. Moreover, he said it in the heart of North Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come out, then I\u2019ll go to him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin took another step forward, the soldiers reflexively got in his way. Their eyes were filled with terror, and Woojin\u2019s indifferent eyes swallowed their terror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to raise his hand when a cat jumped out from behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. Master uses too much brute force-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi stood ahead of Woojin, and she wave her cute pink paw. Bibi\u2019s body shuddered, and black flower petals scattered like snow towards the people gathered around the site.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the soldiers and the reporters slowly closed their eyes, and they slid to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. This is more effective. What if you get sued after you killed them without any cause-ahong? This is earth-ahong. Earth. Stop creating complicated situations-nyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, if he killed everyone here then being sued wasn\u2019t the only thing that would happen\u2026 Is it because she watched a lot of tv? Bibi was more sensitive to how society worked on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could avoid annoying situations, then he wouldn\u2019t object to it. Woojin didn\u2019t want to kill indiscriminately. He just had to kill the one who dared to order a terrorist act of bombing on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll cool his anger by chewing on the person\u2019s soul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He planned on walking past all the sleeping people, but it seemed not everyone had fallen asleep from Bibi\u2019s ability. These existences had magical resistance. They were Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, ass hole. Do you think our Republic is a pushover?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew it would eventually turn out like this. We shouldn\u2019t have let a South Korean brat into Pyongyang.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were the North Korea\u2019s Roused in the Supernatural Force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At commander Ri-pyunggahn\u2019s orders, they had blended into the groups of soldiers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were one Rank A and nine Rank B.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was probably the team who would have tried to clear the Dungeon after Woojin came out. They had been placed here on standby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They blocked Woojin\u2019s path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at them one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Asshole.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who cares if he stared at them? At Woojin\u2019s words, the Roused started activating their abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin saw this, he grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. This is how it should be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to cut off the head of the snake. It would be more absurd if the underlings ignored such an act. Before they could ready themselves, Woojin summoned Bone Spears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected of high rank Roused, they easily avoided his attack, but Woojin was aiming for something else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiiing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took couple spirits out of his Spirit Armor, and he shot out several Spirit Spears. The Spirit Spears chased in pursuit until they hit their targets.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHut! What is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some used barrier magic to block the attack. Some used attack magic to break the Spirit Spear instead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While they were distracted for a moment, Woojin had already let fly his bone arrows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-shook!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin continuously shot out his arrows. The Warrior Class\u2019 Archery skill allowed Woojin to be very proficient in shooting the bow. It let him shoot the bow like an expert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, several Roused immediately counter-attacked after blocking the arrows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Roused had a very fast and sharp attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His quick sword was on par with Lee-yunhwee. He remember being stunned when she had injured his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, his current level wasn\u2019t comparable to before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was only a Rank A Roused\u2019s attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bow in Woojin\u2019s hand immediately morphed into an axe. With the change, he whirled the axe head around towards the lower body of the charging foe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The whirling blow made the opponent stagger from the impact, and Woojin immediately sent a Bone Spear towards him</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooooohng, toohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took another step forward. The blade of the axe took off the opponent\u2019s head from his body, and the head flew into the air. Woojin grinned and he attempted a Resurrection.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battle knight with a severed head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dullahan has superior in ability compared to the normally resurrected corpse. The condition is fulfilled if the opponent is a 6th Circle Rank A, and the Resurrection is used when the Roused\u2019s head has been cut off in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It is a cumbersome requirement, but the result is surprising.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It isn\u2019t a clumsy corpse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoohrahhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His movement was similar to how he moved before death, but his strength and destructive ability increased substantially.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dullahan, who was still wearing the North Korean army uniform, grabbed its own head. Then it charged towards the North Korean Roused, who had been comrades only few seconds ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-ahhhhhhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When had they ever had the chance to fight with a dead corpse? No, this person used to be their comrade, but now they had to fight against his corpse. The battle was resolved pretty fast, and Woojin absorbed the Roused souls into this Spirit Armor for storage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puhhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several corpses exploded. Several Skeleton Soldiers and Skeleton Magicians appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae was summoned in his light form, and he circled around Bibi\u2019s head. If given the command, Dolsae could pull the rubbles to himself to form a body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin moved his feet towards the Memorial palace. He didn\u2019t care where Kim-jungun was hiding. If he moved towards Ggaebi\u2019s energy, he\u2019ll be able to find Kim-jungun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He dared to attack an opponent from the back. Woojin would praise his boldness as he gave Kim-jungun a miserable death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time Che-haesol blocked Woojin\u2019s path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease stop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the unexpected situation, Woojin eyes was filled with curiosity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou were a Roused?\u201d (TLN: hehe)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She didn\u2019t have much of a presence, so he hadn\u2019t checked before. When he activated his Warrior\u2019s sense to observe Chae-haesol, she was a level 11. She had barely reached the 1st Circle. She was a Rank F Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Normal people were between lvl 1 to lvl 9.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had a trifling amount of magic resistance, yet she was able to resist Bibi\u2019s sleep curse. Her mental toughness was commendable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease stop. We can still salvage this situation..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou always speak as if I made some accident.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She is going to salvage situation? Well, Woojin could only be dumbfounded at her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut the accident will start now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ten high ranked Roused of North Korea\u2019s Supernatural Force had died. In the middle of the Memorial Palace\u2019s square, 300 soldiers were put to sleep alongside the reporters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018An accident that is bigger than this\u2026.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol\u2019s head suddenly throbbed. She knew he wasn\u2019t kidding from the look in his eyes. Moreover, she had witnessed him kill 10 high rank Roused, who had been helpless against Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoorahhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpse held its head by its side, and the eyeballs rolled around the socket. The sight was more than grotesque. Even the Skeleton Soldiers, who had shown up after the corpses exploded, felt unreal to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol swallowed her saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had never seen someone who was this stubborn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease stop. I beg of you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be war. This might erupt into a war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was an armed conflict inside Pyongyang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an unprecedented event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was going to cause a huge ripple effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was it wasn\u2019t necessarily a good ripple effect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat war? I just have to teach that pig a lesson.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Does this mean he can\u2019t punish the pig?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s indifferent answer, Haesol stared blankly as she lost the ability to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI hate bastards who stab me in the back. I can\u2019t forgive him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Stabbed in the back? Then the mysterious man, who entered the Dungeon, was a North Korean agent sent to attack Woojin?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, he had to hold himself back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease think about your homeland. You can\u2019t start a war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. Stop babbling. You talk too much. I won\u2019t start a war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked deliberately towards Haesol, who was blocking his path. Every time Woojin took a step closer Haesol\u2019s heart thudded in rhythm with his footsteps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin was right in front of her, her heart was beating so fast that she wondered if her heart had escaped her body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die then get out of my way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She felt a chill run up her spine at Woojin\u2019s words. Che-haesol bit her lower lip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen please kill me instead. You have to restrain yourself. I don\u2019t know what happened in the dungeon, but please curb your anger. This isn\u2019t the way to do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Haesol\u2019s words, Woojin quietly looked at her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yes. He could hold himself back. However, didn\u2019t he need a reason to do so? He had no reason to hold himself back. The pig sent a suicide bomber to him, so why should Woojin spare him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s fist planted itself into Haesol\u2019s stomach. Haesol\u2019s body folded into itself like a shrimp from the single blow, and she slumped to the floor. It would be painful, but the blow wouldn\u2019t kill her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked around his surrounding. No one was awake to block Woojin\u2019s path. He saw voyeurs watching from a distance. They moved busily, but he didn\u2019t really care about them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*The tunnel leading to an underground bunker beneath the Memorial Palace.*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-rooroorooroo!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tee-riiiinnng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A gun emplacement placed in the wall fired, but the Spirit Armor blocked everything. It couldn\u2019t hit Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s hammer hit the wall, and the gun emplacement twisted, and it collapsed with the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the thick wall protecting them disappeared, the two soldiers, who weren\u2019t Roused, was filled with terror.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi immediately casted her sleep curse, and Woojin just shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy bother with doing that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. It\u2019s all right-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked around the hallway filled with smoke. The smell of gun powder was quite strong. There was only one steel door left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Jungun. Why don\u2019t we talk for a moment?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No answer came from inside. He was sure there was someone in there. He could feel Ggaebi\u2019s existence across the door.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, he couldn\u2019t hear Woojin\u2019s voice?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a steel door that could withstand an explosive. Woojin struck it with his hammer, but it didn\u2019t budge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. Hey, Dolsae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWeeeeeng\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae was already level 27.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His basic form could use dirt to make his body. At level 10, he could use stones. Moreover, he was able to use metal at level 20.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo koo koohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entire steel door was ripped away, and it started to form a shape. Dolsae formed in a crouching stance, and he immediately got out of Woojin\u2019s way. The underground bunker shook as pieces of concrete fell from the ceiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door itself turned into a golem. He could see a frightened Kim-jungun and his bodyguards from the Security department inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned when he saw them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould we have a little talk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His smile was crueler than a smile from a devil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou dare try to kill me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cComrade. I\u2019ve never gave such an order.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun replied with a shaky voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a monster among monsters. The Supernatural Force\u2019s Roused demonstrated for him couple times, but none of them were like Woojin. Woojin was outspoken, and he was an impossible opponent to beat. Kim-jungun really felt the threat to his life.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had hidden himself yet Woojin knew where he was like a wraith, and Woojin had come after him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, there is a way I\u2019ll be able to find out the truth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin grinned, a paper thin shadow exited Jungun\u2019s shadow, and Ggaebi was reabsorbed into Woojin\u2019s shadow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Mmmm.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He experienced what Kim-jungun\u2019s shadow felt and experienced, while Woojin was inside the Dungeon. Then Woojin\u2019s eyebrows furrowed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He really didn\u2019t do it?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi shook her head at his embarrassing situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Master made an accident again-ahong. Just resolve it in an amicable manner-ahong.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already ran wild once, so his anger had lessened a little bit. Still, he wasn\u2019t planning on forgiving anyone. Kim-jungun wasn\u2019t the only one who needed to receive his punishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Jungun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease speak, comrade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFind me the man who ordered the suicide bombing on me. I never let live someone who stabbed me in the back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI give you my word, comrade. I\u2019ll find the one pulling the string from behind at all cost. I will hand out an exemplary punishment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Kim-jungun\u2019s words, Woojin grinned as he raised his hand for a handshake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis was my misunderstanding. Sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had turned Pyungyang inside out. Woojin didn\u2019t know if an apology would be enough, but\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. It is my fault for not keeping my subordinates in line.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf there weren\u2019t any misunderstanding, then we could have been good friend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s words, Kim-jungun made a expression of regret then he shook hands with Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed as he saw Kim-jungun\u2019s ample fat on his chin. The feared dictator leading North Korea was a mania for the Roused\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mania was so fierce that he collected numerous Artifacts even if he didn\u2019t have any abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was weird.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he was fan of Woojin\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Then I\u2019ll accept these presents, comrade.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned. He knew where all the Artifacts were kept inside the Memorial Palace. Moreover, he also knew about Kim-jungun\u2019s hobby room, where he stashed away a lot of Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Comrade Kahng-woojin smiled, while he was looking at me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun matched his smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused held strength that was beyond the limit of human. Kim-jungun\u2019s respect towards the Roused was much deeper than what Woojin had suspected.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

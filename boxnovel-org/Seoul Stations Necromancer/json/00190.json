\u00a0Where?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan had been getting ready to berate the man. \u00a0However, he got up from his seat with a bright expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s in London.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLondon?

Yes, mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan politely bowed towards Kahng-woojin's mother, Lee-soogyong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-whew. \u00a0I told you to stop doing that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0How could I\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan was uncomfortable calling her by her name. \u00a0Lee-soogyong, who was abashed by being called by her title, barely got Minchan to call her \u2018mother\u2019. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even now she stood up from her seat by the door to greet him. \u00a0He was uncomfortable by such attention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to greet me like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo ho. \u00a0A person of high stature like the Prime Minister has come here, so how can I not greet you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, mother\u2026. \u00a0Your son is way above me.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had tried to get that point across to her multiple times, yet she didn\u2019t change. \u00a0Therefore, he swallowed what he was about to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall I prepare your usual order?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes\u2026. \u00a0Also, I also have business with Ms. Bibi\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-whew. \u00a0I was thoughtless. \u00a0Hurry up and go see her. \u00a0It seems I took away time from a busy man.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0It is nothing. \u00a0I\u2019ll be going.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soogyong let go of Minchan\u2019s hand, and she went back to giving orders to her employees. \u00a0In her mind, Jung-minchan was the highest ranked person in Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From her perspective, Kahng-woojin was just her son\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan gave his farewell, and he approached the terrace. \u00a0\u00a0Bibi and Sooah were sitting in chairs as they leisurely chatted with each other. \u00a0He also saw Do-jaemin standing close to the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was no longer affected by the sun, so his face was impassive even in the light of the sun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMs. Bibi. \u00a0We\u2019ll have to move the fortress to London.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy London?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've picked up on Kim-gahngchul's trace there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm. \u00a0He is the guy that ran away last time? \u00a0All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her master had ordered the recapture of this particular human. \u00a0Bibi readily nodded her head, and she immediately moved the fortress. \u00a0There was a slight tremor before Bibi\u2019s Castle started to move slowly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh, Sooah? \u00a0Are you feeling unwell?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN...no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike her words, Sooah\u2019s face was pale. \u00a0She had been well until a moment ago. \u00a0When the color of her face changed, Do-jaemin was taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin was asked by Kahng-woojin to protect Sooah. \u00a0This was the first time he had seen such a change, so of course, he was taken aback by it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, Jung-minchan and Bibi\u2019s face was filled with worry, but they weren\u2019t surprised by what was happening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe is receiving an oracle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet us move to a different location.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah was letting out cold sweat as her pupils moved around in an unfocused manner. \u00a0Bibi quickly carried her into a room located at the corner of the cafe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While they left, a man drinking a beverage was manipulating his handphone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man had just taken pictures of Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man attached the photos to a message before sending it out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Possible target. \u00a0Need confirmation.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the message was sent,the man finished his drink before a woman approached him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Soongho. \u00a0Your lunch time has ended. \u00a0Hurry up and go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0Yes, manager.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He put the handphone back into his pocket, then Soongho got up from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Cafe\u2019s Backroom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A powerful energy was being emitted from Sooah\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was barely able to keep her eyes open, but her ghastly visage no longer belonged to Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The time of our destiny has arrived.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her small mouth stood still, yet a sound rang inside everyone\u2019s head. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat time is she talking about?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was no answer to Minchan\u2019s question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was always like this. \u00a0She only spoke what she wanted to say,</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It might be the start of a change, or the bridle may be put on us again\u2026..]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since there was no point in speaking to her, everyone stayed silent as they listened. \u00a0They just recorded her words, so Kahng-woojin could be informed of her words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[\u2026\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah\u2019s body had been floating up in the air, but now she was slowly descending to the floor. \u00a0Bibi lifted her, and she carefully stroked Sooah\u2019s cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPoor thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was her master's dongsaeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did the god of earth pick Sooah? \u00a0She was still very young.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi looked to be the same age as Sooah, but she was a demon. \u00a0She had lived over 200 years as a succubus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She couldn\u2019t help, but pity Sooah. \u00a0She felt for her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Bibi\u2019s slightly wet eyes opened wide from surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMiss Bibi? \u00a0What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan questioned her in surprise, but Bibi extended his hand towards him. \u00a0She stopped him from approaching.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She let out an exclamation as her body started to twist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her arms and legs exploded.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of fragments of blood\u2026 \u00a0Various parts of her body exploded into black smoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she was completely returned to being a cloud of black smoke, it started to coalesce again. \u00a0She was completely different from before. \u00a0She was taller and her body was bigger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if Bibi was unsummoned before being summoned again. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh uhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of the unconscious Sooah, Minchan and Jaemin let out shocked exclamation at Bibi\u2019s changed appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had slim legs that extended for days. \u00a0Alongside her increased height, her breasts and butt grew bigger\u2026. \u00a0She still had her cute face, but her appearance almost made her look inhuman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi had a different type of beauty compared to the Holy Maiden Melody. \u00a0She was oozing with sex appeal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, a slim black tail extended out from her backside\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One couldn\u2019t tell if you was letting out a exclamation or a moan. \u00a0She let out a restless noise as she puffed out her cheeks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis will be troublesome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Even her voice sounded seductive. \u00a0It was as if her voice was melting the ears of the men around her. \u00a0Minchan and Jaemin didn\u2019t even think about turning their heads away. \u00a0Their faces were beet red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi turned to look at the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Jeez. \u00a0Stop looking at the two of us like that. \u00a0We are in a troublesome situation too. \u00a0Holy crap.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are in trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Bibi\u2019s words, the two men mumbled to themselves as if their souls had been bewitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEverything is bigger\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c</span><span style=\"\">Oh, say can you see. \u00a0By the dawn's early light</span><span style=\"\">\u2026.\u201d</span><sub>1</sub></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two men continued to mumble to themselves as if they weren\u2019t of sound mind yet. \u00a0Bibi furrowed her brows as she looked at them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease come to your senses!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-yoohk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She spoke with a serious expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems earth has finished going through its synchronization.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan replied with a question. \u00a0Bibi still had on a serious expression as she turned to look at the unconscious Sooah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So was this the time of destiny mentioned by earth\u2019s god?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Dimensional Gates will now be wide open.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan and Jaemin also put on a serious expression. \u00a0Even now the Dimensional lords were appearing quite frequently. \u00a0If the Dimensional gates was thrown wide open\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the earlier attacks were exploratory attacks, the attacks from now on will be\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The real war was about to start now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBlock them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgooh-ahhhhk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-doo-doo-doo-doo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hail of bullets were shot as the brave Roused charged forward. \u00a0They died in an ill-advised manner. \u00a0Their enemies were powerful, and they had all show up on the world at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the 2nd Dungeon Shock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the name coined by the media of the world, \u00a0and it described the incidents that were occurring daily. \u00a0However, it wasn\u2019t a topic of conversation any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were places where tens of thousands of people were being killed, and the odd phenomena of an entire city being vaporized into nothing had occurred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entirety of earth was in chaos.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The owners of businesses and the upper crust of society had already evacuated to several regions that were considered to be safe zones. \u00a0It was ironic that these people evacuated to third world countries, who possessed no subway stations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was clearing Dungeons the safer option?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeons were reset several dozen times a day, and the Roused couldn\u2019t continuously attempt to clear them. \u00a0\u00a0It only took a single day for Dimensional lords to appear at these unkept Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, it wasn\u2019t just the Dimensional lords. \u00a0There were the Dungeon owners and the Dimensional refugees appearing on earth. \u00a0A problem that arose from these events was the fact that not all of these beings were monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were races that looked exactly like humans. \u00a0Even the Dimensional refugee classified as humanoid were mixing into the population of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The previous Dungeon Shock couldn\u2019t be compared to this current great catastrophe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a situation where it was hard to tell, who should be helped or not, Bibi\u2019s Castle arrived in the skies of London.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre the British government still unresponsive towards our request?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey want us to wait. \u00a0They\u2019ll allow us entry soon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He zoomed in on the surface with cameras, and he could see the situation beneath was very bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was hellish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unknown as to how many Dungeon Breaks had occurred, but there seemed to be more monsters than humans below. \u00a0London was a lawless land now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. \u00a0Hurry up...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had come here to find Kim-kahngchul, but that problem was inconsequential now. \u00a0The solving of the Moon World\u2019s secret was a moot point if the entire earth fell into ruins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, earth wouldn\u2019t fall to ruins. \u00a0The population would be eradicated\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The core members of Alandal were gathered in the control room, and they were still waiting for permission from the British government.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi and Do-jaemin simultaneously let out an exclamation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster is back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH...hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as he returned to his Dimensional Domain, Woojin sent messages to his vassals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How\u2019s earth doing? \u00a0If it isn\u2019t busy over there, I want to gather some Points in Alandal.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is busy. \u00a0Earth is in trouble.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster. \u00a0The Synchronization was completed.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He heard the two voices simultaneously, and Woojin became silent. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Is it bad?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! \u00a0The Dungeons are continuously Breaking all over the world. \u00a0People are being evacuated to regions without any subway stations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Where are you guys?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are at London.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ll be heading over there.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0Please hurry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan wasn't able to hear Woojin\u2019s voice, so he reacted when he heard Do-jaemin\u2019s words. \u00a0Jung-minchan answered with a pale face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the king comes this way, what\u2019ll happen to the employees dispatched at the Seoul Station?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin immediately updated the situation, and Woojin asked a question in response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Who\u2019s there?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChief secretary Woo went there. \u00a0He wanted to improve upon the relationship with Korea\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ah. \u00a0That guy is always quite troublesome.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After mulling over it for a short time, Woojin gave an answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ll go to Seoul. \u00a0I want you guys to kill all the monsters over there.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe British government hasn\u2019t given us permission to enter\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Jaemin\u2019s words, Woojin didn\u2019t even have to think about his answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have my permission.

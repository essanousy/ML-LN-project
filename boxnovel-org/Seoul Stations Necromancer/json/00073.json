His shadow rode along the darkness to head towards the laser.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The missile was flying towards him at a high speed, but Woojin only had to travel a short distance. How large would the explosion be? He couldn\u2019t test it inside the hotel since Jung-minchan was there. Moreover, a lot of people were in the vicinity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin was in mid-air, he punched the head of the missile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be great if he could change the direction of the missile, but he didn\u2019t care if it didn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggooooooohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The contained energy burst outwards as it caused an explosion. The Soul Armor that was always around Woojin activated much quicker than the explosion. The barrier of Soul was thickest at Woojin\u2019s fist. It created multiple layers to protect his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The incredible explosion was obstructed by the Soul Armor, so the flames exploded up into the sky. Moreover, Woojin endured the entirety of the repelling force caused by the explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoooook! Kwahhhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s figure fell to the floor several times faster than the the speed he had ascended with. Woojin flew between buildings as he barely avoided them. He crashed into the road, then a large crater was formed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bbeek, beeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shock wave caused the surrounding parked cars to blare out noisily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poo-sooooooo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fragments and dusts from the cave-in of the road rose thick into the air. In the midst of it all, Woojin stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Spirit Armor had somewhat contained the exploding missile, but all of his stored souls evaporated midway. Afterwards, he crashed to the ground, and Woojin had to absorb the damage with his body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ooh. How can they act like this on US soil?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin wiped the blood that trickled out of his mouth. His chest hurt, and he was having a hard time breathing. It seemed he had broken couple ribs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had used up all of the souls he had imprisoned, so he couldn\u2019t use Soul Extraction to heal his body. He didn\u2019t want to kill and absorb the souls of the surprised people looking out their windows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was Alphen\u2019s Immortal, then he would have already killed them. However, Earth\u2019s Woojin had other options.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He bought a Potion from the Point Store, then he poured it into his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he roughly started to heal, the pain receded, and he started to get annoyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A missile attack on US soil\u2026. Which bastards did this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did the Titan do this with the approval of the Department of Defense? Or was it some other powerhouse?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whoever it was, they had basically sent a declaration of war to him. When he was in North Korea, the explosion was set off in the closed confines of a subway station, and he had barely been able to stay alive. Still, if he hadn\u2019t had his Spirit Armor, he would have died a fruitless death by the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are they keep targeting me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew different people was gunning for him, but the important part was they were all aiming for him. It just reaffirmed the fact that the people of earth won\u2019t be able to come together to resist against Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, it was impossible from the start.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t run amok like a jackass. He just lived according to his personality. He decided to show the world who he was as he ignored other\u2019s gazes. He hadn\u2019t cared if he made enemies during all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he had enemies then it also mean he was making allies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll have to make some adjustments again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Who\u2019ll grab the leadership role of protecting earth?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Will it be the existing groups of capitalists? The Roused with strength in their hands? The nations with the strongest military?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every bastard with a modicum of power would try to seize the leadership role.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet would attack when earth\u2019s powers were split.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Trahnet would bring over his endless army, and only when some of the world\u2019s power starts to fall, earth will try to build an allied force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a pattern he had already experienced on Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Kahng-woojin was summoned, the allied forces of Alphen and Trahnet was in midst of a tense war. Many people had died, and a large portion of the land was wasted. Woojin\u2019s voice didn\u2019t have any influence or power in the alliance, so he decided to build his own forces on the abandoned dead-lands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he quietly grow his power here on earth again?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a good option if he wanted to repeat his past mistakes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt would be great if they revealed themselves to me like this\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t care if those aiming for his life came out into the open. He\u2019ll make an example out of them, so the entire earth will imprinted with the image of him inside their memories.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care if such an act would make people fear him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A more brutal enemy was in front of them, and the earth had to come together. Woojin was going to lead them. At the very least,he wanted enough presence where his voice would be heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care if he gained fame or notoriety from achieving his goals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s way too early\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Events were happening much faster than Woojin had expected.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He hadn\u2019t purposefully held back his personality, but at the same time, he hadn\u2019t done anything that would have made enemies\u2026 He was disillusioning himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So which dimwit was so impatient to get rid of him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah pah pah pah pah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin lifted his gaze. The helicopter in mid-air a long distance away started to fly away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBibi. Go follow it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[All right.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A black smoke formed, and she was carried off by the wind. She flew under the helicopter\u2019s fuselage. The black smoke changed back into a cat, and she clung on tightly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo. Should I go see what these bastards look like?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put Ggaebi on the bastard, who shot the laser pointer. He walked towards Ggaebi\u2019s energy signature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoly Maiden. Guild Alandal\u2019s president Kahng-woojin just arrived at the airport.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody was surprised by Mrs. Hamilton\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Why was she so nervous when she heard the Korean name Kahng-woojin?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hamilton wondered how Melody, who had come from Alphen, was acquainted with a Korean man. Moreover, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder why Melody overreacted every time his name was mentioned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, she couldn\u2019t ask Melody these questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hamilton was a convert of the Aria Church, and Melody was the precious Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you sure we didn\u2019t do anything that would incur his displeasure?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I made a special request to the Titan Guild, and they will guide him to the hotel with utmost care.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She bit her lips as it trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she thought about their eventual meeting, she couldn\u2019t help, but tremble. He probably knew about her being here, and he had come here to meet her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She couldn\u2019t avoid him. She knew the only answer to this problem was to meet him head on. Still, she couldn\u2019t help, but feel afraid when she thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. Shouldn\u2019t she be the one to visit him first?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a fiery personality. Would he cause her trouble if she didn\u2019t come greet him first?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It was more than likely if it was him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden suddenly stood up from her seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich hotel is he staying at?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hamilton was very surprised. Melody was the most important person after the goddess Aria. Was Kahng-woojin worth all of this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll have to go see him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll go prepare the Holy Knights.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the Holy Maiden\u2019s business was conducted inside the Aria Church at the Titan Guild\u2019s headquarters. However, she sometimes had to attend public events, so she received protection from her Holy Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On average, the Holy Knights had the ability of a Rank B+ Roused. Her protectors was the strongest group on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will be honored if I was able to follow you, Holy Maiden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will volunteer my services to the Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Knights scrambled forward to be in the group that would accompany her. Ten knights were chosen amongst them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They accompanied Melody as she headed towards the hotel where Kahng-woojin was staying at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were 3 vehicles, and the Holy Maiden got in the second car. James sat next to her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden had healed his daughter\u2019s incurable disease. After he witnessed the miracle, he became the most fervent vassal of the Aria Church.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used to be a Rank A Roused representing the Titan Guild, but now he was the head Holy Knight of Aria\u2019s church.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs something bothering you, Holy Maiden??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some unknown uneasiness shown through the Holy Maiden\u2019s eyes, and James wasn\u2019t used to seeing her like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was always serene and happy. The Holy Maiden was like a real life angel, who had descended from the sky. She was beautiful, and she had a majestic bearing befitting an agent of the goddess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, this was the first time James had seen her act this way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was unaccustomed to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. I\u2019m fine. Please don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, Holy Maiden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">James decided he would have to pay more attention in protecting her, when he saw Melody\u2019s anxiety. As they were about to head towards the hotel, the vehicle came to a stop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease wait a moment..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">James pushed the mic button on the device in his ear, and he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Chee-jeek. There was an explosion nearby.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">James looked over the driver seat, then he caught sight of the city that was beyond the window. There was a large bank of clouds on top of the city. It wasn\u2019t a natural phenomena.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did the windows shake a little bit before because of the after-effect of an explosion?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems there was a terrorist attack. We\u2019ll have to return for your safety.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden\u2019s chin shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Is he on a rampage? Shouldn\u2019t she go see what\u2019s going on?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to know what had happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to turn back. I\u2019ll report to you after I find out what happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the Holy Maiden\u2019s silence, James radioed a message to his teammates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are heading back to church, Nick. Take some of our boys to see what happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Roger.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two cars did a U-turn, and the last car in the convoy headed towards the street where the explosion happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nick stood in front of a very large crater.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid a meteor fall here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they looked around the surrounding, the impact hadn\u2019t brought down any buildings. However, the fragments from the walls, and the damaged cars were quite noticeable. There was also a crater that looked like a sinkhole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One of the team members sent out to scout the surrounding returned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou might not believe this, but a person fell at that spot. There were a lot of witnesses.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere\u2019s the corpse?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Nick\u2019s question, Jimmy shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s alive. Witnesses said he just walked out of there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you kidding me, Jimmy? Why don\u2019t you just say the terminator came here? Would you survive a collision that would cause a shock wave of this magnitude?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou never know. If it\u2019s a Roused with physical abilities, it might be possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was some logic to his words. If it was a Roused with magic based abilities, a gun shot would kill the person. However, a bullet wouldn\u2019t\u2019 even be able to pierce through the skin of a Roused with physical ability. Many of them had steel-like skins.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, one had to be a Rank B Roused with physical ability to survive this. Did a Roused specializing in defense fall from the sky?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too too too too too too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sounds of rotors made him look up, and he could see the news helicopters up in the sky. When he looked around his surrounding, several reporters were already taking pictures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s head back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs it is? What about our investigation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe news will inform us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jimmy let out a guffaw at Nick\u2019s easygoing words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s head back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Knights of the Aria Church headed back towards the church.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of Kahng-woojin\u2019s hotel room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan stood behind the employee, who was using the master key to open the door. He restlessly bounced on his feet with a nervous expression on his face. The building shook, while he was taking a shower. Moreover, he also heard the sound of an explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The vibration felt like an earthquake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first serious thought that came into his mind was about Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He immediately went to Woojin\u2019s room, but it was locked. Moreover, there was no response from inside the room. This was why Minchan had quickly chased down an employee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, President. Please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the employee with the master key opened the door, Minchan\u2019s eyes took in the dark room with his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tahk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the room was illuminated, the wind blowing through the empty room made Jung-minchan\u2019s blood run cold.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan looked at the broken window with a devastated expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt resentment. He guessed what had happened when he heard the sound of an explosion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s president\u2019s doing.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan looked out the broken window, then he searched the entire room. However, Kahng-woojin was nowhere to be found.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did the president carry out an act of terror on US soil?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even he couldn\u2019t settle this affair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin said he wouldn\u2019t make any accident\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan plopped down in front of Woojin\u2019s messy carrier bag.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">(TLN: I\u2019m not sure why Minchan is putting the blame on Woojin. Maybe he thought the terrorist group wouldn\u2019t attack in the US, so by process of elimination, Woojin did it?)</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

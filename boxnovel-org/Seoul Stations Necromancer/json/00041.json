The barrier is disappearing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? That\u2019s crazy talk?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters gathered in front of the Seoul National University Station\u2019s 6th exit was surprised when they saw the barrier start to disappear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It takes an average time of about 8 hours to clear a 5 star Dungeon. However, Woojin and Sunggoo was showing up after entering the Dungeon for 4 hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if the time flowed 4 times faster in there, they had completed the Dungeon in about 16 hours.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hurry up and write the article.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll have to try to get an interview from him. Oh-wahh. What the heck is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t this mean he is almost at Kim-gahngchul\u2019s level?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. Still, you are comparing him to Kim-kahngchul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one had to pick the greatest Roused of Korea, then everyone would say it was Kim-gahngchul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, his impact won\u2019t be something to scoff at.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. Uh, they are coming out now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Surely there weren\u2019t any Roused in Korea that was hotter than Woojin right now. He was the Roused who had cleared the 5 star Dungeon by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was still obscure since he is a new Rank A Roused, but there were a lot of controversy surrounding him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why didn\u2019t he reveal his true Rank? What happened during 5 years he went missing? What ability did he have\u2026.etc.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since not a lot was known about him, there were a lot of speculations, and the conversations were hot in the internet community.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the job of the reporters to reveal any information about the Roused Kang-woojin, who was hidden by a veil.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kang-woojin. Please do an interview with us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters crowded in to get closer to Kang-woojin. He glared as he ascended the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not in a good mood. Why dont\u2019 you get out of the way while I\u2019m still being civil?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His seething voice was fierce like the sound of a wild animal. The reporters flinched at his intimidating spirit, and they retreated to the back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there were over 20 reporters gathered there. The reporter at the end of the line yelled out a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kahng-woojin. Please give us a statement.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stood still as he looked around to see the reporters. Wooin\u2019s gaze came to a rest on a microphone placed right in front of his nose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPut that away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After hearing his threatening voice, the reporter quietly lowered the microphone. Woojin glared at them, and the reporters all avoided his gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ooh. How can a person glare like that?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin started walking away, and the atmosphere deterred the reporters from talking to him again. The reporters latched on to Sunggoo, who was walking despondently towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Hong-sunggoo. You are Mr. Kang-woojin\u2019s only team mate. How did you guys meet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are people who are comparing Mr. Kang-woojin and Mr. Kim-gangchul. Who do you think is stronger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the rapid succession of questions by the reporters, Sunggoo uncharacteristically got mad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you guys taking this a little too far? Do you think a Dungeon is a playground. We came back alive, and when he just started to breathe the air of earth, you guys are pushing the cameras in our face?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the reporters didn\u2019t\u2019 say anything, Sunggoo became more irate, and he started yelling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you do this to other teams? Do you think we are that easy to deal with?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters covered them since they had been easy to deal with. The other large guild\u2019s teams wouldn\u2019t allow the reporters to rush them in the first place. The Support teams blocked the reporters as a matter of course.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease get out of the way..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo escaped from the grasp of the reporters. Woojin had already walked a fair distance away. Sunggo ran, and he fell in behind Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I\u2019m sorry about before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEnough. That\u2019s enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have to act in moderation or they won\u2019t see you in a favorable light. Weren\u2019t you a little bit to heavy handed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned when he heard Sunggo\u2019s depressed voice. He thought Sunggoo was too innocent. He guessed it would have been more strange if Sunggoo had been fine after he came face to face with death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How much hardship had Woojin gone through at Planet Alphen?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are a man\u2026. Put your chest out, dude.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBe brave. You were only cussed out a little bit. You don\u2019t have put on a martyred expression.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, this was unfair. He was hearing such words from the actual culprit who had berated him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Sunggoo was still strangely comforted by his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDude. Then let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin got into Sunggoo\u2019s car, then he made a call to Kim-haemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Mr. Woojin. No. President. You\u2019ve already come out?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing right now? Where is team leader Jung?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Team leader went home after he finalized the contract for an office. He went home to make a final inspection on the documents he will submit tomorrow\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou guys already acquired an office?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes. Do you want to see it?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What\u2019s the point of seeing it right now? He just wanted to rest today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Just give me the address.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes, sir. I\u2019ll immediately send you a text]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin\u2019s phone call ended, a text arrived. He pressed the address, and the Maps app opened to indicate where it was located at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s close.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s words, Sunggoo snuck a question in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t this too much like a declaration of war against the Hammer guild??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf our headquarters are close, then we would be in direct competitions with them..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a Dungeon Reset happens, the raid opportunity is given to the very first team who arrives. If one\u2019s headquarter is close, then one will have a higher chance of arriving first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was natural for the competition to become intense for nearby companies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The large guilds were called the Korea\u2019s 3 great guild. Everyone stayed far away from them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">KH was located at Gangbuk. Hwarang was at Inchun, and Hammer was at Gangnam. Even the medium-sized guild stayed a good distance away from their territory. This was how the large guilds kept an advantage over their competitors.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what? It isn\u2019t like we want to fight them. Aren\u2019t we just trying to keep our options open?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Initially, they had established the guild to avoid joining the army. However, the Hammer guild wouldn\u2019t see it like that\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin\u2019s house was only two station\u2019s away, so he arrived at the house in no time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow at the office.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung. Please head in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you very much for saving me..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo problem, man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin waved his hand then he headed towards Jaemin\u2019s house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened the door to come in. It seemed Jaemin was still at his tutoring school, and he wasn\u2019t back yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahh. Master has become a lot stronger again-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned at Bibi, who always greeted him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBibi. Do you remember Trahnet\u2019s underlings?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng? What about those monsters-nyahng?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was thinking about it. Let\u2019s say these damn Dungeons were created by Trahnet to attack Earth. I understand those bastards are trying to make something like a Dimensional Tunnel. However, why haven\u2019t we seen any signs of Trahnet\u2019s underling?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahk. There was that time-nyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Rakwi and Drabbits were all low rank monsters. It was hard to call them as being part of Trahnet\u2019s army. They were wild animals that usually showed up near Trahnet\u2019s territory. Maybe they could be considered to be tool used by him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI meant that bastard\u2019s real underlings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t talking about the low rank monsters. If Trahnet\u2019s real army showed up right now, it would be impossible for the Earth\u2019s forces to stand in their way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 10 ballyhooed rank A Roused of Korea only possessed ability akin to level 60.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were on the same class as a 6th Circle Magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would have made some waves with that level of power on Planet Alphen, but it was insufficient when facing Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahhng. Maybe they are still short on power-nyahng?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPower?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook at me-nyahng. I can\u2019t materialize my true body on earth, and I\u2019m stuck in this state-nyahng. Myabe they can\u2019t materialize on earth yet-nyahng?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin suddenly had a thought as a light-bulb went off in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose bastards don\u2019t have enough power to materialize on earth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. I think so-ahong??\u201c</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That seemed likely. No, it must be true. If not, why wouldn\u2019t they actively attack?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose bastards are sending the Anthropomorphic races they had captured or enslaved as the advance troops.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were using the Dungeon and the Dungeon Break. This might mean the humans of Alphen might really come over to earth. From the perspective of people living on earth, they might be viewed as beings of the same race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Why does the Dungeon Break always happen on the 30th days?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahhn. Maybe it\u2019s that-nyahng?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTrahnet\u2019s army always seemed to be reinforced each month-nyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster said so before-nyahng. The bastards only come out on their payday-nyahng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I did say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi had the face of a cat, but she spoke in a serious manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe one thing for sure is Trahnet\u2019s smell will get stronger as the Dungeon Break keeps happening-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That sounded like trouble. The humans of earth couldn\u2019t face Trahnet\u2019s army yet. Earth will probably succumb to Trahnet more helplessly than Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he could get rid of the Dungeon itself then it would be great. However, he couldn\u2019t come up with a good idea. It felt like there should be a good solution to this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yeah. If you return to the Summoning room, Dolsae should also be there.\u201d(TLN: Dolsae= Rock Iron)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng? Really-ahong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s second family member.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi was very happy at the Golem Dolsae\u2019s appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahng. I\u2019m so happy-nahohng. Can I go play with Dolsae inside the Summoning room?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYah-ohng. When you go to a Dungeon next time, please call me out-ahong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soo-soo-sook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Bibi was happy at Dolsae\u2019s appearance. She quickly disappeared as she turned into black smoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. Then should I start studying about the society?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin found the remote control, then he turned on the tv. Then he started writing a text to Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Buy me one bag of tangerine when you come.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took less than 10 seconds before a reply came.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019m almost home.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before Woojin could respond, the front door opened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi, ddi, dii. Dddi-ro ri.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Why don\u2019t you go out and buy some for me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Let me change my cloth first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a puzzled expression when he heard Jaemin\u2019s obedient words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-deek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin put away his bag then he changed his clothes. As he watched Jaemin leave, Woojin spoke as he decided not to take out his wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe isn\u2019t even going to ask me for money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon, Jaemin returned with a bag of tangerine, and he handed it over to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Did something bad happen in school? Is someone bothering you again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. Thanks to hyung I\u2019m doing well. I want to thank you once again..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin bowed his head. Woojin\u2019s eyes turned round, because he wasn\u2019t use to this Jaemin. Why was he being like this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you need some spending money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. The money hyung gave me last time should last awhile. I don\u2019t need more spending money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. This guy. He\u2019s being really serious today. How odd.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I have to study now. It\u2019s my testing period.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, uh. You do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw Jaemin open his book after sitting in front of the desk, Woojin had a sour expression on his face. This kid suddenly turned very serious, and it bothered Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pressed his remote control, and he decreased the volume.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin had his book open, but he couldn\u2019t concentrate. He wasn\u2019t bothered by the sounds of the drama coming from tv or the sound of Woojin peeling the tangerine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt a heavy feeling in his chest. It felt like he was suffocating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he knew it, a sigh leaked out Woojin, and he called out to Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, what? What\u2019s going on? Are you going through puberty?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything like that\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin\u2019s face was filled with worry. He looked like he was holding the burden of the whole world on his back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin called out as he clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDude. Just hurry up and tell me. Stop sighing and just talk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, Jaemin closed his book, then he sat down heavily next to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned off the drama. Jaemin bit his lips several times, and he was barely able to find his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you remember the time I told you about my dream?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh, what. Do you mean you wanting to join a guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI do. You said you want to make a lot of money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin remembered what Jaemin had said. Jaemin bolstered his nerve, then he continued to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung\u2019s story is all over the place recently. In the past, I didn\u2019t know hyung was such a great person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He extorted a high school\u2026. No, he gave the money back. Anyways, Woojin had borrowed money for transportation, and Woojin didn\u2019t have a place to live so he was living at his house. It would have been weirder if he had thought Woojin was a great person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what? Are you sulking because I didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I heard hyung-nim is making a guild\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin secretly smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. So that\u2019s what it was. Do you want me to give you a spot in my guild? Hey. I was already going to add you in, but I was told under-age kids can\u2019t join a guild. Dude. Were you disappointed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t disappointed.

to protect Sooah. \u00a0If he wanted to do that, he had to eliminate his enemies. \u00a0\u00a0Kahng-woojin made up his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go to Seoul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan gave his assent, and the course was set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi\u2019s castle tilted before it righted itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess they are back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an impact that shook the large fortress. \u00a0This could only mean that Yong Yong had landed on the flying fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin came out to the deck, he was greeted by his Undead army. \u00a0They had returned after defeating the Dimensional lords trying to form Colonies in Taiwan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMaster\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet ready, Bibi. \u00a0We are going to go catch Iello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh-ho. \u00a0He\u2019s a great lord..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even amongst the Dimensional lords, the 72 great lords were powerful beings. \u00a0Bibi brought up the information regarding Iello, and she furrowed her brows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s a troublesome one.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLee-sahngho glommed onto that batard. \u00a0We have to eliminate them before they become a bigger problem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho had died once, so he had lost the Code to earth. \u00a0He was basically a Dimensional refugee now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing going for him was the fact that he was the ex-guild master of the Hwarang guild. \u00a0This was why he had a high profile amongst the people of earth, and he had stepped forward to endorse Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In such chaotic times, how would the people of earth react to a friendly Dimensional lord?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the fact that Lee-sahngho was helping Iello by his side would lower the hostility of the people by a significant amount.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the existence of Kahng-woojin also worked in the favor of Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He commanded the Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin\u2019s subordinates were basically monsters to the people of earth, but the only reason why they were accepted was the fact that a person from earth was the leader. \u00a0He had control over his subordinates, and he was able to use them to fight against the monsters considered to be enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Iello was aiming for a similar role\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be troublesome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the people, who already made a pact with Iello, got in Woojin\u2019s way\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He might have to war against a bloc of humans, who had the support of a Dimensional lord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, the situation wasn\u2019t all too bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undead army had raised a significant amount of Achievement Points through their diligent hunting. \u00a0Moreover, he also gained a good amount of Points through the Dimensional Battles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He used both his Achievement Store and Dimensional Store to purchase the Ingredient Items needed to forge the Thrash\u2019s Set.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was barely able to make one more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put on the black gloves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u3008Thrash\u2019s Punishment\u3009</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The god of Fertility Lecia\u2019s treasure was now imbued with the power of the god of Destruction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Item had the power to sprout any seed, but now it had changed into an Item of calamity. \u00a0It allowed Woojin to extract souls from all beings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he just needed the helm for his defensive set Item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he had already regained four of his equipments, so he felt his confidence buoy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin was doing very good work as he continued to fight the Dimensional Battles, and soon he\u2019ll be able to equip all his gears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He will have gathered the five keys that\u2019ll allow him to gain the Executioner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wouldn't be too long before Thrash\u2019s power descended upon him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be back before we arrive at our destination, so wait for my return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, master.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf something happens, contact me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin ruffled Bibi\u2019s head once, and he used his portal to head towards his Dimensional Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to use every minute and every second to gather Points. \u00a0He might be able to gain the last set Item called Thrash\u2019s Glory before he arrived at his destination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> *** \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bam island, Hahn River.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Thorn Tree had grown atop the island, and ice covered the entire tree. \u00a0A palace made out of ice was built atop the tree like a bird\u2019s nest. \u00a0Iello was within and he was incensed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His anger made the palace shake, and Lee-sahngho was prostrated on the floor as he waited for Iello\u2019s anger to subside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKahng-woojin is coming here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0However, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able attack us without cause.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe official statement has not been released yet, but we\u2019ve finalized the defense treaty with Japan. \u00a0This will greatly limit his options.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It hadn\u2019t be announced yet, but Iello and Japan had already finalized the defense treaty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Japan had always been jealous of Korea for being allied to the newly formed country of Alandal. \u00a0This was why it had been unexpectedly easy to achieve alliance with Japan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are also hearing favorable words from Korea, so we just need to wait a little bit more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin\u2019s Alandal was impossible to control, so there were some within the Korea government, who looked favorably at the appearance of Iello. \u00a0Lee-sahngho was saying all the right words to the leading members of the Korean government.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there was a problem. \u00a0He had put in a lot of work to bring all of this about, but it had no effect in easing the rage of Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The source of the problem was Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you really think that bastard will think in those terms?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho had been mercilessly assaulted by Kahng-woojin when all the cameras were on him. \u00a0\u00a0Kahng-woojin was the worst type of terrorist, and he didn\u2019t need much provocation to start a war.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was that kind of a person\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho\u2019s expression darkened, and this sight stressed out Iello mightily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello\u2019s plan had gone off the rail, and he didn\u2019t think it could be righted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He should have waited a little bit longer. \u00a0He would have never expected Ibrit to be so powerless against Kahng-woojin. \u00a0Moreover, he had appeared in plain sight after Kahng-woojin had left Seoul\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho had done a good job bringing order to a chaotic situation when a new Dimensional lord had made his appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, this was also the crux of their troubles right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello had awkwardly thrown his hat into the ring, and now he couldn\u2019t go back into hiding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To make matters worse, Kahng-woojin was heading straight for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...we have to put up barriers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are several groups within Korea, who look at us in a positive light. \u00a0If we bring them into the fold as allies, Kahng-woojin wouldn\u2019t dare to attack\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShut up\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-ahh-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His yell created a shockwave, and Lee-sahngho was embedded within the wall of ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUseless bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The usefulness of having a vassal, who originated from earth, seemed to have come to an end.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His opponent was too terrible to use conventional wisdom to predict his moves. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he find a peaceful solution?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the fight with the bastard couldn\u2019t be avoided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His only regret was the fact that this was supposed to be an easy fight on earth. \u00a0However, things kept getting more complicated, and now a direct conflict was inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had waited for others to cook the meat, so he\u2019ll be able to just pick up and eat it. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he had to roast it himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf I\u2019m going to do this, I\u2019ll do it for certain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Great lord Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to gather only 25 Dimensional Codes, but he possessed something that the high rank great lords didn\u2019t have.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had gathered numerous low rank Dimensional lords as subordinates under the a guise of an alliance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll gather all of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello started gathering all his warriors. \u00a0He\u2019ll be in a war to gain the most important Dimensional Code.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was Rajakui of the Yellow Lizard Alliance from Planet Jaku, Iseural alliance of the Planet Litan, the alliance from the Planet Joojooro\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the Dimensional lord Nakamura from earth, who pledged his loyalty to him\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter what level of power they had. \u00a0Iello summoned all the Dimensional lords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">New National Assembly Building, Sejong City.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW...what should we do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The chief secretary whispered into Kim-byungmahn\u2019s ears. \u00a0One could clearly hear the worry in his voice, so Kim-byungmahn swallowed his groan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he the last president of Korea, who will share the final fate with Korea?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, the situation in Korea was akin to walking a tight rope above an endless abyss. \u00a0It was a very tenuous situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShouldn\u2019t we at least agree to discuss the terms given by Iello? \u00a0The civilians are very nervous right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way. \u00a0He suddenly appeared without warning, and he is trying to coerce us into accepting a deal. \u00a0We shouldn\u2019t listen to his words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several members of the legislative body raised their voice to give their opinions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Black Undying Crow Ibrit made its appearance on earth, Seoul was swept up by a widespread Dungeon Break. \u00a0However, Kahng-woojin had appeared out of nowhere to succeed in defending Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, after Kahng-woojin left, Iello had appeared immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello was a unique Dimensional lord in that he used the ex-Hwarang guild master Lee-sahngho as a go between. \u00a0It was possible to communicate with Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The National Assembly squabbled in regards to the proposed alliance\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Both sides refused to compromise on the issue when the monsters suddenly appearing again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon Rajakui, who had invaded Seoul before, appeared once again...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Dimensional lords were setting up Colonies all over Seoul\u2026 If those Synchronized\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe lost Seoul overnight. \u00a0We have to make a decision.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey offered the alliance first, and we fell for their trick. While we were discussing the issue, they took advantage of our indecisiveness. \u00a0They already made their camps.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some suspected that the request for an alliance was a ruse. \u00a0It bought them time to start building their Colonies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince events have turned out like this, we should ally with Iello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Events were already stacked against them, so some members were pushing for an alliance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can we trust his offer? He isn't human. \u00a0He is just a chunk of ice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJapan has already allied themselves with him! \u00a0If we decide to fight Iello, we become enemies with Japan.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIello was probably afraid of attacking Japan, so he is trying to take over Seoul. \u00a0How can we let this be?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of the legislative body were shouting at the top of their lungs as they fought. \u00a0The president\u2019s worries deepened when he saw this. \u00a0Iello had appeared suddenly out of nowhere to propose an alliance, and now he was basically occupying the main room of the house by residing within Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello had basically invaded Korea, yet they had to ally with him\u2026 \u00a0Now he was expanding his forces, so his actions weren\u2019t trustworthy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When one of the senators caught sight of the silent president, he spoke barbed words towards the president.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the very least, give us some measures we can take.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe status of our alliance doesn\u2019t matter, since Seoul has already fallen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The president immediately shot back with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs this your official stance? \u00a0Are you declaring the Dimensional lord Iello as an enemy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease lower your voice. \u00a0I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The president increased his voice as he spoke about the current situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, it didn\u2019t matter if this was an attempt at an alliance or an invasion. \u00a0The other side held all the cards. \u00a0In such an uncertain situation, Iello\u2019s talk of an alliance were sweet nothings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are already allied with Alandal. \u00a0What will you all do if there is bad blood between Alandal and Iello?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the president\u2019s question, a senator, who had been antagonistic from the start, yelled out as if it was a no brainer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe king of Alandal does whatever the hell he wants. \u00a0Wouldn\u2019t it be better to trust Iello? \u00a0At the very least, he isn\u2019t out of control.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">President Kim-byungmahn let out a bitter laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we hold no bargaining chips that can be used in negotiations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It brought him to tears, but it was the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlandal\u2019s flying fortress is approaching.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flying fortress had turned its nose at Taiwan, and it had headed northward. \u00a0The Korean government sent an inquiry, but Alandal hadn\u2019t given their official reply yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was only a guess, but everyone assumed the flying fortress was returning to start up a big fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a war between Alandal and Iello...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be a war fought on Korean soil, yet their thoughts were elsewhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Korean government didn\u2019t have the power to stop the fight. \u00a0They weren\u2019t even united enough to choose sides, so there weren\u2019t a lot they could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to focus on evacuating civilians from Seoul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The president\u2019s words set off the members of the legislative body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you saying we should abandon Seoul?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShould you be saying this as the president?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-byungmahn stood up as he looked at them. \u00a0A vein was popping out on his neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere are we at right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had left their old National Assembly building. \u00a0The only ones that were left behind in Seoul were the people, who didn\u2019t have the resources to leave. \u00a0The elites and the leaders of the country had already pull out all their families from Seoul. \u00a0They were long gone from Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not saying we should abandon Seoul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tears he had been holding back fell from Kim-byungmahn\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m saying let\u2019s save our citizens.\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

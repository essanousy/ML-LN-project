(1)</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of the ground shaking tickled one\u2019s ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The vibration was transferred from the ground to one\u2019s feet. \u00a0One\u2019s entire body shook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-koohng, koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The sound of clashes was heard from all direction, so one didn\u2019t even need to look around to find the source of the sounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Enemies were everywhere, and it was a mishmash of all races.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Orcs, Ogres, Elves, and even humans\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The creatures of his Dimensions answered the call of Ibrit. \u00a0All of them charged forward to fight Kahng-woojin and his Undead Army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the monsters, who had crawled out of the Dungeons of Seoul, stopped destroying the city. \u00a0They headed towards the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-koohng, koohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The roads that should be filled with vehicles were now clogged by the marching monsters. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused and soldiers on standby looked on with confusion. \u00a0From their perspective, it as if the monsters were retreating. \u00a0However, if one looked at it in a macro view, the monsters were gathering at a single point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters were all rushing towards the islet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Enemies were everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their eyes were red with resentment. \u00a0They were sending out an almost instinctual killing intent towards Woojin, and it was laughable to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems all the trashes from the other Dimensions are gathering here..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dimensional Refugees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These were beings, who had lost their Codes. \u00a0They were unfortunate individuals, who had lost their home planets. \u00a0They were puppets that could be summoned if one had Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These beings bared their teeth towards toward him, and Woojin\u2019s personality wasn\u2019t benevolent enough to try to passively explain the situation with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He resided closest to death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the king of that defied death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll clean this place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With death\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The souls materialized around Woojin, and they were formed into a large soul barrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeeeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cape on his armor fluttered as if it was about to be ripped away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u3008Thrash\u2019s Guardian\u3009</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he repaired the damaged chest armor, all the restriction was lifted. \u00a0He could now use and store an unlimited amount of souls. \u00a0It also increased his power by three folds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin also switched his shoes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u3008Thrash\u2019s March\u3009</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He left behind the energy of death at every step he took. \u00a0It acted as a multiplier of Undead\u2019s battle capability. \u00a0Moreover, his footsteps corrupted the ground with poison. \u00a0It lured all living being towards death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then there was the belt decorated with skulls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u3008Thrash\u2019s Dignity\u3009</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of the Thrash\u2019s Dignity, the number of subordinate he could control increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Just this single Item doubled his Control ability. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing lacking right now was two remaining set Items. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have enough ingredient Items to make Honor and Punishment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The flying fortress needed Points for its defense, so he couldn\u2019t be careless with his use of his Points. \u00a0He had already depleted his Achievement Points by buying from his personal store. \u00a0He was only able to complete three Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have to gather all five Items to bring out the full set effect. \u00a0His Undead army would become much stronger numerically and quality wise once he had them all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall we go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When barrier was taken down, the sound of pitched battle between the Undeads and the monsters rang in his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-oohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin started walking, souls gathered at his feet to assist his steps.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he wasn\u2019t riding Shing Shing, Thrash\u2019s March allowed him to use Phantom Gallop. \u00a0It was childsplay to be in the air now. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could walk to anywhere he wanted to.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped into the empty air, and he started running towards the Orc Warriors, who were crossing the Hahn River by jumping on a congregation of Alligators.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow should I use this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin held up his Warrior\u2019s Weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His weapon was long, and it wrapped around an Orc\u2019s head. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a whip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he reached level 90, his weapon could now transform into a whip. \u00a0It could move in unexpected ways, and it possessed a sharp cutting force. \u00a0It could slice through anything. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-ah-ahk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before the Orc could stop its scream, its corpse exploded, and a Skeleton appeared..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-kee-keek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Control Ability had doubled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enemies kept dying one by one, and the Undead army kept getting larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKill the Necromancer!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKill that bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Humans, elves\u2026. \u00a0Even Dwarven Warriors were starting to cross the Hahn River. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were so many of them. \u00a0If one didn\u2019t know this was Seoul, one would think it was the territory of the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht, paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Light pillars were shooting consecutively into the skies of Seoul, and one could tell a lot of Dungeon were being reset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Dungeons could forgo the Synchronization, the monsters kept crawling out of the Dungeons. \u00a0The guilds and the army didn\u2019t have the time to stem the flow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even the residents of Seoul didn\u2019t have the time to evacuate. \u00a0People were becoming stranded in the streets, and they were being killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a great lord of the 70th Throne.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit\u2019s authority made every monster gather at the islet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ironically, this gave time for the civilians to run away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some ran towards the opposite direction as the monsters. \u00a0Some gave up running away, and they decided to wait for a rescue. \u00a0A very small number of people watched and filmed the battle occurring on the islet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh! \u00a0It is too bad Kiba cannot join us.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Death Knight Ramson swung his hammer with regret. \u00a0Even for the Death Knights, who were quite used to battles, it was rare to face a continuous stream of enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They killed and killed, yet there was no end to the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The air of the battlefield was oppressive and dense from the fear and madness emanating from the living. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How great is this?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights willingly became drunk on this atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roo, gwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hell Hydras appeared from various locations, and they spat out fire from their mouths.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lich Jaenis used his enormous staff to shoot consecutive magical spells. \u00a0The magical energy around him was so thick that Jaenis\u2019 face looked red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Come to me! \u00a0I will save you all!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If living caused pain, he\u2019ll save all of them by killing them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Lich\u2019s magic was endless.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-che-che-cheng, tee-teeng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time the Iron Golem moved the nearby trees fell and the corpses piled up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters that seemed to have stepped out from literary fame died. \u00a0The swords, shields and anything made out of metal were pulled towards the body of the Golem. \u00a0\u00a0The Golem was like a magnet, and its body kept growing in size.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses kept piling up, and now it was filling the Hahn river. \u00a0Blood was flowing out of these corpses, and it was like a river made out of blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous being was raging around as it raised violent sprays of water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Dragon kept asking a question that no one answered. \u00a0It kept chewing up its preys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Gwah-gwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The red water sprayed into the air, and the rolling of the water doused the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before one knew it, there were mostly Undead and corpses left around Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undying Crow, who had shot high into the air, was diving towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Dragon leaped into the air to ram into Ibrit. \u00a0Ibrit became lodged in the Thorn Tree. \u00a0It shot out its sharp feathers indiscriminately, and it decimated the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The whip flew in like a snake, and it encircled the Crow\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI caught you\u2026. Uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was speaking with a smirk on his face. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, when Ibrit jumped, Woojin and his whip was dragged along by its enormous strength.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. \u00a0Jeez..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The whip was sharp, yet it couldn\u2019t even pierce through Ibrit\u2019s skin. \u00a0It couldn\u2019t even harm the feather on its body. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin hung onto his whip, and Ibrit kept increasing its speed as it ascended into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could do nothing by being dragged around everywhere, so Woojin unsummoned his Warrior\u2019s Weapon. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He landed atop a branch of the Thorn Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I guess I\u2019ll watch you perform more cute tricks.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit spoke after climbing high into the sky, and Woojin tried to hold back his bitter laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard was waiting for him to tire out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Dungeons nearby were resetting, so Woojin surmised Ibrit had some kind of a scheme.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seventieth Throne.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had the Codes to 70 planets, so how much Points did it have saved up?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How large of an army could it field if it used all its Points?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you are saying you can\u2019t take me on yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was waiting for Woojin to tire out, so basically, it was admitting to a weakness. \u00a0Ibrit\u2019s combat ability was below his.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked \u00a0down from the Thorn Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undead Army was surrounded by dead bodies, and the still living enemies were being slaughtered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses were clogging the Hahn river, and now it was acting as a bridge. \u00a0The monsters, who were still arriving at the Hahn river, used the corpse bridge to cross.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnsummon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons, Death Knights, Lich and the Bone Dragon disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was the only one left on the islet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Necromancer has run out of magic!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKill that bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters\u2026. \u00a0To be precise, the Dimensional refugees ran towards Woojin as if it was a race to reach him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they arrived at the islet, some tried to climbed the tree. \u00a0The impatient ones threw their spears, or they shot their arrows. \u00a0In a flash, tens of thousands of enemy troops gathered on the island.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you guys really think I\u2019m short on magical energy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s two hands were pointed downwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were corpses and screaming souls everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How could he be low on magical energy?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCorpse Explosion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-ahhhhhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the corpses exploded. \u00a0The explosion swallowed everything nearby. \u00a0The explosion caused more corpses to form. \u00a0The number of corpses was much higher than before. \u00a0Blood and chunks of flesh flew everywhere, and the surrounding looked like a scene from hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The aftermath of the explosion destroyed the island.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Thorn Tree shook fiercely. \u00a0It seemed as it would fall over, but the roots suddenly hardened as it pierced into the surface.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Half of the Hahn river\u2019s water evaporated, and the red water rushed in to fill the void.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Woojin\u2019s eyes could see tens of thousand of souls\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All of them were sucked into the Thrash\u2019s Protection. \u00a0He absorbed several hundred souls, and his almost depleted magical energy was filled to the brim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, if he wanted to use Skeleton Summon again, he had more than enough sacrifices. \u00a0His surrounding was filled with blood, bones and corpses\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSummon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He summoned his Undead army again, and they met the charge of the roaring monsters, who were coming towards him again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked up to see the Undying Crow, then he looked towards his Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Yong Yong. \u00a0It is our turn to counterattack.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is your wish?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon, who suffered from dementia, was usually chatty. \u00a0However, it was silent now. The corner of Woojin\u2019s mouth started turn up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was his baddest and strongest Familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a short silence, Yong Yong spoke a desire he always had for the past couple thousand years.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Give me wings.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A flightless dragon wasn\u2019t a true dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019d love to give it to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smiled as he looked at the Iron Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-uh-uh.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koong, koo-koohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The chunks of steel, which made up its armor, started to fall off. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, only the wisp-like heart of the Golem was left. \u00a0It started to suck up the nearby blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like a fog made out of blood\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blood swirled like a whirlwind, yet it unexpectedly gathered around the Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Golem\u2019s Heart had settled within the enormous ribcage of the Bone Dragon, and it sucked in all the blood nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon roared, and it stretched itself out. \u00a0Blood started to stick to the bones. \u00a0The blood coagulated, and it started resolving itself into flesh. \u00a0\u00a0The bones of the wings, which looked like spears, started to grow a membrane.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood started covering the reddened bones and the bridge of its nose.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It absorbed an endless amount of blood\u2026. \u00a0Blood....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tens of thousand were sacrificed to combine the power of his two baddest Familiars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blood Dragon let out a roar, and the Fear made the monster army flinch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[My wish has been granted. \u00a0What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The imposing Ancient Dragon had revived. \u00a0Woojin laughed in a playful manner as he pointed towards the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo bring me that Crow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It\u2019ll be my pleasure]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It left a big mark as it pushed off, and the Blood Dragon climbed into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wooijn\u2019s magical energy had once again bottomed out, so he used the souls to replenish it. \u00a0Woojin once again used his Control ability to its utmost on the corpses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if consecutive explosions were occurring. \u00a0The Skeletons were ripping themselves out of the corpses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crow had been waiting for a Necromancer to become exhausted?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Undead army had doubled in size, and they waited for the Immortal\u2019s command.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSweep them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s order, the Death Knights roared, and the Skeletons followed them into battle. \u00a0They charged in all directions.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

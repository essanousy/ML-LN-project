He soloed most runs, and even when he teamed up, he only worked with his guild members.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since Baek-jungdoh wasn't showing any signs of joining the hunt, it seemed he was treated as an outsider too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdoh smirked at Blanka's misunderstanding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is no need to go. \u00a0We aren't going to be of much help, so so why should we go with them?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Baek-jungdoh participated, would he be able to decrease the Dungeon Clear time by 10 seconds? \u00a0It almost didn't matter if he expended his power or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka was still confused. \u00a0Baek-jungdoh sighed as he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin closed the five Dungeons in Japan and China, all the Roused, who tagged along with them, had reacted in the same way as Blanka. \u00a0They all ran forward to crack Kahng-woojin's secret, but in the end, they all gained nothing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, they did earn one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He cleared out the monsters very fast and easily.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdoh sat on the floor. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust be sure to record everything later.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka had entered into the Dungeon with the party, since he wanted to see Kahng-woojin's method of clearing the Dungeon. \u00a0This was why he was filled with more questions. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether he participated in the battle or not, Blanka had a mission. \u00a0So why did Baek-jungdoh enter with them?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Stop looking at me with pity. \u00a0I'm just here to play. \u00a0\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon't you know what a picnic is?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, he knew what picnic is. \u00a0He just wondered why they had to have a picnic in a Dungeon yet to be cleared. \u00a0This wasn't like following mother to the market. \u00a0Why would he come to such a dangerous...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a red portal formed near where Baek-jungdoh was sitting. \u00a0The meaning behind this event was self-evident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the monsters within the subway station had been cleared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only four minutes had passed. \u00a0Baek-jungdoh smirked as he looked at Blanka's unappealing expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can everyone all have the same reaction like this?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reaction was the same whether the person was Japanese, Chinese or Indian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdoh stood up, and he dusted off his behind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet's go. \u00a0Let's see what shows up this time.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a brief moment, Kahng-woojin and Hong-sunggoo appeared. \u00a0They all passed through the red portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeng. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The tinnitus sound that tickled the ears faded. \u00a0The sight that appeared in front of them was the view of a beach with calm waters. \u00a0The first one to react was Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow! Isn't this place awesome, hyung-nim?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The beach had white sands and clear waves. \u00a0It was on par with any vacation destination on earth. \u00a0The beach hadn't been touched by a crowded population, so there was an untainted beauty to it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo ran across the sands, and when a Crab monster burst forward, he let out a yell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim! There are crabs here. \u00a0How about having some steamed crabs?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka was taken aback by Sunggoo's bright laughter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a small monster that was 50 centimetre long, but it was still too large to call it a normal crab. \u00a0Moreover, their frightening claws could easily crush human bones.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt's dangerous!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a monster one could easily deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-rook! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The crab was squeezing out of the sands when Sunggoo ignited it with his flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0It's well done.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The crab died instantly from the high heat. \u00a0Its shell turned red as if it was well-cooked. \u00a0Sunggoo took out his short sword. \u00a0If he thought about all the monsters he had to dismantle before, it would give him a headache. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was confident he could remove the meat from the crab.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese bastards travel in a group! Let us get out of here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if to validate Blanka's worries, the nearby sandy beach started to shift as monster crabs started to crawl out. \u00a0There were so many of them that it was impossible to count them. \u00a0There were over 100 of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one got caught by their claws, one would be in danger of losing a limb. \u00a0The number of crabs that showed up was on par with the Rakwis. \u00a0The Vishnu guild had attempted this Dungeon once, and they never attempted it again. \u00a0This was the reason why.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monsters with enough offensive capability to cause fatal harm appeared in large quantity. \u00a0It was impossible for a 10 member party to deal with all the monsters that attacked at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw the crabs that had been hiding in the sandy beach, Sungoo was taken aback... No, he yelled out with a joyous expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow! This is a great harvest, hyung-nim!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTry cooking them well. Let's start hunting after we fill our stomach.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's mouth watered when he saw the crabs. \u00a0They were on a tight schedule, but four hours passed inside a Dungeon when one hour passed in reality. \u00a0They had some time to spare inside the Dungeon. \u00a0Woojin immediately took out a table and chairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He sat in a chair, then he bought refreshing beers from the Achievement Store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKyahhh. \u00a0I really like doing this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bake-jungdoh received a head-sized wooden mug with beer filled within it. \u00a0His face was filled with anticipation. \u00a0One could tell he wasn't new to this kind of experience by the expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026how can you\u2026 This is a 6 star Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0You speak Korean very well, foreign dude. \u00a0Just sit here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka sat in her seat in a moment of bewilderment. \u00a0Soon, he saw the flames wash across the beach.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Fire Wall is quite useful.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. \u00a0Thank you, hyung-nim.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo scratched the back of his head at Woojin's praise. \u00a0Sunggoo picked out the well-cooked crabs, and he started cracking open the crabs. Sunggoo moved his hands in a skillful manner, while everyone else was drink their beer. \u00a0Blanka couldn't get used to the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis place is a Dungeon.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can you guys not feel any sense of danger?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat reason do we have for being afraid?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat's\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The inside of a Dungeon was dangerous, so one shouldn't let go of the tension. Wasn't this common sense? Still, the current situation couldn't be called dangerous....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeeyah. \u00a0Doesn't this taste better than Steamed Snow Crabs?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdoh was a third generation heir, so he had always eaten the best. However, he had gotten a taste of the unknown alcohol Woojin brought out, and he had eaten the monster dishes in the Dungeons. \u00a0He enjoyed it immensely.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's had vast knowledge about the monsters, and his cooking skills were pretty good. \u00a0Moreover, he tasted alcohol that was on par with anything on earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, my foreign friend. \u00a0Don't frown so much. \u00a0Enjoy yourself.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wanted him to enjoy the Dungeon.... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this really suppose to be an adventure to save one's family and nation? \u00a0Wasn't this suppose to be a fight to the death?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe need another plan. \u00a0The crabs have been taken care of, but the flame magic won't work inside the water.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as Blanka said.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dread was building an underwater palace. \u00a0They would have to deal with the special environment. \u00a0The fact that the place was underwater was an effective barrier in keeping out the intruders. \u00a0This was one of the reasons why the Indian Roused team was unable to clear this Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeveral hundred... No, several thousand jelly fishes will swarm us. \u00a0It\u2019ll be difficult to fight through them to reach the Return Stone. \u00a0Those bastards' Paralysis Poison is so strong that most Antidote doesn't work against it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka was the only one speaking in a serious manner. \u00a0After hearing his words, Woojin stood up from his seat. \u00a0He was pretty full from just eating a single crab leg. \u00a0There had been a lot of crab meat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou just sit back and enjoy the drink. \u00a0Several hundred to a thousand... \u00a0That should be the right amount.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When will he be able to do a group hunt of this size again?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow great would it be if all monsters just stayed calmly inside the water?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Water was a great barrier in protecting oneself from the land-bound organisms. \u00a0However, it had \u00a0a critical weakness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin used the hundred crab corpses as medium to summon the Skeleton Magicians. \u00a0Then he unsummoned all the Skeleton Magicians that couldn't use Poison or Thunder magic. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, 20 Skeleton Mages gathered around Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall we start fishing?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put his feet into the water. \u00a0After taking several steps, the water reached Woojin's waist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When an intruder appeared, the several dozen types of monsters inside the water converged towards Woojin. At the appropriate moment, Woojin used his Poison Nova.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pwahhhhhk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The poison mixed with the water, and it polluted the environs of the sea. \u00a0Woojin poured out more of his magic, and the poison became more concentrated as it kept spreading farther into the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-roo-roo-rooh. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Poisoned swarms of jellyfishes floated to the surface. \u00a0Woojin came back onto the beach. \u00a0It didn't matter if the monsters had bones or not. \u00a0Each corpse was used as medium for his summoning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin used the floating corpses of various fishes, crabs and jelly fishes to summon more Skeleton Magicians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-pahk! </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gathered the Skeleton Magicians, who could use Thunder or Poison Magic. \u00a0There were 500 of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck them up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-kee-keek. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Mages shot their Thunder and Poison magic towards the sea. \u00a0Woojin returned to the table and he sat. \u00a0Baek-jungdoh had a broad grin on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLil bro Kahng can hunt with such ease. Huh huh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, this is only true when I'm hunting the weak ones.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was attacking or defending against large number of monsters, was there anyone, who could match up with Woojin? \u00a0If several thousand to hundred thousand monster appeared in a Dungeon, it would actually be an advantage for Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Skeleton Army could take care of all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the other hand, if a handful of strong monsters appeared in the Dungeon, the Skeleton Army would be useless against them. \u00a0However, Woojin still had his powerful Death Knights and his personal prowess wasn't bad either.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow we just have to wait for the octopus bastard to come out. \u00a0Let's have a drink in the meantime.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha ha. That sounds good. What do you mean by octopus?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou'll see later.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Magicians indiscriminately fired into the sea. \u00a0When some fishes floated up to the surface, they were disappointed that they wouldn't be able to eat any sashimi. \u00a0However, the fishes had been poisoned, so they couldn't eat it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They ate the succulent crab meats, and they waited for the Dungeon Owner to appear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did 30 minute elapse?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several thousand monster corpses washed up onto the beautiful beach. \u00a0When the sight of the beach turned bizarre, the Boss Monster appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The octopus parted the waters as it appeared, and the Skeleton Magicians focused their magic on it. \u00a0However, a barrier was easily formed, and the magic couldn't cause any damage to the Boss Monster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The eight tentacles walked on top of the water, and when it landed on the beach, Dread spoke out in anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-rooh-roohk. \u00a0What the hell are you doing? \u00a0Shall I consider this as a declaration of war?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You are the one, who brought the fight to me. \u00a0Who told you to link to Earth?] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-roohk. That is laughable. \u00a0You are conceited in thinking that the entirety of the Earth Dimension is yours. ] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No Dimensional Lord actually claimed an entire planet as one's Domain. \u00a0However, this human in front of him named Kahng-woojin had the audacity to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koohk. \u00a0You are fearless in requesting a Clear of my Domain. You will pay for your own stupidity.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dread would have understood it if this was a Dimensional Battle where Woojin could borrow the power of his Domain. \u00a0However, Kahng-woojin had arrogantly entered his Dungeon to clear it with a small party. \u00a0By his own volition, \u00a0he was challenging Dread after turning his status from 'Lord' to 'Adventurer'.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dread could use all the power given to him by his Domain, but his opponent could only use his own personal skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the bastard was in Death's Limbo, he'll steal the bastard's unprotected Dimensional Domain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-roo-roo. \u00a0I'll show you the power of Dread!] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The octupus' head turned red as it showed it off in a boastful manner. Then it started to gather in magic from its surrounding. \u00a0Woojin smirked when he saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You last words are really corny.] </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dread. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His eight tentacles were standing on top of a field of corpses. \u00a0What did that mean?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Will it be able to handle the power being emitted by the several thousand corpses?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had filled himself with magic as he waited for Dread to show up, and he released all of his magic at once.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCorpse Explosion.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the magic drained out of Woojin's body.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

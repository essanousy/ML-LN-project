\u00a0He came here on his own?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had ordered Captain Leone to log out Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I came here to check on your soul.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes laughed as he looked at Dr. Toppler. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A leery suspicion Woojin had was resolved. \u00a0It had been weighing down a part of his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"W...where are you going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I have things to do.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin turned to leave, Dr. Toppler pointed at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Why aren\u2019t you detaining him?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the nearby soldiers didn\u2019t move an inch even at his insistence. \u00a0This was also true for Captain Leone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Captain Leone! \u00a0What are you doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Please give it up, professor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"......?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin possessed the Recovery Code.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t matter if they hadn\u2019t been able to acquire the Earth\u2019s Code. \u00a0They had to find a way to turn back the time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Eeek! \u00a0If we just let him leave right now....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, the Recovery Code was needed to carry out some form of a Reset. \u00a0Dr. Toppler got off the bed, and he ran towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Stop!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was standing on the stairway leading out of the spaceship. \u00a0Woojin turned, and their eyes met\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Uh uh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler groaned when he felt the sensation of being airborne. \u00a0It wasn't just a feeling. \u00a0His body was really floating in the air. \u00a0It was as if he had been levitated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Don\u2019t follow me. \u00a0I confirmed what I needed from you..\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"H...how the hell....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler couldn't believe what was going on. \u00a0He looked as if he had seen a ghost. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What had Woojin done? \u00a0What allowed him to use such supernatural powers?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was like the Roused from the VR Earth\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You should return to your home, people of the moon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin descended the stairs, the power suspending Toppler in the air disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What the hell is........\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Leone helped the confused Toppler to his feet. \u00a0He had felt the same emotions as the professor only a few minutes ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Maybe, he is no longer a human. \u00a0Please give up, professor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What nonsense are you....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Isn\u2019t this the parameters of this project?

\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This might be an unpredicted variable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was something that couldn\u2019t be proved with science. \u00a0His supernatural power was beyond the ken of mortal men.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What could possibly be the explanation behind this development?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"This...at this rate.......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler ran towards the stairs in a mesmerized state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Professor! Your respirator!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unclear as to whether he heard the soldier\u2019s warning, but Toppler continued to run down the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hoo-oop.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The air was thick and pungent with particles. \u00a0It felt as if he had sand in his mouth. \u00a0He didn\u2019t have to travel long before he saw Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Please wait for me! \u00a0Cough.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Toppler coughed as he ran. \u00a0He approached Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin replied as if he was a bit annoyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Where are you going?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What will you do if I tell you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Please just tell me what you are going to do.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> What was he going to do\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kahng-woojin looked upwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The stars filled the sky as they let out a bright light. \u00a0Unlike this beautiful sight, the ground was black.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The land was desolate, and one couldn\u2019t even see a single blade of grass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019ll be going back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He already knew how to sever the link.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The knowledge was inside his head when he woke up. \u00a0It was as if he he had learned it from a Skill Book.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The VR Earth was about to collapse right before I was awakened. \u00a0Even if you go back, the people of Alandal\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Professor Toppler spoke carefully as he studied the other man.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Did you see it for sure?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Did you see them die?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I didn\u2019t see their final moments, but they were found inadequate in dealing with the absolute being\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler swallowed his words. \u00a0Woojin\u2019s deep eyes was looking at him, and he couldn\u2019t be rash with his words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You can\u2019t see the future, so how do you know that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"My guys won\u2019t go down that easily.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Even if they are still holding out, how are you going to log back in?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was in the same boat as Kim-kahngchul. \u00a0They could no longer log back in. \u00a0It was the same for Toppler, who hadn\u2019t been able to log out through an arranged exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Previously, they had each foot planted in both worlds, but now their foothold in the VR was gone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If I can\u2019t go there....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"...I\u2019ll bring them here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The barrier of Bibi\u2019s Castle was damaged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The buildings on the aircraft carrier shook violently. \u00a0The people, who were evacuated inside, was trembling from fear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Is there\u2026. \u00a0Can we....do nothing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan spoke in a despairing voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were using every ounce of their power to fight back, but the Black Armor\u2019s power was beyond imagination.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was exhausted\u2026. \u00a0This was also true for the Undead Army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [We are low on energy.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the crux of the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahn-woojin wasn\u2019t here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The being, who replenished their ranks through raising the enemy\u2019s corpses, was gone. \u00a0Their magical energy was no longer being replenished through the consumption of the enemy\u2019s souls.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Necromancer was absent, the Undead army had been reduced steadily. \u00a0Only the Familiars were left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Lich had never had to worry about the use of its magic when it was with its Necromancer. \u00a0However, it was ownerless right now, and it had to judicious with its use of magic. \u00a0This was why it could only act as a diversion from the back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights were tireless, but now they had to worry about defense. \u00a0They couldn\u2019t commit to an all out attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Bone Dragon and the Golem was also short of magical energy. \u00a0They had to wait a while, before they were able to regenerate their broken bodies.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Goo-ha-ha-ha.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Either the Black Armor didn\u2019t know how to speak, or it didn\u2019t want to speak. \u00a0It kept letting out its weird laughter as black energy shot out from its fists. \u00a0Each strike created incredible damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kwahhhhhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a big hole made through the hull of Bibi\u2019s Castle. \u00a0The unlucky employees fell from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Kyahhhhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> A phoenix flew towards the falling people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Rings of fire wrapped around the people, and the phoenix landed atop the deck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"T...thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t have time to acknowledge their gratitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal had been able to hold out for a week against the Black Armor\u2019s attacks. \u00a0Hong-sunggoo and Che-haesol deserved the most credit for their survival.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo didn\u2019t have a single wound on his body, but this was thanks to his body\u2019s peculiar attributes. \u00a0He was very exhausted inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was making an unreasonable demand of his body by pushing well beyond his limits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ha-ah. \u00a0Is there any way we could resolve this problem?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Goo-ha-ha-ha!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Kwah-ahng, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A water dragon flew into the air as it became entangled with the Black Armor. \u00a0They exchanged attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Goo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The water dragon let out a long cry. \u00a0It could no longer withstand the power of the enemy\u2019s fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That was the last water dragon.......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol mumbled to herself. \u00a0It was as if she was in a state of despair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The water dragons had been the strongest beings left alive on Alphen. \u00a0They were all dead now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Goo-roo-roohk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s eyes took in the sight of the broken Blood Dragon resting on the deck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Colony\u2019s energy had bottomed out, so there weren\u2019t enough magical energy to regenerate the Bone Dragon\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One wing had been ripped away\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blood Golem looked like clotted blood around the Bone Dragon, and chunks of it was missing. \u00a0The wounded Blood Dragon roared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [This Dragon will not die!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Ancient Dragon had lived for over a 1,000 years, \u00a0and it had an earnest wish right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of its race was dead\u2026 \u00a0\u00a0They had defected...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had tried its best to forget the humiliating history of its race\u2026 \u00a0Since it couldn\u2019t rewrite the history, it will disappear with it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yong Yong, who had been crouching, stood up. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The head, which was attached to a long neck, headed towards Hong-sunggooo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shining red eyes of the Bone Dragon gazed at Hong-sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thick scent of someone from its own race emanated from him\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"My wish....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo looked at the Black Armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It would be great if you would kill that bastard.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [I will grant you your wish!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was time to bring about its most earnest wish.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It didn\u2019t want to live again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It just wanted to fly again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It also wanted to feel that sensation once again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Give me my last Breath!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it could fly and breathe in air, how could it be a dead Dragon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had forgotten even its own name, but it wasn\u2019t dead yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That is a great idea.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo grinned as he ignited his body into a ball of flame. \u00a0The flame was like smoke. \u00a0It was sucked in towards Yong Yong\u2019s nostrils.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Koo-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis extended its hands towards the roaring Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [I will give you all my power!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Colony\u2019s energy had run out, so the Lich poured out all its magical energy from its own Life Vessel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwe-roo-roo-roohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The various destroyed parts of Yong Yong was quickly regenerating.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Only victory will let us sidestep death!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights ran forward, and they all extended their hands to transfer their magical energy into the Bone Dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They wouldn\u2019t retreat, because the enemy was powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Victory or death.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were already dead, so a second death didn\u2019t exist for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Koo-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if it couldn\u2019t control its overflowing power, the Blood Dragon leap caused Bibi\u2019s Castle to rock back and forth..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Goo-hoo-hoo.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had already killed 17 water dragons. \u00a0The Black Armor laughed when it saw its next opponent. The Blood Dragon was a tenacious bastard. \u00a0It kept returning to the flying ship for repairs after taking a little bit of damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Goo-roong, goo-roong.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Blood Dragon was in a slightly different state.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> It didn\u2019t throw itself forward in a ruthless attack. \u00a0It slowly flapped its wings as it glared at the Black Armor. \u00a0Its stomach expanded before it became smaller. \u00a0The Blood Dragon was breathing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was supposed to be a dead Dragon with only its bones remaining.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a fake wearing a skin made out of blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the red eyes of the Blood Dragon was filled with confidence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [.......]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Black Armor realized that it had to take this seriously. \u00a0It focused on the Blood Dragon\u2019s stomach. \u00a0It was moving periodically\u2026 \u00a0\u00a0Slowly.......</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like a bellow increasing the temperature within the furnace\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [I\u2019m alive.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had lost its flesh, and its heart had been cut out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had forgotten its name, and past.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was still alive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Koo-oh-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragon opened its jaw as if it was about to spit out the sun.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ah-ah-ah!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An incredible heat and shock wave blew violently forward as it swept over the Black Armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Koo-oohk.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A black energy was sent out as a counter, and it collided with the red energy. \u00a0It was as if the black energy and the red energy was in a tug of war. \u00a0The black and red energy tossed and turned as they tried to swallow each other. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated. \u00a0The enormous shockwave and explosion raged outwards as the surrounding was encased with light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Koo-ooh-ook!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shockwave pushed against Bibi\u2019s Castle, and it plunged towards the ground. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the present rate, everyone on the fortress would be killed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aht!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Bibi felt the energy of the Colony be refilled, she immediately activated the barrier. \u00a0\u00a0Even now Jaemin was tirelessly conducting the Dimensional Battle from the Dimensional Domain. \u00a0She thanked Do-jaemin from inside her heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The barrier was activated, but Bibi\u2019s Castle couldn\u2019t overcome the momentum. \u00a0It crashed into the ground. \u00a0An incredible cloud of dust rose into the air. \u00a0Then the backblast of the Dragon\u2019s Breath washed over them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Countless number of people had been thrown to the floor by the impact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Did we win?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights and Bibi looked towards the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dust hadn\u2019t settled yet, but they could see something descending towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a black figure.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Goo-hue-hue-hue.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Black Armor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, the bastard was really a transcendent

Code, which resided within Bibi\u2019s Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [This was fun.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the Black Armor knew that there was no opponent that could resist against it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It spoke for the first time, and it made Bibi want to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It descended slowly as if it was an angel descending towards the ground. \u00a0Everyone had an expression of despair on their faces as they watched it descend.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, their expression of despair was soon replaced with happiness and delight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler got on his knees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Please think this over.

was a weapon that could cut and kill everything. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Thrash\u2019s Executioner.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This enormous power and authority could influence

\".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For a brief moment, a bitter expression passed by his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the Bibi\u2019s Castle, which had landed

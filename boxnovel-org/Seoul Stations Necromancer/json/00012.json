Thank you~)</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, bro. You look to be alone, so why don\u2019t you join our party? We\u2019ve gather exactly 7 people here, so there is one spot left.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it\u2019s ok. I\u2019ll enter alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man was taken aback by Woojin\u2019s refusal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would you want to waste your entrance fee by entering by yourself? Since there is a time limit, there is a limit on how many Bloodstones you can mine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man laughed when he saw Woojin\u2019s confused expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t been a Miner for long.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused were called by a slang. The people, who specialized in challenging the unconquered Dungeons, were called Rangers. Those, who mined the Bloodstones, in the safe and conquered Dungeons were called Miners. The Roused, who were mobilized to fight the monsters with the military during the Dungeon Break, were called Guardians.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were called these names based on their occupation. However, a Ranger could become a Miner, and a Miner could become a Guardian.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As if the man thought Woojin was a noob, he started going over the rules for a Miner in broad terms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a cap on how many people could enter the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Rangers decide to attack a Dungeon, they make their teams based on the headcount. These people were called the Attack Squads. The 3 great Guilds of Korea were famous for having competent Attack Squads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the same for the Miners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Miners could only be admitted up to the maximum number. The Attack Squads sent in the maximum number of people to send in the best fighting powe, and the Miners did it to increase their efficiency.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entrance fee was also calculated based on the maximum number of people able to enter the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The maximum number of people able to enter the Shinrim Station\u2019s 7th Exit was 8 people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, if I want to use it alone then I\u2019ll have to pay the fee of 8 people? 800,000 won?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Moreover, it is an hourly fee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though only the basic monsters were summoned in the Dungeon, it was still dangerous. The information about the Dungeon had already been released to the public, so the danger to a Miner\u2019s life was lessened. However, they were still putting their life on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Return Stones could only be found in the deepest part of most Dungeons. It was impossible for one person to clear it in one hour. If one went over the time limit, the entrance fee doubled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I want to use the Dungeon for 2 hours alone, then I need an entrance fee of 1,600,000 won.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he took out all the Monsters, then he\u2019ll probably make decent money. However, a Roused with that much ability, wouldn\u2019t even enter a mere 2 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is your rank?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s rank F.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk tsk. You came here without knowing anything, but you are in luck. Join our party as a learning experience. We\u2019ll guarantee your safety.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was able to take care of his own safety, but he joined the party without any fuss. It was purely based on the fact that he didn\u2019t have the entrance fee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll have to level up fast, so I can attack a Dungeon in peace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were too many constraints and fees. It seemed Woojin\u2019s temperament was incompatible with Mining. He was disappointed, but he decided to experience Mining for a day with these people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Groups of eight members were entering the Dungeon, so the waiting line grew shorter pretty fast. They were all Roused, but they all held low ranks. The people gathered here were quite diverse.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The difficulty level wasn\u2019t very high, so the parties in front of them were all able to clear the Dungeon in 40~50 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The man, who introduced himself as Bae-dohsoo, was a Rank E user. He was a professional professional miner, who traveled with 6 team mates to gain profits from the Mines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Usually, they only visited 1 star Mines, but they decided to attempt a 2 star mine this time around. Since this will be their first attempt, they wanted to fill the 8 slots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Eight people were better than six people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-woojin and a Roused named Hong-sunggoo had come to the Dungeon by themselves, so they joined Bae-dohsoo\u2019s team. Hong-sunggoo was a new Roused and he was Rank F like Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, everyone except me is Rank F. Therefore, my share will be 2, and everyone else will be 1. We\u2019ll gather all the Bloodstones, then we\u2019ll divide into 9 portion at the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t have much to say. He agreed to Bae-dohsoo\u2019s words. He was challenging a Mine just to have the experience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew, I\u2019m shaking. How about you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the start, Hong-sunggoo had a hard time getting along with Bae-dohsoo\u2019s group, so he tried to act friendly towards Woojin, while they waited in line. Woojin replied back in a sufficient manner, so they talked about various topics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo was a rank F noob, but he was very interested in the Dungeons. He possessed a vast array of knowledge. Woojin\u2019s conversation with him was quite beneficial.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo was 21 years old, and he had become a Roused only two months ago. He had quit going to school, and he had started his Roused activity in earnest. He had been going to 1 star Mines for the past two month, and he felt he had gotten used to the Mines. This was the first time he was attempting a 2 star mine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Money wasn\u2019t his ultimate goal. His goal was to strengthen and train his Roused abilities. His dream was to join a Ranger\u2019s team to attempt an unconquered Dungeon. He wanted to join the Attack Squad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if one is afraid, men aren\u2019t suppose to show it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Big brother is quite confident.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The queue time lasted several hours, so they talked a lot. Eventually, they decided to call each other big bro and little bro.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk ok. Let\u2019s start getting ready to enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The barrier around the Dungeon let out a green light, and it started to fade. Woojin tilted head in curiosity as he saw the team in front of him exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? It seems there was an accident.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the experienced Bae-dohsoo had predicted, the team in front of them had 4 casualties. The public employees and officials dispatched from the Dungeon Management Agency ran towards them to investigate the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were waiting right behind them, so Woojin was able to hear their words clearly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA Hobgoblin showed up! How is that possible?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dispatched public employee showed Entrance Log to the argumentative Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you read this? You even signed here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The basic monsters summoned inside the Dungeon may vary from information given.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The burden of responsibility regarding this is placed on the Roused.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 4 surviving Rosued, who had lost their team, was very animated, but they had no way of receiving a compensation. Being a Miner wasn\u2019t a safe job.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTsk tsk. It is useless to argue like that. They are just wasting their energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed they had left their party member\u2019s corpses behind, and they were only able to run away after securing the Return Stone. Since they weren\u2019t able to secure any Bloodstones, they had only incurred losses in this Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected of a veteran Miner, Bae-dohsoo had experienced a lot of these situations. Bae-dohsoo looked away from the argument, then he spoke to his teammates.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHobgoblins are 2 star monsters. If we are well prepared, there is no reason why we wouldn\u2019t be able to fight against it. No, those bastards most definitely drop Bloodstones, so it should be better for us. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">According to Bae-dohsoo\u2019s words, he had never hunted a Hobgoblin before, but he had the experience of clearing over 200 instances of 1 star Mine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The eight party members briefly signed their names in the Dungeon Entrance Log then they started heading down the subway station\u2019s stairway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk ok. Let\u2019s enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Bae-dohsoo\u2019s encouragement, they descended the stairs and they approached a tunnel. A white barrier started forming when they entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You have enter the Shinrim Station\u2019s 7th Exit.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This Dungeon has already been conquered. Basic monsters will be summoned.]</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

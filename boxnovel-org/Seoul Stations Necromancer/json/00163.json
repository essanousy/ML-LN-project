Bibi's Castle (2)\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">KH hotel. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only the people invited could enter the assembly hall, but the content of what they would be discussing wasn't a secret. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The main participant hosting this general assembly hadn't appeared yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The assembly hall was decorated like a dinner party, and everyone was having a conversation as they gathered into various groups. \u00a0No one was paying attention to the food that was being laid out in a buffet style.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone that had been invited were the best Roused that the world could offer. \u00a0Moreover, the main figures of the guilds were all here. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a gathering hosted by Kahng-woojin. \u00a0Some only needed this fact to move like migrating clouds to attend this meeting. \u00a0The medium-sized guilds weren't even able to get a seat in this event.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were dissatisfied, but they couldn't do anything about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan caught sight of a man with drooping shoulders within the crowd. \u00a0Minchan smiled as he approached him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigo. \u00a0Is that you, president Park?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hammer guild's president Park-sahngoh was about to drink his beverage, and it had gone down the wrong hole. \u00a0He let out a cough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmm. \u00a0Kmmm. \u00a0Should I call you Prime Minister Jung now?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha ha. \u00a0Yes, I am Alandal's Prime Minister.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At one time, he had been the president to this former team leader, who had been in charge of a lower end support team. \u00a0There was an awkward apprehension that was unfolding between them right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI heard you had a hard time trying to set up this general assembly.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It was ridiculous. \u00a0Various guilds threatened me for an invite, and there were also terrorists that forewarned me of attacks. \u00a0Then there was the requests for....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Park-sahngoh had a difficult time. \u00a0There were dark circles under his eyes, and his skin looked dull. \u00a0He looked to have aged significantly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess we were unnecessarily demanding with our requests.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0I fully understand why those requests were made.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't as if Minchan couldn't sympathize with Park-sahngoh's troubles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't a birthday party. \u00a0One couldn't just book a place, then send out the invitations. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This meeting was being led by Kahng-woojin... </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This general assembly was being done to disseminate more information about Alphen and the Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the world's attention couldn't help, but be focused on this event. \u00a0Countless people sent requests or threats to obtain an invitation to this general assembly. \u00a0Park-sahngoh had to carefully plan out how they would be able to protect everyone. \u00a0First, he had to do an exhaustive search on finding a building, then the security personnel....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As time continued to pass, the interest in this event grew proportionally. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was so much factors to worry about that it had been hard to advance in his work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh had suffered under such conditions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the KH guild insisted on managing the general assembly, Park-sahngoh immediately shoved the responsibility to the KH guild as if he was attempting to blow away all the stress he was feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The location of the general assembly was decided to be held at the KH hotel, and the new invitations were re-sent. \u00a0Funnily enough, the new invitation was sent by e-mail.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The effort and preparations paid attention to by Park-sahngoh was all for naught with the change in venue. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The KH guild was relaxed in their preparation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The complaints and threats reached a fevered pitch, but KH guild and Alandal ignored it all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs this really going to be ok?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSome guilds didn't receive personal invitations, so they took it as Alandal ignoring them....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOur invitation was extended to every guild in this world.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. \u00a0You guys only put up a post regarding that issue on an SNS post....\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat should be enough.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were dealing with the VIP Roused of this world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One didn't need to look too far. \u00a0Several large guilds in China had their pride hurt when they hadn't received an official invite, so they weren't attending this event. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh thought about his past hardship, and these discontented guilds had caused a lot of friction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s their choice.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this really the Jung-minchan he had known?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was said the office makes the man. \u00a0When did he develop such large balls?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, a stocky man approached them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-oh. \u00a0Prime minister Jung.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident Baek..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">KH guild's president Baek-jungdo approached as he massaged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI roughed it for so long that any amount of sleep won\u2019t recover my body.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. \u00a0You exaggerate too much. \u00a0I heard you measured your rank again, and you were determine to be Rank AA. \u00a0Congratulations.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Did the news already spread that far?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere are article being poured out right now. \u00a0How could I not know?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-haha. \u00a0That is true.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Baek-jungdo returned to his guild, he had remeasured his Rank. \u00a0He wanted to check the result of his training. \u00a0Unexpectedly, his Rank had turned out to have gone up to Rank AA.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one didn't count Kahng-woojin, he would officially be the first Rank AA of Korea. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, Jaemin will probably be measured to be Rank AA. \u00a0Of course, the Holy Maiden is at least a Rank S. \u00a0Don't you think Blanka and Haesol is also Rank AA?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe haven't measured them yet, so it is all speculation at this point.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKoo-kook. \u00a0Alandal is too humble. \u00a0We don't even have to measure brother Sungggoo. \u00a0I'm sure he is at very least a Rank AA.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan wordlessly smiled. \u00a0Hong-sunggoo's growth speed was the best in this world. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, it is contingent on him coming back alive. \u00a0Hahaha..\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan couldn't just laugh at Baek-jungdo's joke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh's eyes widened in surprise as he listened to their conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll the Roused of Alandal is at such levels?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? I guess president Park doesn't know much about it. \u00a0Even the new recruits they just picked up looked pretty good.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was Alandal some kind of factory that churned out monsters?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How are they able to scout all these geniuses?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-ahngoh eyed Jung-minchan. \u00a0When he was with Hammer guild, team leader Jung-minchan had a knack for unearthing talented individuals.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Now he had moved guilds, and he had started out as the vice president. \u00a0However, he had risen to help found a nation, and he had become the Prime minister of this said nation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Koo. \u00a0I shouldn\u2019t have let him slip away.\u2019 </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He should have held onto him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He should have listened and given full support to Minchan. \u00a0However, it was too late to regret it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. \u00a0It seems the president has arrived.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entrance became crowded, and the flashes caused by the cameras could be seen. \u00a0Jung-minchan headed towards that direction. \u00a0All the people in the hall focused their attention on the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan saw Woo-soonghoon hanging around near the entrance, so he asked Soonghoon a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere did the president go?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI directed him to the ready room. \u00a0He said for you to hurry up, and prepare everything.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKmmm. \u00a0Have you prepared the data?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe've been thorough in our preparation.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Let's hurry up and go.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was still one hour left until the appointed time, so why did they have to be so urgent.... \u00a0\u00a0The two headed towards the ready room. \u00a0Soon, an announcement was heard informing everyone about the start of the general assembly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*** </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The room was reminiscent of a large lecture hall at a college. \u00a0People were packed into the seats. \u00a0Even if it was uncomfortable, no one complained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Some of the guilds here were already aware of the information that was about to be discussed here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people, who knew this information, had kept it a secret. \u00a0However, Kahng-woojin would be revealing everything to the world. \u00a0There was no way to predict what kind of ripple it would cause.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The cameras were running, and it was being live broadcasted to the world. \u00a0Jung-minchan ascended the stage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Jung-minchan. \u00a0I am the Prime Minister of Alandal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had put on a relaxed smile on his face, but he was shaking inside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mother could have never expected this. \u00a0She probably never expected him to rise to a position where the world would pay attention to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan had wanted to be successful, but his ambition hadn't been this large. \u00a0However, things somehow turned out like this after he had met Kahng-woojin. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBefore the king gets up here, I'll go over a summary of the information we were able to find out about the Dungeons.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan put the power point he readied on the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTrahnet. \u00a0This word has entered our sphere of consciousness not too long ago. \u00a0It was first used by Alandal's king. \u00a0It was introduced by Kahng-woojin-nim.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The word, \"Trahnet\" appeared on screen, then planets started to form around it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe look at it as a network between planets. \u00a0Roads are constantly being made.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a picture of the monsters that appeared in the last worldwide Break. \u00a0It especially highlighted the Dragon that seemed to be wrapped around an enormous tree as if it was protecting it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Dimensional lords use these roads to invade. \u00a0They are also called the Monster Lords. \u00a0The monsters are their troops.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Then the pictures of the subway stations appeared next.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Dimensional lords each have their own separate Dimensional Domain. \u00a0This is what we call the high rank Dungeons. \u00a0These Dungeons are like gateways. However, they cannot open all the doors to come to earth.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Afterwards, the screen changed, and the picture of a green gem appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the Dungeon is a gateway, then the Return Stone is comparable to a key. \u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A successful clear created a Mine and a failure created a Break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCurrently, thirty days are needed for synchronization. \u00a0If no one is able to take away this key, they are able to open this gateway. \u00a0This is called the Dungeon Break. \u00a0If one is able to steal the key, the monsters would haunt the Dungeon until the Energy is all used up. \u00a0It'll turn into a Mine.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone quickly raised their hand high into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow do you explain the Dungeons that Broke even though the requisite 30 days hadn't passed?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe information regarding that issue will come out right after this.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan moved onto the next slide.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBasically, the owner of the house had opened the door. \u00a0A person from earth opened the door. Our king deterred the ex-Hwarang guild's president Lee-sahngho. \u00a0He was the root cause.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen changed again. \u00a0It was footages of when Kahng-woojin had visited the US. \u00a0It showed the missile terrorist attack and the Iron Golem Dolsae fighting the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis place had been a test site. \u00a0It was the first time a Dungeon was formed outside of a subway station. \u00a0These experiments had been conducted by the Rivers organization and Professor Riola. \u00a0As you can see, they had succeeded.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This had moved beyond just defending the subway stations now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What could they do? \u00a0The sense of crisis pressed down heavily on the assembly hall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow we will hear from Alandal's king.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one directed it, but everyone got up from their seat when Woojin appeared. \u00a0It felt as if he was getting up to give a lecture. \u00a0He didn't show his pleasure or displeasure regarding this situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a nonchalant reaction as if he had expected such a reception.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEveryone should sit. \u00a0Everyone should know who I am, so I won't introduce myself again. \u00a0I'll just deliver my message.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out a purple colored gem from his possession. \u00a0It was letting out a bright light, and massive amount of energy was being emitted by it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn the recent fracas, didn't some countries pick this up? \u00a0Britain also bought one from me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, research was going on in many quarters of the world. \u00a0Woojin had put this secret information out in the open. \u00a0He spoke about topics and Items that was potentially worth billions...no, trillions of dollars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you can gather three of these, you'll have the qualification to become a Dimensional lord. Moreover, you can gain a Dungeon if you use one of these.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone got impatient, and this person raised his hand as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen Kahng-woojin-nim is also a Dimensional lord?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The assembly hall stirred.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the general atmosphere indicated that they had come to an understanding. \u00a0They assumed Kahng-woojin\u2019s inexplicable amount of personal power wasn't all his own.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAren't you being very shameless? \u00a0You sat on something that is so profitable?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin turned to look at him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cProfit?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If seizing power was a form of profit, Woojin was enjoying the benefit of his actions. \u00a0However, it was also true that he had much more responsibility, because of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don't you go find one for yourself then?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a bit cheeky to say what Woojin had said, but it made the person sit back down. \u00a0Jung-minchan couldn't help, but let out a laugh. It was a very Kahng-woojin-like answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe important part is the fact that the road to earth is open now. \u00a0The invasion attempts will continue. This isn't about profit for me. \u00a0Why would I be telling all of this to everyone if that was my aim?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a hubbub.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin continued to speak as a buzz was building amongst the crowd.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to protect my family. \u00a0On a smaller note, I want to protect earth. \u00a0The fact that I protect the earth is secondary. \u00a0The safety of my family is my primary goal.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah. \u00a0Isn't that supposed to be the other way around? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs there a way to do it?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin spoke confidently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI bought an aircraft carrier. \u00a0I'll put my family on it, and I'll protect it.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin's words, someone mumbled, 'Noah's Ark', under their breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The atmosphere inside the assembly hall turned a little sharp. \u00a0The change in the general mood darkened Jung-minchan's face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't evil for a man in power to be hypocritical. \u00a0Maybe Kahng-woojin was too honest....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you saying you'll only save yourself?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo, this is a warning. \u00a0My enemies aren't all located in different dimensions.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a warning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin, the greatest Roused of this world, revealed what was most important to him... \u00a0He said he would put his family above all else. \u00a0He was telling everyone not to mess with them. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don't want to unnecessarily ramble on after calling all of you here. \u00a0This is what I what I wanted to tell all of you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin looked at his stirring audience, and he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat can we do when the enemies are gathering here?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was there a solution? \u00a0No. \u00a0They weren\u2019t all gathered here, because the solution was known.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can lessen the number of roads connecting to our place. Then we can all fight against the enemies together.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, he was telling them the obvious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn't anything ground breaking. \u00a0It was the stock answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Currently, they were doing all they could do decrease the links to the Dungeons. \u00a0The unavoidable Dungeon Breaks were blocked using a combined force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The only thing different in this proposal was his plan to unite the world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou already have a method that'll ensure your own survival. \u00a0Do you want us to act as meat shields for the bullets?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone yelled out in anger. \u00a0Woojin smirked at those words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin boldly let out a shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll be leading the vanguard.\u201d</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Uh uh? P...pres\u2026 \u00a0No, my king.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s appearance, Woo-soonghoon turned his head, and he quickly scrambled to his feet in surprise. \u00a0The workers, who had been working, looked to see what the fuss was about. \u00a0When they saw Woojin\u2019s face, they came running towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you rebuilding this place?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? \u00a0Well, we have salvage whatever we can. \u00a0Also, shouldn\u2019t we have a base camp near the Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right. \u00a0All of us are going back to the flying fortress, so I want you to gather everyone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cExcuse me? \u00a0I have to stay behind here to work on our diplomatic relationship with the Korean government\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFrom what I saw, you don't look like you have much to do here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way. \u00a0Just my mere presence here\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Soonghoon talked back to him, Woojin\u2019s eyebrows arched. \u00a0Soonghoon quickly simplified his explanation, so Woojin could understand his intention.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the very least, shouldn\u2019t there be a hostage present here? \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if Alandal has fully renounced Korea yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHostage? You are one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026yes. \u00a0At the very least, the king\u2019s chief secretary should stay behind. \u00a0Well, I\u2019m the least useful one, so I should do this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon wasn\u2019t a Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one excluded Jung-minchan and Kim-haemin, he was the next highest ranked officer amongst the founding members. \u00a0However, what he brought to the table was miniscule compared to how high his position was at Alandal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since he always tried to find a role for himself, he did the miscellaneous works. \u00a0No one ordered him to do so, yet he always volunteered himself for these tasks. \u00a0It was admirable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right. \u00a0Go gather all of our luggages.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care about leaving the diplomatic channels open or not. \u00a0It\u2019ll be more convenient for him to gather everyone at the flying fortress. \u00a0His mind would be at ease as he worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his command, the remaining employees of Alandal present in the Seoul Station were all gathered. \u00a0There were 25 of them, and none of them were Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The regular employees were hired by Jung-minchan\u2019s discretion, and Woojin decided to \u00a0take over the recruitment of Roused. \u00a0However, he hadn\u2019t hired any new Roused, since he hired the members of the Phantom Unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were other Roused employed on the flying fortress, but they weren\u2019t of the human race. \u00a0To be precise, they were Dimensional refugees. \u00a0They weren\u2019t from earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo how are we going to get there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are going to get there by\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke as if it wasn\u2019t a problem, yet he let out a sigh when he looked at them. \u00a0They weren\u2019t Roused, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to pass through the Portal. \u00a0Woojin had no choice, but to use a physical method to transport them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll fly there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? \u00a0Most of the flights were cancelled\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the number of flying monsters increased, it was too dangerous to fly in airplanes. \u00a0This was why most airlines indefinitely suspended their flights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Few companies dared to fly their airplanes, and there was no guarantee one of these airplanes were present at the Incheon Airport.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYong Yong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s summon, a black smoke coalesced to form atop the fallen remains of a building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[What is your wish?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a heart attack inducing sound, a large Bone Dragon was summoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was like the fossils one could see in a museum. \u00a0It was made out of bones, and there was no way it\u2019ll be able to fly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI...It really can fly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked as he looked at Yong Yong, who was preening in an arrogant manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere\u2019s always a way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin was approaching Yong Yong, it suddenly raised its head into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-roo-roo.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was gazing into the sky. \u00a0Everyone followed its gaze, but nothing was there. \u00a0Unlike the world that had gone to hell, the sky was clear, and there was only a single cloud in the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-oh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin couldn\u2019t see it with his eyes, but he could clearly feel the energy. \u00a0It was a grave situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It\u2019s Ibrit.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Yong Yong confirmed it, Woojin\u2019s expression slightly hardened as if this development wasn\u2019t welcomed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA really troublesome bastard has arrived.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the king of the Knife-beak Crows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Undying Crow Ibrit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ahhhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying a screech, a large body appeared. \u00a0It was covered with black feathers that rippled like water.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs soon as I returned to earth, I come across the 70th throne\u2026..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was an existence that was worshipped as a god in 70 Dimensions. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Ibrit appeared, he took out all his equipments from his Inventory, and he put it on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jeju\u2019s Manjang Cave.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a long wait, he had took on a tangible form on earth, and he was close to the time of his triumph. \u00a0This was why his time hiding in the Manjang Cave felt slow. \u00a0It felt like an eternity. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The day when everything will culminate was here. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddee-ring, ddee-ring.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he earnestly looked at his handphone, Lee-sahngho gave his report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA black mysterious bird appeared above Seoul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring it to me..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The hand phone was handed over to Iello, and he smiled when he saw the picture.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is Ibrit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit was of the 70th Throne, and it was a very troublesome opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the great lords with Thrones, one wasn\u2019t ranked based on power or battle capability. \u00a0The ranking measured, who had the better management skill. \u00a0It was merely a number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A strong opponent could have a low number, and a weak one could have a high number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one looked only at the pure battle capability, Ibrit was within the top five amongst the great lords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello was the 25th Throne, but he was also one of the top great lords in terms of battle capability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello exited the Manjang cave with a confident expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll start hunting at my leisure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even amongst the planets, earth was a special.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the Synchronization was finished, several hundred lords will converge in an attempt to gain the Master code. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to come out on top, he would need to make allies of the native people. \u00a0He would used them as his allied army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll defeat the villain, and he\u2019ll become the savior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEnough. This will be adequate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit was a being that was absolutely wedded to the role of a villain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Would earth\u2019s existing military force be able to withstand the assault of this being?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their best efforts would only be able to drain the health of Ibrit. \u00a0When the time comes, he\u2019ll defeat Ibrit, and he\u2019ll become the hero of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll present himself as a vassal of earth. \u00a0Lee-sahngho had already finished the preparations under the table.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit had not\u2019 descended alone. \u00a0A flock of several thousand crows appeared with him, and they swept across Seoul. \u00a0The black birds occupied the sky, and they dove between the buildings to pluck out and eat the hearts of humans. \u00a0They also caused explosions by attacking the vehicles and gas pipeline.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-uhng! Kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several crows were swept up by the explosions, but only few died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The crows were like a black storm, and they nested at an islet located at the Hahn river.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undying Crow\u2019s size rivalled a Dragon. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit\u2019s landing broke apart the bridge that ran over the islet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-koo-koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit made the island float above the river, and it immediately planted a Thorn Tree.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ryuu-ahhhhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous tree kept growing as if it was trying to defy the sky . \u00a0After the Synchronization ended, there were no restrictions placed on the Symbols.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The trunk of the tree kept getting thicker, and it was thick enough to occupy half the island. \u00a0The branches were so long that they reached the banks of the Hahn river.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit landed atop the bizarre thorn tree, which held no leaves. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was impossible to think that this enormous tree belonged on earth, yet it had grown to full height in 10 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ahhhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">From the top of the tree, it could see the entirety of Seoul at a glance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several hundred Dungeon entrances nearby.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It could tell by the energies that there were millions of people clustered together in various locations....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit let out a cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I declare this place to be the territory of Ibrit-nim!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His domineering words weren\u2019t spoken in any languages spoken on earth. \u00a0The cry rang out as it moved to the far reaches of Seoul.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only one person understood its words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019re talking shit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped off the Phantom Steed to land on top of the Thorn Tree. \u00a0The thorns were the size of a full grown man, so there were a lot of places where he couldn\u2019t stand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Necromancer\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit\u2019s red eyes blinked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its domineering gaze shot towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Are you going to submit to me? Or do you want to be hunted down by me?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll choose the hunt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ll repay your bravery.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit opened its wings wide. \u00a0Its wings were enormous, and the feathers on its wings stood on end. \u00a0The feathers became as sharp as knives. \u00a0Even if one was brushed by its feathers, one would become cut into tatters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since it was such a threatening sight, Woojin sharpened his senses as the tension within him increased.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is exciting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was his first time facing Ibrit. \u00a0He just heard stories about Ibrit from Jaenis and Yong Yong. Now that he was in front of it, its overpowering nature was no joke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was fighting it for the first time, but Woojin was confident in himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahk, kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Its speed was unbecoming of such a large body. \u00a0Ibrit dashed forward at an incredible speed, and one wing was sweeping towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped to avoid the attack, and since he didn\u2019t have wings, he started falling to the ground. \u00a0However, Phantom Steed Shing Shing appeared, and it stopped Woojin\u2019s fall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ahhhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The knife-like feathers were as sharp as Ibrit\u2019s screech, but Woojin\u2019s Soul Armor was able to block all the projectiles.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When it saw Woojin heading below the island, Ibrit rotated its body as if it was about to free fall towards the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The feathers were seeped with incredibly strong energy, and the feathers fell towards Woojin \u00a0like rain. \u00a0This time his Spirit Armor couldn\u2019t stop all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Choo-choo-choot!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several blades brushed by Woojin, and he suffered multiple wounds. \u00a0His stored souls immediately absorbed into him to heal the damage.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been a long time, since he had faced an opponent of this caliber.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the first after he reached the pinnacle as a Necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While he kept descending towards the ground, Jaenis and the Skeleton Magicians focused their magic on Ibrit. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hell Fire charred the black feathers, but it couldn\u2019t be set on fire. \u00a0Several Death Knights were also summoned. \u00a0They appeared from very locations to latch themselves onto the body of Ibrit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Small fry.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit shook its body, and it let out a loud screech.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ahhhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Fear\u2019s influence didn\u2019t take hold on the Undead, but this sound wasn\u2019t meant for them in the first place. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ahhhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several thousand Knife-beak Crows flew into the air. \u00a0They blotted out one\u2019s vision as they attacked the Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you want to do this with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would never lose in terms of numbers. \u00a0Woojin immediately summoned his Undead army on the Island. \u00a0The Skeleton Warriors and the black crows fought each other, and it created a chaotic scene.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, when Ibrit was nearly to the floor, the enormous Bone Dragon pounced. \u00a0It opened its jaw, and it bit Ibrit\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kooooohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two enormous beings rolled across the ground, and as the trees nearby was uprooted, the rim of island started to sink into the ground. \u00a0When Yong Yong refused to let go of Ibrit\u2019s neck, Wooojin yelled out to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. \u00a0Just keep hit immobilized like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit\u2019s head was being held to the ground. \u00a0A being that looked like a Steel Puppet ran across a broken branch of a Thorn Tree. \u00a0\u00a0After he jumped high into the sky, he brought his fist down on the crown of Ibrit\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-ahhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The shockwave was big enough to cause waves on the Hahn river. \u00a0However, the blow wasn\u2019t strong enough to chase Ibrit back to its Dimension.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[How dare you!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The crow used powerful strokes of its wings to shoot into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ahng, koohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Crow and the Dragon impacted on various parts of the Thorn Tree as they flew into the air, and Yong Yong was eventually dislodged. \u00a0Yong Yong fell to the ground..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-ahhhhhhh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ibrit flew at a higher elevation than the Thorn Tree and it let out a cry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst the continuously resetting Dungeons, several subway stations reacted to the cry.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

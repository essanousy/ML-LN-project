It is an item that can\u2019t be easily found. When I was at the Hammer guild, I only saw it two or three\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked around his Achievement Point Store. He found an item with a similar function.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">&lt;Heres\u2019s Determination&gt;</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The god of Time Heres is determined to start his adventure anew. This item cannot be transferred to others.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Use : Portal Formation Price : 3000 Achievement Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have to kill 1000 Rakwis to fill the point requirements. However, each Naga in the 5 star Dungeon gave him 100 points. Therefore, the Achievement Point was equivalent to killing 30 Naga.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t an insignificant amount of points, but it was a useful item to have in case of an emergency.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo how much is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the very least, it is worth 10 million dollars\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At his words, Woo-soonghoon and Sunggoo became wide-eyed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026isn\u2019t that too expensive? What function does it have?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt has a very rare function. It allows one to escape a Dungeon before it is cleared. This is the only way on could achieve such a feat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t an item needed by the low rank Roused. However, the Return Portal Marble was more valuable than any other Artifacts to the high rank Roused. It was well worth the price.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One couldn\u2019t return from the Dungeon without the Return Stone. The Return Stone acted as a key to opening the barrier. However, the Return Portal allowed one to escape the Dungeon by bypassing the barrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is an item one must have to attempt a 6 star Dungeon. The price is inevitably high since the supply is low.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An incomplete Dungeon meant a certain death for the Roused. Even if all the teams were composed of Rank A Roused, the probability of clearing a 6 star Dungeon was very low. This was why the team was required to have a Return Portal when attempting a 6 star Dungeon. If one fails in clearing the Dungeon, the portal could be used to come back outside. If the Rank A Roused didn\u2019t have this item, then they would have a hard time making up their minds as to whether they should dare to attempt the 6 star Dungeon or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what\u2019s the actual price?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGuilds or nations wants to procure as many of these items as they are able to. In the beginning, it was sold for a price close to 50 million dollars. However, the price varies where you purchase it now, and it ranges from 10 to 20 million dollars.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was surprised. The finger tip sized gem in front of their eyes was worth 10 million dollars\u2026 Woojin was surprised by something else.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018If I could transfer it, then I would have been able to make 10 million per 3000 points.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 3 thousand points weren\u2019t a low figure, but the cash felt larger compared to the points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow much is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out a variety of items now. There were some minerals, and mushroom-looking food ingredients. He also had medicines in bottles. The items he took out was all over the place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese are Reinforcement Stones. Whether it is a mineral or not, they are called Reinforcement Stones. It is an item that can strengthen the Roused\u2019s abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are well informed. So how much does each sell for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a team leader of the Support division, Michan had distributed a lot of these items. This was why he had a good eye for judging the price of the items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt has to be measured. The price differs a lot based on how much energy is within the Reinforcement stone. The Reinforcement Stones sells for at least for 100 thousand dollars. The price sky-rockets as the measured energy increases..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne hundred thousand\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it costs 100 thousand dollars, then it was probably a drug that increases 1 Stat Point. If he tried to buy a drug that increases 1 Stat Point, then the lowest asking price in the Point Store was 2000 points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That\u2019s too bad.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If only the Return Portal was trade-able, he could have sold his 3000 points for 10 million dollars. He could have used that money to gather Reinforcement stones. If he was going to save his points, then he couldn\u2019t purchase the Reinforcement stones in large quantities. Still, he wasn\u2019t too worried about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if it wasn\u2019t a Return Portal, there were other ways to make a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMove aside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out 7 magic scrolls, and 17 Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. This is tremendous. You basically brought back everything that could be found in the 5 star Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned. Woojin hadn\u2019t taken out the Artifacts he would use for himself. Moreover, the money he received from exchanging bloodstones were all put into his account.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow much do these sell for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFirst, I have to find out the Artifact\u2019s ability and effect. Most decent guilds have a team for identifying items. We could also send the Artifacts to the Management Bureau to have them identified. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring me a paper.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin was quick to pick up on Woojin\u2019s intention, so he brought Woojin a piece of paper. Woojin wrote the abilities held within the magic scrolls, and he wrote all the Artifact\u2019s effects.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNow how much can we get for these?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cY\u2026you also have the ability to identify items?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a Roused possessed an ability that could read the Artifact\u2019s information, even a Rank F Roused with that ability would be treated well in the guild. The Identifiers were essential in circulating the Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Is it strange?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow many ability do you have?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Mmmm. How many skill did he have? He had learned a lot minor skills along the way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. Several. Why? Is it important?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. If you are reluctant to talk about it, then you don\u2019t have to. The number of abilities could also influence the determination of one\u2019s Roused rank.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo how much would all of them sell for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnlike the bloodstones, there aren\u2019t a fixed price on the Artifacts. We\u2019ll know the exact figure only after we sell it. If I had to guess on an approximate value, I think we could receive around 15 million dollars. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we also sell the Return Portal then we would bring in around 25 million?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is the floor. If you aren\u2019t in a hurry, we could sell it slowly. Then we could probably double the profit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin nodded his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. You take care of selling everything here. Also, if there are any Reinforcement Stones selling for a fair price, then purchase all of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon was listening to their conversation, and he secretly swallowed his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ah. This isn\u2019t a joke. They are playing in a different league. \u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yesterday, he searched for articles on Kang-Woojin. He knew Kang-Woojin was hot, but he never knew he was this capable. Soonghoon had just stepped into the world of the Roused, and it made his whole body shake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I have to stick here at any cost. No matter what the it takes.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew how hard it was to enter into a guild. Moreover, it was a guild with a Rank A Roused\u2026 The guild was still in its infancy, but he knew this guild would grow into a large guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This job would allow him to earn money and fame, and it couldn\u2019t even be compared to working as a hand phone dealer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan started counting the items for the inventory list, so Woojin didn\u2019t feel the need to stay in the storage room any more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He took all the Reinforcement stones, then he relocated to another location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere is my seat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOver here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin followed Haemin, and he was guided into the president\u2019s room. The room was twice the size of Jaemin\u2019s one room. Woojin sat on the sofa, and he pointed towards the opposite wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s put a tv over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I ordered one. It\u2019s supposed to arrive in the evening, so it\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had hinted at what he wanted in the morning, but Haemin had already taken care of it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAfter they finish taking inventory, tell everyone to come in here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin sank his body into the sofa, then he became lost in his thoughts. This was a small organization with only 5 members, but it still needed a hierarchy. Woojin had ruled over a lot of followers on Alphen, and he was comfortable with dealing with such issues.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soon, the four people entered Woojin\u2019s office. Woojin told them to sit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader Jung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat position should I give you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t we need ranks to decide what we should all do? Everyone tell me what you guys want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone became nervous when they heard Woojin\u2019s words. They had to speak carefully right now. Woojin seemed indifferent, and indulgent regarding this matter. However, no one was willing to speak first in this atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader Jung. How are the normal guilds structured?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe guild is divided into two categories. The Roused position range from deputy to director. The Roused could be given the title of vice-president, but the titles aren\u2019t that important. The treatment of the Roused is determined by the percentage of the profit the roused would receive for clearing a Dungeon, and the basic adjustment rate. Everything is written in detail in the Roused\u2019s contract.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was only one other Roused here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you want to do, Sunggoo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? I have to be hyung-nim\u2019s manager for a year\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, it\u2019s fine. Then Suggoo will be a director.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA d\u2026director?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was deeply moved. Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDirector in charge of picking up the loots.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did such a title for a director exist anywhere else? It would have been better if he was called the director of packaging services.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow is the Support Division structured?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is divided into executive branch, sales branch, accounting branch, general affairs branch and the support branch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe 3 of you are going to be responsible for all of that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader Jung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are the general director.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the highest position one could reach inside a guild if one wasn\u2019t a Roused. Jung-minchan felt a feeling surge up from inside his chest, and it moved him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was so moved that Minchan didn\u2019t even realize that Woojin had spoken to him in an informal manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you want to do, Haemin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease assign me as the department head of the Support division.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t playing house, where they were deciding if one was choosing to play the role of mother or father. So how couldn\u2019t Woojin be so cool in this situation?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHeh heh. I\u2019ll be loyal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the remaining person, Woo-soonghoon. His face was flushed, and his face was filled with anticipation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell. I\u2019ll leave the rest to Director Jung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Director Jung. Director Jung! The word circled around Jung-minchan\u2019s ears, then he felt his heart beat faster. He suddenly felt he made the right choice in changing his occupation. It felt like he had become one of the nucleus of this guild. It was more than a feeling now. He had become a core member.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president. So how should we go about hiring new employees\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought about the empty desks within the office when he heard Minchan\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have to hire more people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. If we want to run a smooth operation, we would need\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do you need to hire more people?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026well? We have to grow our guild. As the number of Roused increases, we would need some employees\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out an envelope from his pocket, then he tossed it on to the table. Minchan was surprised when he saw the contents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Draft Notice]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT\u2026this is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.. He had only 4 people under him, but now that he had underlings, he felt freed from dealing with annoying businesses.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, Minchan and Haemin were elites in this field.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want to be exempt from joining the military, and I want to clear the Dungeons in peace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo I need more employees for that to happen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So this was it. This was the reason why he made the guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan felt dizzy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wanted to avoid joining the military, then he could have just entered the Hammer guild. Minchan would have been given the title of general director of the Support division for his meritorious deed if Woojin had done so.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, we need to bring in couple more people\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Then I\u2019ll leave it to your discretion. General director is in charge of any work related to the Support Division. All right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Did Woojin trust him this much or was Woojin trying to push all the annoying work to him? Ah. Why did he feel so uneasy?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen you take care of it. I\u2019m going to clear the Dungeon one more time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It took a little more than 4 hours to clear it, but 16 hours passed inside the Dungeon. Woojin\u2019s hunting speed was so fast that Sunggoo was being worked to death. Woojin wanted to go to the Dungeon again with only this much rest\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s face darkened, and Minchan spoke to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBefore you do that, you have to visit the Management Bureau.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do I have to go there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have to be measured for your true Roused rank before the guild evaluation could proceed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go there first then.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, Sunggoo and Minchan headed towards the Management Bureau. Haemin, and Soonghoon stayed behind in the office to sort out the rest of the loot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFascinating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stood in front of a machine that looked like the Dungeon Energy measuring instrument. Every time the machine was used, a pile of bloodstones was used, so it wasn\u2019t used that often. Still this was the most accurate method in measuring a Roused\u2019s Rank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The public employee finished setting it up. He spoke as he pointed towards the thick wall of the measuring room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCould you please direct your most powerful ability towards that direction?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When a Roused used their abilities, energy was emitted. The measuring instrument measured that energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin summoned his Bone Spear as if it was a trivial matter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ri-ri-ri-reek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several numbers appeared, and in the end, the Rank showed up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? It says Rank C?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Did something go wrong?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two public employee saw the monitor, then they started having a serious conversation with each other. The media spoke as if Woojin being a Rank A Roused was a foregone conclusion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. One just had to look at his accomplishments. He was able to clear a 5 star Dungeon by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Without a hint of doubt, everyone believed Woojin was a Rank A Roused. Today\u2019s Rank measurement was a formality. It was done, so there would be a record of his Rank measurement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, do you need something more from me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. Do you have a more powerful technique?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t enough, then I could give you more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, the public employees prepared the bloodstone again, then they activated the measuring equipment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll just emit magical energy until the Rank A shows up. Turn the monitor towards me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The public employee turned the monitor, so Woojin would be able to see it. Woojin summoned 10 Bone Spears at once. The measuring instrument\u2019s number quickly rose, but a \u2018B\u2019 showed up on the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the Bone Spears wasn\u2019t enough. He quickly summoned the Wall of Bones, which consumed a lot of magic. He sent it towards the measurement room\u2019s wall. Then he consumed his vitality in preparation to use Earth Strike without a weapon.

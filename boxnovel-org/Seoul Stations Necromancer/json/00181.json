How dare you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak raged as the back of his shoulders exploded. \u00a0Wings erupted from his back as it kept getting larger. \u00a0The wings unfurled, and it was over 10 meters in size.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-dook, too-toohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wings weren't the only parts that got bigger. \u00a0It was as if Celrak's body was trying to grow in proportion with the large wings. \u00a0His body steadily grew, and it was three times larger than a normal person's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How dare you order me around!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The angered Celrak moved his feet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kooooooong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ground shook as clouds of dust rose into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The army organized formation showed signs of charging too.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are striving for something useless. \u00a0Your era will never come to pass.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The god of Destruction... \u00a0This bastard was mad as a hatter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhhng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Celrak extended his hand in mid-air, his weapon appeared. \u00a0It was a spear containing the power of lightning. \u00a0The white electricity crawled over the spear as it let out a menacing sound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jee-jeek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak saw a small needle in front of his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhng, pah-chee-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He reflexively swung his Thunder Spear, and something bounced off of it. \u00a0It was a Bone Spear thrown by Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bastard!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His chest voice exploded forth as he folded his wings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong, koo-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as big as a Titan, yet it was as fast as an Elf.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst Trahnet's great lords, he was one of the top ranked lords in terms of battle capabilities. \u00a0Moreover, Celrak had fought the Immortal thrice in the past, and there had been no victors in any of those fights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their battles always resulted in both sides wasting their resources.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal brought back the monsters he killed, and the Dimensional lords wasted all their Points by replenishing their armies with new troops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why it was important to kill the Immortal before he could turn the tables.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak never joined a fight where there would be no gain for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, he now had a reason to kill this bastard even at the cost of losing Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he used his Points freely, there was no reason why he wouldn't be able to win against this bastard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undead army would be able to continuously add to their ranks, so it would be a fight of wills. \u00a0However, it wasn't as if the Immortal was all powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since Celrak had come here with tens of thousands of monsters, his army would occupy the Undead army. \u00a0While they fought, Celrak just had to kill the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal was the summoner, and if he was killed, the Undeads were easy preys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll show you my full power!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a battle where he had to weigh the advantages and disadvantages to change strategy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to pour everything he had into this fight, and he had to tear the Immortal into pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is too late for you to run away!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What did you say, retard?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin had suddenly appeared next to his ear, and Celrak was barely able to block the sword strike by swinging his Thunder Spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-jee-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The electric sparks flew into the air, and it spread in a threatening manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Bastard!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak quickly found him again, but the Immortal had already planted his sword within Celrak\u2019s leg.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he always this fast?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-uh-uh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corpses strewn across the ground suddenly stood up. \u00a0They ran towards Celrak, and they grabbed onto both his legs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"How dare these insignificant Undeads attack me!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ooh-ooh-oohng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak unfurled his large wings, and he rose into the sky. \u00a0He tried to shake off the Undeads clinging to his legs, but unfortunately, the explosions occurred before he could act.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggoo-ahhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The walking corpse zombies started to explode, and Celrak\u2019s legs disappeared. There was nothing left behind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A light arrow pierced through his wing. \u00a0Celrak flailed around before he plummeted to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Koo-oohk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What a shameful scene!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If only he had the Alphen's Master Code....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll be able to immediately regenerate such minor wounds. \u00a0He could shape and mold everything within this planet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin walked to the head of the fallen Celrak. \u00a0The Warrior's Weapon in his hand turned into an axe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You'll be able to see the world in half now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Celrak glared at him when Woojin raised his axe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You bastard. \u00a0Have you been hiding your power?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No matter how he saw it, this wasn't the movements of a Necromancer. \u00a0Was he a warrior?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Retard.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The axe fell, and it split Celrak's head into two. \u00a0His body turned into gray light. \u00a0Celrak was dead, but his tens of thousand underlings still remained.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their commander was dead, yet the monsters weren't flustered. \u00a0They didn't run away. \u00a0Instead, they charged towards Woojin, and they were full of killing intent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why Dimensional lords used monsters as underlings. \u00a0If they had orders, they fearlessly charged their enemies. \u00a0Woojin welcomed this sight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Come, my sacrifices.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The day when all his Familiars would be able to gather in a single location wasn't too far off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">****</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After shooting several dozen fireballs, Sunggoo came down from the Amplifier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Oo-oohk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn't find his balance, so he swayed on his feet. \u00a0Do-jaemin quickly helped Sunggoo stay upright.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hyung. \u00a0Are you ok?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo didn't look ok, but he tried hard to put on a smile for Jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham looked surprised when he saw the pale-faced Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Please calm your magical energy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Your magical energy might go on a rampage. \u00a0Please hurry up and come here!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was helped by Graham, and he started stabilizing his magical energy. \u00a0He calmly sat as he tried to calm his insides. \u00a0Graham clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Tsk. \u00a0I already know you aren't a Spirit King.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That fact was so obvious that Sunggoo didn't know what to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm really curious as to who taught you about magic.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he say he learned it from Woojin? \u00a0Or should he say he learned it through books, since he obtained the skills through magic scrolls....</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was thinking about what he should say when Graham kept berating him in a dignified manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That person has no right to call himself a magician. \u00a0You have to harmonize your magic, yet your teacher taught you to focus only on fire. If your equilibrium falters a little bit, your body will be burned into ashes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Uh...mmmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How should he answer such a speech?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he say he was self-taught? \u00a0Or maybe he should tell Graham about his Lich teacher, who deserved to be cussed at? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I believe you should be fine now. \u00a0You should use your magic recovery technique as you bolster your weakened body.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah. \u00a0Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Sunggoo bowed towards him, Graham shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This man had the potential to become an Archmage, yet he was an incomplete mage only capable of producing fire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was too bad.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So who is your teacher? \u00a0Do all magicians on earth use magic like you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah... \u00a0The person I call my teacher is from Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? \u00a0Who is he? \u00a0I really want to question him immediately.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham became surprised, and he started showing his gallant spirit. \u00a0Sunggoo let out an awkward laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha. \u00a0He said his name is Jaenis... \u00a0However, he is already dead.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Sunggoo's words, Graham put on an embarrassed expression as he let out a fake cough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hrmm hrrm. \u00a0My regret at your situation made me badmouth the deceased. \u00a0I'm sorry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's ok. \u00a0I'll introduce you to him soon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How was he suppose receive such words?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He said he'll make Graham meet a deceased person. \u00a0Was Sunggoo saying he'll kill Graham?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham wasn't sure if it was a 'joke' or a 'forewarning of an assassination'. \u00a0Graham had an odd expression on his face when he heard Sunggoo's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was akin to a fire spirit, yet he was strangely a half a mage. \u00a0What should he do with this magician from earth?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Graham was thinking over what to do, Do-jaemin let out a shout.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He's here! \u00a0Hyung-nim is here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh? \u00a0Where?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Energy suddenly welled up from his dry reserves. \u00a0Sunggoo abruptly got up to look for Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the only one able to communicate with the Dimensional lord was the vassal Do-jaemin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He said he is just around the corner.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ha. \u00a0This will now come to an end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had tried hard not to show it, but he was quite exhausted inside. \u00a0Sunggoo started to breath easy again, but Graham shook his head as he looked below at the Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It is the end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Our lives are at an end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The confused Sunggoo followed Graham's finger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-oh-oh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two beings showed their clear presence from afar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were two Dragons flying towards them. \u00a0One was red and the other was yellow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Can't you do something with your barrier?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My barrier can't block a Dragon\u2019s Breath.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Haha.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo wished Woojin would show up before the Dragons could let out their Breaths.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let out a sigh when he saw Unon and Shirao block his path.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Couldn't you guys have just fight me at once? \u00a0Why fight me in order like this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't know.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon really looked like an Asian man. \u00a0If he said he was Korean, it would have been believable. \u00a0He was wearing thin hemp clothes, so Unon looked like an ancestor from medieval times. \u00a0It evoked a weird feeling inside Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Whatever. \u00a0Just hurry up and attack me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Colony was right in front of him if he pushed past these bastards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In some ways, Woojin had been fortunate. \u00a0The most dangerous Dimensional lords headed towards him instead of going to his Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be hard to face the army of monsters, but he thought the Coalition would be able to hold out until he got there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you in such a hurry?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon's easygoing attitude got on Woojin's nerves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you worried about your comrades?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I miss it. \u00a0I miss the ability to worry about others.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had lived so long that he wasn't able to feel such emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon let out a bitter laugh as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Fatooh and Leia is already heading towards your Colony.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Those lizards?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dragons were considered to be incredibly powerful compared to humans, but they didn't rate too high amongst the great lords.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe, this was true, because humans were much more proficient at Domain battles. \u00a0Amongst the Trahnet's great lords, there were an unusually high number of humans.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if one observed old records, one would find that humans built nations. \u00a0They were quite talented in ruling and supervising their lands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dragons were shown to be poor leaders.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were a race that would rather cause fear and destruction rather than rule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weren't the Dragons the 6th and 9th Throne?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they were on their way to his Colony...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Even if you leave right now, it'll take you 10 minutes to get there. \u00a0It is enough time for them to raze the Colony to the ground.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he left right now, he would be cutting it close. \u00a0No, it might be too late for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, how long will it take for you to take me down?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had reached the extremes in regards to techniques dealing with the body. \u00a0Unon was a hard opponent to face even if he received help from the Death Knight. \u00a0On top of that fact, Unon wasn't by himself. \u00a0He had a large force of Minotaurs with him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that impatience I see?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was this what he was aiming for?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was he trying to slightly increase his odds by using such a tactic?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unlike his relaxed appearance, it seemed he had been thorough in his preparations. \u00a0It was cute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Jeez.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, this should be just the right amount.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...what are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm short around 5%.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It'll be here soon. \u00a0I prepared this just for you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been looking at Woojin to decipher the meaning behind his words. \u00a0Unon suddenly tilted his head up until it looked as if his neck would snap. \u00a0He could see a shining star in the clear sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ah-ah-ah.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon's eyes opened wide when he saw the meteor slicing through the atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When did he use the meteor summon magic?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You are already too late.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\".....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"As you said before, I'm in a hurry, yet I've been talking to you in a relaxed manner. \u00a0Why did you think I was doing that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What this his plan?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if he had the table turned against him. \u00a0Unon had thought he was the one waiting with the trap prepared, yet the Immortal had used his tactic against him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The meteor summon magic had a long preparation time, so he must have used it earlier. \u00a0The Immortal had just been waiting for them to show up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This doesn't change anything.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unon clenched his fists.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The meteor couldn't tell the difference between allies and enemies. \u00a0It would destroy both the monsters and the Undead army. \u00a0Moreover, Unon and Shirao would be unharmed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two of them would be enough to stall the Immortal. \u00a0Once the Immortal's Colony was destroyed, he would be stuck on Alphen. \u00a0He would be trapped until he was able to acquire a new Dungeon or a Colony.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Goo-haha! \u00a0Is this the last sacrifice needed for our friend?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis had perfectly completed his mission. \u00a0After appearing next to Woojin, he immediately formed a barrier. \u00a0Woojin was able to unsummon his Death Knights and Undead army just in time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The meteor impacted the surface, and the incredible explosion obliterated the monster army.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

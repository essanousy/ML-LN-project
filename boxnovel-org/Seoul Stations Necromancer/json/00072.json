Hey, Haesol.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was glad to see a familiar face, so he wave his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease greet him for me. This man is our guild\u2019s general director.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Jung-minchan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m Lieutenant Che-haesol. In the near future, we will be eating from the same pot of rice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan tilted his head in confusion as he shook her hand. Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe the new recruit I chose.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lieutenant Che-haesol was the new recruit he was talking about last time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked towards Haesol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought I told you to apply for discharge from service. Why are you here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll be a civilian around the time president returns. Until then, I\u2019m still a solider, and I have to faithfully do my job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you have any vacation time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, Haesol let out an awkward laugh. She didn\u2019t know how he could make such a silly joke in situations like this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sure you heard about the intel. We were tipped off on a potential terrorist attack.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI know. So will I be able to go to the US?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSince there are a lot of potential risk factors, it\u2019ll take a long time make preparations.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would have to delay the take-off. Every single passenger and flight crew would have to go through a background check, so the long delay was inevitable. Moreover, they were sweeping the baggages multiple times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo when will we be able to lift off?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt the very least, it will be tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s brows furrowed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be inquiring about taking another plane instead?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why my commander requested cooperation from the KH Guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKH Guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">KH group was a guild that ran a large company.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy them?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKH Guild is also participating in the consortium. Their group is travelling using a private jet, so you can use it with them. I\u2019ve already received their permission.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh-ho. That\u2019s good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With Haesol\u2019s guidance, Woojin went through a simple screening process before the departure. Minchan and Haesol took care of all the small matters. Woojin just had to show his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that my passport?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019ll keep it in my possession.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A photographer had come to the office not too long ago to take Woojin\u2019s portrait shots, and it must have been used to make his passport. Woojin handed the passport over to Minchan then he shook hands with Haesol.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you when I return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. Have a nice trip.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Haesol finished her duty as a guide, she departed. They walked through a long passageway. After reaching the runway, the two of them got on a shuttle bus.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked out the bus\u2019 window to view the runway. It was the quintessential image of a person about to ride a plane for the first time, so Minchan couldn\u2019t help but smile.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had a hard time thinking of him this way, but Woojin was a 24 year old with no experience in taking overseas trips.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m looking at the air planes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe one we will ride won\u2019t be as large as those.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan spoke as he looked at the line of A380s. Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve ridden something much larger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you say this was your first time riding an airplane?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt will be the first time I\u2019ll be flying on an airplane, but I\u2019ve ridden many things that could fly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was something that flew that was much larger than an airplane?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll let you ride him next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin put on a bitter smile at Minchan\u2019s answer. It wouldn\u2019t be a comfortable ride. He could imagine the expression Minchan would make at the rough ride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bus stopped in front of an air plane with a KH group logo on the side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In front of the steps, a man in a neat suit was waiting for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Jung-chansung. I am the senior vice president of KH Guild. I was notified of your arrival.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll be imposing on your hospitality for a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-chansung smiled at Minchan\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou won\u2019t be imposing anything on us. It is an honor to serve president Kahng-woojin. Please come up. Our guild\u2019s president is waiting for you inside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked up the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they entered the passageway, they didn\u2019t see any airplane seats. Instead, a room arranged like a living room was revealed. There was a 40 year old middle aged man sitting on top of a sofa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was recently on the news on a frequent basis, so his fame was quite recent. However, the masses already knew the face and profile of all top 10 Rank A Roused of Korea. Jung-minchan recognized the man\u2019s face, so he whispered into Wooin\u2019s ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe is KH Guild\u2019s president Baek-jongdo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin walked closer, Baek-jongdo suddenly stood up, and he quickly walked towards Woojin. Then he raised one hand high in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo, president Kahng!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin blankly stared back at him. Jung-chansung, who was also his personal assistant, quickly approached Baek-jongdo to hold him back. His face and ears was red.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. They are guests we are seeing for the first time, so please restrain yourself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh huh huh. Understood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jungdo pushed his hand out towards Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI thought you watched this drama since it is very popular right now. I\u2019m KH guild\u2019s Baek-jongdo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m Kahng-woojin..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin asked a question as he shook the other man\u2019s hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat were you doing before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? It\u2019s something they do on a popular drama on tv right now. Huh huh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I thought you wanted to fight me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jongdo let out a cheerful laugh at Woojin\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you like dramas?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-huh huh. Since we have a lot of time before we get to the US, let\u2019s watch some dramas together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, that\u2019s great. I was bored, so I was wondering what I should do to entertain myself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin enjoyed watching TV. The problem was he didn\u2019t have time to watch it. This was why he put a TV inside the president\u2019s room. Whenever he had a spare moment, Woojin watched dramas.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI installed a fantastic multimedia room inside my private plane. Come this way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Baek-jongdo and Kahng-woojin moved past Jung-changsung, he was left standing inside the parlor with Jung-minchan. Jung-changsung lowered his head to his chest.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Our president is a really eccentric person\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa ha ha. It\u2019s ok. Our president is also\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan answered awkwardly, but somehow he felt some unknown kinship with Jung-changsung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwarang Guild\u2019s President Room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A TV was mounted on one side of the wall. The news about the terror intelligence, the closure and inspection of the Inchun Airport was being reported. Moreover, there was a breaking news that said Kahng-woojin was accompanying the KH Guild\u2019s president to the US.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2019s really become a celebrated figure in Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His every move was now being reported on the internet, and the news. The cameras were constantly on Kahng-woojin, since his clearing of the 6 star Dungeons, and his visits to the US were big news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho frowned as he glared at his silent hand phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ri-di-ri ding dong, ddi-ri-di-ri\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was call from Korean broker Lee-sahngho had been waiting for. He pressed the answer button, and he put the phone up to his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It\u2019s me.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow can you work so sloppily?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Sloppy? I\u2019m disappointed in your words.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe whole country knows about the planned terrorist attack, and the target just left the country. Can you afford to be so relaxed??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Koo-kook. Our plans are well under way, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ooh. Are you sure?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Who would be so uncouth these days to carry out a terrorist attack on an air plane? This is only the initial smokescreen. Be at ease. Just wait and see.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo. All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho ended the call. Were they pretending to cover up the fact that their plan had gone side way? Or is this really their initial smoke screen? He had no way of finding out which was true.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The broker called him everyday with a different number.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no way of contacting the man unless the broker contacted him first.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had already paid a substantial price, so they would fulfill his request. They were a group of professional killers, who have yet to fail yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">KH Group\u2019s Private Airplane Multimedia Room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Three people were sitting in a place set up like a mini theater.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The screen was showing a currently popular drama called \u2018Reply 1988\u2019. (TLN: If you want to see the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BF3pHSufn4 )</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exiting the restroom, Baek-jongdo looked at the others busily watching the drama, and he felt a rewarding feeling. He was able to share something he enjoyed with others. He felt great joy at experiencing something with others he liked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin saw Baek-jongdo returning from the restroom, he suddenly stood and approached Baek-jongdo with one hand in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo, president Baek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jongdo raised one hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAigoo, president Kahng!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two hands met. When they grabbed each other\u2019s hands, they started squatting up and down repeatedly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see you. Really great to see you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan felt his hands and feet shrivel up when he saw both of their antics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was well aware Kahng-woojin lived without caring about what others thought of him. However, it seems KH Guild\u2019s Baek-jongdo was also formidable opponent in that respect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan glanced to his side, and Jung-chansung was red up to his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When their eyes met, Jung-minchan and Jung-chansung exchanged sorrowful gazes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I guess it is our role to be embarrassed for them.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan prayed they wouldn\u2019t act that way in a crowded location.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the 20 hours flight, they finally arrived at New York.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Titan Guild was hosting the consortium, so an employee was dispatched for each guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWelcome. I\u2019m Titan guild\u2019s Richard Che. I\u2019ll be guiding you to the hotel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For the convenience of guests of each country, the Titan guild sent employees capable of speaking the native language of each guests. The guide led them to vehicles on standby. Before Baek-jongdo got in the car, he smacked his lips in regret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a drink after a brief rest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. That would be great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo. I\u2019ll see you later. Ah-ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIll see you later, Baek hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Minchan got into the car with Richard Che.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. I guess you are quite taken with President Baek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. He\u2019s quite fun. Moreover, he\u2019s of a similar age as me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Baek-jongdo was 42 years, and Woojin was 24 years old\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. You said you lived on Alphen for 20 years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He estimated Woojin should be around 39 years old. When Minchan thought of it this way, it was obvious why he felt Woojin wasn\u2019t like a young person.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. Isn\u2019t Woojin older than him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, the concept of age is a funny thing now, because of the Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t only true in regards to Woojin, who had returned from to Alphen. The time within all the high rank Dungeons ran 4 times longer inside\u2026 It would be laughable to apply the standard age on the Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Instead of age, shouldn\u2019t they measure the time experienced by each Roused?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Still, isn\u2019t he a little immature for a 39 year old?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, one\u2019s life is weighted differently depending on the life one lived.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard Woojin\u2019s quiet mumble, Minchan felt guilty. It felt as if his inner thoughts had been revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spent a hellish 20 years over there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he wasn\u2019t able find merriment, he would have probably killed himself long before. Even though Baek-jongdo was a scion of a rich family, he might had led a similar life to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They probably lead a life heavy with burden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The car left the airport, and they stopped at a hotel nearby. It was a dark night, and one could only see hotels lining the street. One couldn\u2019t see any place that would provide entertainment.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The consortium would start tomorrow at lunch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease rest comfortably. We\u2019ll have a vehicle ready at 11 AM.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After finishing the check-in, Richard Che returned to where he came from. Woojin and Minchan greeted each other inside the elevator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCome out immediately after you wash yourself. I\u2019m going out to drink.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone invited to the consortium were special guests, so there were no special treatments among the guests. Minchan was placed in a business room on the 3rd floor, and Woojin was guided to a VIP suite on the top floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took a shower, then he dried his hair. After he drank the water bottle he took out of the fridge, he opened the carrier packed by Minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several formal wear he would wear tomorrow packed inside, and there was also a sweatsuit in there. He took out and wore the sweatsuit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even though it was only a sweat suit, it was made from materials brought out from the Dungeons. It was something a Roused would wear. He wasn\u2019t too familiar with the subject, but clothes like this could easily go for several thousand dollars.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he was about to head out, Woojin turned off the light to his room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt a strange sense of danger. When he swept his gaze across the room, he saw a shaking red dot on one side of the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA laser?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sooah and Bibi played frequently with the laser pointer, so he was used to seeing the red light. The only difference was the size. The laser point was about 5 times larger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked several steps forward to see where the laser point was originating from. When he looked out the window, he could the light of a laser being shot from a far off building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same moment, Woojin saw a missile falling from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The missile was heading straight towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

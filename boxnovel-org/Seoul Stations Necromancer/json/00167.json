style=\"\">[Have I met that Elven bitch?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ooh-haha! \u00a0It's a festival! \u00a0A Festival!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[You want to make a bet? \u00a0As always, I will win.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights were boisterously talking, and the humans held their breath as the Death Knights passed by them. \u00a0The Death Knights didn't show any signs of hostility in their conversations, yet the humans knew how frightening they were.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These beings would cut off their heads as they laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Immortal's Army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Death's Executioners.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">These beings just walked past the people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Goo-uh-uh-uh!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeletons and the unsightly Zombies also passed by them. \u00a0The humans were treated as if they were non-existent.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puh-puhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-keek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Vesics and Tudons were helplessly taken down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No, they were being swept away. \u00a0Once the army swept past them, the humans let out the breath they had been holding in.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Hoo-ah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They couldn't even move their mouth from feeling overpowered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What's going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal's Army held a great hostility and hatred towards the living. \u00a0Yet they were just passing by the humans right in front of their eyes...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, the Immortal had shown up with the kidnapped Holy Maiden.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Look over there. \u00a0We have to rescue the Holy Maiden.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The army is at a distance now. \u00a0This is our golden opportunity.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"However, the bastard has other Familiars....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They couldn't come to a decision. \u00a0While they were indecisive, the Immortal approached them on his Phantom Steed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yo, what's up? \u00a0It's been awhile.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know their names, but there was a faint memory of their faces left inside Woojin's head. \u00a0He raised his hand in a welcoming manner as he greeted them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric and the other heroes tensed at the sight. \u00a0They glared at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you planning to do by kidnapping the Holy Maiden?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What kidnapping?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin let Melody down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody couldn't control the expression on her face. \u00a0She was thankful and apologetic at seeing the surviving people. \u00a0Her expression switched back and forth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm sorry for my late arrival. \u00a0To save Alphen, I went to the planet Earth to bring reinforcements.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you saying?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Immortal has agreed to help us reclaim Alphen.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric, Graham, and Latasha looked at each other when they heard Melody's words. \u00a0When she saw their expressions, she laughed with tears in her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody had also been very surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had almost been unbelievable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal's name had been synonymous with calamity, yet he had become her ally.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The Holy Maiden is dead!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"She's become the Immortal's corpse puppet!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You evil bastard!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody was taken aback when she saw them grasp their weapons as the tension in the air spiralled upwards.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"No. \u00a0It is a misunderstanding. \u00a0He really has come to help the coalition...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Stop speaking nonsense! \u00a0I'm sure the Shadow Ghost is controlling her.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah ah. \u00a0I can't believe the Holy Maiden of Aria had passed on in this fashion.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric seemed genuinely sad. \u00a0Tears started falling from his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is a true misunderstanding. \u00a0I'm still alive. \u00a0The Immortal really is...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes. \u00a0She's the Illusion Witch! \u00a0I'm sure this is an illusion.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah ah. \u00a0Oh Skia. \u00a0Please give me strength.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ooh-ooh-ooh-oohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric was swept up in a pink light. \u00a0As if to let out his pent-up anger, Tauric was getting ready to charge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw Melody become taken aback at seeing these people become enraged, Woojin let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, do we really have to explain it in such a lame way?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to resolve the misunderstanding...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This isn't something you can resolve with words.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped off Shing Shing, and he summoned the Warrior's Weapon. \u00a0There was a playful smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You just have to let them feel the truth with their bodies.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin showed signs of getting ready for battle, Tauric was the first to charge towards Woojin. \u00a0He couldn't control the tears falling from his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I dreamed of this day. \u00a0I have the chance to eliminate the Immortal when his army isn't around him. \u00a0Isn't this the culmination of my life destined by Skia-nim?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric charged forward. \u00a0No one had been able to eliminate the Immortal, since he was always surrounded by his Familiars and the tens of thousands of Undeads.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know the reasoning behind the Immortal\u2019s actions, but his army was focused on eliminating the Trahnet's army in the distance. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was Tauric's golden opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoooooong, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His mace was blocked by Woojin's Steel Staff. \u00a0Tauric was the Monk of Skia, the god of Adventurers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Monk Tauric's strength wasn't insignificant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His eyes widened from surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhk, kwahnk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His surprise didn't end there. \u00a0Woojin used his strength to push him backwards. \u00a0Tauric was skidding backwards when the Steel Staff impacted on his knee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Koo-uh-uhk!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought there was no way he would lose in terms of strength. \u00a0Tauric was being overwhelmed by strength. \u00a0Was the Immortal always this strong? \u00a0Moreover, the consequent attacks were swift.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was as fast as Latasha when she was going all out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek, kwahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric was victimized by the Immortal\u2019s cruel hands. \u00a0The Immortal's Steel Staff crushed Tauric's knees, and Tauric was also struck on his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blood exploded forth as his scalp bled freely, but Tauric was barely able to avoid death. \u00a0However, he couldn't stop himself from passing out. \u00a0One could see the white of his eyes as he lay on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin left behind Tauric, and he immediately surged towards Graham.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huht!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham's body disappeared in a flash as he reappeared a little ways off from his original position.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had used the close range teleportation spell called Blink.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The souls that inhabited Woojin's Soul Armor turned into several dozen spears, and the Soul Spears chased after Graham.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh-huht!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Soul Spears followed until it impacted on their target. \u00a0Graham was tirelessly moving to avoid the Soul Spears. \u00a0Kahng-woojin changed his Warrior\u2019s Weapon into a bow, and he shot an arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Puhhhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Koo-ahhhhhk!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Graham had deployed his defensive magic, yet his shoulder exploded in a bloody mess. \u00a0Graham rolled on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"My father's murderer!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was only 60 years old, yet she had risen to the position of Elf Lord. \u00a0She had filled the position out of necessity as countless elders had sacrificed themselves in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal had killed her father!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng, kahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha danced with daggers in each hand. \u00a0In a flash, Woojin had transformed his Warrior's Weapon into a daggers as he faced her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoo-ah-ahk, kahng, shwee-sheek, shoohk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The four daggers clashed against each other, and the battle was becoming prolonged. \u00a0Latasha possessed the tragic Elven Blood in her veins, and the Elves were second to none in terms of agility. \u00a0However, he was as fast as Latasha.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She would have never imagined the Immortal was this fast.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were only a handful of times the Immortal had personally entered a battle, so it wasn't surprising that Latasha had no idea about the capabilities of the Immortal. \u00a0She had heard countless stories about his notoriety, but she had only faced him twice before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This would be her third time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal used the split-second opening to strike Latasha's thigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ooh-oohk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn't a critical wound, but it was an effective blow that was enough to decide the outcome of the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shoo-shoohk, shahk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin's daggers danced as wounds opened up all over Latasha's body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, each daggers were embedded in her shoulders. \u00a0Her arms were sealed from moving.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah-ahk!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a last-ditch effort, she attempted a low kick. \u00a0Maybe it was because she couldn't control her strength, but her shin broke. \u00a0Her lower leg was hanging at a weird angle as she lost her balance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Son of a bitch! \u00a0I'll curse you even in my death!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin's smirked at Latasha's struggle. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's just forget about the past.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You want me to forget about my enmity against you for killing my family?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You caused harm to my subordinates too.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if Latasha had fought against the Immortal Army, how many could she have killed? \u00a0In the battle where she had face off against him, she was placed in the rearguard unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I destroyed the soulless Undeads. \u00a0How can you compare it to losing family...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Ah, I don't care. \u00a0They are precious to me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Despicable...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"We have enmity against each other, so let's just call it as being even.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He unsummoned the Warriors Weapon jammed into her shoulder. \u00a0More blood spilled out through her open wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin glanced behind him, and he saw the pale Melody. \u00a0Then there were the terrified village people that couldn't even meet his gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, shall I go out and help in earnest?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...you should be a little bit more merciful...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody started mumbling something as she looked at Woojin, but she gave up on it. \u00a0The three of them were still alive. \u00a0The only problem was the fact that they were in critical conditions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You take care of it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin got back on Shing Shing, and he summoned Jaenis and Dolsae.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Are we going to save Alphen yet!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he looked at Sunggoo, who was fighting a fierce battle with the Feris.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"It's about to start.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[....]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis' body flew into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I'll save you all from this dreadful life!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis' staff started to emit fire as it ruthlessly impacted on the incredible number of Vesics that were swarming towards them from distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Shall I gather the souls first?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin possessed Thrash's Protection. \u00a0Most of its abilities were sealed from being damaged.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were no limits on how many souls he could store inside his Soul Armor, so he welcomed the presence of the thousands of ingredients he would be able to use.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could also see the Dimensional lord Go-shoo-shoo, who was personally leading his army into the battle field.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Let's go, Dolsae.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Weeeeeng]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dolsae started to gather all the blood spilled on the Battlefield. \u00a0Since Bibi wasn't here, it would be hard to calm down the Blood Golem. \u00a0However, there was no better warning he could give to this world than the rampaging Blood Golem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin's... \u00a0No. \u00a0The Immortal's Undead Army had returned to Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The giant Cyclops Go-shoo-shoo was lying on the floor. \u00a0He was a bloody mess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"A bad egg has returned.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I know you missed me. \u00a0Isn't that right?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Koo-roo. \u00a0Choose your territory. \u00a0I won't encroach on it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had his axe rested on his shoulder, and he stood in front of the Cyclop's single eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What should I do?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What the hell are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I want to take possession of the whole planet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Go-shoo-shoo's big eye blinked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So you are aiming for the Alphen's Code?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin furrowed his eyebrows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What is this Code suppose to be?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Go-shoo-shoo's eye rolled as he looked over the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I see. \u00a0You don't know about it. \u00a0This is why you are uselessly helping the residents of this planet.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he he knew about it, he probably would have spent more effort on the Dimensional battles. \u00a0The Immortal's deeds were eccentric. \u00a0It was hard to see him as a Dimensional lord.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You could be a little bit more friendly by telling me what you are talking about. \u00a0Would that be a problem?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why should I do that?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin knitted his brows. \u00a0He brought down the axe in his hand with force.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-jeek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"If you plan on playing twenty questions, you can just fuck off.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The axe was embedded inside the Cyclop's head, and his body started to fade away into gray light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This is annoying.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe all the 72 thrones of Trahnet were gathered at Alphen for this Code. \u00a0The \u00a0Dimensional lords at Planet Jaku was comparably weak to the ones in Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin brushed off his hand, and he looked at Jaemin and Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Do you think you'll be able to do this?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, I don't see much differences from any previous tasks we had to do.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the location where Go-shoo-shoo had disappeared, and he looked at all the corpses of monsters filling up his surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"This bastard is on the level of being a small-fry. \u00a0Don't let your guard down too much.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, hyung-nim.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes, hyung.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Then you guys clear the surrounding. \u00a0If you see something useful, pick it up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yes sir!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When they moved away, Woojin absorbed all the souls floating around the surrounding. \u00a0Moreover...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kee-kee-keek!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several thousand Skeletons rose up once again, and they replenished his army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I have to gather all the Set Items as fast as I can.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he gathered the Set Items once again, he would able to maintain a much bigger army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin headed towards Melody.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had healed Tauric, Graham and Latasha. \u00a0Then she had healed the townspeople. \u00a0She was in the process of blessing them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since they had confirmed that her holy power wasn't fake, Tauric and his party looked at Woojin with dumbfounded expressions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why...why did you spare us?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"You want me to kill you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren't asking him to kill them. \u00a0They were just curious about the reasoning behind his actions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Why are you helping the coalition?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Well, is there some rule that says I can't?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal was strong, and he was still an asshole.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'll clean this up for you guys. \u00a0Just don't interfere with my work.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He'll hunt them all down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the very least, he wanted to return to Earth with Yong Yong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin ended the conversation by walking away. \u00a0Everyone gathered around Melody when he left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Is that person a hero, Holy Maiden?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She let out an awkward laugh at the child's question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...I'm not sure...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Latasha let out a low growl as she looked at the Immortal's back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I don't know what he is thinking. \u00a0I'm sure he will cause us harm in the end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I'm not sure about that.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Holy Maiden looked at Woojin with slightly saddened eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">'Even after hearing the oracle...'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had delivered Aria's words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Nevertheless, Woojin's behavior hadn't changed. He didn't show any reluctance in entering Alphen. \u00a0She didn't know his true intent, but it was true that she should be thankful towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody bowed her head towards his back.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

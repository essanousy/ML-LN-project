However, this was a long ways off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Basically, a Dimensional lord that had caused terror in this region was gone. \u00a0This was also the reason why the people that had escaped in every direction were able to gather here.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were over a thousand people here, who were sick and tired of being afraid and exhausted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"He is our hope. \u00a0This is the word of my goddess.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heroes still wasn't satisfied even after hearing Melody's appeal. \u00a0It didn't matter if her words were true. \u00a0They had too much enmity and feelings stacked against the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, they couldn't hide the fear and worry they had towards the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"I wonder if this is like chasing a Wyvern away to bring in a Dragon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"That's right. \u00a0Our future will still be very uncertain if we rely on him.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody's face darkened a little bit as she spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"The important part is that he is making a sacrifice for our sake.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh. \u00a0What sacrifice is the Immortal making for us?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While they continued this hopeless conversation, a Phantom Steed galloped towards them. \u00a0\u00a0When the Immortal got closer, the heroes unconsciously grabbed their weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were tense as their palms became sweaty just from the Immortal appearing. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Yo.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin jumped off Shing Shing, and he stood amongst them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What are you all doing?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin furrowed his brows. \u00a0They were either looking at each other or they looked at the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"What?

\u00a0Maybe he'll be able to find out a little bit about how the Dimensional lords think.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin discreetly threw a bait out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So do you have the Code?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Are you coveting the throne?

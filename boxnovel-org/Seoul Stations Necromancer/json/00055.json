He also had to drive Do-jiwon to Sahdahng, and it had tired him out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he had been really nervous about the passenger next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was none other than Kahng-woojin\u2019s woman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even Woo-soonghoon, who had a lot of experience dealing with pretty women, had never seen such a beautiful woman. He was in a constant state of nervousness as he shared the same space within the car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon massaged his sore shoulders. He took a shower then he opened a can of beer as he sat on his sofa.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah. Is there anything fun on tv?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he was flipping through the tv channel, he stopped when he saw the press conference held by Alandal and the Hwarang guild. Since it was his guild, it caught his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. They are trying to bite him like dogs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon saw the reporters ask a torrent of questions, and Woojin looked at the reporters indifferently. It made him feel a weird sense of incongruity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHis temper is really dirty\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even kings were cussed at when they weren\u2019t present. Soonghoon knew better than anyone that Woojin had a really bad temper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had set up the events to be considerate of Woojin. Woojin hadn\u2019t even thanked him. Instead, Soonghoon was given punishments\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAt this rate, isn\u2019t he going to flip out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was worried, but Soonghoon doubted Woojin would act that way in front of the camera. He had a bad temper, but he couldn\u2019t be that ignorant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon was drinking a single gulp of his beer, when Woojin stood up from his seat inside the screen. He became nervous in spite of himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe\u2026he\u2019s going to make an accident. He\u2019s like a crazy wild horse.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw Woojin\u2019s expression, he knew Woojin was in a really bad mood. Soonghoon was an experienced salesman with 8 years of experience, so he was quick to pick up such tells. With just one glance, he could understand what the other person was thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sure enough, Woojin kicked the president of the Hwarang, who had been tormented by grief.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWaaah. Fucking awesome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Before he knew it, Woo-soonghoon yelled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew his president was a crazy bastard, but he didn\u2019t realize the president would show his crazy side to the public.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWahh. Fuck. It\u2019s like the time when I was almost beaten.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His chest turned cold even when he thought about the it right now. He had sold a mere Galaxy to such a person. His cheeks still throbbed when he thought about that incident. Sweat ran down his back as he saw Woojin kick Lee-sahngho, who was trying to get up, again, . It automatically made Soonghoon feel some empathy towards Lee-sahngho.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWahh. Wah-ah\u2026 Wahh..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was too surprised and shocked. He couldn\u2019t think of anything to say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wahhh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A human can act like that. A person can live without not giving a fuck about what other people think.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was someone who lived by his temper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hweeek, Zzwahhk!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The camera audio picked up the sound. Soonghoon\u2019s body flinched when he heard the graphic slapping sound. He couldn\u2019t look away from the TV. Will Woojin make a bigger accident?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cM\u2026maybe this is already a big accident?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Korea\u2019s 3 great guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the guild master of Hwarang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hwarang guild\u2019s president was being held by the back of his neck, and he was being slapped. He was well aware of Woojin\u2019s personality, so it probably won\u2019t stop at one blow\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The wild gazelle meets a female as he attempts to mate.

Soonghoon blinked his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat..what the hell?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The urgent news had interrupted a drama, and now the programming changed into an animal documentary.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As expected, president\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI bet everyone is in an uproar right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wouldn\u2019t this be a hot issue maker?(TLN:trending story) Soonghoon took out his hand phone.

The search result expanded, then he clicked on the first video.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">BBS station\u2019s anchor was speaking, but he was speaking English. Soonghoon couldn\u2019t understand what was being said. Soon the video resolved into a very beautiful blonde woman stepping forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. It\u2019s an elf. An elf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought Do-jiwon was pretty, but this was\u2026 It was a beauty that made one doubt if it was real or not. It felt like he was seeing a CG. He felt a sense of dissonance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The more surprising thing was the people in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The elf woman made some kind of prayer towards the person in the wheelchair.

A man missing an arm stood in front of the elf woman. She prayed once more. The light swirled around the man, and his arm was regenerated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT\u2026this is crazy. Isn\u2019t this fake?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of opportunist Roused out there. They tried to sell medicine that was considered to be miraculous. Even the Regeneration Salve could regenerate a missing part of a body.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, there weren\u2019t any medicine or ability that could fix a congenital deformity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if the medicine existed, it was incredibly expensive. They were items one couldn\u2019t attain even if one had a lot of money.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This woman had the ability execute a miracle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The search ranking that was plastered with Kahng-wooin was replaced by the search words like Holy Maiden, Melody BBS, Miraculous Regeneration and Titan guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Miracle Maker.

She allowed a patient who had never walked before to stand on his two feet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The miracles were surprising, and a big crowd gathered at the Titan guild to wish for a miracle. There were numerous people from various nationality and class gathered there. However, they all weren\u2019t able to experience the miracle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was only for those who believed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was for those who wanted to become the servants of Aria.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the Holy Maiden Melody from the church of Aria displayed her miracles, she revealed the existence of the goddess Aria to Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the number of believers increased, voluntary offerings started to be given.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s pointless to stop her now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Titan guild master Deacon searched for Melody, so he could meet her.

Are you really going to agree to her request?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLook over there..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ath his secretary\u2019s words, Deacon pointed towards all the people worshipping the goddess Aria. Many people had converted to the church of Aria. The first step to receiving the Holy Maiden\u2019s miracle was to convert.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was only able to exhibit her powers to those who believed in her goddess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe already has followers\u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter if we like it or not. Our guild has to agree to the request if we want to continue our relationship.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The secretary agreed with Deacon\u2019s resigned words, so he shut his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe need her precognition ability.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was right. Her foresight allowed the Titan to possess five 5 star Dungeons, and two 6 star Dungeons in just one week.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, she had requested only one thing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Aria\u2019s Holy Knight Order.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t there already a lot of volunteers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is why I am worried, master.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He understood why the secretary was worried. Within the Titan guild, there was a significant number of Roused who had joined in worshiping the goddess Aria. There were those who had been surprised by her miracle, and many of their family had received benefits from her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe have no choice. Since we can\u2019t stop it, we have to make the best use of her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Deacon spoke in a sour manner. He felt bitter inside since it felt like his leadership role had been passed on to her. He had no choice, but to minimize the damage. He had to look for a way to gain something out of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, she was the greatest Roused in existence right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She had the ability of an SS Rank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLee-hyunhwee tried to kill me.

Ask this bastard who is trying to assassinate me from behind the scenes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin voice thundered towards the reporters, then he left the press conference. The reporters were busy with activity, and Lee-sahngho was lying idle on the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No one asked any questions, and no one spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Silence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin left after he threw a grenade. After receiving the grenade, Lee-sahngho, who was lying still on the floor, suddenly got up. His face was swollen, and he looked ridiculous.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Fuck.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His brutish behavior didn\u2019t have a limit. He would have never guess Woojin was this stubborn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. What do you think happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you think! He probably made that shit up!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho gave an angry reply as he left the press conference room. Shit. There was a limit to how embarrassed he could be. Lee-sahngho asked a question towards the Hwarang guild members following him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKooh-ook. Twehh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He dirtied the clean hotel hall by spitting a loogey mixed with blood. The inside of his mouth was numb, and he couldn\u2019t feel anything. His vision was fuzzy. It seemed a blood vessel had burst in his eye.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFuck. How many times did he hit me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was ridiculous. Lee-sahngho had fainted mid-way. He was a Rank B Physical type Roused yet he had fainted from being slapped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe hit you s\u2026seven times..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho let out a string of cuss words. Brute asshole. Crazy bitch. Even if he attributed all the cuss words to Woojin, it wasn\u2019t enough.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cReady my car. Gather all the lawyers at the headquarters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho used the back door of the hotel to slip out quietly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou were too harsh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is a massive incident now. The public sentiments will be up in arms against you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Jung-michan\u2019s words, Woojin stopped walking. Woojin looked straight at Jung-minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Minchan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t think of Woojin as someone younger than him. Kahng-woojin looked larger than life to Jung-minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThose bastards were trying corner me. They were trying to paint me as a murderer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut it isn\u2019t the truth, right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was so surprised that he could only blink his eyes. Haemin and Sungoo had been trailing behind. Even their faces froze.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe tried to kill me, so I killed her. I was stronger. Is that going to be a problem?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, it\u2019ll be a problem. How could it not be? Still, Minchan didn\u2019t know how he should answer that question. If someone tried to kill him, wouldn\u2019t it be more strange to let the person kill him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you know what the schemers ,who plot in the background, fear the most?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is making a big mess out in the open.

He won\u2019t be able to easily conspire from behind the scene.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was about to give a retort to Kahng-woojin\u2019s words, but he stopped himself from speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What would be the result of this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The narrative would change from \u2018Why couldn\u2019t Kahng-woojin prevent Lee-yunhwee\u2019s death?\u2019 to \u2018Was Hwarang really behind the assassination attempt of Kahng-woojin?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There weren\u2019t any evidence. It was something that had happened within the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He thought Woojin had acted without thinking through the ramification, but it seemed Woojin had made some plans of his own. Jung-minchan\u2019s face was filled with admiration as he looked at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIndeed, you are the president. So how are you planning to pick up the pieces?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin shrugged his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s your job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He acted without a plan! This asshole of a president.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you think your salary is insufficient, then increase it..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Woojin still had a conscience.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKmmmm. I\u2019m going to go to the Dungeon, so you pick up the pieces. Let\u2019s see Director Jung\u2019s skills. Let\u2019s go Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was basically doing a hit and run after a major accident.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin put his hand on the devastated Jung-minchan\u2019s shoulder. An indescribable sense of kinship was formed, and their wet eyes met.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-wooin and Sungoo exited the hotel, but they weren\u2019t able to go straight to the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWahh. It\u2019s Kahng-woojin!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The road in front of the hotel was filled with people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One could see such a large crowd at a fan signing event for a famous celebrity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters who weren\u2019t invited to the press conference was busily pressing the shutters to their cameras.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why is there so many people gathered here in the middle of the night? When Kahng-woojin took a step, the people made way for him. He was such an amazing Roused that the people watched from the surrounding as they didn\u2019t dare to approach him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their eyes were filled with a mixture of thankfulness, happiness, and novelty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.

Now they were all here to express their thanks to Kahng-woojin. They hadn\u2019t gathered here to see a celebrity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They came to see their benefactor, who had protected their home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had been able to level up by monopolizing the EXP to himself. Moreover, he had protected these people\u2019s home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every step Kahng-woojin took the crowd parted to make way for him. Hong-sunggoo, who was following Woojin, was choked up with emotion. His chest automatically puffed out in pride.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAhjushi. Thank you very much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A small child ran out from middle of the crowd, and she pushed out a bouquet of flower towards Woojin.

rubble.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ooh-oong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Their bodies shook every time the swords clashed. \u00a0The aftershock was considerable, so an endless amount of dust rose into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fierce battle continued. \u00a0Neither the monsters nor the Undead army was able to approach the two.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In contrast, the Undead army was slowly gaining the upperhand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a free for all where the allies and enemies were jumbled together, but this was the type of battle most favored by the Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several Death Knights, who could spare the time, hovered near the battle occurring between Kahng-woojin and Iello. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Should we help him?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It is our King\u2019s battle.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an enormous Death Knight with large tusks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiba just watched as Kahng-woojin fought in a fierce battle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was the supreme commander of the Undead army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was a Necromancer, yet he was about to enter into a realm of being a true Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His king was about to take a step forward in this fight, so Kiba couldn\u2019t interrupt the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Let us clear the surrounding, so we can watch our King\u2019s fight.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Let us do that.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Kiba\u2019s words, the group of Death Knights near him marched forward with their subordinate Skeleton Warriors to clean up the surrounding.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koo-ah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A being impacted on the wall of an enormous building, and it rolled as it took down the building.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This is my sixth.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The enormous teeth had chewed and spat out its sixth Dimensional lord. \u00a0The Blood Dragon let out a roar. \u00a0It raised its head to look for the mad magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The being was letting out a too dangerous of an atmosphere to be called a human.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwah-kwah-kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hell Flame Dragon Hydra had taken shape as if it was a flower blooming. \u00a0It raised all of its head. \u00a0It let out streams of flame as it made the surrounding into a sea of flame.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During the conflagration, Dread had become a grilled octopus. \u00a0The Skeleton with the red eyes stepped on Dread as he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[This one is my seventh.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hoong.]</span></p><br/><p><span

can do by running amok.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a bet against a large lizard, who had lost its Dragon\u2019s Breath. \u00a0If Jaenis lost, his pride as a Lich would suffer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Bloom.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the Lich swept his hand towards the fallen buildings, the heads of the Hydra appeared as they roared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019ll show you all hell.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hellfire was emitted from the Hell Dragons. \u00a0Seoul started to resemble the depths of hell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Accompanying an explosion, Iello pulled away as he glared at Woojin. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corner of Woojin\u2019s mouth lifted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are better than I imagined.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

gave a response.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy do you keep speaking as if we are acquaintances?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span

style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes narrowed further as he glared at Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had always been called the Immortal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How many Dimensional lords actually knew his name?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s name was extremely famous on earth. \u00a0However, there was a sense of dissonance when his name was spoken by Iello.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It gave credence to his words\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou exist in this world to hand over the key to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThrash\u2019s Executioner?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are well informed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The corner of Iello\u2019s mouth lifted into a smirk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwah-cha-chahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The ice sword had become small as ice was chipped away. \u00a0However, it grew back to become a large sword again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is time for you to die now for earth..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello\u2019s sword came up in a flash, and it aimed for Woojin\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His Warrior\u2019s Weapon deflected the strike, but Woojin\u2019s expression was much more complicated than before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sure about one thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin opened his mouth as if he was trying to chase away the thoughts cluttering his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kah-ahng\uff0ckahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The two swords had crashed into each other three times already, and they were about to repeat the process.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are going to die by my hands.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoong. You\u2019ve already reached your limit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello had poured everything into this venture to kill Kahng-woojin. \u00a0Time and preparation was on his side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No simulation predicted his loss. \u00a0The Authority would be transferred to him when he killed Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was all for saving earth and all the Dimensions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah-ahp!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello\u2019s sword was aimed at Kahng-woojin again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was within a cage made out of glass.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler was frustrated. \u00a0He would lose his mind if he didn\u2019t cuss out loud.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Council was ignorant. \u00a0They didn\u2019t realize how important this change of events was. \u00a0They were excessive in their zeal to walk the proven path. \u00a0They continuously revised the errors, yet they kept repeating the same path endlessly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn\u2019t it time for them to step forward now?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How long will they restrain themselves before reaching out for the light of hope? </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler wanted to reach it before his life ran out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was why he had met Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had talked to the Seed of the God of Destruction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Weeeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The frosted side of the glass brightened before it became transparent. \u00a0When the glass cleared, Speaker Shelt was standing on the other side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late to stop the Leone\u2019s ship, Shelt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHah-ah, Toppler. \u00a0It isn\u2019t as if I don't acknowledge your ability. \u00a0However, we have to be a bit more careful in this endeavor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe can still survive two or three more Resets.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBefore that happens, we\u2019ll die from natural causes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an undeniable truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler and Shelt was already old.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt isn\u2019t as if we can\u2019t do it. \u00a0You just don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease watch your tongue.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shelt\u2019s face immediately turned ugly at Toppler\u2019s attempt to get a rise. \u00a0As if to reply with his own expression, Toppler\u2019s expression turned fierce.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve already reported this several dozen times. Don\u2019t we have to accept our failures and try something different?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOur plan wasn\u2019t a failure. \u00a0It\u2019s just incomplete.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Huh\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler felt devastated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had awakened the Recovery Admin, and they had tried to normalize the system.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They tried hard to regain their lost home planet, yet they kept failing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They kept going back to the starting point, but they had continued to follow the same path they had traversed before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While they were doing this, the Moon World\u2019s time continued to flow. \u00a0Now there were only old people left in charge, and they were too afraid of making changes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Reset had restarted the events, but the time on the Moon World had never stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour theory has too much risk involved.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is worth trying it out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou want to bet the future of the Moon World on your imagination?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe mechanism maintaining our lives are failing. \u00a0Is that really a path to our future?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler restlessly walked back and forth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was surrounded on all sides by glass. \u00a0There was a wall across the glass, and empty space was beyond that\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They lived on the moon, yet they hadn\u2019t been able to colonize it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were just the new lives that had continued the existence of their race.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease think about the children and our descendents. \u00a0Please discuss the option of carrying out my prepared plan with the council.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe need both of them. \u00a0In the first place, the Deletion Admin and the Recovery Admin has to be summoned at the same time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen we are already too late. \u00a0The two of them has already started their fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The former had lost his memory, and the latter had only retained partial memory. \u00a0The relationship between the two was already antagonistic, so if both were summoned, it would lead to destruction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t up for debate as to who they\u2019ll choose and who they\u2019ll throw away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zeeeng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shelt glanced backwards. \u00a0When the door opened, a soldier entered. \u00a0Shelt once again looked at Toppler.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems the result is already out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler let out a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There must be a reason why two beings each held different keys. \u00a0Now one had died, and the other would hold two keys.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat is\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldier had come searching for Speaker Shelt, since he had to give his report. \u00a0The soldier spoke with a dark expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe outcome was decided before Leone\u2019s ship could arrive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo who won?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The blades made out of ice flew in all directions, and they left sharp marks behind. \u00a0A good number of blades flew towards Woojin. \u00a0His Soul Barrier formed automatically, and he received no wounds.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-too-too-toohng.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, each ice particle sent towards him consumed a soul. \u00a0The soul disappeared after doing its role.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve reached my limit?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe the bastard\u2019s words were right. \u00a0\u00a0No, the bastard was aiming for this result. \u00a0He was able to store unlimited amount of souls thanks to the Thrash\u2019s Protection. \u00a0However, the souls were being consumed each time to form a small barrier, and he was reaching an end to his reserves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he didn\u2019t have any souls, it would cause problems in creating barriers. \u00a0However, the bigger problem would be his inability to recover his magical energy in a short amount of time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Undead army was incredibly powerful, but all their magical energy came from the Necromancer. \u00a0It came from Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His driving for all things was the souls he collected. \u00a0It was his source of energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Too-too-toong, pshhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A sharp shard of ice went past the souls, which had been blocking all the fragments. \u00a0It slid by Woojin\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello smiled when he was able to wound Woojin for the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahhhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All the fragments of ice that had pieced together to form a saw-like blade fell away. \u00a0A long ice spear made its apppearance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello gripped it as he charged towards Kahng-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is the end for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had consumed all his souls, yet he was unbelievably calm. \u00a0For a brief moment, Iello flinched. \u00a0He had almost been convinced that Kahng-woojin had a hidden card he hadn\u2019t used.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Koong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin raised his great sword to block the Ice Spear, and his body slid backwards. \u00a0He had used up all his magical energy, so he was akin to a common Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are bluffing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwahng, kwahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was busy focusing on his defense. \u00a0He was being pushed backwards by the constant attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What a tenacious bastard..\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin looked as he was about fall over, yet he resisted. \u00a0Iello pushed forward as he clicked his tongue. \u00a0How many years of preparation and Points did he have to waste to catch this single human?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin was able to command the dead, and the ability to use souls was almost a cheat ability. \u00a0Iello had just peeled away the many shell around Kahng-woojin, but he had to use most of his Points gained from being the 25th Throne.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-oohk, hoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he saw Woojin take ragged breathes for being exhausted, Iello reformed his broken ice spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Zzuh-juh-juhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is really the end for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a bluff. \u00a0The bastard\u2019s magical energy and stamina should be close to zero. \u00a0There was only one problem that troubled Iello. \u00a0The corner of the bastard\u2019s mouth had be steadily lifting as the fight progressed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhk!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello was executing his final charge when he caught sight of a broad smile on Kahng-woojin\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNinety-nine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u3008Level Up!\u3009</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-paht.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, his nearly non-existent magical energy and stamina was restored. \u00a0He felt his weakened and damaged Warrior\u2019s Weapon recover its durability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hooooong!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Warrior\u2019s Weapon changed into an axe. \u00a0It split Iello, who was charging with his spear, in half.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-ahng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The bastard\u2019s body was made out of ice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The exploding fragments of ice impacted on Woojin\u2019s body, but he endured it by gritting hsi teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had activated his basic barrier using his magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour resistance is useless.\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The broken body of Iello was knitting back together. \u00a0He regenerated as if nothing had happened to him. \u00a0Iello had consumed a massive amount of Points, but he didn\u2019t particularly care.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, instead of distancing himself from Iello, Kahng-woojin grabbed Iello\u2019s body after he flung his Warrior\u2019s Weapon onto the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello was a Iceman with no heart. \u00a0He didn\u2019t possess any vital spots.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How do you kill a bastard of his constitution?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin had racked his brain, but he could only come up with a single method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a troublesome Power that could only be used if he consumed most of his magical energy in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is your Punishment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Shwahhhnk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The glove touching Iello\u2019s body was dyed black.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a Punishment that allowed Woojin to destroy an opponent\u2019s soul by burning all his magical energy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGgoo-ah-ahk\uff01\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Iello was caught by the black glove, and his body started to melt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho won?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT....the Deletion Admin won.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was unprecedented.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A change that had never happened before had occurred, and Shelt\u2019s face stiffened. \u00a0The inside of his head was white like a blank piece of paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Naturally, his head turned towards Toppler. \u00a0Toppler also had a dumbfounded expression on his face as if he had been hit in the face by a hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Toppler had wanted both of them to survive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since one of them had died, his plan was already dead.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cProfessor! \u00a0In the end, you screwed up everything.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Shelt\u2019s angry scolding, Dr. Toppler raised his \u00a0head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"\u2026\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span

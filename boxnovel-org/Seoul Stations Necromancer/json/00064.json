As soon as she saw saw him, she got on her knees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Why are you being like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease heed my request.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEven if it is one hour, could you not rest for a little bit before you go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every time he came out of the Dungeon Lieutenant Haesol tried to grab him. However, she clung to him more desperately today.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. I told you I\u2019m fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe political climate right now isn\u2019t good. Please think about your home country and rest a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What nonsense is she talking about? When Woojin tilted his head in confusion, Haesol looked around her surrounding, then she approached Woojin to speak into his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNorth Korea wants to extensively advertise this successful Dungeon raid. South Korea wants to package it as a North &amp; South joint operation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen just go with that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a \u201cSo what?\u201d expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease come with me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to return to the Dungeon. You take care of the politics..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol had an almost tearful expression on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The most important person in these proceedings wasn\u2019t showing his face at all. Couldn\u2019t he at least take couple pictures with the others?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin decided to be considerate of Che-haesol\u2019s situation, so he decided to vacate one hour of his schedule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez. This is quite tiresome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Memorial Palace became busy when they heard Woojin was coming.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The high ranking North Korean officials and the negotiation team from South Korea all gathered at the banquet hall. Several of them had dissatisfied expression on their faces since they had been waiting on Woojin for 2 weeks. However, it didn\u2019t both Woojin one bit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">All kinds of delicacies were prepared in a grand fashion in the banquet hall. Woojin ate some food, then he stood with Kim-jungun and the representative of the South Korean negotiation team. The three of them took pictures.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease smile a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the reporter\u2019s request, Woojin made an exaggerated smile. The high ranking officials North Korean officials were displeased when they saw this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m really busy, so let\u2019s wrap this up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to leave when a Major stopped him. He was a bodyguard affiliated with the Security Department.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cComrade. Please sign your name on here for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin stared blankly at the white paper handed to him by the guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are the greatest Roused in South Korea. It would be an honor to receive a signature from you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was wondering what you wanted.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned, then he signed his name on the paper.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGood luck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you, comrade.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the guard received his signature, he let out a sigh of relief. The guard even secretly looked towards Kim-jungun to give him a wink.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin felt something was off, so he summoned Ggaebi.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Ggaebi. Do you see that pig over there?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I see him, master.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Try latching on to him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Koo-kook. Finally, my first mission on earth.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He felt Ggaebi exit his shadow. Ggaebi secretly slipped into Kim-jungun\u2019s shadow. When Ggaebi entered inside Kim-jungun\u2019s shadow, he would able to share in the experience of the host\u2019s movements, and feelings.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, when he returned to Woojin, Woojin would be able to experience what Ggaebi experienced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had only 1 more day left to use the Dungeon. If he wanted to gain a little bit more Achievement Points, he would have to move more diligently.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A man with sharp features was eyeing Woojin as he disappeared from the banquet hall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Republic\u2019s Supernatural Force Commander Ri-pyunggahn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Another man approached him, and he quietly whispered to Ri-pyunggahn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCommander. We are ready. Are you sure about this? Do you really want to take him head on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCarry it out with the utmost stealth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the man he ordered disappeared, he let out a twisted laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat bastard dared to look down on the Republic.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A mere Roused from South Korea was being pushy inside the heart of North Korea. He was extremely unhappy about it. It also bothered him that Woojin put on a dignified appearance, and he didn\u2019t show any deference towards the chairman.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The chairman admired the Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had established North Korea\u2019s Supernatural special forces, and Ri-pyunggahn was named the commander of this force. Their Roused population was small, so whenever the high rank Dungeon reset, they had to receive help from China. Their loss was quite substantial.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">China was mining gold in their front yard, yet they couldn\u2019t prevent them from doing so. To clear this 6 star Dungeon, they had sent in a team of Roused they had ambitiously cultivated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There had been 2 A Rank and 8 B Rank.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This group represented almost half of the high ranked Roused of North Korea. The Republic even gave them their only two Return Portal, yet the whole team was wiped out. No one knew what had happened to them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since they died before being able to use the Return Portal, they didn\u2019t have any information on the Dungeon. Moreover, they had lost the Roused they had cultivated with much difficulty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In a flash, the confidence in the Supernatural special forces was lost, and commander Ri-pyunggahn\u2019s position was also shaken.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">With only the North Korean forces, they weren\u2019t even able to clear the 6 star Dungeon. Moreover, they still had to worry about the Dungeon Break. China ignored North Korea, and the other nations of the world also ignored them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the end, a pompous Roused from South Korea had come to raid the Dungeon. Ri-pyunggahn had snorted at the time. However, Woojin had cleared the Dungeon in 3 days, and he experienced a sense of crisis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He knew the chairman was trying to appease the Roused named Kahng-woojin. If he joined the Republic, then his post as commander of the Supernatural Forces would immediately be in danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon had already been cleared, and the negotiation on how they would divvy up the Dungeon had been resolved. North Korea still had 2 Rank A Roused and several dozen skilled Rank B Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The first clear was difficult, but the subsequent raids significantly decreased in difficulty. Moreover, they had been able to learn a significant amount of information about Dungeon from the negotiation talks.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018That son of a bitch.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since the hunt was done, it was time to put down the hunting dog.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was able to solo the Dungeon by himself, but in the end he was still a human. If a Roused got shot or blown up then death was inevitable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If it happened inside the Dungeon, then there wouldn\u2019t be any evidence. Before one clears the Dungeon of monster to use the portal, one could still use items from earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He will become the fertilizer for the growth of our strong and prosperous country.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everything he did was to make his country strong and prosperous. The chairman had a brief lapse in judgement. This was for his comrade. Ri-pyunggahn looked towards Kim-jungun, with eyes filled with ambition.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked past the soldiers still seriously guarding the Dungeon, and he headed towards the Dungeon entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are going back in again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis will probably be your last run. We wish you good luck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soldiers opened a path for him as he headed toward the Dungeon entrance. He just needed to work hard for 1 more day. No. He just needed to work hard for 4 days inside the Dungeon then he\u2019ll be able to go back home.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin entered the Dungeon with a light heart. Right before the barrier could form, another person jumped into the Dungeon. The soldiers weren\u2019t surprised by the extra person, who had entered.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe was able to enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had entered before the barrier could form.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the barrier dissipated, it either meant one cleared the Dungeon, or all the people who went into the Dungeon had died.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This time they were hoping for the latter situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell done, comrade Nahm-josun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A single soldier departed to make a report on the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they didn\u2019t see one foreign reporter taking pictures of these events from afar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Four hours had passed since Kahng-woojin had entered the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ri-pyunggahn was worried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid we fail?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The agent, who had followed behind Woojin, was a Rank C Roused of the Supernatural Forces. The man\u2019s loyalty to the Republic was extraordinary. He had strapped bombs on his entire body, and he had entered the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was a plan where his life was forfeit from the start.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as he entered the Dungeon, he was supposed to hug Kahng-woojin and blow himself up. Even if he wasn\u2019t able to grab Woojin, it didn\u2019t matter. The entrance of the subway station was narrow, so an explosion from a short distance would be just as deadly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So why hadn\u2019t the barrier disappeared yet?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he came back alive\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ri-pyunggahn felt irritated just from thinking about it. He had sent in enough explosives to blow up an entire building. How likely was it that Woojin would come back out alive?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Even if he wasn\u2019t killed, he would have received a critical wound. He\u2019s probably on his last breath. He probably received a critical wound, so how will he be able to find and use the Return Stone?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused had abilities well beyond the imagination of humans. Kahng-woojin must had some trick up his sleeves to be still alive. However, he was sure Woojin had received a critical wound.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One needed a Return Stone to break through the barrier.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if he was alive, his life would probably end at any moment. He felt frustrated since he had no idea what was going on inside the Dungeon. However, Lee-pyunggahn kept his hope alive as he waited for Woojin to die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been over 2 days and 1 hour since Kahng-woojin had entered the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSomething is wrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Lieutenant Che-haesol\u2019s words, the leader of the negotiation group, General Lee-soonchae, replied in a gruff manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf we take into account of Mr. Kahng-woojin\u2019s personality, he wouldn\u2019t attempt something he wouldn\u2019t be able to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSomething must have gone awry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soonchae\u2019s voice was filled with strained emotions. It had been over 2 days since Woojin had entered the Dungeon. He was given 15 days to use the Dungeon for himself, yet an extra day had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The South had agreed to pay for cost of Woojin staying for an extra day, so Lee-soonchae couldn\u2019t help but feel worried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWoojin\u2019s last clear time was 1 day and 17 hours. Normally, he should be out by now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUghh. So what else do you want to say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t we have to launch an investigation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you realize where we are? What can we do over here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was Pyungyang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were dozens to hundred eyes watching them in secret. What could a mere dozen people making up the negotiation group do in this situation?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease look at this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol had received a photo from one of the foreign reporters. She held it out. It was a picture of an unknown man following Woojin into the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-soonchae\u2019s expression turned serious when he saw the photo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen did you obtain this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI received it around 30 minutes ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Che-haesol obtained the photo, she came to report with a worried heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll have to investigate immediately. We\u2019ll have to make a formal complaint towards North Korea.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Che-haesol\u2019s agitation, Lee-soonchae coldly berated her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If someone had hatched a scheme, then it would be North Korea\u2019s doing. Still, how could they lodge a complain against them? Should they ask them to just reveal their plots?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It would be like throwing oil onto a fire. This was the heart of North Korea. When they turned their backs for a moment, it would basically be like jumping into a tiger\u2019s maw.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s just observe for now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they hatched a plan to kill Kahng-woojin, they were basically handing the negotiation team a huge bargaining chip.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if they were going to lodge a complaint, they would have to do it after they return to South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They would handle it through diplomacy\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Only Che-haesol had a face full of anxiety and concern.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been over 2 days and 18 hour since Kahng-woojin had entered the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun saw the news article on the tablet, and he vented his anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was an article from a French news agency. It was a picture of an unknown man slipping into the Dungeon entrance after Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho is this bastard?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are trying to find that out right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and find out about it. Tell me who this mother fucker is right now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs you command.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun\u2019s face became red. His ample chin fat trembled. South Korea\u2019s greatest Roused might die this day. No matter how he thought about it, he would come out at a loss. He had to find the bastards who hatched this plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was always the excessively loyal bastards who gave him the most problems.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDamn bastards!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-jungun brought his fist down. His gaze landed on the white piece of paper inside the framed picture. It was the paper with Kahng-woojin\u2019s signature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been over 3 days and 5 hour since Kahng-woojin had entered the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? It\u2019s disappearing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The barrier was disappearing. Whether Woojin came out alive, or died as the Dungeon reset, this would be big news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The foreign reporters pressed their camera shutters busily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A foreign reporter had photographed an unknown man entering the Dungeon, so it had been shown in the news. It caused the atmosphere inside North Korea to turn serious. The activities of the officers in the North Korean army started to pick up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lieutenant Che-haesol from South Korea stood in front of the Dungeon everyday for all hours except when she had to sleep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was it because she had wanted to hear it? She heard footfall coming up the stairs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tuk, tuk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each step was deliberate and slow. As he reached the top of the stairs, she saw his face and hair.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were wounds all over his body, and his face had wounds as if his skin had been scraped off. His face was blotchy, and his skin didn\u2019t look too good.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Woojin ascended the stairs, he looked around his surrounding. Numerous gazes were fixed on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, who had a blank expression, twisted his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to applied a lot of Regeneration Salve. His face and body was still recovering, but he didn\u2019t care about that. The wounds on his body would heal completely in couple days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The problem was the dirty feeling he felt. His chest was filled with so much rage that it was stifling him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The twisted laugh that came out of Woojin stopped, and the smile on his face disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you all want to die? Is that what you wish?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked around his surrounding with heartless eyes.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

At the very least, I\u2019ll be releasing two regular chapters(it\u2019ll depend on each week) + any sponsored chapters. The two regular chapter this week is LoL &amp; DMW. Next week will be Elqueeness &amp; Seoul Station\u2019s Necromancer. I\u2019ll alternate each week.

Is this for real?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was taken aback, and he hurriedly opened his Status Window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level : 1</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Name : Gang-woojin</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Class : Necromancer(Advanced)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Grade : Middle Rank</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Achievement : 4</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic Point : 0/0 Energy : 0/0</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Stat&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strength : 15 Speed : 13 Health : 17 Wisdom : 15</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic : 0 Vitality : 0 Recovery : 0 Healing 0 Control : 0</span></p><br/><p>Undistributed Points : 99</p><br/><p>&lt;Skill&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Combination Box Summoning(lv 1)(Advanced Skill)(Impossible to add points)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Use of Achievement Shop(lv 1)(Advanced Skill)(Impossible to add points)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Undistributed Points : 99</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Status Window differed greatly from the time he was first summoned to the Planet Alphen. He felt confused. However, he was able to realize the implications soon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, it hadn\u2019t disappeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had thought all of his powers he had accumulated on Alphen had disappeared in the process of returning to earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Advanced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the words indicated, his full level character had become level 1. However, he had received several benefits. At a glance, he had receive two advanced skills. His stat points and skill point was the equivalent to the level he had been before the advancement.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlso, my class is the same. It\u2019s Necromancer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had achieved everything he could as a necromancer. He had also controlled and used the Undead, which was known to be the ultimate existence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This wasn\u2019t a bad thing at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Seoul seems to have changed in a weird way. He didn\u2019t know what will happen in the future, so it wasn\u2019t a bad thing to have power. He couldn\u2019t see far into the future, but he needed the power to safely escape this dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he leveled up, Woojin felt relieved. Also, there was a margin for error for him now. He had recovered the power he thought he had lost. He had less mental fatigue when thinking about how to prepare for the danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t want the monsters to mob him after smelling the blood, so he retraced his steps. As soon as he returned to the pathway where the damaged stores were lined up, he started looking at the newly formed Advanced Skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could combine various ingredients to receive a new item. He might be able to put in items to extract a key ingredient.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow do I use this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a skill he had never seen before, so he didn\u2019t have the faintest idea on how to use it. He tried speaking the activation word, and he searched for various methods. Eventually he was able to find the Inventory.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a Combination Box located on the lower half of the Inventory. He tried to touch it, and as if another Inventory was opening up, there were buttons on the bottom.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Combine] and [Extract].</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet, the Inventory Expansion returned to it original state.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Inventory had only 3 columns of space. As one\u2019s level increases, the Inventory expands. However, it seemed like it didn\u2019t receive any Advancement Benefits, so he was disappointed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, the most disappointing part was the items he had accumulated before had all disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin touched the other Advanced Skill called Achievement Shop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He tried various method, but he was able activate the Achievement Shop through an activation word. He repeated saying the activation word, and he found out it was possible to open the Shop without saying anything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Shop was lined up with Skill Books, Equipments and Consumable Items. He needed a large sum of Achievement Points to purchase them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Alphen Planent didn\u2019t have an Achievement Shop. This was akin to internet shopping where he didn\u2019t have to go to a location to purchase the items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere aren\u2019t anything I want to buy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The equipments he could buy was low-grade. The thing he needed the most right now is a Skill. Even the lowest skill required 10 achievement points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin eventually chose three skills.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Search], [Detect], [Skeleton Soldier Summon]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Each of the skills required 10 achievement points. He decided to get Search to help find items in his surrounding. He needed the skill to find the Return Stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Detect was a passive skill. It would accurately alert him of danger in advance. It was an essential skill in helping him survive.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Soldier Summon was one of the basic skills of a Necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Whether it was the effect of the Advancement or maybe it was the fact that his class was automatically selected, there were constraints in which skills he could learn. He was able to learn common Magic Skills and weapon skills, but he could only learn the Class Skills of a Necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I should worry too much about it right now. I\u2019m short on points any ways.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He looked at the 4 points he had accumulated, so the method was clear. One Drabbit gave 1 point. He\u2019ll be able to purchase one Skill if he defeat 6 more Drabbits.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He immediately needed his fighting capabilities. It would allow him to defeat the monsters safely. It was a problem he could solve without purchasing a Skill.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Stat&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Strength : 30 Speed : 30 Health : 30 Wisdom : 30</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic: 10 Vitality : 0 Recovery : 10 Healing 10 Control : 9</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Undistributed Points : 0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin distributed his points. He swung the hammer as he looked at the updated Stat Window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Boo-oong. Boong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A destructive sound that couldn\u2019t be compare to before emanated. He moved his body a little bit, and his body was lighter than before. Moreover, his reaction speed couldn\u2019t be compared to before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He possessed 10 times the capability of a normal human. Woojin had 3 times the strength of a normal adult male. He was also 3 times faster, and his stamina was 3 times better.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m 3 times smarter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His ability to memorize and calculate had definitely improved. It felt like his brain worked faster. However, the difference in his body movements were much more noticeable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk, let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had to defeat 6 Drabbits. He had to acquire the Search Skill. He\u2019ll find the Return Stone, then he\u2019ll escape the dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin headed back downward as he held onto to his clawed hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa, there are so many of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the Planet Alphen, there were so many Drabbits that one might trip over them. It basically meant they were easy to find, and they were very easy to defeat. However, he felt fatigued after facing them continuously in the narrow pathway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took in a ragged breath.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As soon as he went down the stairs, he had methodically defeated the Drabbits he faced. He was able to steadily accumulate his Achievement Points. He had defeated 27 Drabbits as he traveled through the dark passageway.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to purchase the essential Search and Detect skills with his Achievement Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the same time as he purchased them, the Skill Books appeared in his Inventory, and he learned them immediately.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It consumed one Magic Point every time he used it. He tried using the Search Skill, but he didn\u2019t see any items that could be called a Return Stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had traveled the same passageway, and he failed to find the Return Stone. There was only one place left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo I have to go down there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin hid himself behind the handrail as he glanced down the stairs. It was inner part of the station where the wrecked subway was located at.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At a glance, he could see over 20 Drabbits milling about. It was possible for him to face 3-4 Drabbits in a tight passageway, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to face over 20 Drabbits in a large open space. If he became surrounded by them, then he\u2019ll inevitably be hurt.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. It really isn\u2019t in my personality to move around on my own.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked as he looked at the clawed hammer, which was stained with Drabbit\u2019s blood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He opened the Achievement Shop, then he purchased the [Skeleton Soldier Summon] Skill Book with his remaining points.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

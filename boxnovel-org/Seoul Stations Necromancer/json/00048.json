The building next to the Management Bureau was the headquarters for the Special Defense Brigade. They were a branch of the Ministry of National Defense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Soonghoon stopped his car in front of the headquarters, a soldier was waiting in the front for them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. I am Lieutenant Che-haesol of the Special Defense Brigade\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPleased to meet you. My name is Kang-woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After greeting Woojin, Che-haesol looked towards Woo-soonghoon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI will be the one guiding you now. Your companion may return.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, president.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin followed after Che-haesol, and he was guided into the headquarters. The Special Defense Brigade was an army unit, but they didn\u2019t seem too stiff. The passerbys wore military uniforms, but it felt like he had stepped into a normal company.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo, do I have to go greet the general?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. After handling several administrative businesses, we will leave immediately. We don\u2019t have a lot of time, so I\u2019ll brief you on the go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSure. Whatever.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was led by Lieutenant Che-haesol, and he had to take several tests. They checked his eyesight, and his blood was drawn.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had to make several demonstrations of his abilities, and he also gave descriptions of his abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol smiled as she spoke to Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Woojin is quite unusual.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIn what way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNormally, Roused don\u2019t like their blood drawn. They also avoid talking about their own abilities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs that so? Wouldn\u2019t you have to know what my abilities are to make plans for the joint operation?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn\u2019t it a standard procedure to find out the allied force\u2019s power?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI would like it if all Roused thought like Mr. Woojin..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If the Roused cooperated without a fuss, then how great would it be? The army had a very difficult time handling the existences called the Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll be moving now. I will also guide you to Daegoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tilted his head in confusion when he saw the offical vehicle on standby inside the parking lot.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre we going by car?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. We mobilize by car.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t there going to be a Dungeon Break? Aren\u2019t we in a hurry?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin thought he would be riding a helicopter. However, he was going by car, so he couldn\u2019t help but wonder. Haesol laughed as she opened the door to the back seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTo be precise, the Dungeon Break will happen 2 in the afternoon. I\u2019ll give you the details when we are on the move.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took his seat and Lieutenant Che-haesol sat next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s depart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the driver started up the car, Che-haesol started explaining the operation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll the locals have been evacuated 2 days ago. The inspection for the last stragglers will end today. The Break will happen tomorrow at 2:11 pm. The most common monster that will appear are goblins, and trolls. Moreover, a few ogres will show up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? You already know what will show up?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course. The 6 star Dungeon\u2019s Break happens when the attempt at clearing a Dungeon fails.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin understood what had happened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During a Dungeon raid, the Roused used the Return Portal to escape the Dungeon once they realized the Dungeon was beyond their power. When they escaped, they brought back information about what\u2019s in the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it is happening tomorrow afternoon, we still have time left. Why aren\u2019t we trying to clear it again?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol was taken aback by Woojin\u2019s question. She couldn\u2019t help, but be puzzled when he asked a question about something that should be common sense.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA return portal can be used 3 times to escape a Dungeon. On the 4th use, the portal itself won\u2019t open.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Hwarang\u2019s Vermillion team failed the Dungeon\u2019s first raid. On the second run, Hwarang and KH combined to make a team, but they also failed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On the 3rd try, we asked for cooperation from the Rank A Roused in Korea, but we failed in forming a team. We used a foreign Roused organization to form a team to challenge the Dungeon, but they also failed. It is impossible to make another attempt now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMoreover, all three teams failed at the entrance of the Dungeon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The portal can be made to escape the Dungeon, and one had to use the same Dungeon portal to re-enter it. It was a type of save point.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were able to step in at where the last team left. However, all three team had failed. It meant the difficulty of this Dungeon was unimaginable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf it is that difficult, then wouldn\u2019t it be very dangerous?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haesol nodded her head in a solemn manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t the terrain have a huge influence on the difficulty of the Dungeon? This Dungeon was also largely affected by the terrain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you have any detailed information on the Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? The Dungeon will Break soon\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon Break will happen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The battlefield will switch from inside the Dungeon to the outside. If the Dungeon was the monster\u2019s home field, then the land outside the Dungeon was the earthling\u2019s home field. They would receive help from modern technology that couldn\u2019t be used inside the Dungeon. The humans held a large advantage outside in defeating the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the beginning, humans hadn\u2019t been prepared for the Dungeon Break. However, there were almost no civilian casualties now. Still, the property damage was immense\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe ogres are a problematic since they have high resistance. Still, a 12.7mm NATO ammo works on them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen why did you call me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not really sure\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen will we arrive there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll arrive around 7. You can have some dinner then you can rest at the hotel. We\u2019ll move to the area of operation at 10 in the morning tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin rubbed his chin. If it\u2019s ogres, it might be worth trying\u2026</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre the information about the Dungeon a secret?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. It\u2019s not. Information about Dungeons are usually released to everyone on principle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even if the bloodstone companies are deeply involved with wanting to clear the Dungeons, foremost, it was a work done to protect cities, and nations. Monopolizing of information happened, but it was extremely rare.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan you find some for me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lieutenant Che-haesol called somewhere, then she answered Woojin</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to read it immediately when we arrive there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked out the window for awhile. Then he leaned his seat back, and he closed his eyes. It was a luxury car, so it was very comfortable. Moreover, the driver drove the car very smoothly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin crossed his arms and closed his eyes, Lieutenent Che-haesol didn\u2019t speak to him any further.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s eyes opened almost at the same time as when the car stopped. He looked outside the window, and he saw a very subdued and quiet city. It reminded him of a ghost city.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are in front of the command and control center.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin glanced up, and he saw a sign for a specialty coffee shop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAfter we meet the commander, we\u2019ll go to the hotel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. There are other Roused dispatched here. Would you like to greet them??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll do that. Where is the data?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. It\u2019ll be delivered here soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are going to give it me, please print it out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. We\u2019ll do so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin entered the cafe, and the 50th divisional commander was waiting for him. It seemed he was notified Woojin was coming. The divisional commander requested a handshake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m the 50th divisional commander. I\u2019m manager Lee-joonae.\u201d (TLN: he\u2019s speaking in a dialect)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy name is Kang-woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin copied Lee-joontae\u2019s accent, his eyebrows twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m reassured by the fact you came here. After you hear my brief overview of the operation, you can go greet the other Roused.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Contrary to manager Lee-joontae\u2019s words, his faced indicated that he wasn\u2019t too thrilled with the other allies joining up with his troops.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The divisional commander left since he showed his face to Woojin, and the other Roused scattered around the cafe caught Woojin\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI am the Operation command assistant, Major Kim-joonyong. I\u2019ll be explaining our operation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-joonyong started explaining about how they will clear the monsters tomorrow. They will set a line centered around the Joonjuk station, and they\u2019ll lay down a concentrated fire when the monsters come out. Then they\u2019ll fortify the 2nd and 3rd lines.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The air force planes will deal with the flying monsters, and they will also lay down support fire. All the civilians had been given eviction orders, and they had all been evacuated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After the 1st barricade was destroyed, the Roused was in charge of blocking the monster from reaching the 2nd line. When the 2nd line was breached, the Roused had the autonomy to hunt the monsters by themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve read the Dungeon Energy, and I think we will be able to protect the 2nd line. However, we don\u2019t have any information on the final monster, so please be ready for the a variable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon raid finished in the early stages, so they didn\u2019t have any information on the final monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA more detailed instructions will be delivered tomorrow at 10 am.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen please go greet the other Roused..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin turned his head, he saw every Roused staring at him. If one discounted the military and guild association, the total number of Roused participating in this operation was 480.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amongst them, there were 30 Roused who were at least Rank B.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An upwards of 20 people that were part of that group was inside the cafe. The rest were resting in the hotel.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Korea\u2019s 11th Rank A Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot of people curious about Kang-woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, there was also an acquaintance there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A bobbed-haired beauty walked towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGlad to see you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSeoul National University\u2019s 6th exit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin expression indicated she was talking nonsense, so the bobbed-haired beauty introduced herself while frowning.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m the team leader of Hwarang guild\u2019s Vermillion team. My name is Lee-yunhwee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Surprisingly, Lee-yunhwee was the Roused representative of the Hwarang guild. She would be participating in the operation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Nice to see you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After a brief greeting, Woojin received the bundle of documents brought to him just in time by Haesol. A rough map of the Dungeon, information on the monsters that showed up, and a detailed information of the Dungeon was spelled out in the documents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. If you need anything else, please talk to me. Your hotel room number is 502.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After receiving the key, Woojin skimmed over the bundle of documents. Then he rolled it up, and he stabbed it into his pocket.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s worth a shot.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin left the cafe. Lee-yunhwee, who had been by his side, clenched her fists as it trembled in anger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid he just ignore me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Lee-yunhwee started to shake, the members of the Vermillion team quickly came over to calm her down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease calm down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKids these days lack self-awareness. He probably thinks he is the best since he is a Rank A Roused.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehe. Team leader should be patient. His high nose won\u2019t last long.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee fanned her red face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHo-ooh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She took out her phone to find her oppa\u2019s number, then she pressed the call button.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hello?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did you call him here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Who are you talking about?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe fucker who stole the Dungeon last time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Huh huh. Mr. Kang-woojin? I want you to observe him. Moreover, I want you to build up some goodwill with him. I purposefully brought him in to participate in this operation.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to be friendly with him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ah. Why are you being like this again? Just observe him closely. Try to see what ability he uses, and how well he controls his power. See if he has any unusual habits.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHooo. Why didn\u2019t you assign this to someone else?\u201c</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwarang\u2019s guild master Lee-sahngho spoke after he cleared his throat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[I\u2019m not asking you as your oppa. I am ordering you as the Hwarang\u2019s guild master. Gather as much information on the Roused Kang-woojin.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee\u2019s brow furrowed when she heard his serious voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m quitting the guild. Keep up the good work, bitch of an oppa. You always make me do the annoying assignments.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Uh uh? Why are you being like this again, Yunhwee? Oppa is\u2026.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddoo-ooh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She ended the call in a temper. Lee-yunhwee exited the cafe\u2019s entrance with a frown on her face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Where did he go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee couldn\u2019t locate Kang-woojin, so she asked a soldier near her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere did Mr. Kang-woojin go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe said he wants to look around the site, so he went there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Wasn\u2019t the Dungeon going to break loose tomorrow anyways? Why would he want to go there?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you mind if I use one of your vehicles??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Yes, sir. We\u2019ll prepare one soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee got on the military owned vehicle in front of the hotel, then she headed towards Jookjun station\u2019s 3rd exit. There weren\u2019t any cars on the road, and she drove by tanks from time to time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she got closer to the subway station, she saw barricades, tanks, and machine guns placed in buildings. When she arrived at the first line, it was filled with soldiers on-guard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After exiting the vehicle at the 1st line of defense, Lee-hyunhwee walked towards the problematic subway station, which was 4 blocks away. The surrounding high-rise buildings had been demolished for a better line of sight. However, they hadn\u2019t cleared the debris, so the surrounding was cluttered with debris.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dungeon entrance had been protected from the effects of the explosions, and Kang-woojin was standing in front of a strangely colored portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee face crumpled at Kang-woojin\u2019s answer. She always heard from others she was rude, but it felt weird meeting someone who was more rude than her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would I come to a Dungeon? I\u2019m here to clear it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Yunhwee was surprised by Woojin\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are mad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t crazy. This place had a lot of EXP and Achievement Points. It was crazy to make the 3 battle lines outside, and it would be crazy for him to share the monsters with the soldiers and the Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunhwee realized Woojin wasn\u2019t making a joke with his laughter. She approached him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA..are you crazy? What can you do by yourself? If you go in, you won\u2019t be able to use the portal again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wasn\u2019t going to use it. He won\u2019t use the portal to exit the Dungeon. He\u2019ll break through the barrier using the the Return Stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey. Hey. Try thinking logically. Even if the monsters pop out, we can kill all of them if we work with the soldiers. So why do this? Are you thinking about making a noble sacrifice for your line? Hey, wake up. No one will care what you did if you die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What nonsense. He wasn\u2019t making a sacrifice for his line. (TLN: family line)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The monsters will be sacrificed for his benefit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-yunwee was surprised when Woojin took a step forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you really crazy? You\u2019ll die if you go in!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh.

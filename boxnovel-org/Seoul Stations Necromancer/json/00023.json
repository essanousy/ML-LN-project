Thanks~)</span></span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was the team leader of the 4th Support team of the Hammer guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 4th Support team managed any work related to Dungeon equal to or below 3 stars. The team was also in charge of educating the new Roused inducted into the Guild, and they helped out with the training.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he got to work, he always hand-brewed his coffee. He was a coffee maniac. He started off the day leisurely as he drank a cup of coffee in his large office. This was an important ritual for him and it gave him joy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 30 minutes after he got to work was his small time of happiness. His team members didn\u2019t bother him unless there was an important business.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ri-ri.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was about to grind the coffee beans with his hand mill when the phone rang.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He picked up the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is 4th Support team leader, Jung-minchan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Team ldader. This is Haemin.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-haemin was part of the management staff he had deployed to the Maebong Station\u2019s 3rd exit. The Maebong Station\u2019s 3rd exit was taken by the Hammer guild about a month ago. They were now in charge of managing the Dungeon, where the Rakwis spawned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[These guys arrived at the Dungeon this morning, and they reserved 4 hours before going in. There is something wrong with these guys.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid they die?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was common for the Roused to meet an untimely death when they attempt a Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[No. They were able to safely clear it, but their clear time is abnormal. The first attempt took 30 minutes, but it is taking them 11 minutes to clear the Dungeon now. Huk . They just came out right now, and it took them 9 minutes 47 seconds. Hey. Hey. I won. Collect all the money.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan heard low voices in the background, and he already knew what Haemin was doing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Ah. We made a bet on whether they would be able to clear the Dungeon in less than 10 minutes. Never mind about that. Why don\u2019t you look up these bastards? They said they were Rank F, but I\u2019m sure they are ranked higher.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Something was most definitely off. This didn\u2019t make any sense. Two ranked F Roused was able to clear a Dungeon spawning Rakwis in less than 10 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cKeep your phone by your side, and wait for me. I\u2019ll call back after I look them up. First, when their reserved Dungeon time comes to an end, try to detain them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Yes sir. Team Leader. Keep up the hard work.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After Minchan ended his phone call, he logged on to the Association site to look up their information.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? This guy registered yesterday? The other guy seems to have registered only 2 months ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were fledglings yet they were clearing 3 star Dungeons. Moreover, they were clearing it within 10 minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne is a necromancer and the other is a flame magician.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">By looking at their specialty, one could roughly guess the style of their hunting method. It basically meant either there was a mistake when measuring their Roused rank or they were intentionally hiding it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Anyways, it was obvious the two Roused were well above Rank F. At the very least, they should be Rank C. f a Roused exhibited a Rank C ability from the beginning, every single one of them matured into a high ranked Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It has been a long time since a promising Roused had appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI must catch them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan abandoned the coffee he loved, and he immediately left his office. As the 4th Support team, their main job was to manage the Dungeons equal to or below 3 stars, but it was also important to scout the Roused using their Dungeons.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan\u2019s car raced towards the Maebong station.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After he roughly parked near the road, he headed towards the 3rd exit. Kim-haemin was waiting for him, and he gave Minchan a greeting.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. Hyung-nim came by yourself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s business hour right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-chacha. Team leader. Heh heh. It\u2019s bee about 8 minutes since they entered. They\u2019ll be out soon. By looking at their clear time, they still have time to go through the Dungeon once more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had reserved 4 hours, and they had 15 minutes left. They\u2019ll be out soon, so they might attempt the Dungeon once more.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThese guys aren\u2019t playing around. They\u2019ve already made over $300,000. Uh-whew. If I was skilled, then I would do the Dungeon runs like them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a high ranked Roused team attacked a 3 star Dungeon, of course it would be possible for them to clear the it within 10 minutes. However, those high ranked Roused had no reason to attempt a lowly 3 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they were able to clear a higher ranked Dungeon, the $300,000 was chump change. The 3 star Dungeon would basically be a repetitive labor. It was as simple as that.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEither these bastards have incredible potential or they are criminals who are using fake identities.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they possessed some amazing Roused ability that grew enough within few days to allow a Rank F to sweep through a 3 star Dungeon, he had to get a hold of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a different story if they were criminals with laundered identities. The supervision over the Roused was very strict. It would be very hard to cover up one\u2019s identity to go through the Roused registration again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Criminals wouldn\u2019t do such eye-catching deeds like this in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they coming out? It\u2019s about time they should be coming out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s party had already passed the 10 minute mark. Haemin was becoming restless when they didn\u2019t come out like usual. Dungeons were a place where one didn\u2019t know what was coming. Everything further than one\u2019s nose was an unknown. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for a high ranked Roused to die even in a low ranked Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmmm. It means this will be their last run\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haemin was restless for no reason, and he glanced at his watch. They had only 4 minutes left. There wasn\u2019t enough time left for them to attempt the Dungeon one more time. Either this was there last run or they wouldn\u2019t be coming out forever.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t the latter situation. Woojin came out with a complicated expression on his face, and Sunggoo seemed exhausted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018W\u2026we burned through it like white hot fire.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s two arms felt like it was about to be ripped off. However, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh when he thought about the bags filled with bloodstones on his back. The bloodstones were worth about $50,000, and it was all his.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I made the right choice.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He made a good choice by sticking to Woojin, and becoming his manager. This was a once in a life time opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you doing? Go quickly settle our account.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. Hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The adjusted profit would all be going to Sunggoo this time, so Woojin didn\u2019t have to go with him. Sunggoo tried to quickly head towards the Bloodstone exchange store, but someone blocked his way.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMay I speak to the both of you for a moment?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo didn\u2019t give a reply, and he casted a furtive glance towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A flame magician with 2 month experience, and a Necromancer on his 2nd day. They were an odd combination. Moreover, the relationship between the two seemed more strange.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I guess that person is the leader.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan approached Woojin to ask his request again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMay I speak with you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The correspondence of his words with his action was right on point. Woojin pushed passed Minchan, who was in his face. Minchan was taken aback, and he quickly got in Woojin\u2019s way again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cP\u2026please. Please wait a moment. I just need a moment of your time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you are planning to steal my time anyways, why are you asking politely?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the other\u2019s unexpected response, Minchan had two thoughts in his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What kind of crazy son of a bitch is this?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018He is straight forward. I have quickly give him the main points.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The former was his emotional side speaking, and the latter was his logical side speaking. Michan, who had climbed up the ranks to become the team leader of the 4th Support team, preferred logic over emotion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell you my business first. I want to recruit you to our Hammer guild.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan hurriedly put his hand into his suit\u2019s pocket to take out a business card, then he tried to hand one to Woojin. Woojin didn\u2019t even entertain the idea of taking the business card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had heard a lot of information from Jaemin and Sunggoo, so he was well versed on this subject.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI refuse.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t even think for 1 second before he gave his answer. Minchan had to suppress himself from grumbling, and he was barely able to reply back.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it seems you don\u2019t know about the Hammer guild yet\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it one of the 3 great guilds of Korea?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt seems you know much\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not in a good mood, so why don\u2019t you stop bothering me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s thought was on a razor edge as his mind was filled with thoughts about Trahnet. He became irritated when this person started pestering him. He didn\u2019t want to speak to him, and it was about a subject he didn\u2019t want to talk about. Of course, he wasn\u2019t happy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Fortunately, Minchan was quick to pick up on other\u2019s mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t have to be now. At least give us a call once. Hammer guild takes good care of the Roused with skill.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin walked passed Minchan after he glanced at the business card . Sunggooo, who was following after Woojin, stealthily read the face of Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018What a waste.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of an organization is the Hammer Guild?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were one of the 3 great guilds of Korea. They were a guild ranked within the top 20 even if one put them against the guilds of the world. They were a powerful guild, who possessed 2 Rank A Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One fourth of the Dungeons in Seoul were Hammer Guild properties. The guild was probably making an enormous amount of money just from the entrance fees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If one was noticed by such a guild, it guaranteed a fast advancement in one\u2019s status. Moreover, a member of the support team and the team leader was here to recruit him. This mean t they were very interested in him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018How could he kick away such an opportunity?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo knew Woojin was in a foul mood.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Money wasn\u2019t the only thing the guild possessed. They had numerous magic and artifact. Moreover, they had experience. Sunggoo\u2019s goal was to increase his ability, and he wanted to advance in rank. As a Roused, this was opportunity was like a dream.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan didn\u2019t miss Sunggoo\u2019s anxious reaction.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease talk it over carefully with your party member. Then please give us a call.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo sneakily took the Team leader Jung-minchan\u2019s business card. As he watched the two leave, Jung-minchan put on a confident smile. When the two entered the Bloodstone exchange store, he swore as he frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the fuck! There is a limit on how arrogant a person should be.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are right, team leader. The bastard isn\u2019t normal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ah! He should be thankful just to be noticed. Even that should be too much for him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s right. He has no idea how high the door steps to Hammer guild is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan took a couple deep breath then he let go of his anger. There were public employees from the Management Bureau present. There were also other Roused and managers watching from the surrounding. If he had a temper tantrum, then it would be a bad look for him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan approached the public employee.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you going to send in your report?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Of course, I have to give my report\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t send in your report.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Well, I\u2019ll do what you say.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two F ranked Roused cleared a 3 star Dungeon in 10 minutes. This meant something must have went wrong when they were assigning their Ranks, so the employee had to send in a separate report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the public employee was a close friend of the Hammer Guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The site employee Kim-haemin turned the public employee a long time ago.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease don\u2019t give the information to the other guilds.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. I\u2019ll do as you say.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At the public employee\u2019s answer, Kim-haemin grabbed a hold of Jung-minchan\u2019s arm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJeez, team leader. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve done this. I\u2019ll go have some soju with that friend over there. Anyways, are you going to try to catch those two?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. You should return to the office for now. Go dig up some information on them. It seems those bastards aren\u2019t interested in guilds.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo they have enough worth for us to catch them?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t have any value. You have to catch them first. Have you never fished before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFishing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf the lure is being pulled then you reel it in. If it is a small fry then you just throw it away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh-ha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAnyways, go learn about them. The less people who know about them would be better for us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The information will be spread in an instant for eye-catching guys like them. However, he had to do his best to delay it as much as he can. During that time, it would be best if they entered into the Hammer guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If they poked around too much then they would lose an excellent Roused to other guilds and it would be their loss.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey\u2026they are coming out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Kim-haemin\u2019s words, he turned to look. Woojin and Sunggoo was exiting the Bloostone exchange store. Minchan and Haemin stood next to each other then they looked at the two with a confident smile on their face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe earned a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the final adjusted figure, and he felt a little bit relieved. With this much money, he wouldn\u2019t have any problem purchasing a house.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the achievement of a Roused, who had been registered for only two days.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">$380,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the balance in Woojin\u2019s account. He already had $50,000 in there, and he had gained $330,000.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I respect you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had received his 10% cut, and Woojin allowed him to keep all the bloodstones he had excavated at the end. He had made $93,000. This large sum of money blew all the thoughts about all the money he lost out of his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was once again surprised he had made so much money in one day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go back to our neighborhood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They headed toward the parking lot to find their car. When they were passing the parking fee window, Woojin grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess the parking fee really isn\u2019t that expensive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? Also, the 4 star Dungeons will be very different. The drop rate for an artifact is quite high there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he purchase a house, then his immediate need would be fulfilled. His immediate goal was not to gather money. He knew his goal had to be leveling up as fast as he could. Woojin\u2019s expression turned complicated again, and Sunggoo threw out a question towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Why did you refuse the guild\u2019s offer? Do you have any reasons\u2026.\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not accustomed to having someone above me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was a ruler. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to having someone above him. He actually felt repulsed by it. Why should he receive orders from someone else?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How laughable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggo saw Woojin\u2019s grin, and he quietly took out the business card from his pocket. Then he threw it out of the window. He was afraid what would happen to him if Woojin found out he took the business card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Bye bye. Hammer Guild.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo grabbed onto the handle as his eyes misted up a little bit.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

I have the answer for this situation. You have to try to break through to her by forcing the issue.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon spoke passionately as if this personally concerned him. Soonghoon called Jaemin to find out when his noonah would get off work, then he looked at the clock.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe\u2019ll barely make it, president. Why don\u2019t we start moving first?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEverything about president is perfect, but\u2026 Your style is a bit\u2026 How about doing a make-over so the women would like you more?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He wanted to apply some medicine on her, so why did he need to dress up for it? Well, it was the weekend, so it would be okay if he took a break.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo didn\u2019t have anything to do, so he followed Woojin and the excited Woo-soonghoon to the department stone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOur time is tight, so let\u2019s clean you up first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As a new Rank A roused, he had societal recognition and fame. It was his first visit to the department store, but Kang-woojin was made a VIP. The department store\u2019s VIP employee welcomed Woojin, and she guided him to the VIP lounge.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The private room was decorated lavishly, and the employee started measuring Woojin with a ruler.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease stay here, president. I\u2019ll bring the clothes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon left. Woojin, Sunggoo and an salesperson assigned to them was left waiting in the room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Her face was so pretty that Sunggoo couldn\u2019t meet the employee\u2019s eyes. His nervous eyes could only roll around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring me some water.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, customer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, the employee assented to his request, and she brought a tray with a cup of water on it. Woojin indicated towards the tray with his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDrink this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Yes..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed the water was for the nervous Sunggoo.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. Hyung-nim is used to places like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the first time he had come to a department store in Korea like this. However, on Alphen\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, I\u2019m kinda used to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOf course, hyung-nim is\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s respect for Woojin deepened, and at that moment, Woo-soonghoon entered the room. It seemed he had finished shopping. He was followed by employees carrying clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kang-woojin was the VIP, but it looked as if Woo-soonghoon was the one who was puffing his chest out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident\u2019s hair and make-up should be styled like this\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon brought up a picture on his hand phone to Woojin\u2019s face, and he started giving an explanation. Woojin grabbed and pulled his ear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Soonghoon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t this enough?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was in danger. Soonghoon\u2019s instinct was warning him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he pushed Woojin any further, then he would be in danger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident is very well built, so a well fashioned clothes will bring your style to life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned. He just wanted to give Jiwon the medicine, so he didn\u2019t know why Soonghoon was making such a fuss. Still, it wouldn\u2019t be bad if he could purchase some good clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin entered the dressing room to change his clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he came out after changing his clothes, Soonghoon and Sunggoo raised both their thumbs towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A man should always wear a suit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had a sculpted body, so the suit and tie really brought him to life. As if he looked dashing, several of the female employees, who had brought the clothes, had flushed faces.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Soonghoon pushed shoes and a watch towards Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cA watch completes the suit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned as he put on the watch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m going to go out then.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease take director Hong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Soonghoon\u2019s word, Woojin shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you think he is some kind of a chauffeur? He worked his butt off until now, so he should rest today. I\u2019ll just take a taxi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sure enough, Sunggoo felt like he was about to die. It had only been several days, but he spent 4 times the time inside the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t have time to rest during the rigorous schedule, so he was exhausted.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhile you are resting, don\u2019t even come to the office. I\u2019ll see you on Monday. Tell director Jung what I told you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. Please succeed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Succeed with what? He just needed to put the medicine on her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was about to go, when Soonghoon gave him a note.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve finished researching about Pyeongtaek. If you follow these instructions, then you will be fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at the note, and it had several addresses of popular restaurants. It was a pretty well planned out date course.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Well, he guessed he could take a brief break since he was going there any ways.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, thanks. Have a nice weekend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin stepped out, the department store employee called somewhere, and she ordered a car to be readied for Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo-ah. It\u2019s a rare time off. What are you going to do, Mr. Soonghoon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo automatically grinned when he thought about the delicious two day break. However, Soonghoon looked at Sunggoo with a determined expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo hoo. I still have some work to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ve never failed at creating a couple when I set them up. I\u2019ll support the president all the way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Hyung-nim went to confess?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo hoo. Why wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo tilted his head in puzzlement when he heard Soonghoon\u2019s confident words. Did Woojin hyung-nim really like Jiwon noonah? He had no idea.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHoo hoo hoo. Then I\u2019ll see Director Hong on Monday. I have a lot of things to prepare. I have to get to Pyeongtaek as fast as I can.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo shook his head when Soonghoon disappeared in a rush.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wasn\u2019t planning on confessing\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo thought he had heard something about healing from the president\u2019s office. Well, he was a single guy, so he was in uncharted waters.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since Sunggoo was at the department store, he decided to shop for presents to give to his parents. His body was weary, but he had accrued a vast amount of money these days. He should at least by some presents for his parents.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Sunggoo shopped, Woojin headed towards Pyeongtaek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin tried to ride a taxi, but the department store let him use a car as a courtesy. So he was driven in comfort to the factory where Jiwon worked.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Jiwon\u2019s line was already done with their shift, so they had retired to their dorm. Woojin had no choice, but to look for her at the dorm.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The dormitory looked like an old 7 story apartment building, and there were two of them standing side by side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin found the dormitory\u2019s security office.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCould you give Ms. Do-jiwon a call?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t you have that interphone or something. Why don\u2019t you call her yourself?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe isn\u2019t answering my calls.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An old security guard glanced at Woojin, and he made a knowing expression.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou fought with your girlfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After retiring, he had spent the last 10 years as a security guard. This kid dressed up to the nines, and it seemed he had come to look for his young lover.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh huh. I\u2019ll call her for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While the security guard left his seat, Woojin decided to wait outside.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon came out after finishing her shower, and she was getting ready to sleep. Her line was being rescheduled this weekend, so after a short break, she had to go in again for the night shift.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, the door bell interfered with that plan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMs Do-jiwon. Your lover is looking for you. Ah. Hurry up and go out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the security guard\u2019s voice was heard across the door, it wasn\u2019t Jiwon who reacted first. It was her room-mates Haejin and Nayoung.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow! Unni had a boyfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWa, jackpot, jackpot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The girls quickly headed towards the window, and they stuck their heads out.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. This is crazy. He is tall.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? He is looking this way. He is handsome. He is a jackpot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she heard them making a great fuss, she decided to see who had come looking for her. She stuck her head out the window.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin saw her face come out from the 3rd story window, Woojin laughed and he wave his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. This is crazy. He looked over here. I s he really unni\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI think he just waved his hand when he saw unni.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. I think he did. This is a huge event!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon was taken aback by the fuss created by Haejin and Nayoung, so her face stiffened.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did he show up here out of nowhere??</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon hurriedly found her hand phone, then she pressed the call button.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Why do you think I came here? You weren\u2019t answering my calls or texts, so I decided to come here.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon let out a sigh. Haejin and Nayoung covered their mouth, and they were acting silly.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Waa, jackpot. Jackpot.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s really him. It\u2019s the real one.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you have something to say, then just say it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[It isn\u2019t something I want to speak over the phone. Come out. Let\u2019s go eat something, and I also have a present to give you.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Haejin and Nayoung tried not to scream in delight, Jiwon brought the hand phone closer to her ears. Jiwon was uncomfortable with the girls, so she started to edge backwards. However, this made the girls more interested, and they chased after her to listen to her phone call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have to work again on the night shift. I don\u2019t have any time. Just tell me through the phone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[When I went to your company, I spoke to your president. You schedule is empty now, so come out.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why was he being like this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why is he keep trying to get involved in her life? His face is was already plastered all over the media\u2026 He was a famous person now, and he would only hear bad things if he became associated with her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[If you aren\u2019t coming out then should I head in? If you don\u2019t want to come, then I guess I can give you the present over there.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cN\u2026no. Outsiders can \u2018t come in here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[All right. Take your time.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon let out a sigh when Woojin ended the call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow! Jackpot. Who is that oppa, unni? Is that really your boyfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNo. He\u2019s just a friend from my high school days.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Haejin and Nayoung\u2019s faces switched to an expression filled with anticipation when they heard Jiwon\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s Kang-woojin!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-muh. It really is him! He\u2019s the Roused Kang-woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Someone yelled out from another window in the dormitory. Haejin and Nayoung hurried back to the window, then they searched for Woojin on their hand phone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWow. I have goosebumps right now. It really is him, Kang-woojin..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUnni is really friends with Kang-woojin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh? Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Jiwon\u2019s words, their gazes turned hot, and it was an emotion close to desire.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cCan\u2019t you take us, unni? We are hungry too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, unni. Please take us along to eat dinner\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was going to return after talking to him, so why were they being like this? They suddenly acted nice to her. She was taken aback, and she felt uncomfortable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since when did they start acting so close to her\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t ask Woojin about it. It would be bad manners\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you won\u2019t mind if oppa says ok?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAssa. Hey, hurry up and get ready.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI knew it! Unni is an angel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019ll get a picture as evidence, then I\u2019ll post it on Facebook. Hee hee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Haejin and Nayoung fussed about what clothes and make-up they should put wear, Jiwon quietly picked out a hat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah. What\u2019s taking her so long?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Every window in the dormitory had a head sticking out, and they were looking at Woojin. Woojin felt like a monkey in a zoo. However, he never cared about other\u2019s gazes, so the situation didn\u2019t make him feel uncomfortable.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t care if they saw him or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After awhile, Jiwon showed up, and Woojin grinned when he saw her.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat the heck? You kept rejecting me yet you came out looking pretty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Woojin\u2019s word, Jiwon\u2019s cheeks flushed from shyness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cO\u2026oppa. Nice to meet you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had followed after Jiwon, and the girls gave their greeting toward Woojin with wide eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is this? Who are these uggos?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had a wide face like an orc, and the other\u2019s eyes were squinty. Uh? One was an orc and the other was a goblin?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jiwon was surprised by Woojin\u2019s words, and she tried to put a hand over his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT\u2026they are my room mates. They said they wanted to go have a meal with you\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jiwon\u2019s troubled words made Woojin grin, and he pushed her hand away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you guys hungry?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, oppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They thought they heard some unpleasant words, but since they will be able to eat dinner with the Roused Kang-woojin, they decided to overlook it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out a $50 bill from his wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, kids. I saw a lot of stores selling fried chicken when I was coming here. Go order something, and eat it. Oppa needs to have a talk with this pretty unni.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh. Wh..what did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow rude..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were quickly disappointed. Jiwon didn\u2019t know what to do when Woojin led her away with his hand on her shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, let\u2019s leave these dongsaengs. They look like they will be great at eating chicken legs. We can go have something delicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? W\u2026Woojin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pulled her away with his hand, so she was unavoidably led away. This situation was so ridiculous that she unintentionally let out a laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What\u2019s happening?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When she saw the flustered Haejin and Nayoung, it felt like a stone that was pressing on her chest was removed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cW..what the heck? This doesn\u2019t make any sense..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHul. Kang-woojin really sucks. I\u2019ll tell everyone on Facebook..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYeah. When I read the articles, I wrote he was cool. I\u2019ll have to change it through the app.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. What nonsense. Will food go down his throat if he eats with someone like Jiwon unni?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think he\u2019s a crazy bastard..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s basically the handsome man, and the beast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cEh-ee. I put on my make-up for nothing. Let\u2019s go eat some fried chicken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. Let\u2019s just go back in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the girls head back in to the dormitory, Woojin took Jiwon away, and they got into a taxi.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Now the reporters swarmed Woojin and Sunggoo like bees.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2026what are you guys doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo spread out both his arms to block the reporters. He called himself a manager, but Sunggoo wasn\u2019t proficient at the jobs done by an actual manager of a Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kang-Woojin. Is it true you are a Roused secretly raised by the Hammmer guild??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs it true you are a Rank A Roused?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYour mother works at the restaurant. What happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo couldn\u2019t even respond to the questions that poured out like a waterfall, so Woojin stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy are you standing there like that? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? You just want to go like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen do you want to be stuck here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBut how\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin clicked his tongue.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGet out of the way. I\u2019ll just answer their questions quickly. Why are you getting so worked up over it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2026he was so cool. He was his hyung-nim.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters rushed in front of Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHurry up and ask me a question. I\u2019m busy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kang-woojin. Please respond\u2026. Uh? What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI said hurry up and ask me a question.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporter was taken aback, but he used his professional mind to quickly come up with a reply.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat kind of a relationship do you have with the Hammer guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI have no relationship with them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is your exact Roused Rank?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">I\u2019ll be measured soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou mother works at the restaurant. What happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean by what happened? She just works at a restaurant. That\u2019s it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He gave short answers to the trivial questions, and suddenly 5 minutes flew by.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m about to go into the Dungoen, so could you guys move aside?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis will be my last question.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSpeak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich guild are you affiliated with?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlandal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters quickly took notes as they asked their questions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt is the first time I have heard of this guild. What kind of guild is Alandal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">What kind of guild was it? It was his military exemption card.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m done answering questions. Let\u2019s go Sunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo pushed past the reporters, then they headed towards the Dungeon\u2019s entrance. Several reporters caught up with him to keep asking questions, but he didn\u2019t give any answer at all.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entrance was guarded by public employees dispatched by the Management Bureau. This Dungeon wasn\u2019t cleared by a guild rather it was a privately owned Dungeon. The Management Bureau had been entrusted with the supervision of the Dungeon instead. There had been inquiries about the Dungeon, but no one had made an appointment yet. So they weren\u2019t able to collect their fees even once yet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Mr. Kang-woojin? Are you going to use the Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. Here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out his Roused card, then he wrote his name inside the Access Control Registry.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cJust the t..two of you are going in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe two of us will be enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo entered the Dungeon with multiple flashes from cameras directed towards them. When they crossed into the entrance, the barrier formed, and everything external to the barrier was completely shut off.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;You have entered the Seoul National University Station\u2019s 6th exit Dungeon.&gt;</p><br/><p>&lt;This Dungeon has already been captured. The basic monsters will be summoned.&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo spoke in an excited voice.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOoh-wa. Hyung-nim was like a famous entertainer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStop talking nonsense, and pay attention.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. If you take even one direct hit, you will probably die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuk. Yes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo sharpened his senses, while still being nervous. Even a ghost learns a few things after 3 years.(TLN: idiom) Sunggoo was somewhat getting used to the life of being a Roused, so he was able to focus his mind in an instant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOnly Lrats will show up until the last floor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lrats were enormous bat-like monsters. They stick to the ceilings of the subway station, and they attacked when they saw an opportunity. They were a very troublesome monster to deal with. If one didn\u2019t have a long-ranged attack then this monster would cause a lot of difficulty. However, Woojin and Sunggoo had ranged magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOh yeah. Try using this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out a short stick from his inventory. When it was handed to Sunggoo, he took it in confusion, and he was bewildered by it.</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Ruby Wand&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A magical wand with a large ruby embedded in it. +100% effect for Flame-based magics.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI picked this up. You should use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026hyu\u2026hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was touched by the move. The price of a magical Artifact was extraordinary. However, Woojin was just giving this one out without any qualms. It showed how great Woojin was.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t just his ability to acquire such item. Sunggoo was surprised at Woojin\u2019s willingness to give this item away as if it was nothing. This was a very precious item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It\u2019s a low level item, so it should be useful for awhile.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo didn\u2019t realize the item Woojin gave out was trivial to him. In the previous tour of this Dungeon, he had picked up several Artifacts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There was a big difference between the Artifacts found in the Dungeon, and the Artifacts bought in the Point Store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It all came down to rather another person could use it or not.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The items purchased from the Point Store could be materialized and used. However, items with special abilities could only be used by Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could share the clothes and food with anyone. However, the skill books and magic imbued Artifacts couldn\u2019t be shared.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would be able to give it away. However, the skill book would appear as a blank book with no ability. It wouldn\u2019t be able to produce any magic, and it would basically be a normal item.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I\u2019ll have to experiment with the consumable items.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he was able to transfer consumable items, then he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about things like potions.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 5 star Dungeon gave much more Achievement Points compared to the 4 star. Moreover, he was able to level up faster.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Let one fly as an experiment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s face was filled with awe as he formed his fireball magic. The fireball was several times larger than before. Sunggoo\u2019s eyes turned round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He threw the fireball towards a Lrat hanging on to the ceiling.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwa-roo-rook, Puhng!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the fireball reached the Lrat, the fireball broke into several dozen pieces as sparks flew everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cZzeeek.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fire coated the entire body of the Lrat. It flapped in the air for a moment before it fell to the floor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cFinish it..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s body was trembling from excitement. His magic was effective inside a 5 star Dungeon. The real 5 star Dungeon was across the portal, but still how great was this?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was actually able to help in clearing the 5 star Dungeon. Woojin was fascinated by how Sunggo had used his magic.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Did he use his own body as a medium to imprint his magic?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused was a fascinating existence. They had learned of a different way to use magic compared to the magicians on Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Were they like Woojin where they leveled up? Did they only have a single skill?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know when he will have to confront Trahnet, but Woojin knew it might be impossible to do it by himself. No, it was almost an impossibility. He might need allies who will fight by his side. He needed to find out more about the existences called the Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggo, who was by Woojin\u2019s side, would be a good subject to observe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. I got it! I was able to do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo had killed one Lrat. It looked like it had been roasted. The Lrat\u2019s meat were similar to that of a bat, so it wasn\u2019t tasty. Even if it was cooked well, eating it was a chore.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou did well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin used the Lrat\u2019s corpse to summon a Skeleton Magician.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Skeleton Magicians had also leveled up to level 13 during all of this. The Skeleton Magicians also had a wand, so they took over one of Sunggoo\u2019s role.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As the number of Skeleton Magicians increased, the speed of the hunt also increased. This forced Sunggoo to pick up the short sword instead of the magic wand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa. It feels more natural to excavate the Bloodstones than using the wand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin and Sunggoo took care of all the monsters inside the subway station in a flash. They returned to the 1st floor, and they saw the generated portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIts the real thing from now on..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They didn\u2019t want to make the same mistake as last time, so Sunggoo and Woojin changed into a different set of clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh? Hyung-nim. Your equipment\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After changing his clothes, Woojin started taking out items from the sub-dimension. He started equipping the items one-by-one, and it made Sunggoo\u2019s eyes turn round.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">On top of his cloth, Woojin wore a blue Raider armor, and a hat made out of leather. Moreover, the gloves and shoes looked quite unique.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI customized my equipment a little bit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had bought the shoes and gloves from the Point Store. He had picked up the armor and hat when he cleared the Dungeon last time. It possessed options that increased his magic, and recovery stat. He\u2019ll probably use this for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018It would have been great if I had my old equipment. This leaves much to be desired.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was a peak Necromancer. If he could get his hand on the equipment he possessed on the Planet Alphen, then he would become several times stronger.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no choice, but to swap out his equipment one by one as he acquired better items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOk. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDon\u2019t even think about joining the battle. You just write the guide.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If Sunggoo joined the battle, he wouldn\u2019t even be of any help. He might even get in the way, so Woojin decided to fight by himself. Even on Alphen, he had worked in sync with his Summoned familiars. It wasn\u2019t in Woojin\u2019s style to hunt with other people.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018I only have 6 levels left.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s current level was 24. The previous Dungeon raid had increased his level by 10. This basically meant the 5 star Dungeons gave a lot of EXP. This meant the level of difficulty for this Dungeon had been quite high even for Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s main skills were released every 10 levels.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin reached level 20, his main combat skills were released. He just needed to raise 6 more levels, and he would reach the requirement to be able to summon another one of his familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was able to increase 10 levels on the previous raid, so he thought it would be possible for him to increase his level by 6 this time around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018Well, if it isn\u2019t enough, then I could just run it one more time.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wasn\u2019t as if the Dungeon was going to run away. Woojin was the owner, so he didn\u2019t even have to make an appointment. He had acquired a proper inexhaustible hunting ground. Woojin and Sunggoo went through the portal together.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A scene of a desert was spread out in from of them after they crossed the portal.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The scorching sun was ablaze, and the heat made it hard for one to breathe.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere will be an ambush within 10 seconds. Be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It happened right after Woojin\u2019s words had ended.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Pah-pah-paht!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The desert\u2019s sand exploded, and large tentacles shot out from below. The identity of the large tentacles was none other than the Sand worms.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The long worms were 2 meters in length. It\u2019s large terrifying mouth held saw-like teeth. It was able to move freely around in the sand, and it could burst forward from the sand to bite its enemy. The Sand worm\u2019s attack was frightening.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It seemed Woojin was the Sand worms\u2019 target. He intentionally jumped high into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The steel staff in Woojin\u2019s hand changed its appearance in an instant. The blunt head of the staff disappeared, and it was replaced by a sharp spear point. The spear point\u2019s appearance changed into a shape akin to a falchion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Warrior\u2019s weapon evolved with Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he reached level 20, he was able to change its shape into a spear.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwahh?!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Sand worms tried to leap after Woojin, but they couldn\u2019t jump high enough. Woojin used his spear to attack.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The soft Sand worm had a natural resistance against blunt physical attacks, but a piercing weapon was very effective.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin attacked the 5 Sand worms that had suddenly ambushed him. It only took a blink of an eye for Woojin to take care of them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Amazing!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo couldn\u2019t think of another word to describe what he saw. Woojin didn\u2019t looked like a Magic type Roused. Instead, he looked like a Physical type Roused.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid you record it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Yes, sir. I wrote it all down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo quickly wrote inside the notebook. \u2018Five Sand worms ambushed us at the same time we entered. Use sword instead of club.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you see that over there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026yes. What is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pointed toward a cloud of dust blowing towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe Sand Pill Bugs are rolling towards us. There is about 12 of them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow are we suppose to kill it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere is only one way those bastards attack. They quickly roll towards their enemies, then they self-destruct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAs it explodes, it lets out a poisonous gas. The poison is quite nasty, so it would be best to strike them before they could approach us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cC\u2026can\u2019t you use the Skeleton Magicians?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTheir range is too short. The Skeleton Magicians would have to be within range of the poisonous gas to kill those bastards. I will probably be ok, but you will die from the poison.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cT\u2026then what are we suppose to do?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou have to either bring an antidote, or have an archer or a long-ranged magician in your party. \u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhich method are we going to use?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was a bit frightened when he heard about the poisonous gas. Sunggoo asked with a tremulous voice, and it made Woojin grin. How cute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin raised one hand, and a bone spear formed on top his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This was the powerful magic he had gained at Level 20.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hoooooong.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s body bent like a bow, and the dynamic movement allowed him to throw the spear a far distance. It was beautiful. He looked like a Olympic javelin thrower, and Sunggoo watched him with his mouth open.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The thrown spear landed around 800 meters away. Still it was well short of reaching the Sand Pill bugs.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was approaching them faster and faster. Sunggoo could see the monsters with his naked eye now, and fear started to fill his eyes. At the very least, he didn\u2019t want to die a painful death from being poisoned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, who had been still as he watched the Pill bugs approach him, started to chant a spell.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRise. Wall of Bones!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Magic slipped out of him as it accompanied the activation words. Then the Bone Spear, which looked like an item someone had just thrown away in the middle of the desert, changed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Chwa-roo-roo-rook!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Suddenly, the bones started to grow like vines in the desert. It grew quickly and it spread to make a wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kwa-kwang, kwang, kwa-kwang!</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The wall of bones suddenly formed in front of the Desert Pill bugs, and they exploded as they ran into the wall. A large poisonous cloud was spread, but Woojin and Sunggoo was too far away. It quickly dispersed into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThe first objective is the Oasis over there. By the time I reached it, I was attacked 4 times by the Desert Pill bugs, 8 large scorpions, and some Desert Rats that shows up from time to time. Also, the group of 5 Sand worms attacked me 3 more time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin spoke as if nothing of import had happened, and it made Sunggoo\u2019s body quake.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So this was a 5 star Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was facing off against them like it was nothing. He was amazing. The only word that would come to his mind was amazing .</span></p><br/><p>&lt;Level up!&gt;</p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin leveled up once again when he disposed the Sand Pill bugs. He smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Level 30. He just need 5 more levels before he could summon the Golem.</span></p><br/><p></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

He spoke towards the one who had pushed him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh-ooh, ahjuhshi. What were you doing pushing me? I almost died.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t push you\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin approached the security personnel then he gave an exaggerated hug.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHahaha. It\u2019s alright. Everything is fine since I\u2019m still alive. Ahjuhshi was probably also surprised? You don\u2019t have to feel guilty. Aren\u2019t I still alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">No. How can this be considered just being alive? This was the first incident where a Roused had successfully cleared a 5 star Dungeon by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh uh? Hey. Hey. Hurry up and turn the camera.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The people from the tv station, who were taking a break, started to busily set up their cameras.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the announcer spoke, Woojin\u2019s image was captured by the camera, and it was broadcasted to the entire country.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are bringing you some breaking news. Mr. Kang, who had accidentally fallen into the Dungeon, has surprisingly come back out alive. We have no idea what has happened, but I will try to interview the person directly involved.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Jung-minchan saw the announcer approaching Woojin, he sidled up next to Woojin. Minchan took off his coat then he placed it around Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was confused, but Minchan quickly placed an arm around him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease dont\u2019 do anything. If your identity is revealed through the press, then the press and people around the country will gather to bother you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That couldn\u2019t happen. Woojin obediently put the jacket over his head. Sunggoo was quick on the uptake, and he also sidled up next to Woojin. Kim-haemin quickly went to get his car, so they could make a quick exit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">During all of this, Jung-minchan blocked the path of television crew, and the reporters who were relentlessly pressing down on their camera\u2019s shutter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHe has just barely made it back out alive from the 5 star Dungeon. He is declining to do an interview. He requires stability right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWho are you dt block us? Doesn\u2019t the public have the right to know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Several complaining reporters recognized Jung-minchan\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIsn\u2019t he a Hammer guild\u2019s team leader?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDoes that mean the Roused in the accident is part of the Hammer Guild?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWas this incident disguised as an accident, so the Hammer guild could snatch the Dungeon away?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan became serious when he heard the reporters talking in whispers.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease stop these speculative reporting. I will sue you. If the personal information of the Roused is leaked then we will respond strongly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan blocked the reporters, who were trying to earn at least a single shred of information. Haemin brought his car around during all of this.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTeam leader! Over here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and Woojin quickly entered the back seats. When Minchan also got in the car, Haemin quickly drove into the crossroads before the mass of people could crowd around the car.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. It felt like I\u2019ve turned into a criminal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Michan let out a sigh when he heard Woojin\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. I\u2019m not really sure if I am in a dream or not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan\u2019s heart pounded. His intuition had pointed out Woojin, but he would have never guess Woojin would be able to clear a 5 star Dungeon by himself\u2026. Moreover, it was an undisclosed Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat do you mean? I was pushed, and I entered co.incident.ally?\u201d (TLN: he clipped the word coincidentally into 3 parts)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan smirked at Woojin, who answered a question with a question. If someone saw him right now, who in their right mind would think this person just came out of a 5 star Dungeon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo how was the Dungeon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. It was somewhat of a hairy experience.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt must have been an arduous experience, since you weren\u2019t able to bring out any loot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, it was a in his sub-dimension. He was late, because he was gathering every last drop of bloodstones\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin didn\u2019t feel the need to tell him the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWell, it was something like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan half-turned his body from the passenger seat, and he stared straight at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThere will be a lot of noise in the media for awhile. Don\u2019t go to a Dungeon for the time being. Better yet don\u2019t even come out. The Hammer guild will try its best to block the reporters, and the tv crews.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin grinned at Minchan\u2019s words. Why was he putting so much effort into him? Why was this ahjuhshi so amicable towards him?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan gulped down his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWill you join the Hammer guild? Your ability is already proven now, so it would be possible for me to get you the vice president\u2019s seat. I\u2019ll be able to get the authorization from the president with no problem. Moreover, we will make a team just for Woojin-nim. You will also have free reign to choose your team members.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo, who was listening to the conversation from the side, gulped down his saliva.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was understandable. There were only 10 Rank A Roused in Korea. Woojin had suddenly emerged, and he might be a new Rank A Roused. Of course, he would be treated well, but this was too shocking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo stopped breathing as his eyes headed towards Woojn\u2019s lips. Even Haemin, who was driving, pointed his ears towards Woojin as he focused on what Woojin would say.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cChet. Why does he have to go to a place like that to get publicity?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hammer guild\u2019s president Park-sahngoh clicked his tongue as if he was displeased. His ire rose when he saw team leader Jung-minchan\u2019s face on the breaking news.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The 5 star Dungeon was only two station down from the Sahdahng station yet the Hwarang guild was in line to be the first one to attack the Dungeon. Minchan had the galls to linger around there.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">In the first place, wasn\u2019t he trying to scout a necromancer name Woojin or whatever? Wasn\u2019t this the price of neglecting his original duties?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Minchan returned, he would hand down a strict disciplinary action. It happened when he was having such thoughts.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The barrier being filmed by the broadcasting camera disappeared, and Woojin walked out. Park-sahngoh abruptly stood up from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is nuts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He soloed a 5 star Dungeon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was possible. Park-sahngoh was confident he could do it. However, he was a Rank A Roused. Wasn\u2019t the other person a Rank C? No. He was able to become a Rank C, because Jung-minchan adjusted the Rank from the middle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIs he a Rank A?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This Roused wasn\u2019t at all like Park-jinwoo where his potential had to be unearthed. This person was already a completed product.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is crazy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Was Jung-minchan\u2019s intuition correct?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He saw Minchan on the broadcast. He hurriedly protected Woojin\u2019s identity. They got on a car, then they quickly drove off.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Park-sahngoh made a fist.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes! I knew team leader Jung would succeed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jung-minchan was about to reel in the 3rd Rank A Roused for the Hammer guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwarang guild\u2019s Master Lee-sahngho was sighing as he read over the investigative report prepared by the Support department.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHow confident are you on this report?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAbout 70%.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Roused named Kang-woojin was the subject of this investigation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The conclusion from the investigation was written in this report.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Roused was secretly grown by the Hammer guild. He had disappeared for 5 years, but there weren\u2019t any conclusive evidence as to whether he really disappeared or not. He became active only recently, and he hadn\u2019t tried to raise his Roused Rank. He had been working as a Rank C.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Moreover, he cut in line in front of the Vermillion team, who had arrived first at the Dungeon.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t he just ignore the queue?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was the very first person to write his name for the queue. However, he was a Rank C Roused. He didn\u2019t have the right. His attempt at the Dungeon broke the rules.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He entered the Dungeon using an accident as an excuse. He basically worked around the rules? He also risked going in solo? Moreover, he did this while revealing his identity as a secretly cultivated Roused?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Hammer guild did this to take a mere 5 star Dungeon?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t add up. The Hammer guild is currently struggling to shut the reporters from talking. Couldn\u2019t we draw a conclusion from this fact?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hammer guild wanted to keep Woojin\u2019s identity a secret.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Support team leader, who had made the report, furrowed his brows.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf he isn\u2019t affiliated with the Hammer guild, then his skill can\u2019t be explained.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s correct. It can\u2019t be explained. If a person could become a Rank A just from completing 4 Dungeons, then couple hundred Rank A would exist.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPlease investigate him again. Please approach the investigation as if he was free. Please look at it as a possibility.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Support team leader thought hard on it before he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPresident. There is one way we can find out his affiliation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho\u2019s ears perked up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMr. Kang-woojin is still an incomplete.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Lee-sahngho\u2019s round eyes turned into a crescent shape, then he smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Of course, if they used that method, then they would be able to accurately dig up Woojin\u2019s affiliation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">*</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPooh-haha. I really like that part.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. You are so funny, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin frowned since he couldn\u2019t focus on his study in this environment. He turned his head to see them laughing their heads off at the comedy program. Sunggoo, Woojin and the cat\u2026 Uh? Why is a cat laughing like that?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Maybe this cat has some self-awareness?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">As he looked at them, Jaemin couldn\u2019t stop himself from speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m studying for test, so couldn\u2019t you turn down the volume?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAll right. All right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin half-heartedly pressed the button on the remote, and a single bar of volume went down.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHehe. I\u2019m sorry, student Jaemin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin let out a deep sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did this house become an inn for those youths with nowhere to go?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung. Aren\u2019t you guys worried?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh haha. About what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin gave a half-hearted answer as his eyes never left the tv.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s been 3 days since the reporters started blanketing outside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin\u2019s voice was filled with exhaustion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey\u2019ll start to get tired of me, then they\u2019ll enventually disappear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were a lot less reporters compared to the first day. However, that wasn\u2019t the problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung. Haven\u2019t you seen the internet? They are making a huge ruckus about the person who soloed a 5 star Dungeon. I know it was hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI guess I\u2019m famous now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaemin shook his head from side-to-side at Woojin\u2019s apathetic answer.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were several dozens of speculative articles written about Woojin every day before it got buried.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[The veiled Roused, KangXX. What is his identity?]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">[Hammer guild\u2019s secret Roused.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There were all kinds of speculative reporting rampant everywhere, yet how can the people directly involved be so relaxed?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was annoyed at Jaemin, who kept talking to him. So he brought out his wallet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh. I\u2019m in an inconvenient situation, so I can\u2019t eve go out right now. That being said could you go out an buy some tangerines?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStudent Jaemin. Please buy two bags.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hul. These hyungs looked frighteningly more relaxed than me? Furthermore, I\u2019m the one who is being inconvenienced. He was damn uncomfortable right now.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung. It\u2019s my testing period.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou can have the leftover money as a tip for shopping for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out $50 bill and he waved it around. Jaemin had a sullen expression as he glared at the money. Then he stood up from his chare/</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStudent Jaemin. I want a Melona.\u201d (TLN: ice cream)</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI want a Wonder cone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNyahh, Nyahhng.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin immediately raised the volume as soon as Jaemin left.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. Aren\u2019t we being too much of a bother to student Jaemin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHaha. Where else are we going to go? Everywhere we go the reporters are following us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The reporters had even come looking for them at their home, and they were making life difficult for their family members. This was why the two of them had escaped to Jaemin\u2019s house. It had already been 3 days, but the undercover reporters were still hanging around where they stayed. They couldn\u2019t even go to a Dungeon, so they were just staying inside Jaemin\u2019s one room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAlso, hyung-him. Are you really going to keep turning down the Hammer guild\u2019s offer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cUh. Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ah, it was a great opportunity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They don\u2019t give the vice president seat to just anyone\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. It\u2019s nothing, hyung-nim.\u201c</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddi-ri-ri-ri..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At that moment, Woojin\u2019s hand phone started ringing, so he answered it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, mother. Are the reporters still showing up? Yes. What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin, who had been lying down on his side as he watched tv, suddenly sat up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThey still send those things out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was curious to know what was said on the phone. What made Woojin so surprised?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhew. I understad. If I have the chance later, I\u2019ll go pick it up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo asked the question as soon as Woojin ended the call.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s face turned as serious as Sunggoo had ever seen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSunggoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDid our countries unify yet?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cNot yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy not?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he knew the answer to that question, then he would be the Minister of Unification. Why would he be sitting here?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin pressed firmly on his temple.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His draft notice had come.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been 5 years since the Dungeon had formed, but this damn country was still divided.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Sunggoo. You should come with me to Pyongyang.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Why would we go there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go kill Kim-jungil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? Kim-jungil has been dead for awhile\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat? He\u2019s dead yet the countries aren\u2019t united?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHis son took over.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">After thinking over it for a moment, Woojin spoke again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThen let\u2019s go kill that son of a bitch.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was looking at Sunggoo with a serious face, so he knew Woojin wasn\u2019t making a joke at his expense. So he sobered up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHyung-nim. What\u2019s causing you to act this way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMy draft notice was issued.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo\u2019s expression turned serious. Woojin abruptly stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyung-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cLet\u2019s go! Let\u2019s unite the country. Let\u2019s unite it before I have to join the army.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cH\u2026hyung-nim. Please calm down.

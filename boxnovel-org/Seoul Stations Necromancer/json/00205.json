style=\"\"> \"Where is he?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the spacecraft's hatch closed, Dr. Toppler took off his helmet, and he was the first to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Leone had a bitter expression on his face as he looked at the anxious professor.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"He\u2019s in the recovery room.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler was able to read many things from his expression, so he opened the door to the recovery room with a gloomy heart.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"P...professor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler looked the same except he was a bit older. \u00a0It seemed Kim-kahngchul was deeply moved by this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He really had opened his eyes in the real world.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What happened to Earth\u2019s Code?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"...I failed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ha-ah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler let out a long sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So what was the point in awakening Kahng-woojin, who only had the Recovery Code? \u00a0If they wanted a Rollback, they needed a reference point in the form of the Planet Code.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Is there really a need to do a Rollback, professor?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Can\u2019t you just save everyone just like me?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ha-ah.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Kim-kahngchul\u2019s words, Toppler shook his head from side to side as he let out a sigh. \u00a0Their resources were already depleted, and the presence of any life was absent in their home. \u00a0In such a situation, what would happen if tens of thousands of people were to awaken at the same time?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even without an external cause, the people would self-destruct.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was inside the VR world, but humans fought each other for power through an endless war. \u00a0It was human nature.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul\u2019s expression still indicated that he didn\u2019t comprehend the reasoning behind the Rollback.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ha-ah. \u00a0Once we reach our base on the moon, you\u2019ll be educated at the Readjustment Center...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler stopped speaking as he looked at the time displayed on the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why did everything get so twisted?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Should he have followed the advice of the \u00a0Council? \u00a0Should he have made more preparations by running more tests?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His meeting with Kahng-woojin was a small event, yet it had a butterfly effect. \u00a0\u00a0Now events had spiraled out of control.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Please listen to me carefully.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes, professor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul listened to Dr. Toppler\u2019s words as if it was gospel. \u00a0He was reverent as if he was in the presence of a god.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"When one connects to the Virtual World, an avatar is created. \u00a0We call this the Login.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul was already aware of this fact. \u00a0He didn\u2019t even think of VR earth as being real. \u00a0He found it easier to think of it as a game. \u00a0No, he was living proof of this fact.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I was finally able to log out.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Exactly.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul thought of it as escaping the virtual world, yet it wasn\u2019t as if the real world was a good place to live.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One had to always struggle for survival in this place. \u00a0It was a world that might be relying on a \u00a0hope that might have already flown the coop.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Just be open to this possibility. \u00a0What would happen if the beings in the Virtual Reality was logged out into this world?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It is as I said. \u00a0I\u2019m not talking about logging out a person that was logged in. \u00a0What if the stuff in the virtual reality could appear in reality.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That is......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Why was virtual reality called virtual?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a non-tangible abstraction of a physical object. \u00a0The world existed only in the simulated space.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"We are able to login to their reality. \u00a0What if they could login to ours?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This was beyond Kim-kahngchul\u2019s wildest dreams.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If a person of the VR world could login to reality, what should it be called? \u00a0Was it an act of creation from nothingness? \u00a0Was it a descent into this world?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It will be the same as how we can go to the VR Earth. \u00a0We\u2019ll be able to bring the beings in the VR to this place.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If that is possible\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"We are trying to bring the VR Earth to this solar system. \u00a0That VR Earth will become the new earth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The real earth had used up all its resources, and it was in ruins. \u00a0This was a last ditch attempt at saving the population of earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was terraforming through Virtual Reality.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">An enormous amount of time had passed to make this into reality. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"So what will happen to this earth?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"It\u2019ll stay the same.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Earth wasn\u2019t the target of the terraforming. \u00a0Earth was an ark that\u2019ll store the sleeping population until it was possible to move into the new earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \u201cMars will be terraformed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Huh.... \u00a0If that is possible then....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Humanity would gain a new earth, and when they escape the VR World, they\u2019ll be able to live new lives. \u00a0They\u2019ll be able to live on the new earth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"This is why we need a Reset.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"......?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What\u2019s the point in bringing out an earth that is almost at the brink of ruin?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The outbreak of Dungeons\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The war had worsened, and the VR Earth was being destroyed in many locations.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> This was why they needed a Reset.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"...I see.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> His voice sounded deflated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Now he knew why his life had been repeating. \u00a0Instead of feeling relieved at finding out the reason, the feeling of emptiness grew within.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had achieved his goals in opening his eyes in the real world, but the real world was in ruins. \u00a0Moreover,everyone here had put all their eggs in the basket of the VR World.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"If the 72 Thrones are able to completely take over the worlds of Trahnet, we\u2019ll no longer be able to login. \u00a0Our last hope is the terraforming, yet everything might end before we can attempt it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Aren\u2019t they also humans?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They were supposedly humans sleeping and interfacing with the VR Worlds\u2026. \u00a0If everything within was created by humans connected to the Trahnet, he was having a hard time comprehending the situation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Professor. \u00a0Captain Leone is paging you. \u00a0The Neutralization Equipment is ready to be used again.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> When he heard the voice spoken from outside the door, Dr. Toppler patted Kim-kahngchul\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Trahnet might not have been created by humans.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The VR space was created as a byproduct. \u00a0They had been researching the possibility of instantaneous travel between earth and mars. \u00a0Maybe, humanity coincidentally stumbled onto Trahnet by chance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This might not be a fight between humans. \u00a0They might be fighting for survival against some alien entity. \u00a0It was time for him to go retrieve the only key that\u2019ll allow them to reset the board.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Please rest.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kim-kahngchul\u2019s role was done.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll have to search for a new candidate, who\u2019ll follow his instructions on Resetting earth. \u00a0This person would have to be receptive to receiving a message from the Moon World.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The Neutralization equipment has been activated.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"All right. \u00a0Let\u2019s head in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At captain Leone\u2019s order, the party members hurriedly went into the subway station. \u00a0This place had acted as a great bunker. \u00a0It kept the people sheltered from the repeated wars and the resource depletion.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They relied on the flashlight to traverse the dark path, and they quickly arrived at Kahng-woojin\u2019s capsule.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ready the cutter!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes, sir.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They weren\u2019t going to do this with hands. \u00a0They planned on ripping out the capsule, so they brought an enormous machine cutter.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Open the hatch!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes, sir.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party members opened the poorly closed capsule again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Huhk.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The party members became surprised when they looked into the open hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"He\u2019s not there.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Leone came closers, and he could see that the capsule was empty.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"W...where the hell\u2026.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Where did he go?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This had never happened before.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"What should we do, captain?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Eeek.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Captain Leone gritted his teeth. \u00a0He was also confused, so his thoughts became complicated.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Find him. \u00a0Do a thorough search of the surrounding.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes, sir!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The party members quickly turned on the portable lights, and they searched the surrounding region.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\"Maybe....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Leone was mesmerized as he stared at the empty capsule. \u00a0No one had been able to wake up through one\u2019s own efforts. \u00a0No one had been able to do it, since humanity was connected to Trahnet\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ggee-eek.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler opened the broken door. \u00a0He looked around his surrounding. \u00a0\u00a0It seemed there had been a battle inside the isolation room. \u00a0It was a mess.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u2018 Hoo-ooh\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was all up to him now. \u00a0While captain Leone acquires the Recovery Code, he had to quickly acquire the Earth\u2019s Master Code.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He froze when he exited the isolation room.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Members of the Phantom Unit was on guard duty, and their gazes landed on him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Who are you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He would have felt better if a gun was pointed at him. \u00a0As they asked the question, they moved to either side of Toppler, and they grabbed him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ooh-ook.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was roughly thrown to the floor. \u00a0Then his hands and feet were cuffed. \u00a0As if this wasn\u2019t enough, a Roused with a Binding skill used his ability.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Huh-ooh.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It felt as if the strength in his body had been drained away. \u00a0He lay on the floor as he looked at the members of the Phantom Unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"So who is he?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I have no idea. \u00a0Go get the vice-commander.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes, sir.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The fact that this man had popped out of the previously empty isolation room was suspicious.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka\u2019s eyes turned round when he saw the captured Dr. Toppler.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Dr. Toppler!\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler was drained of energy, so his tongue felt like a leaden weight. \u00a0He let out a weak laugh. \u00a0No, he tried to laugh, but his face wouldn\u2019t move.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Most of the Phantom Unit was Rank A. \u00a0Several of them had already reached Rank S. \u00a0This wasn\u2019t a simple Binding skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Why are you here?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> At Blanka\u2019s question, a member of the Phantom Unit unfroze Dr. Toppler\u2019s face. \u00a0Dr. Toppler tried moving his stiff tongue, and he was barely able to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019m here to save earth.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Hmmm. \u00a0Then why are you sneaking around in secret?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I\u2019m not sneaking around....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I know about you. \u00a0You\u2019ll disappear if there is a door.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \".......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"We\u2019ll wait until the king returns.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Where\u2019s Kahng-woojin?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"The king went to Moon World. \u00a0You\u2019ll stay here until he comes back.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">There wasn\u2019t enough information to predict Dr. Toppler\u2019s behavior pattern, but there was one thing they were sure of. \u00a0He was able to create Dungeons using doors, and he could disappear using this method.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka pointed towards a long antenna on the other side of the control tower. \u00a0If he was tethered there, he won\u2019t be able to run away easily.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was the ideal place to hold Dr. Toppler.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You guys keep an eye on him.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Yes, vice-commander.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The members of the Phantom Unit dragged Dr. Toppler to the antenna, and they started tying him up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"We don\u2019t have time for this. \u00a0We have to save earth immediately.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"You don\u2019t have to save it. \u00a0We\u2019ll protect it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"......\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Blanka made a gesture with his eyes, and his subordinate froze Dr. Toppler again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'Jeez. \u00a0What the hell is this?'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He couldn\u2019t believe what was going on.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could do a force logout. \u00a0However, if he did that, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get Earth\u2019s Code\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Dr. Toppler was tethered to the antenna, and he could see the horizon in the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He was too far away, so it looked like a dot in the sky. \u00a0However, \u00a0Toppler could feel his presence.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> 'Absolute being....'</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> The being that wanted to dominate Trahnet.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">That being had revived.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">If he acquired the Earth\u2019s Code, everything would end. \u00a0He had to Reset everything before that happened, yet he was tied up here\u2026..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A ball of flame landed on top of the Flying Fortress\u2019 deck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a human, who had turned into fire itself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hong-sunggoo opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"This might be more dangerous than I thought. \u00a0He received damage, but everything gets absorbed.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Tell me in more details.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> His old pupil.... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis looked at Sunggoo, who had become a Dragonoid. \u00a0Jaenis spoke again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Mmm. \u00a0It takes damage, but if the attack doesn\u2019t pass a certain threshold, it recovers instantly.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan, who had been listening to the exchange, asked in a serious manner.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Do we have any chance of defeating it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Unfortunately, my attacks can\u2019t get over that threshold.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"We\u2019ll have to fight it to figure this out.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Che-haesol spoke confidently, so a small hope appeared on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [We have to follow the lord\u2019s command]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan agreed with the cold voice of Jaenis.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Let\u2019s run away. \u00a0If the possibility of us winning is low, we should preserve our forces.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They had to protect Sooah. \u00a0This was the command given by Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone differed in opinion, so in the end, they couldn\u2019t come to a decision.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"We won\u2019t solve this by bickering against each other. \u00a0We have to be quick in making our decision. \u00a0Let\u2019s do a majority vote.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Rubbish!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"I agree with the method.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and the others were of different opinion as Jaenis. \u00a0In the end, they started the vote.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, we have two choices. \u00a0If you want to retreat, please raise your hand.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> Jaenis, Bibi, Minchan and several others raised their hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [The lord\u2019s orders are absolute. ]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"That\u2019s right. \u00a0We have to follow master\u2019s words.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi didn\u2019t want to run away, because she was afraid. \u00a0She didn\u2019t care what sacrifices they needed to make. \u00a0The most important thing to her was Kahng-woojin\u2019s last order. \u00a0This was why she wanted to retreat.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Well, if you want to fight, please raise your hand.\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo and Haesol, who had went on reconnaissance, raised their hands. \u00a0\u00a0Minchan was delighted as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Then let us retreat....\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [This is absurd.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A roar that made his ears ring was heard. \u00a0Minchan flinched, and he turned to looked at the Death Knights. \u00a0They were in a line, and they were all raising their hands.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">To make things worse, Bone Dragon Yong Yong was slightly raising its wing.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> \"Ah...\"</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [We fight.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Death Knights.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiba, who was the leader of the Death Knights, stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis\u2019 eyes immediately flickered with red light.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [The master\u2019s command is absolute.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [We aren\u2019t going against his order!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">His voice was resolute.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [We fight. \u00a0We fight to win. \u00a0This is how we protect her.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [.......]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was at a loss for words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiba continued to speak..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [The Immortal isn\u2019t dead.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiba spoke the words everyone was tiptoeing around.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Two beings had clashed, and it had caused an explosion. \u00a0Now the survivor of the two was charging towards them. \u00a0It was a Dimensional lord that was letting out energy of darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was worried about the whereabout of Kahng-woojin, and they had suppressed those feelings. \u00a0However, Kiba boldly spoke about it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [The Immortal doesn\u2019t run away.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Jaenis shook his head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [I forgot about that.]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kiba raised his axe high into the air.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [We\u2019ll fight to win! \u00a0Then we will ready ourselves to greet our king!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> They just had to take care of the battle then wait for their king.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\"> [Ooh-oh-oh-oh!]</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Death Knights.... \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The fighting spirit of the Undead Army burned white hot.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

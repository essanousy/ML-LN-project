\u00a0When Woojin returned to earth, he would have to regain what he had lost with interest from the Daken guild.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou should go do your jobs.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Tauric and the others had been imprisoned until a moment ago, so they were confused by his words. \u00a0Woojin pointed towards the outer castle walls with his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The goblins were fighting the forces of the Coalition. \u00a0\u00a0Some of the goblins were cooperating with each other, and they were pushing into the inner walls. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was a clusterfuck.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin had merely forced his way past the defense to climb to the top of the Saurus Mountain.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAre you planning on letting them all die?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The heroes of the Coalition went forth to calm the situation. \u00a0The only ones left behind with Woojin was the Holy Maiden and the Phantom Unit.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHey, Haesol.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shook the still unconscious Che-haesol. \u00a0However, she didn\u2019t move. \u00a0He placed his hand beneath her nose, and she was still breathing. She just refused to wake up.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat's wrong with her?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cOne of the people from earth injected her with something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was unknown whether it was a sleeping or an anesthetic drug.</span></p><br/><p><span

\u00a0Why can\u2019t \u00a0you do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI was abandoned by the goddess.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When Woojin tilted his head in confusion, she had to give an additional explanation. \u00a0\u00a0Melody crumbled to the ground, and she cried.</span></p><br/><p><span

style=\"\">After hearing Melody\u2019s rambling explanation, Woojin stroked his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo it didn\u2019t matter if you burned the World Tree or not, since these bastards crossed over to Alphen. \u00a0Both scenario would have resulted in me losing the Colony.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

rid of Nakamura, who had occupied his Colony. \u00a0At most, it took him an hour.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cStill, you did good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you burned it, I would have been really angry.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span

the Immortal, so she hadn\u2019t carried out the oracle. \u00a0As a result, she had lost everything.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Immortal\u2019s wrath was avoided, but they had lost time.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat about Haesol, president? \u00a0Is she going to die?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shrugged his shoulders at Blanka\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShe\u2019ll probably wake up when the drug wears off.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He had no idea what kind of drug was used. \u00a0Since she wasn\u2019t dead yet, he doubted she would die.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cBring me any bastard from the Daken guild when you guys come across one. \u00a0I need to know what drug they used if I want to treat it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When the Colony was completely taken over, he would be able to return to earth. \u00a0Whether it was an antidote or a stimulant, earth will have it.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI\u2019m sorry. \u00a0This is all my...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin shrugged his shoulder at Melody\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody\u2019s dropped her head. \u00a0The Immortal was showing such magnanimity\u2026.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cSo you lost your abilities in its entirety??\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin took out Aria\u2019s Circlet, and he pushed it towards her. \u00a0Melody took the Item in a moment of bewilderment, and she looked up at him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t feel anything even though you are touching it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI feel an energy, but\u2026. \u00a0It is completely different from before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHmmm. \u00a0It means you are able to feel magical energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin looked at her, and Melody\u2019s level had remained the same.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was akin to a S Rank Roused, who had lost a Skill.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat noonim is pretty petty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t know if he should call Aria as noonim or a hunk of machine.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are unemployed now. \u00a0Come work under me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">A Holy Maiden had lost her Holy Power, so it wasn\u2019t a problem that could be easily glossed over...</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen my Colony is finished, you can protect it here.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He made a mistake in not appointing an admin for his Colony. \u00a0\u00a0If he had to deal with internal and external problems occurring here, Woojin would have to be tethered to the Colony. \u00a0He would rather appoint a new administrator.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'm going to earth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you answering me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody\u2019s shaking eyes gazed at Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He\u2019ll put her in charge of the Colony? \u00a0Her? \u00a0What was the basis of his belief in her?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou trust me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin laughed as he was dumbfounded by what he had just heard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat if I betray the Immortal again? \u00a0Isn\u2019t that a possibility?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhy would you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin approached Melody, and he put his face in front of her face. \u00a0Their faces were a handspan apart from each other .</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me to help Alphen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">For no reason at all, she felt embarrassed. \u00a0Melody was barely able to answer him.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cIf you betray me, I\u2019ll just throw Alphen away. \u00a0At that point, I wouldn\u2019t care if the gate was closed or not.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh\u2026.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">So that was what he meant.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Melody understood his words, yet a corner of her heart was somehow a bit disappointed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou do what you need to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin went to the side wall of the palace. \u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He approached a flame that was burning with fortitude.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis damn guy isn\u2019t awake yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-rook.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It was as if the flame could understand his words. \u00a0There was no winds, yet the flame danced.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou are too greedy. \u00a0When you think it is enough, I want you to wake up and come to earth. \u00a0I\u2019ll be heading there first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Hwah-roo-roohk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked, and he turned away.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It had been awhile, since Sunggoo had digested the Dragon\u2019s Heart. \u00a0He hadn\u2019t woken up yet, because he was very greedy.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Sunggoo was being patient, because it allowed him to be born much stronger and more perfect.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin\u2019s Colony was restricted, so he couldn't use the Dimensional Store. \u00a0This was why he opened his Achievement Store. \u00a0He had stored up a lot of Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even now his Undead army was on a warpath, and they were constantly giving him more Points.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall i get my equipment back now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Thrash\u2019s Set Items.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The core Ingredients that weren\u2019t sold in the Dimensional Store or the Achievement Store were gathered. \u00a0All the other ingredients were going to be bought through the Store.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn\u2019t spare his Points. \u00a0He started buying all the Ingredients. \u00a0A mountainous amount of Items were bought, and one by one it was put into the Combiner. \u00a0His Items were being completed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">One day had passed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The false rumor, which said the Immortal had betrayed everyone, was put to rest. \u00a0The Coalition was being put back together again.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Unfortunately, the captured members of the Daken guild said the substance injected into Haesol didn\u2019t have an antidote.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, they were lucky in the fact that the drug lost its efficacy as time passed. \u00a0She would wake up later, but they could just carry Haesol around everywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou really won\u2019t regret this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes, sir. \u00a0We\u2019ll return when our team leader wakes up.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The entire Phantom Unit decided to stay behind with Haesol, so Woojin allowed it without much protestation. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t as if earth was in imminent danger, so they weren\u2019t needed.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin knew Thrash\u2019s Executioner was on earth, and he had to find clues there. \u00a0He\u2019ll be able to accomplish this by himself.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cGuard the Gate closely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYou will never lose your way again.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin smirked at Melody\u2019s stout words. \u00a0He patted her shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhen Haesol wakes up, tell her to cross over. \u00a0If Sunggoo wakes up, he should also come to earth immediately.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cShall we head back?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">While Woojin went through many happenings and events, the Undead Army had swept through a large swaths of land. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The nearby Dimensional lords and monsters were eradicated..</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin called back his Undead Army.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he unsummoned them, they resolved into black smoke around Woojin. \u00a0The black smoke swirled around before it disappeared en masse. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He could feel the energy of his Familiars occupying his Summon Room. \u00a0They had an unbreakable bond with Woojin.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cI'll return soon. \u00a0Wait for me.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woojin was sent off by the heroes of Alphen, and he went across the gate.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">***</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Alandal\u2019s Flying Fortress, Bibi\u2019s Castle.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan sat within the Prime Minister\u2019s office, and he let out a long sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is driving me nuts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">How much gravity did Kahng-woojin exert from Alandal?</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say Kahng-woojin was the bulk of what Alandal is. \u00a0His absence created a lot of problem.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The Dimensional lords and the monsters were threatening the people of earth. \u00a0There was an expectation on what role Alandal should play in this situation, yet Alandal hadn\u2019t come up with a solution.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">They used Points through the moving fortress to eradicate the monsters, but the scale of the attack was limited to what a normal guild could do.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Even defeating one of the Dimensional lords forming a Colony was almost beyond their capacity.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Since Alandal couldn\u2019t solve the problem, the negative press was getting louder. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">This in turn increased the stress felt by Jung-minchan.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Beep.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u300cPrime Minister. \u00a0Bibi-nim is here for a visit.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">When he heard the intercom, Minchan brushed his messy hair with his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cTell her to come in.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Ddal-kahk.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">The door opened, and Bibi took short and quick steps to enter the Prime Minister\u2019s office. \u00a0She wasn\u2019t alone.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Kahng-woojin\u2019s dongsaeng Sooah followed Bibi everywhere as if they were close friends. \u00a0Then there was Do-jaemin, who acted as their bodyguard.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Woo-soonghoon followed in behind them.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cMmm. \u00a0What can i do for you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Bibi let out a small smile as she asked him a question.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe are going to Beijing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cYes. \u00a0We will work together with the Chinese government, and we\u2019ll take care of the Colony.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWe aren\u2019t going there.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThat Colony was formed by one of the great lords of Trahnet. \u00a0The risk is too high.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHowever, we already promised them our help. \u00a0If Alandal doesn\u2019t step forward, we won\u2019t be able to avoid an international disaster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Everyone was making a big fuss, because Alandal had been conservative in their actions in recent days. \u00a0If they didn\u2019t step forward this time around, Alandal\u2019s renown as the country, who protects earth, would crumble away in a single day.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">However, Bibi felt differently in regards to Minchan\u2019s worries. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">She was resolute. </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cRejected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin spoke up to give an additional explanation.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cPrime Minister Jung. \u00a0I also think we shouldn\u2019t go there. \u00a0It is too dangerous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHa-ah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Do-jaemin had returned early from Alphen.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">He didn't know what Do-jaemin experienced in Alphen, but he back as a very cautious youth. \u00a0He turned down doing anything dangerous, and he only stayed next to Kahng-sooah at all times.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cThis is a problem where the existence of Alandal is on the line. \u00a0We can\u2019t always avoid the problems.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">At Jung-minchan\u2019s serious words, Bibi playfully shook her head from side to side.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cAh ah. \u00a0I don't care. \u00a0I'm more interested in listening to my master rather than guarding earth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span

\u00a0They existed solely for caring for Kahng-woojin. \u00a0They were founded to take care of all the miscellaneous work.</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">\u201cHuh huh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span style=\"\">Minchan let out a hearty laugh. \u00a0The thoughts that had complicated and stressed him out lessened a little bit.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Feeling somewhat helpless, he watched a multicolored parrot flapping its wings as it flew through the air. A small bell could be seen attached to its claw, and the parrot looked very pleased with itself. It somehow seemed licentious, and even had a black strip of cloth wrapped around its head, covering one of its eyes. The remaining visible eye gleamed brightly as it flew out from the mountain peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just wait for Lord Fifth, you old hag. And as for you, my beloved concubine, don\u2019t worry, Lord Fifth will be coming back for you. I\u2019ll risk everything to rescue you from this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind the parrot was the tier 7 alchemist, the old woman. Her face was a mass of fury as she shot after the parrot at top speed. Behind her was a beautiful young woman, clad in a white robe, the picture of purity and innocence. This was the same young woman who Meng Hao had encountered after challenging the seventh level of the Medicine Pavilion, the clan Junior Sister named Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Miserable shrieking could be heard in the distance, and Meng Hao could just barely make out a beautiful peacock, gasping and struggling in vain to rise to its feet. From the look of the situation, it had just experienced some unimaginable catastrophe.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sighed, feeling quite sorry for the peacock. Anything with feathers that showed up in front of the parrot would find it difficult to escape the bird and its fiendish hobbies.</p><br/><p>As soon as the parrot flew out, it caught sight of Meng Hao, and its uncovered eye lit up. It hurried over and began to cry out plaintively.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, save me! Master, this old hag is out of control! She\u2019s trying to kill me! Save me, master!\u201d As the parrot cried out, the bell attached to its claw suddenly made a popping sound and transformed into the meat jelly, which also began to cry out to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, here you are, finally! There\u2019s a bully following us! Master, she\u2019s a real bully!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not too far behind, the furious old woman caught sight of Meng Hao, as did the young woman in the white robe. The young woman\u2019s jaw dropped in surprise, as if the Meng Hao in her mind couldn\u2019t possibly have anything to do with this shameless parrot.</p><br/><p>Clearing his throat, Meng Hao hurriedly backed away, and then made to continue on his way as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything that was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, save me\u2026.\u201d the parrot screeched immediately, flying toward Meng Hao at top speed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao waved his hand, and his body disappeared in a minor teleportation. When he reappeared off in the distance, the parrot immediately changed directions and continued to speed toward him. As for Meng Hao, he suddenly seemed to radiate an air of righteousness. Expression solemn, he began to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not know you, evildoer! Exactly who the hell are you?\u201d he said. Then a slightly confused expression appeared on his face as he looked at the pursuing old woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao!\u201d squawked the parrot, glancing back the old woman, who was about to catch up. \u201cI have spirit stones!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold your tongue, evildoer!\u201d said Meng Hao, stopping in place. His face was somber, as if he was the sole representative of justice. \u201cThere is no enmity between us, and yet you try to frame me? Well, never mind. I might as well just put you in your place right now!\u201d With that, he waved his right hand.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t even have a chance to unleash a divine ability. Before anything could actually happen, the parrot let out a miserable shriek, and then its body went stiff, as if it had just been seriously injured. Then, it shot directly into Meng Hao\u2019s sleeve.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and inwardly cursed the parrot\u2019s unconvincing performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior,\u201d he said to the old woman, cautiously backing up. \u201cThis bird is vile and detestable. I\u2019m just on my way back from visiting Pill Elder, after having been fortunate enough to become a tier 8 alchemist. Junior will help you take care of this bird, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman\u2019s cultivation base was so profound that Meng Hao couldn\u2019t assess it. In the Dao of Alchemy Division, alchemy was the true Dao, and one\u2019s cultivation base played a mere supporting role. However, because of all the life-or-death scenarios that Meng Hao had faced, he still edged backward carefully as if guarding against any contingencies, simultaneously flashing his tier 8 alchemist\u2019s command medallion.</p><br/><p>The old woman looked at Meng Hao backing away, and said nothing. Eventually, he transformed into a beam of light that fled into the distance. At that point, the old woman\u2019s eyes flashed.</p><br/><p>The young woman hesitated for a moment, then quietly said, \u201cGrand-aunt, that bird\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust forget about it,\u201d said the old woman, turning to head back toward the mountain. The young woman followed.</p><br/><p>Along the way, the young woman couldn\u2019t refrain from asking, \u201cGrand-aunt, Fang Hao\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman did nothing other than shake her head. A flash of insight could be seen deep within her eyes. From the moment Meng Hao had challenged the seventh level of the Medicine Pavilion, she knew that he would be a new force coming to the fore of the Dao of Alchemy Division. Then he concocted the Skypalace Sunspirit Pill, which left her shaken inwardly, and also thoroughly convinced that Fang Hao would be a blazing sun of the Dao of Alchemy Division!</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if he was the type of person to nurse grudges. Because of the level of her cultivation base, she had been aware all along that the parrot and the meat jelly belonged to him. Furthermore, she had intentionally driven them out at the exact moment in which Meng Hao had been passing by.</p><br/><p>Her entire goal had been to resolve any feelings of resentment Meng Hao might have toward her.</p><br/><p>She was much higher than him in terms of clan seniority, had a profound cultivation base, and had been famous for many years. Therefore, she was well versed in finding clever ways to resolve problems, and the scene that had played out just now was just the method she had come up with to resolve her issues with Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao continued flying through the Dao of Alchemy Division. When he realized that the old woman wasn\u2019t pursuing him, his eyes flickered. He, of course, understood her intention.</p><br/><p>As they emerged from the Dao of Alchemy Division, the parrot\u2019s spirits seemed to lift. It flew out of his sleeve and arrogantly cried, \u201cYou just wait for Lord Fifth, you old hag! Lord Fifth will be back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Off to the side, the meat jelly nodded its head vigorously. For the meat jelly to act in such a way was clear evidence of the sufferings these two dunces had endured in recent days.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as the parrot finished speaking, Meng Hao\u2019s right hand shot out, grabbed the parrot, and dragged it in front of him. The parrot\u2019s eyes bulged.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing!? What are you grabbing your Lord Fifth for!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say just now about spirit stones?\u201d Meng Hao asked coldly. Whenever he and the parrot interacted, it was never with courtesy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit stones?\u201d the parrot pretended to be confused. \u201cWhat spirit stones?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao glared at the parrot, and then suddenly, a bashful expression appeared on his face. The parrot\u2019s eyes immediately went wide, and it began to shiver.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly gasped and let out a muffled shriek.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that expression again! Finished! We\u2019re finished! Whenever that expression appears, it means the end is near! The bird is really done for this time\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The parrot\u2019s eyes filled with fear, and before Meng Hao could even say anything, it fawningly said, \u201cHahaha! I\u2019m just playing around with you! Spirit stones\u2026 ah, spirit stones. That old hag has a whole vein of spirit stones underneath that mountain of hers. Whenever you feel like going to steal them, Meng Hao, I\u2019ll help you dig them up.</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao heard the words \u2018vein of spirit stones,\u2019 his eyes began to shine. He then began to ask about the specifics.</p><br/><p>One man, one bird, and one meat jelly flew back toward the ancestral mansion, conversing with each other in hushed tones.</p><br/><p>By now, evening was falling. Off in the distance, the setting sun filled the sky with golden light. When Meng Hao got back to the ancestral mansion, he saw numerous clan members heading toward the East District. Meng Hao looked in that direction and suddenly remembered what was going to be happening in the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cEast Ascension Sun!\u201d Muttering to himself, he changed directions and flew toward the East District. The parrot perched on his shoulder, and the meat jelly transformed into a bell and attached itself to the parrot\u2019s claw.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the East District\u2019s East Ascension Pagoda, Fang Wei smiled as he chatted with the various Chosen. Not once did he mentioned the event which had just sent the entire Fang Clan astir.</p><br/><p>Although nothing seemed unusual about the way the other Chosen were carrying themselves, all of them had long since caught on to the fact that something unusual had happened. The mere fact that Fang Wei had brushed the matter aside was what had led them to this conclusion in the first place.</p><br/><p>At one point, somebody brought up Fang Mu again. Just like before, Fang Wei didn\u2019t openly admit that he was Fang Mu, and yet, he looked over and gave Li Ling\u2019er an apologetic smile. Quite a few Chosen noticed this, and began to consider what it meant.</p><br/><p>Li Ling\u2019er snorted coldly, and even more derision could be seen in her expression. She was even more convinced than Sun Hai that Meng Hao was Fang Mu. She hated Fang Mu deeply, but when she looked at Fang Wei, her expression was one of ridicule. She seemed to be sickened by him.</p><br/><p>When Fang Wei saw the look on her face, his eyes flickered imperceptibly. He suddenly changed the topic and began to chat about the East Ascension Sun.</p><br/><p>Sun Hai\u2019s eyes flashed, but when he thought about how the girl he adored was a member of the Fang Clan, he didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he pulled another of the Fang Clan Chosen off to the side and asked whether or not he knew a member of the Fang Clan clan named Fang Yu.</p><br/><p>The sky was growing dark, and more and more members of the Fang Clan clustered together around Brightmoon Lake. Originally, they had been waiting quietly, but now they were all discussing the matter of Meng Hao concocting the Skypalace Sunspirit Pill. Although the Dao Bell had long since ceased to toll, the sound of it still rang within their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Fang Hao actually concocted a Skypalace Sunspirit Pill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the three sacred pills! I never could have imagined that he would be able to concoct one of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Fang Hao returned, I didn\u2019t really think much of him. He was kind of quiet. But now he\u2019s causing all sorts of waves!\u201d</p><br/><p>Words such as these echoed out constantly. Fang Wei\u2019s expression was the same as ever, making it impossible to determine what he was thinking. In contrast, Fang Yunyi\u2019s face only continued to grow darker. Then he looked over at Fang Xi near the lakeshore, chatting excitedly with the clan members around him, and he snorted coldly.</p><br/><p>A cold gleam flickered in his eyes, and his lips twitched into an icy smile; the people he had arranged to take care of Fang Xi were now closing in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe direct bloodline\u2026 is crap! They had their glory in the past, but now they're in decline. The Fang Clan\u2026 is no longer a place where they hold the upper hand!\u201d Fang Yunyi snorted again. \u201cToday is the day when I humiliate Fang Xi of the direct bloodline!\u201d His eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fang Xi stood in the crowd, excitedly flaunting his recent experiences to the clan members standing next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf all the people over all the years in the Dao of Alchemy Division, nobody has ever been able to concoct that medicinal pill. But my Coz concocted it!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe had a 30,000-meter Bloodline Gatebeam, and he even challenged the seventh level of the Medicine Pavilion. And then he concocted the legendary Skypalace Sunspirit Pill. That\u2019s my Coz! Fang Hao!\u201d The other clan members panted as they heard the stories of Meng Hao. More and more people were elevating their personal estimation of Meng Hao\u2019s status to the same level as Fang Wei.</p><br/><p>About this time, two young men appeared nearby, pushing their way through the crowd. Their expressions were icily arrogant as they neared Fang Xi, then rudely waved their hands, causing a burst of wind to materialize. It descended onto Fang Xi, causing his face to flicker. He tried to fight back, but was no match. He made a slight grunt as he was involuntarily shoved backward ten paces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe clan has ordered that it is prohibited to be loud and disorderly during the rise of the East Ascension Sun!\u201d said one of the two young men, his eyes cold. \u201cAnyone who violates the rule will be stripped of the qualifications to observe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d said Fang Xi, looking up with rage in his eyes. However, when he saw who the two young men were, his face fell. The other clan members in the area also looked shocked, and immediately backed up.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

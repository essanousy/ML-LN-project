The night was dark and charming; a soft breeze brushed gently against his face.</p><br/><p>He rotated his Cultivation base as he slowly treated himself. Taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes. A few days passed.</p><br/><p>The parrot and the meat jelly emerged during that time, then left to go play on the sea. It was impossible to tell what vices they had indulged in, but they came back smelling like seawater. They made quite the commotion as they returned to perch on Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are immoral!\u201d cried the meat jelly, preparing to launch into a speech. \u201cThat white crane\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d replied the Parrot, glaring. It was just about to continue speaking when suddenly it made an \u201ceee?\u201d sound and then looked around. Before it could say anything, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes snapped open and he stuffed the parrot and the meat jelly into his bag of holding, then cleared his throat and continued to meditate.</p><br/><p>At the moment, Patriarch Reliance was completely torn about what to do, so he didn\u2019t notice what had just happened. He was utterly helpless in terms of Meng Hao; during the past few days, he had grown increasingly anxious. It was now clear based on Meng Hao\u2019s actions that he planned to stay long term to restore himself to health.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little bastard, you just wait. The Patriarch is going to go all out!\u201d Patriarch Reliance lifted his head up and roared. He had been in conflict over the past several days, and at this point, couldn\u2019t wait any more. Clenching his teeth, he waved his sleeve, causing his body to grow transparent. It appeared as if he had separated some of his essence, which then began to swirl in the air above his hand, emanated a multicolored glow.</p><br/><p>It rapidly turned into what appeared to be a Spirit Fruit, from which a delicate fragrance wafted out. Anyone who looked at it would instantly feel themselves palpitating with eagerness.</p><br/><p>Off to the side, Guyiding Tri\u2019rain\u2019s eyes went wide and she began to breathe heavily. She recognized this object; it was a strand of essence from Patriarch Reliance\u2019s clone form.</p><br/><p>Clenching his teeth and enduring the distress of it all, Patriarch Reliance lifted his right foot and then stamped it down onto the surface of the palace. Instantly, a white crane appeared. As soon as it flew out, it began to change shape into a gray eagle, which then grabbed the Spirit Fruit with its talons. After that, it passed through the walls of the palace and shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance watched anxiously as the gray eagle left. He felt distressed, and couldn\u2019t stop from stamping his feet back and forth in nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrewed over. I\u2019m screwed over big time\u2026. However, as long as that little bastard leaves, the Patriarch can deal with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The gray eagle shot through the sky with incredible speed toward Meng Hao\u2019s location. In only the space of a few breaths, it appeared near him.</p><br/><p>It kicked up a stiff wind that caused Meng Hao\u2019s eyes to open. He looked up into the sky, and as soon as he caught sight of the gray eagle, his pupils constricted. Clearly, the most important part was the Spirit Fruit it held in its talons.</p><br/><p>At a single glance, he could sense the ripples that emanated out from within the fruit, as well as the colorful glow which surrounded it. It almost looked like an Immortal Fruit. Even just glancing at the Immortal Fruit provoked a reaction from his internal injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing can really heal injuries\u2026.\u201d thought Meng Hao. He hesitated for a moment, then smiled bitterly. Patriarch Reliance really had hit him in a soft spot with this particular move. He sighed inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s such a blatant move\u2026. Well, he is Patriarch Reliance, after all, so I guess it\u2019s not that strange.\u201d It was with a wry smile and a conflicted heart that he watched the gray eagle start to fly in circles over his head. It seemed as if it was simply waiting for him to snatch the Spirit Fruit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnatch it!\u201d roared Patriarch Reliance. \u201cCome on! Why aren\u2019t you snatching it!?\u201d At the moment, he wanted nothing more than to throttle Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>After struggling back and forth for a while, Meng Hao took a deep breath. His eyes filled with determination. He simply couldn\u2019t ignore such temptation. He had just made the decision, and was about to make a move, when suddenly, the gray eagle loosened its talons.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Fruit slowly fell down from the sky with great accuracy to land directly in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance burst out with hearty laughter, and he looked extremely proud of himself. Then he harrumphed to express the superiority of his intellect. Finally, he sent his Divine Sense into the gray eagle, causing it to let out a cheerful cry filled with complacent pride.</p><br/><p>Because Meng Hao was staring in shock, he didn\u2019t notice that at some point, the parrot had stuck its head out of the bag of holding and was looking intoxicatedly at the gray eagle. Suddenly, it transformed into a black streak of light that shot out at top speed.</p><br/><p>Back in the palace, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s Divine Sense was still in the gray eagle, controlling it as it flew off into the distance. \u201cYou little bastard! The Patriarch has lived for years and years, and you want to try to compete with me? Let\u2019s see what reason you can come up with to stay now! Hahaha! The Patriarch is\u2026 huh? Ahh? AAGGHHH!!\u201d In the midst of his complacency and laughter, he suddenly shuddered, and his eyes went wide with disbelief.</p><br/><p>He could clearly see the black beam of light shooting out from Meng Hao\u2019s bag of holding. Then, the black shadow shot through the air to penetrate the rear end of the gray eagle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 what is it doing?\u201d said Patriarch Reliance, trembling.</p><br/><p>The gray eagle shook. It was illusory, after all, so it twisted and then transformed into countless dots of glittering light that spread out in all directions.</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through Patriarch Reliance and he stared blankly. Because his Divine Sense had been inside the gray eagle, everything that had happened just now\u2026 he had also experienced.</p><br/><p>His face was filled with disbelief, but it only took a moment for him to react. His eyes went wide and were shot with blood as he lifted his head up and roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you, you\u2026 you actually\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cRidiculous! You actually\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d After understanding exactly what had happened, Patriarch Reliance was filled with unspeakable, unprecedented rage and madness.</p><br/><p>All of the the lands of Saint\u2019s Island shook, and enormous waves rolled out across the sea. The faces of all the Cultivators on the island flickered as they wonder what had just transpired.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was also a bit frightened. When he saw the parrot returning, that intoxicated look on its face, his scalp went numb.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned bird,\u201d he thought, taking a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2026 it actually did\u2026 it did Patriarch Reliance?\u201d The parrot\u2019s expression was one of deep emotion as it returned. Everything that had happened completely exceeded Meng Hao\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>The parrot still seemed to be savoring the aftertaste of what had just occurred. As it returned, Meng Hao could hear it muttering.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange. How come it couldn\u2019t handle being done? I barely started and it disappeared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao grabbed the parrot and violently threw it into his bag of holding. Then he smiled wryly and collected up the Spirit Fruit. He quickly popped it into his mouth, then transformed into a beam of light and shot up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in this place!\u201d he yelled loudly. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here!\u201d He immediately shot off into the distance. Even as he did, the area he had just been in collapsed into a huge crater.</p><br/><p>The ground trembled and shook, and huge waves surged across the sea. Patriarch Reliance was completely in a rage; his fury was burning to a shocking level. Although he couldn\u2019t do anything to Meng Hao, he still couldn\u2019t accept such humiliation. He was just on the verge of revealing his true self to swallow up the parrot, when Guyiding Tri\u2019rain came running over. She grabbed Patriarch Reliance\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, calm down!\u201d she said. \u201cThink about what\u2019s most important!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away! The Patriarch is gonna go all out with this guy!\u201d Patriarch Reliance took a few steps forward. A rumbling sound filled the air as the palace opened up to reveal the lands of Saint\u2019s Island stretching out below.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, think three times before you act!\u201d urged Guyiding Tri\u2019rain. \u201cMeng Hao\u2019s already gone! If you reveal yourself now, you\u2019ll undo all your previous hard work!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance stopped in place with his foot in the air. Veins bulged out on his face, and his entire person resembled a volcano that might erupt at any moment. His face twisted with struggle; on one hand, he was thinking about the happiness he could enjoy in the future. At the same time, he was thinking about the revenge that needed to be exacted for what the parrot had done to him.</p><br/><p>In the midst of his struggle, he stomped his foot down. Forcing himself to endure everything, his body trembled and his head seemed about to explode. Clearly, his restraint had reached its very limits.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance could feel an indescribable fire burning inside of him. He felt as if he had to find someone to beat up to vent the rage and toxic anger that raged in his heart.</p><br/><p>As he forced himself to continue to be patient, Saint\u2019s Island ceased trembling, and the sea returned to calmness. Meng Hao transformed into a beam of light that shot through the air. His face was unsightly, but his internal injuries were now healing at a shockingly fast rate.</p><br/><p>In the time it takes an incense stick to burn, all the pores on Meng Hao\u2019s body seemed to have opened. The injuries inside of him were healed, and an intense coldness rushed out through his skin into the air, transforming into flakes of black snow that drifted in the air.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath and increased his speed. His mind spun with countless ideas as he tried to come up with more reasons to stay on the island. However, he knew that Patriarch Reliance\u2019s rage had been kindled to its peak, and the slightest mistake on his part could cause it to explode out.</p><br/><p>If that happened, Patriarch Reliance would definitely run away again, and that did not fit in with Meng Hao\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the fault of that bastard parrot. It ruined my big plan.\u201d He sighed as he neared the border region of the island. He decided to slow down a bit, but when he did, the land beneath him would quake and the nearby mountains would collapse.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled bitterly and then continued to speed along. Soon, he saw the sea off in the distance, as well as the last Cultivator city of Saint\u2019s Island. Right now it was day, and the city should have been bustling with noise and excitement, but instead, all the shops were closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch turtle, you\u2019ve pushed me into a corner!\u201d cursed Meng Hao inwardly. He clenched his teeth and then suddenly stopped in mid-air. His eyes began to glow with an intense light, and his expression was incredibly grim.</p><br/><p>The look on his face caused Patriarch Reliance\u2019s fuming heart to suddenly begin to thump.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hiding in this ancient palace for years,\u201d he thought, \u201ccompletely cut off from anything to do with the Demon Sealers. He shouldn\u2019t be able to sense me\u2026. Not good, not good! Maybe what I did just now was too obvious! When you add in the fact that I couldn\u2019t control my temper, maybe the little bastard saw through it all!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked around, his face grim. Finally, he spoke in a cold voice: \u201cI\u2019m not sure which member of the senior generation in this place doesn\u2019t want Meng Hao to stick around. Fine, I\u2019m leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Complete silence was the only response.</p><br/><p>When Patriarch Reliance heard Meng Hao\u2019s words, he immediately heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here. He actually thinks I\u2019m someone else. Alright, that will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao glanced around before his gaze finally came to rest on the city up ahead. He lifted his hand up and pointed at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019m lacking in Spirit Stones, and happen to have a random assortment of magical items in my bag of holding. I\u2019ll sell them in this city, and as soon as I\u2019m finished, I\u2019ll leave this place!\u201d With that, Meng Hao flicked his sleeve and headed toward the city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With an anxious, earnest expression, she examined the jade slip. Perhaps her latent talent was average. After looking at it for the space of about ten breaths, she reached out her hand, which began to glow with a purple light\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Yunlai\u2019s eyes began to glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, Junior Sister Chen! Okay, take out a medicinal plant seed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ling quickly opened her bag of holding and took out a seed. She placed it on her open palm, then, her face very serious, began to catalyze it. The violet Qi in her hand grew denser, until it seemed it couldn\u2019t grow any stronger. The seed began to wriggle, and then three leaves sprouted out of it.</p><br/><p>Many of the surrounding onlookers noticed this, and then looked at Chen Ling. Her face grew red, and she was clearly excited. She looked at Bai Yunlai expectantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo produce three leaves on your first try shows that you have pretty good latent talent. Junior Sister Chen Ling, according to my calculations, you have a ten percent chance of becoming a master alchemist in the future.\u201d He sighed emotionally, looking a bit jealous. It seemed that someone who could produce three leaves was uncommon among the hundred thousand apprentice alchemists. Bai Yunlai quickly recorded the results of her catalyzing.</p><br/><p>After that\u2026</p><br/><p>The voice of the man lecturing about alchemy techniques drifted over. He sounded calm and solemn. \u201cYou will join District Two Valley Thirteen.\u201d His face was austere as he looked at her.</p><br/><p>In a low voice, Bai Yunlai offered an explanation: \u201cThe hundred thousand apprentice alchemists of the Eastern Pill Division are separated into Districts One to Four. Generally speaking, only those with outstanding latent talent can enter District Two. Junior Sister Chen, go on over there to Master Uncle Zhou. Good fortune is with you today!\u201d Looking excited and nervous, Chen Ling immediately ran over.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Fang, it\u2019s your turn now,\u201d said Bai Yunlai with a sigh. He looked at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stood there thoughtfully for a moment. The technique described in the jade slip was simple, but obviously, the implementation of it was fantastic. Essentially, it could catalyze the medicinal age of medicinal plants, and as such, could be viewed as a force of nature.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems only simple medicinal plants can be catalyzed using this technique,\u201d thought Meng Hao. \u201cBasically, you use spiritual energy to nourish the medicinal plant. Even still, this technique is extraordinary. I wonder how the Violet Fate Sect prevents it from being stolen\u2026.\u201d He silently retrieved a medicinal plant seed from his bag of holding and placed it on his palm. He looked at it for a moment, then used the technique described in the jade slip to begin catalyzing it.</p><br/><p>He had two Core Seas, the first one of which contained five Perfect Dao Pillars. Before arriving at the Violet Fate Sect, he had used the Sublime Spirit Scripture to once again form the second one.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the only Cultivation base visible to outsiders was the aura of his second Core Sea. Its power caused the purple glow to appear on his hand. It was immediately apparent that the glow was thicker and brighter than that created by Chen Ling.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the seed in Meng Hao\u2019s hand began to wriggle. Then it sprouted one leaf, two leaves, three leaves\u2026 in the blink of an eye it had already sprouted seven leaves!</p><br/><p>The purple glow in Meng Hao\u2019s hand grew blinding, filling the air. Instantly, all the surrounding apprentice alchemists looked over, shocked. All eyes were on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The blinding rays of light were unthinkable, unbelievable. The man lecturing about alchemy techniques looked over wide-eyed, staring openly at Meng Hao. Next to him, Chen Ling stared in shock.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Yunlai, his jaw dropped, and he rubbed his eyes vigorously before staring in complete shock.</p><br/><p>Everything was quiet as all onlookers stared at the violet glow and the medicinal seed plant in Meng Hao\u2019s hand. Then, Meng Hao continued to use the technique. He fell into a strange state, as if he himself had turned into nature, and this seed had become a part of him.</p><br/><p>It was a marvelous feeling, and as Meng Hao immersed himself in it, the seed suddenly sprouted an eighth leaf, then a ninth\u2026. A cracking sound pealed out as the seed continued to grow. The emerald green leaf sprouts grew larger, wrapping up and around Meng Hao\u2019s right arm.</p><br/><p>The white-haired, wrinkled old man who had been dozing behind Bai Yunlai opened his eyes. They glowed with an ancient light as he looked at Meng Hao. At the same time, they filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hadn\u2019t just caused new leaves to sprout, he had grown an entire plant. Meng Hao\u2019s mind reeled as the cracking sounds from moments ago pulled him out of the bizarre state he had just been in. His eyes flickered, and he frowned. He hadn\u2019t intended to show off such talent, and actually, he had been completely immersed in the strange state just now, which had somehow led his actions.</p><br/><p>He hesitated for a moment, his face pale. His Cultivation base was dried up, and following the reduction in his spiritual power, the medicinal plant also began to slowly wither up. Soon it died, and then fell off of Meng Hao\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Panting, Meng Hao stepped back a few paces, eyes shining with confusion.</p><br/><p>Everything was deathly silent. It seemed like Bai Yunlai couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. He had been in the Violet Fate Sect for years, and had never seen someone perform such an astonishing feat the first time they practiced catalyzing. He looked at Meng Hao as if he weren\u2019t even human.</p><br/><p>All of the surrounding apprentice alchemists were completely shocked. What they had just witnessed exceeded their imaginations. The middle-aged man panted as he looked at Meng Hao, his eyes shining with passion.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026.\u201d said Meng Hao, hesitating for a moment. He was a little bit scared, unsure of what he should say. At this moment, the old man behind Bai Yunlai stood up and walked forward to stand next to Meng Hao. He reached a hand out to grab Meng Hao\u2019s wrist. His spiritual power burst out, flowing through Meng Hao\u2019s body, examining him.</p><br/><p>The power was incapable of completely examining Meng Hao. Despite having some suspicions, he could only see Meng Hao\u2019s second Core Sea, which contained the power of the sixth level of Qi Condensation.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t able to see the true color of the Core Sea either, as it had been completely transformed by the frightening power of the meat jelly. As far the man could see, everything was normal.</p><br/><p>Eventually, he released his grip. He picked up the withered medicinal plant and looked at it carefully for a moment. Then he returned his gaze to Meng Hao. His eyes were now filled with the glow of praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst rate latent talent! You will join District One Valley One!\u201d A wide smile covered the old man\u2019s face as he clasped Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder. Then he flew up into the sky, taking the withered medicinal plant with him.</p><br/><p>As he flew off, the entire valley broke out into a huge commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst rate latent talent!! No wonder his catalyzing is so astonishing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith latent talent like that, he\u2019s destined to become a master alchemist, which we haven\u2019t seen for years\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019ve heard of people having first rate latent talent, but I\u2019ve never heard of someone as inhuman as this! He catalyzed full plant growth!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the air filled with conversations, Bai Yunlai approached Meng Hao, eye shining with excitement. \u201cJunior Brother Fang,\u201d he said, \u201cmake sure to watch out for yourself from now on. You have first rate latent talent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould there have been a mistake?\u201d asked Meng Hao, still hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way! Elder Wang tested you personally. How could he possibly make a mistake? It seems he took that medicinal plant to go show other Elders. Haha! Junior Brother Fang, you\u2019re going to be famous! Come come, I\u2019ll take you to District One Valley One. It\u2019s like a celestial paradise. I look in every time I pass it, but I\u2019ve never been able to go in.\u201d He pulled Meng Hao along with him, leaving behind the hubbub and shining eyes. Even after they were gone, the commotion continued to echo out.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Soon half a month had gone by. Meng Hao was now much more familiar with the East Pill Division of the Violet Fate Sect. Division One Valley One wasn\u2019t very large, but was occupied by few people, clearly much less than other valleys.</p><br/><p>The scenery was enchanting. The mountains were lush, and a small mountain stream flowed down from up above. Fish swam within its depths, which Meng Hao could see from his house, located just north of the stream. It was a small house with a courtyard outside.</p><br/><p>Within the courtyard was a small garden where he could grow medicinal plants. Currently, Meng Hao sat cross-legged in the courtyard, holding a scroll of bamboo slips. The scroll was filled with handwriting and pictures, all describing various medicinal plants.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sat all morning and into noon reading the scroll. Finally, he looked up. He smelled the medicinal aroma that filled the air and listened to the gurgling of the stream. A light mist filled the area, causing the valley to truly seem celestial. Maybe that was somewhat of an exaggeration, but there was no denying that this was an ideal place for Cultivation.</p><br/><p>This was basically the number one valley for apprentice alchemists in the entire Sect. Meng Hao had found out that including him, less than fifty people in the entire Sect had the requisite latent talent to live in here. Everyone had their own living quarters where they could study, grow plants and practice pill concocting.</p><br/><p>It was a quiet location, and Meng Hao felt very at home. He was especially happy to read books that weren\u2019t jade slips but actual scrolls. It reminded him of his life as a scholar back in Yunjie County.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred thousand medicinal plants, all different and organized into different categories. Not only do I need to memorize them, I also need to remember their habits and characteristics, how to plant and harvest them, and how to store them. I need to remember which medicinal plants cannot be mixed together, where and how to grow them, and also the proper ratios when using them.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, it\u2019s not just the whole plant itself. The leaves, stems and sap of various plants are all different. Splicing plants together can lead to countless variations. They talk about one hundred thousand medicinal plants, but actually, when you combine everything together, it\u2019s more like a million.\u201d Meng Hao rubbed the bridge of his nose. For the past half month, he had been studying information about medicinal plants every day.</p><br/><p>As an apprentice alchemist of the Violet Fate Sect, he must remember all such information. Of course, there was simply so much information, it was essentially impossible to magically brand it all onto the mind. The only method was rote memorization.</p><br/><p>The more he memorized, the more prepared he would be. Forewarned is forearmed, so to speak; there was no trickery about it. Besides, Meng Hao didn\u2019t find it annoying. He was a born scholar, after all, and this type of environment suited him quite well.</p><br/><p>There was no killing, no danger and treachery, no dealing with the wind and rain of the outside world. Meng Hao attempted not to think about the past, and instead fully immersed himself in the role of Fang Mu. He was in the Violet Fate Sect now, and he intended to take advantage of the peace and quiet. As he examined all the information available to apprentice alchemists, his mind began to swirl with many images. Now he knew that this sort of knowledge, was nature talent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

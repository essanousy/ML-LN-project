If you looked closely, you would be able to tell that within that isolated world were three people. They were screaming, and apparently wished to be able to break out of the world, but could not.</p><br/><p>If Meng Hao were there to see them, he would be incredibly shocked, perhaps even feel his scalp go numb. That was because... he knew two of them!</p><br/><p>One was the dead boy Hong Bin, and the other... was the tenth Echelon cultivator Hai Dongqing!</p><br/><p>As for the third person, it was easy to imagine who it might be. As expected, it was the Echelon cultivator from the Second Nation, who had died by Dao-Heaven's hands.</p><br/><p>Although those three people were already dead, their souls appeared to be sealed inside of that crystal ball. What a bizarre situation!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the man in the Imperial robes opened his eyes, and a mysterious light could be seen glowing within them. He slowly turned to look in the direction of the border between the Third and Fourth Nations. In the same moment, Meng Hao entered the Third Nation.</p><br/><p>This man\u2019s cultivation base was not incredibly high, and he was not even in the Immortal Realm. However, he had a bizarre aura floating around him that made him seem completely mysterious and enigmatic.</p><br/><p>At the same time that he opened his eyes, numerous figures appeared around him, either standing on the mountain peak or floating above it. All of them wore black robes, with cowls that covered their heads, making it impossible to see their faces. However, all of those figures emanated the ripples of the Ancient Realm.</p><br/><p>Of course, cultivators of the Windswept Realm were incapable of breaking through to even the Immortal Realm, let alone the Ancient Realm. And yet here were multiple powerful experts of the Ancient Realm. Furthermore, among the black-robed experts were two or three whose cultivation base ripples were stronger than the others, indicating that they were comparable to Elders from various sects and clans in the Mountain and Sea Realm, with ten or more extinguished Soul Lamps.</p><br/><p>All of them hovered there silently, awaiting the orders of the man in the Imperial robes.</p><br/><p>As for that very man, his expression was the same as ever as he waved his right hand, causing numerous flickering images to appear in front of him. One of those images depicted Meng Hao entering the Third Nation.</p><br/><p>He watched thoughtfully as Meng Hao coughed up blood, his body withering. The man's eyes flickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the girl taken care of?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe sent people to kill her,\u201d said one of the black-robed cultivators, his voice hoarse, like that of an old man. \u201cUnfortunately, she\u2019s very crafty, and has managed to evade them thus far. She's still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe's a dangerous variable,\u201d the man in the Imperial robes said. \u201cGo take care of her yourself, just to be safe. Time is wasting away, so make it happen quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the true Dao!\u201d the black-robed man said earnestly, clasping hands and bowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the true Dao!\u201d responded the man in the imperial robes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the true Dao!\u201d the rest of the black-robed men chanted fervently in unison, lowering their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding Meng Hao... he counts for nothing, much the same as Dao-Heaven. They are ants in a maze, nothing more. Ignore them. If he dares to come to the National Aura Mountain, then just as Dao-Heaven, he will flee in fright and never dare to set foot back into the Third Nation again. We should tangle with the Echelon only if necessary, so leave them alone. They will become useful to us later. Soon, when we leave this mountain, then... we will achieve our grand design!\u201d The man smiled, gazed into the crystal ball for a long moment, and then closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>The black-robed men maintained silence. After clasping hands and bowing, they slowly dispersed, each one heading in a different direction.</p><br/><p>In his Immortal\u2019s cave in the Third Nation, Meng Hao\u2019s heart trembled as he looked down at the blood-colored mask. Then he glanced at the ground. Eyes flickering, he sent out some divine sense into the earth. After a moment passed, he frowned. His divine sense wasn\u2019t able to locate anything unusual.</p><br/><p>However, from the way the mastiff was struggling to awaken, he could tell that its intense thirst was increasing. Meng Hao had never sensed anything like this from the mastiff before.</p><br/><p>It was as if, in order to sate that thirst, the mastiff would not only awaken, but do so in a transmogrified state. It would be different than before, having undergone a drastic transformation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is hidden down there...?\u201d he thought. Instead of doing anything rash, he put the blood-colored mask away, closed his eyes, and continued meditating to heal his injuries.</p><br/><p>With medicinal pills and his Eternal stratum, he recovered rapidly. After only three days, his eyes opened, and they shone with a brilliant light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm sixty percent recovered....\u201d he murmured. \u201cFrom here on out my recovery will naturally slow down.\u201d During the three days he had spent recuperating, the mastiff\u2019s thirst had only gotten stronger.</p><br/><p>He slapped his bag of holding, and the parrot and meat jelly flew out. They looked around nervously for a moment but, seeing no danger, heaved sighs of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dao-Heaven isn't chasing us,\u201d Meng Hao said with a cold snort. Sometimes the parrot and meat jelly acted fearless in the face of death. At other times, they seemed like unbelievable cowards. The whole thing was a huge headache for Meng Hao. He just couldn't believe that they were unaware of the battle that had occurred with Dao-Heaven. He had even considered directly summoning them.</p><br/><p>However, during the heat of the battle, both of them had been busy playing dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t blame Lord Fifth for this,\u201d said the parrot with a guilty chuckle. \u201cConsidering Lord Fifth\u2019s level of skill, a single glance and a few breaths of time would be all it took to wipe Dao-Heaven out thousands of times over. The problem was I really happened to be napping at the time. Hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Third disagrees,\u201d the meat jelly said solemnly. \u201cLord Third thinks that you need practice! In order to become truly strong, you need more and more experience! Lord Third will never help you unless it's absolutely, positively necessary!\u201d</p><br/><p>To hear the meat jelly say something like this caused Meng Hao to stare in shock. Historically speaking, the meat jelly would always just copy the parrot. It wasn\u2019t just Meng Hao who was taken aback; the parrot was also stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you two get into an argument?\u201d Meng Hao asked curiously.</p><br/><p>The parrot cleared its throat, then glared threateningly at the meat jelly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Third is actually right,\u201d it said, putting on an air of superiority. \u201cIt seems there\u2019s no need for Lord Fifth to hide the truth from you. It\u2019s true. Unless there is an extremely deadly crisis, we won't do anything to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d yelled the meat jelly. \u201cLord Third and this evil bird did get into an argument. Damned pigeon. Henceforth, our differences are irreconcilable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say! I DARE you to say it again!\u201d squawked the parrot, its feathers standing on end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it again,\u201d roared the meat jelly, glaring at the parrot. \u201cI\u2019ll even say it three times!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao instantly felt a headache coming on. Seeing that the two of them were about to start arguing, he snapped, \u201cEnough! If you want to argue, you can do it back inside the bag of holding. Parrot, look around and see if you can see anything strange about this place. Meat jelly, you check it out too. There\u2019s something off here, there\u2019s uh... some bullies!\u201d</p><br/><p>At first the meat jelly looked disdainful, but as soon as it heard bullies mentioned, its eyes shone brightly. It looked closely at the ground, and then suddenly gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really are bullies! Lots of bullies!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The parrot looked over, and its expression flickered with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cDesolate Blooddriven Heavenly Departure formation!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an ancient evil spell formation, and yet people nowadays are still able to use it!? It operates on sacrifices, but to offer sacrifices here... this is impossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered, and he sent out his divine sense to merge with the parrot and meat jelly. In that instant, his mind trembled, and he suddenly saw numerous images. Deep down in the earth, far, far below, was a sprawling necropolis!</p><br/><p>The necropolis was huge, and featured ninety-nine gigantic pits of boiling blood. The boiling blood let off a blood-colored mist that swirled up into the air.</p><br/><p>Sitting cross-legged next to each of the ninety-nine blood pits were countless cultivators. Their cultivation bases were not very advanced, and so skinny that they looked like bags of bones. They stood next to the pits, fanatical expressions on their faces as they slashed their arms with knives and poured the blood out into the pits.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the sound of chanting could be heard, filling the necropolis.</p><br/><p>Deeper into the necropolis were dozens of black-robed figures, sitting cross-legged in meditation. They appeared to be standing guard. Because they were protected by what seemed to be a spell formation, Meng Hao couldn't make out the level of their cultivation bases.</p><br/><p>Most shocking of all was that at the bottom of each of the ninety-nine blood pits was a cultivator, sitting there cross-legged. There were ninety-nine of them, one for each pit, and considering that they were submerged in blood, if it weren't for the fact that Meng Hao was using a special vision technique, he wouldn't be able to see them.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao recognized one of those cultivators. It was none other than... the old man from the Ninth Nation, Jian Daozi!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao began to pant. With the help of the parrot and meat jelly, his vision pierced down into the blood pits. What he saw was that the pits were actually shaped like funnels, and if you looked closely, there were eyelets at the bottom.</p><br/><p>Beneath those eyelets, and beneath the ninety-nine blood pits, was a tunnel that led to another part of the necropolis.</p><br/><p>It was much smaller than the main necropolis, almost like a secret chamber connected to the larger structure up above. Both structures together almost looked like an inverted bottle gourd!</p><br/><p>Within that secret chamber were several statues that resembled spirit creatures, including a turtle, a crane, and even a bat.</p><br/><p>The statues were connected by a ray of light than linked them together, forming a circle. In the middle of that large circle, in the very center of the secret chamber, was a blood-colored block of ice!</p><br/><p>That blood-colored block of ice contained something sealed inside of it... a blood-colored bat!</p><br/><p>That bat looked the same in every respect as the the bat statue among the surrounding group of statues!</p><br/><p>Currently, the block of ice was melting, and as it did, a blood qi rose up into the tunnel above, to be absorbed by the ninety-nine eyelets!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is all this?!\u201d thought Meng Hao, his face flickering. When he looked at the blood-colored block of ice, he immediately felt an aura of boundless evil buffet against him. Although he was only looking at it with divine sense, and was separated from it by the parrot and meat jelly, he could still sense it. It was an evil filled with madness and terrifying power.</p><br/><p>It was definitely... something that cultivators couldn't control. It was like something that exceeded the natural laws of Heaven and Earth, and even that of Essence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... a renegade spirit....\u201d the parrot murmured.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Behind him, the Thorn Rampart covered the two thousand members of the Crow Divinity Tribes like a dome. He took a deep breath and then pointed his hand toward the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you for a while now,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cRighteous Bestowal!\u201d Instantly, this land which was cut off from spiritual energy, suddenly seethed with Demonic Qi. As Meng Hao waved his hand, the Demonic Qi exploded out.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Qi instantly caused the approaching neo-demons to begin to tremble. Their expressions were that of fear as they suddenly stopped moving and began to emit plaintive shrieks.</p><br/><p>The sudden change caused the expressions of the aggressive, violent members of the Eternal Universe Tribe to immediately change.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that Meng Hao had unhesitatingly unleashed all the power of the Demonic Qi he had at his disposal. This was a power that did not belong to Grand Dragoneers, but to Demon Sealers. This was a truly momentous Heavenly power!</p><br/><p>Cultivators could not sense this Qi, but to the neo-demons, it couldn\u2019t be clearer.</p><br/><p>What they saw was Meng Hao, seething with shocking Demonic Qi. The Qi soared up into the sky; even the violet rain seemed to be distorted by it. Meng Hao was the center of a storm of Demonic Qi that burst out in all directions.</p><br/><p>In the world that only the neo-demons could see, Demonic Qi roared up from Meng Hao, transforming into a massive figure. This was a figure composed completely of Demonic Qi, and it looked like\u2026 Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Meng Hao did not appear to them to be a Cultivator, but rather a Greater Demon of Heaven and Earth!</p><br/><p>This Demon could shake the world, and had monstrous Demonic Qi. It was like a king who arrived and made any land he stepped on part of his domain.</p><br/><p>The neo-demons in the horde were shaking so badly that even their souls trembled. Suddenly, memories within their blood were awakened. The neo-demons suddenly began to cry out. The sounds of their cries were filled with reverence and allegiance.</p><br/><p>They submitted before the master of the neo-demons, before an aura of a Greater Demon, an aura that was just like that of their own ancestors!</p><br/><p>The tens of thousands of neo-demons of the Eternal Universe Tribe, regardless of their level, were all roaring continuously, their expressions filled with veneration and respect. They were no longer charging across the ground, but rather prostrating themselves on it! The neo-demons who had been flying in the sky also fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how their Masters tried to control them, they all acknowledged their allegiance to Meng Hao, without exception.</p><br/><p>This scene caused the members of the Eternal Universe Tribe to pant with shock. Before they even had time to react, Meng Hao waved his hand, causing the shocking Demonic Qi to surge toward each and every one of the neo-demons.</p><br/><p>As the Demonic Qi entered their bodies, their roars grew frenzied and their bodies grew larger and fiercer. Their auras were now many times more powerful than before. All of them even began to show signs of Ancestral Awakening!</p><br/><p>One of the neo-demons in the horde was a blue-faced Ghoul neo-demon. It lifted its head to the sky to roar; as of this moment, it no longer walked along on all fours, but rather stood up on two legs. Its blue, hairless body emanated shocking ripples. Its eyes became bright red, and it grew nearly ten meters taller. Even more shocking, a horn suddenly grew out of its forehead.</p><br/><p>The spiraling horn crackled with arcing sparks of lightning, and it emanated an astonishing aura. The appearance of this neo-demon very closely resembled the nine statues back in the Eternal Universe Tribe\u2019s city.</p><br/><p>Its appearance immediately caused the members of the Eternal Universe Tribe to be filled with shock. Their hearts trembled and cries of astonishment filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cSacred Ancient! It\u2026 it looks exactly like the Sacred Ancient!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this person? He causes our neo-demons to mutate and go out of control\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst the commotion, Meng Hao\u2019s calm, bizarre voice echoed out: \u201cFrom now on, you follow me. To battle!\u201d In response, the tens of thousands of neo-demons roared, shaking themselves loose from their masters and turning on them with vicious expressions. It seemed\u2026 they really were switching sides.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Meng Hao waved his arm, causing his own 20,000 neo-demons to suddenly appear, howling to the sky. They instantly shot toward the Eternal Universe Tribe members.</p><br/><p>Nearly 60,000 neo-demons all absorbed Demonic Qi, which caused a variety of mutations. They quickly surrounded the eight thousand trembling Cultivators, all of whom had completely lost their will to fight. One can well imagine the end result of the battle.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was calm as he watched the savage slaughter erupt. Booms and screams filled the air. At the same time, the five Nascent Soul Cultivators shot toward him, emanating killing intent.</p><br/><p>These people were all of the early Nascent Soul stage; to deal with people like that, Meng Hao didn\u2019t even need to don the Blood Immortal mask any more. His hand flashed with an incantation gesture and he pointed forward. Instantly, the power of Frost soil shot out, followed by a raging sea of flames, a gigantic tree and a golden rain. Totems of four of the five elements exploded out as he pointed.</p><br/><p>Before the five approaching Nascent Soul Cultivators could even get near to Meng Hao, their bodies trembled under the attack of his four great totems.</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed from their mouths and their faces filled with astonishment. It was at this point that two roaring figures suddenly shot through the air toward Meng Hao, sending out ripples in all directions. Any neo-demon that got in their way was transformed into a cloud of blood; none were capable of even causing pause for these two figures.</p><br/><p>It was two old men, filled with intense killing intent as they closed in on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Grand Dragoneer! Kill him and the neo-demon horde will disperse!\u201d</p><br/><p>As they neared, Meng Hao slipped on the Blood Immortal mask. Instantly, Blood Qi exploded up, completely changing his aura. Radiating killing intent, his body flickered as he turned into a black moon. A wisp of smoke could be seen as he suddenly appeared directly in front of the two old men.</p><br/><p>For him to appear in this way was bizarre and shocking. They almost couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing with their own eyes, and their hearts filled with foreboding.</p><br/><p>As the faces of the old men fell, Meng Hao casually clenched his right hand into a fist and then launched a blow!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>One of the old men was sent tumbling backward. He quickly summoned seven or eight magical treasures to try to defend himself, but they were crushed, the fragments of which slammed into his chest. Blood sprayed from his mouth and the totem tattoos on his body flickered.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Meng Hao turned. Black moons flashed within his eyes and suddenly, a black moon like an eye magically appeared on his forehead as he looked at the other old man. This old man urgently employed divine abilities, and was instantly surrounded by Ghouls. This was actually the Greatfather of the Eternal Universe Tribe; the man Meng Hao had struck moments ago was the High Priest.</p><br/><p>When the Greathfather\u2019s eyes met Meng Hao\u2019s, his expression flickered and his mind filled with roaring as suddenly, the reflection of a black moon appeared on his own face. He felt stabbing pain in his Sea of Perception, as if a great invisible blade were stabbing into it.</p><br/><p>He let out a miserable scream. Unable to attack, mind filled with buzzing as he shot backward in retreat.</p><br/><p>This black moon eye was none other than Yi Chenzi\u2019s life saving treasure. However, in Meng Hao\u2019s hands its might far exceeded what it had in the hands of Yi Chenzi. Although Meng Hao did not cultivate the blood sacrifice magic, after putting on the Blood Immortal mask, the power of his Blood Qi far exceeded that of Yi Chenzi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>He needed no blood sacrifices. Everytime he killed a person, the redness of the mask would grow deeper.</p><br/><p>Bloodcurdling screams could be heard continuously as 60,000 neo-demons ruthlessly attacked and killed the besieged Eternal Universe Tribe.</p><br/><p>What shocked the Eternal Universe Tribe most was that within the neo-demon horde was a flock of extremely bizarre black crows. They didn\u2019t attack anyone, but rather flew around, seemingly absorbing something. However, it didn\u2019t take long before the corpses on the ground began to twitch and rise to their feet.</p><br/><p>The dead came back to life and stood up. Within the eyes of each corpse could be seen the image of a crow. Immediately, the corpses charged toward their former Tribe members in attack.</p><br/><p>Most astonishing of all was that these corpses\u2026 still had Cultivation bases!</p><br/><p>Although they could only use their Cultivation bases instinctively, these corpses did not fear death. Even if all they had left was a head, they would still try to bite their opponent. The battlefield instantly grew even more brutal.</p><br/><p>The situation quickly grew hopeless, causing some of the Eternal Universe Tribe members to bite their tongues and spit out blood. After performing quick incantations, they pointed up to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cExalted Sacred Ancient, help us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The High Priest, the five nascent Soul Cultivators, and the rest of the Tribe members all bit their tongues and spit out blood. One by one the roared up into the sky: \u201cExalted Sacred Ancient, help us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of thousands of Tribe members joined together, transforming into a thunderous sound that rolled out in waves, shaking Heaven and Earth. Suddenly, a roar could be heard from the sky off in the distance.</p><br/><p>It was a black cloud, within which was a living Ghoul!</p><br/><p>Its skin was blue, and it was fully three hundred meters in length. It had a spiraling horn, and its body was covered with scales. This neo-demon Sacred Ancient\u2019s aura shot out explosively, and when it appeared, it stared toward Meng Hao with its red eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou an aura similar to mine\u2026.\u201d The creature roared, and then shot its claw-like hand directly toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>At the same time that the Ghoul roared, another roar could be heard. \u201cOutlander!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was none other than the Outlander Beast. It suddenly shot through the air to slam into the Ghoul.</p><br/><p>Amidst the resulting boom, the parrot flapped its wings and let out a shriek. Its eyes glowed with a look of disgust and detestation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! No fur or feathers! You, you, you\u2026. Why don\u2019t you have any fur or feathers!?!? Beloved concubine, put it to death! This damned bastard has no fur or feathers, that\u2019s the most heinous of crimes! Show no mercy! AAHHHHH! You dare to not have fur or feathers!\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to being slammed into by the Outlander Beast, the Ghoul roared and fell back. The Outlander Beast whistled through the air to slam into it again. The parrot was off to the side, continuing to call out excitedly.</p><br/><p>On the ground, Meng Hao chuckled. He had been waiting for quite some time for the Eternal Universe Tribe to come. How could he not have made certain preparations? He lifted his right hand to perform an incantation gesture and suddenly, a blood-colored face magically appeared around him. It spread out and then shot forward in attack.</p><br/><p>The attack instantly slammed into the several Nascent Soul Cultivators, causing blood to spray from their mouths. They retreated, faces filled with astonishment. It was at this point that the thorns suddenly began to spread apart. From within, the members of the Crow Divinity Tribes as well as the several hundred slaves, all emerged, shouting battle cries.</p><br/><p>At this point, Meng Hao knew that the Eternal Universe Tribe was completely defeated.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

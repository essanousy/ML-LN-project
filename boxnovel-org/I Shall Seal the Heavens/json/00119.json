If I'm careless, I'll likely fail and die... But with great risk comes great reward. If something is riskier, it shows that there is more chance for reward. If there isn't such danger, then fine. But if there is... Well, if I don't go, then I'll regret it for the rest of my life!\" Determination filled his eyes as he continued to think over what Chu Yuyan had told him. However, after some time, he hadn't come up with any new ideas about why she had told him so much.</p><br/><p>\"She was provoking me. Maybe her true goal was to get me to go in. Or perhaps it wasn\u2019t... The chances of the latter are small. Perhaps she hopes that after entering and starting the Blood Immortal Legacy tournament, it will attract the attention of the outside world, and perhaps give the Violet Fate Sect a better chance of tracking her down.\" His eyes flashed as he looked over at her.</p><br/><p>\"If I don't go, nothing will happen. But if that's what she wanted, why would she go into such detail right now, especially in a way that would make me hesitant? I wonder... what is she thinking? What is her true goal...?\" His eyes flickered as he thought. Finally, he closed his eyes and began to meditate.</p><br/><p>Time passed slowly. Soon, half a month had gone by. Chu Yuyan finally concocted the second pill. However, by the time another month passed, her attempts at the third and fourth pills had failed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could not perform alchemy, but it was clear to him that she was not failing intentionally. Instead, the pill concoction was becoming more difficult. Throughout the month, Meng Hao didn't spend time thinking about the Legacy of the Blood Immortal. He seemed to have put it out of mind.</p><br/><p>One day, he slowly stood up and hopped onto a flying sword, shooting up through the mists to go observe the shield.</p><br/><p>In the past half month, he had made it a practice to go up every ten days or so to observe the shield. Every time he left, Chu Yuyan would observe his departure expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>This time, after Meng Hao left, she waited about four hours, then suddenly lifted her head, her eyes flashing. She frowned, as if she were having some problem with the pill concoction process. Then she stood up, looking off into the mists. Shortly after, she began walking toward the region of the lake of blood. When she got there, she looked around, then turned and returned to the pill furnace. It seemed as if whatever question was in her mind had been answered. She continued with her alchemy.</p><br/><p>Another half month passed. Finally, she was able to successfully concoct the third and fourth pills. She then began working on the fifth pill. As far as Meng Hao was concerned, this was the last pill. Once it was finished, then all seven of the minor pills would be ready.</p><br/><p>More time slipped by. In the blink of an eye, two months were gone. Meng Hao and Chu Yuyan had now been trapped in the volcano for half a year. Within the two months, Chu Yuyan would occasionally leave the area of the cave. Sometimes it was when Meng Hao was watching her, other times it was when he was away. It seemed as if every time she had some problem with the formula, she would pace about. However, she would never enter the region within three hundred meters of the lake of blood. She would always stop at that mark.</p><br/><p>Finally one day, under Meng Hao's watchful eye, she stood up. Frowning, she walked into the mists. When she reached the three hundred meter mark, her eyes flashed. Suddenly, the power of her Cultivation base flared up, and she sped toward the lake of blood at top speed.</p><br/><p>As she neared it, the surface of the lake began to ripple. The altar appeared, followed by the enormous stone head. The mouth gaped, a passageway awaiting for the Legacy tournament participant to enter.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuyan's eyes flickered with excitement as she raced forward. She was almost leaping into the air by the time she reached the mouth. Just as she was about to enter, a light laugh filled the air. A sword aura flickered, shooting toward Chu Yuyan.</p><br/><p>As soon as she heard the laughter, her face went pale. Ignoring the approach of the wooden sword, she gritted her straight, white teeth and charged forward. There was only two meters between her and the large stone mouth.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a black net appeared, moving at a speed much faster than Chu Yuyan. It immediately enveloped her, and she was not able to move beyond that last two meter. The wooden sword scooped her and tossed her back to the lake shore.</p><br/><p>Standing nearby within the mists was Meng Hao. His face expressionless, he slowly walked forward.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuyan's face was pale, and her eyes flashed with venomous hatred as she glared at Meng Hao. The instant he had brought back that skull to study, she had put all the pieces together regarding the Legacy of the Blood Immortal. Furthermore, everything she had said those months ago was true. She thought she knew Meng Hao, and understood his innate skepticism. She intentionally tried to make him think that there was something suspicious going on. Given his nature, he would certainly suspect her. Based on all of this, she knew that he would not easily be convinced to act. That would give her time.</p><br/><p>In the following months, she had made it a practice to go for walks; she did this so that Meng Hao would not find it unusual. Today, she had finally made her attempt, never having imagined that she would fail.</p><br/><p>\"You really are quite patient,\" said Meng Hao. \"I gave you a whole three months.\" At the moment, he was disinclined to explain to her how he had seen through her plan. \"You have one month. I want to see the fifth pill. Now, get back to your alchemy.\" He made a snatching motion with his hand, retrieving the large net.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuyan bit her lip and got to her feet. Without another glance at Meng Hao, she made a bitter departure.</p><br/><p>\"So, she really did want to go in.\" Meng Hao looked thoughtfully over his shoulder at Chu Yuyan's departing figure. A cold smile lifted the corners of his mouth. Now, his doubts were dispelled. He walked forward and entered the mouth of the enormous statue.</p><br/><p>The instant he entered the mouth, he disappeared, and the lake of blood began to seethe. A roaring sound rippled out, and the lake of blood transformed into a blood-colored mist, which dispersed in all directions.</p><br/><p>An archaic voice echoed out from within the blood mist, resounding out from within the volcano. \u201cThe Ancient Doom Clan, the Legacy of the Blood Immortal. Enter my sea of blood; nine will open in the Southern Domain; all creation will know. The first person... shall acquire the bloodline of the Blood Immortal!\u201d When it hit Chu Yuyan's ears, she staggered, and her face grew pale. She gnawed on her lip as a look of extreme bitterness filled her face.</p><br/><p>\"If only I had realized earlier what this place was...\" She shook her head. Her face was pallid. Her hatred toward Meng Hao, and toward fate itself, filled her with complicated emotions.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, outside in the Southern Domain, there were seven different locations, out from all of which suddenly could be heard a massive roaring. As soon as the sound raged out, the sky above the entire Southern Domain turned the color of blood.</p><br/><p>From each of the seven locations, an archaic voice rumbled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ancient Doom Clan, the Legacy of the Blood Immortal. Enter my sea of blood; nine will open in the Southern Domain; all creation will know. The first person... shall acquire the bloodline of the Blood Immortal!\u201d</p><br/><p>The echoing sound immediately sent the Southern Domain stirring. Regardless of their Sect or background, any Cultivators near the seven Blood Immortal Legacy zones looked on in astonishment. They immediately shot off in various directions at incredible speed.</p><br/><p>\"The Blood Immortal Legacy zones have re-appeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\"The eighth Blood Immortal Legacy zone has been discovered. Now that it's been entered, the other seven Legacy zones have opened. The eighth Blood Immortal Legacy tournament is about to begin!\"</p><br/><p>\"There will only be nine total chances to get the Blood Immortal Legacy. Over the past tens of thousands of years, it has happened seven times. This is the eighth time. If no one acquires the Legacy this time, who knows how many years will pass before the ninth tournament arrives...\"</p><br/><p>The other seven locations were places where previous Blood Immortal Legacy tournaments had begun. Whenever a new location appeared, it would cause a huge sensation in the Southern Domain. The eyes of countless Cultivators grew red with desire. Although no one had ever acquired the Legacy itself, in every race, lucky participants emerged with various magical items and techniques.</p><br/><p>As the news spread, the five great Sects and three great Clans were the first to react. After them, other Clans followed in taking action.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the roaring sound rippled out, and the words of the archaic voice echoed loudly. The entire Southern Domain buzzed with action. The Wang Clan, one of the three great Clans, was one of the first to act. Several hundred beams of light flew out, followed by several enormous flying battleships, filled with the disciples of the Wang Clan. They made their way toward the nearest Blood Immortal Legacy zone.</p><br/><p>White-robed Wang Tengfei stood on the second boat in the procession. His hands were clasped behind his back as he stared coldly at someone on the ship ahead in the lead position. There stood a man wearing a similar white robe. He closely resembled Wang Tengfei, although he looked a little bit older. He frowned in thought.</p><br/><p>This was Wang Lihai [1. Wang Lihai's name in Chineses is  (w\u00e1ng l\u00ec h\u01cei) \u2013 Wang is a common family name. Li means \u201cexperience.\u201d Hai means \u201cocean\u201d], Wang Tengfei's older brother. He was a Dao Child of the Wang Clan, which was a position higher than that held by a trifling Chosen. He was in the late Foundation Establishment Stage, and could achieve Core Formation at almost any time. He was surrounded by various elite members of the Wang Clan, including his Dao Protector, a Nascent Soul Clan Uncle.</p><br/><p>As for Wang Tengfei... he stood there silently, hands clasped rigidly behind his back. One of the fingers of his right hand looked very different from the others. It was as transparent as crystal, within which circulated tiny black spiralling threads. It looked extremely bizarre. [2. If you forgot how Wang Tengfei lost his finger, please re-read Chapter 32: This Finger Brought me Humiliation, Today, I Cripple it!]</p><br/><p>Standing next to him was Wang Xifan, the man who had almost killed Meng Hao with a single look that day, years ago [3. If you forgot how Wang Xifan almost killed Meng Hao, please re-read Chapter 35: I'm Not Willing! (also the same chapter where we meet our favorite sexy female antagonist, Chu Yuyan!)]. \"If things hadn't happened the way they did in the State of Zhao,\" he said coolly, \"You wouldn't be at the early Foundation Establishment stage right now. You would be at the middle stage. You would still be behind your brother, but not as far as you are now.</p><br/><p>\"I will exceed my brother,\" said Wang Tengfei calmly. \"I will become a Dao Child!\"</p><br/><p>\"There will only be one chance to acquire the Legacy of the Blood Immortal,\" said Wang Xifan, his eyes flashing. He frowned. \"It's too bad there hasn't been any word from the Violet Fate Sect about Yuyan. Apparently, she's in a critical stage of secluded meditation. Otherwise, she would be able to provide you with some assistance.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You\u2019re so low, you don\u2019t even deserve to make a fool of yourself here!\u201d He imperceptibly exerted pressure with his fingers in an attempt to crush the pill, but failed. He was in the mid Nascent Soul stage, and had reached a point where he could destroy magical items without the use of magic. And yet, he wasn\u2019t able to harm the medicinal pill in the least bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe path of the Dao of alchemy is focused on creating new pills,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cAnyone in the East Pill Division could practice this heretical art. But no one would deign to do so! This doesn\u2019t even deserve to be called a pill!\u201d He waved his right arm, sending the pill flying back to Eternal Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pill was not created from gold or iron,\u201d said Eternal Mountain calmly, catching the pill. \u201cNor was it fused with crystal or stone. It was concocted from 37,924 types of medicinal plants together with countless variations, and is perfect in all respects. It contains the full and complete strength of all the five elements, and is matchless in Heaven and Earth. This truly represents the Great Dao of alchemy, and does not count as a mere refining. Years ago, I observed that Heaven is round, while the Earth is square. It was this enlightenment that caused me to found the World Pill Division, and also seeded my desire to forge a great pill of Heaven and Earth. This very pill contains the Heavens, the Earth and the world itself!\u201d He tossed the pill over to Fatty.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Fugui is a Golden Frost Sect disciple who practices the cultivation of Spirit Stone consumption,\u201d he said in a deep voice, his eyes glittering. \u201cHe was born with superhuman strength that is concentrated within his teeth. Elder Brother Lin, you call this pill a heresy, and claim that anyone in the East Pill Division could concoct it. Very well. If anyone can concoct a pill that this kid is incapable of crushing with his teeth, then I will give you the pill formula. However, if the East Pill Division cannot do this, then please request Master to reveal himself and provide an assessment of my pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as his voice rang out into the silence, Lin Hailong snorted coldly. \u201cThe East Pill Division doesn\u2019t want your pill formula.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin Hailong even finished speaking, Tang Shicang of the Golden Frost Sect cleared his throat. He pulled out a pill bottle from within his robe. It was gray-colored and covered with blackish marks. It emanated a feeling of ancientness, as if it had been hidden away for countless ages.</p><br/><p>Tang Shicang only uttered one sentence: \u201cThis is a product of the Dao of alchemy of ancient times, an Entrancement Pill of the tenth level of Qi Condensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words instantly caused all of the alchemists of the East Pill Division to stare at the pill bottle. An Zaihai\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Even Lin Hailong seemed shocked.</p><br/><p>The tenth level of Qi Condensation was a legendary realm. After the change in the Heavens, the path of Qi Condensation was not complete, and thus, Entrancement Pills appeared. They were the ancient Dao of alchemy\u2019s response to the changes in Heaven and Earth, and a way to continue to tread the ancient path. With such a pill, a Cultivator could gain a chance to enter into the tenth level of Qi Condensation.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, pills like this were rare even in ancient times, and were not guaranteed to be completely effective. In any case, the benefits of being able to study an Entrancement Pill were hard to quantify.</p><br/><p>It turned out, the Golden Frost Sect had come prepared with just such a pill!</p><br/><p>Eternal Mountain spoke, neither quickly nor slowly: \u201cThis Entrancement Pill is complete. Elder Brother Lin, I would like to place this pill up as stakes of a wager\u2026. Will you accept, or not?\u201d His words instantly put a great pressure on Lin Hailong.</p><br/><p>Accept, or not? It was a good question. If he accepted, but couldn\u2019t produce a pill impervious to Fatty, then he would become a laughingstock. If he didn\u2019t accept, then it would be obvious he was avoiding the challenge. If this were battle magic, it wouldn\u2019t matter, but battling with alchemy was different\u2026. Furthermore, the competition was only a Foundation Establishment pup\u2026.</p><br/><p>Lin Hailong really had no choice but to accept!</p><br/><p>The Golden Frost Sect obviously had foreseen this, which was the very reason they had come today. It was a very serious matter. They clearly wanted to force the issue, and make the East Pill Decision accept their challenge.</p><br/><p>An Zaihai\u2019s face looked unsightly. He and Lin Hailong exchanged a glance. Both clearly felt themselves to be in an awkward position. Their opponent had chosen a Foundation Establishment pup as champion, and the only stipulation of the challenge was to create a pill he couldn\u2019t crush. If a Violet Furnace Lord of the East Pill Division produced such a pill, it might not count as a loss, but certainly wouldn\u2019t be a win.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t even be fair for a Furnace Lord to participate; the position wasn\u2019t compatible. A win would still be a loss, and a loss\u2026 would be a complete disgrace.</p><br/><p>Wu Dingqiu frowned. As everyone sat there silently, Fatty walked forward to stand next to Eternal Mountain, clearly in very high spirits. He pulled out a Spirit Stone, placed it into his mouth, and crunch, crunch, crunched it into pieces. He looked around at the alchemists of the East Pill Division, grinning. Then he pulled out a flying sword and began to grind his teeth, apparently desiring to sharpen them.</p><br/><p>All of this caused the people from the East Pill Division to gasp and stare wide-eyed in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are those teeth\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of this fat guy. They say his teeth can crush flying swords\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the discussions broke out, a strange look appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face. The sight of Fatty looking so triumphant, his teeth glittering, caused Meng Hao to sigh emotionally. He remembered all those years ago in the Reliance Sect how he had encouraged Fatty to focus his Cultivation on his teeth.</p><br/><p>Lin Hailong and An Zaihai looked even more worried after seeing Fatty crush the Spirit Stone. They frowned, knowing full well they had to accept the challenge. However, if they accepted, it would only be appropriate for challengers from the ranks of the thousand master alchemists to participate. If one of them won, the results would be acceptable. If a Furnace Lord participated, it simply wouldn\u2019t be appropriate.</p><br/><p>Besides, if a Furnace Lord lost, it would be far too embarrassing for the East Pill Division. If a master alchemist lost, at least it wouldn\u2019t be so embarrassing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould the Violet Fate Sect please respond?\u201d said the Golden Frost Sect\u2019s Dharma Protector Tang Shicang, smiling.</p><br/><p>An Zaihai, brow furrowed, glanced over at the master alchemists. Suddenly, his gaze fell upon Meng Hao. It was only a glance, but he instantly recognised him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is beneath a Furnace Lord to concoct such a heretical pill,\u201d replied An Zaihai quickly. \u201cHowever, there is definitely one amongst the thousand master alchemists of the East Pill Division who can concoct such a medicinal pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Hailong had just been thinking about how to avoid the whole situation, but hearing An Zaihai\u2019s words, he nodded slightly. His heart, however, was pounding. He looked over at Li Tao, who was standing next to Meng Hao. \u201cLi Tao, please step forward and concoct a pill,\u201d he said, completely ignoring Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Li Tao\u2019s eyes filled with concentration, and he took a deep breath as he clasped hands and bowed to Lin and An. Considering he was a master alchemist of the East Pill Division, he didn\u2019t need to formally greet Wu Dingqiu and the others from the Violet Qi Division.</p><br/><p>Lin Hailong looked at Li Tao with an expression of praise. He had been paying attention to the man for some time. He may have been eclipsed by Pill Cauldron at the Pill Auction, but as far as Lin Hailong was concerned, Pill Cauldron was a mystery. Li Tao, however, had the potential for much future growth. \u201cTake this Earthly fire,\u201d he said \u201cQuickly concoct the pill!\u201d He flicked his sleeve, and a violet-colored crystal flew over to land on the ground. The limestones seemed as if they were about to melt from the intense heat of the Earthly fire.</p><br/><p>Li Tao looked thoughtful for a moment, then produced a pill furnace and some medicinal plants and began to concoct.</p><br/><p>The Earthly fire given by Lin Hailong made the concocting process go fairly quickly. Li Tao carefully performed his catalyzing and concocting, and after the time it takes two incense sticks to burn, the pill furnace roared, and a white medicinal pill flew out.</p><br/><p>Li Tao had condensed hundreds of various hard medicinal plants into the pill. The concoction time had been relatively short, but he had employed all the skill he possessed. He was confident that even a fierce tiger would break its teeth if it bit such a pill!</p><br/><p>When the pill emerged, Li Tao didn\u2019t even look at it. He simply tossed it over to Fatty, who grabbed it from mid air. He cleared his throat, and then, as everyone watched, placed it into his mouth. With a crunch, the pill shattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even grind my teeth with this crappy thing,\u201d said Fatty, his face filled with disdain. He spit out the remnants of the pill, looking quite proud of himself.</p><br/><p>Lin Hailong\u2019s face was filled with embarrassment. He singled out one master alchemist after another, but the pills they concocted were are easily crushed by Fatty, then spit out onto the ground. Fatty\u2019s dialogue grew even more arrogant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, it seems it really is difficult to find a medicinal pill that my teeth can\u2019t destroy. What a lonely life\u2026. Do any of you have any skill? Come, concoct something I can\u2019t crush.\u201d He looked more and more complacent. The same gall he had shown at the Pill Auction, was now in full force. He seemed very much in his element.</p><br/><p>Lin Hailong\u2019s face grew more unsightly, and he slapped his palm down onto the table. Looking at Eternal Mountain\u2019s expressionless face, his heart filled with fury. Suddenly, he said, \u201cMaster alchemists of the East Pill Division! Whoever of you can concoct a pill that this kid can\u2019t crush will instantly be promoted to Furnace Lord!\u201d His words echoed out through the mountains, all the way down to the master alchemists who were congregated at the foot of the mountain. Everyone\u2019s faces filled with shock, and their eyes began to glow.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s pupils constricted, and he stared at Lin Hailong, his heart pounding.</p><br/><p>Being promoted to Furnace Lord was a very important matter. Barring unusual circumstances, before being considered for promotion, one usually needed to be a master alchemist for a full sixty-year cycle, be at the Foundation Establishment stage, and concoct over a thousand different types of medicinal pills with fifty percent medicinal strength. Even more importantly, the Sect required that the candidate master alchemist have concocted ten million medicinal pills for the Sect.</p><br/><p>After meeting all those requirements, the approval of all the other Furnace Lords was also required. If there was more than one candidate, then a rigorous pill concocting competition was required, whereupon one person would be selected for promotion.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had previously thought about becoming a Furnace Lord, and had even considered using his identity as Grandmaster Pill Cauldron to attempt to do so. However, he was still hesitating and analyzing the whole matter. Hearing Lin Hailong\u2019s words caused him to take a deep breath. His eyes began to glow.</p><br/><p>To him, this was a chance that might only come once in a hundred years!</p><br/><p>Of course, many other master alchemists were thinking the same thing. All of them began to pant; if they seized this opportunity to be promoted to Furnace Lord, it would be as if the gate of the Dao of alchemy had been opened. Granted, being promoted in such a way would arouse the ire of the other Furnace Lords, and would likely lead to scorn from others. However, it was still an incredible opportunity.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if one was qualified or not. After becoming a Furnace Lord, one would have access to many special techniques, as well as secret formulas regarding various interactions of plants and vegetation. This in itself was enough to enable a master alchemist to advance by leaps and bounds. They would suddenly have access to plant and vegetation combinations that they would never otherwise be able to comprehend. The respect commanded by a Furnace Lord was enough to send almost all of the master alchemists into a frenzy.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the words had come out of the mouth of Lin Hailong himself, the most senior of the Violet Furnace Lords, and a sub-Grandmaster. No one would disbelieve him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath and looked at complacent Fatty. Feeling a bit guilty, he thought, \u201cFatty, brother, I don\u2019t want to cause problems for you, but this is my only chance\u2026. I am determined to prevail!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

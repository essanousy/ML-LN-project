The disciples were still faced with difficult decisions.</p><br/><p>Should they continue to defend their position, or should they leave the Southern Domain\u2026?</p><br/><p>Should they surrender to the Blood Demon Sect, or die in battle\u2026?</p><br/><p>The destruction of the Black Sieve Sect was nothing astonishing. However, the Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s surrender had been witnessed by hundreds of thousands of Southern Domain cultivators. Word had long since spread, and even the sealed-off Golden Frost Sect had gotten the news.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take very long at all for the Golden Frost Sect to grow incredibly alarmed. Of course, the least alarmed of all was Li Fugui. However, despite his lack of alarm, he was still quite nervous. Recent days found him sighing with distress, and at a distinct loss.</p><br/><p>The Golden Frost Sect had treated him well, very well, from the very beginning. He had been given many beautiful beloved companions, which left him exhausted, but happy\u2026. On the other hand, Meng Hao had been his brother ever since their days in the Reliance Sect.</p><br/><p>They had joined the sect together as Outer Sect disciples. They had caught wild chickens to eat, and had even run the general store together. Meng Hao had looked out for him, and that was something he would never forget.</p><br/><p>The two of them were truly brothers.</p><br/><p>Now, though, he was in an awkward predicament, and was actually somewhat confused about what to do. His brother was on the way to destroy the Golden Frost Sect, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to handle the situation.</p><br/><p>A few days after the surrender of the Solitary Sword Sect, the Golden Frost Sect\u2019s only Spirit Severing expert, along with Li Fugui\u2019s master, personally came to him to discuss the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSue for peace?\u201d said Fatty, gaping in shock at the Spirit Severing Patriarch, who looked quite exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on good terms with Meng Hao. He\u2019s the type of person who\u2026 despite being cruel and merciless, capable of carrying out horrendous massacres, and with an unfathomably high cultivation base, is still\u2026 someone who cares about past friendships.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can verify that from the news about the Solitary Sword Sect. Based on what happened with Chen Fan, it\u2019s possible to tell a little bit about what Meng Hao is thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Fugui, think about it. How has the sect treated you ever since you joined? We\u2019re now facing imminent catastrophe. Hopefully, you can step forward bravely and use your friendship with Meng Hao to help us weather this storm!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Golden Frost Sect is willing to surrender. Our only request is that we don\u2019t become an auxiliary branch, but rather, allies!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will do everything in our power to comply with the Blood Demon Sect, but we want to preserve our core Daoist teachings and doctrines, so that our sect will not be wiped away from the Southern Domain. Perhaps years from now, we can once again rise to prominence. We must fight for that chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Golden Frost Sect\u2019s only Spirit Severing Patriarch clasped hands and bowed deeply to Li Fugui. Li Fugui\u2019s master stood off to the side, looking at him.</p><br/><p>Li Fugui was quiet for a moment before nodding seriously.</p><br/><p>Another day of nervousness passed for the Golden Frost Sect. Finally, the clouds seethed outside of the sect\u2019s grand spell formation, and tens of thousands of beams of light appeared. They were like a towering sea of blood, bright red as they shot toward the Golden Frost Sect.</p><br/><p>These were the Blood Demon Sect disciples. They had destroyed the Black Sieve Sect and forced the Solitary Sword Sect into compliance. Now, they turned toward the Golden Frost Sect, their hearts filled with the desire to kill.</p><br/><p>Behind them were the rogue cultivators, even more than before. Hundreds of thousands were following the Blood Demon Sect through the Southern Domain to bear witness.</p><br/><p>Outside of the Golden Frost Sect was an area where the air did not ripple with the distortions of a defensive spell formation, nor was there any enshrouding fog. Instead, an illusion barrier protected it, revealing only the image of a barren mountain.</p><br/><p>As soon as the Blood Demon Sect disciples appeared on the scene, and before they could even react, a beam of light could be seen, and Fatty\u2019s round figure was there on the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t attack, don\u2019t attack, it\u2019s me!\u201d he called out at the top of his lungs. Seeing the tens of thousands of Blood Demon Sect disciples, and the hundreds of thousands of rogue cultivators behind them, left Fatty completely frightened.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at Fatty, and then glanced over at the Golden Frost Sect. It only took him a moment to figure out what the Golden Frost Sect was planning. Inwardly, he had already been experiencing some doubts regarding how to handle them.</p><br/><p>Fatty was here, and Meng Hao knew that no matter what he did to the Golden Frost Sect, it would affect Fatty negatively.</p><br/><p>Seeing Fatty suddenly appear, Meng Hao waved his sleeve, causing the air around him to distort. He vanished, then reappeared in front of Fatty. They were then surrounded by a blurriness that prevented anyone from seeing clearly what was happening.</p><br/><p>A faint smile appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face. He looked over Fatty\u2019s rotund figure, then laughed out loud. Fatty heaved an inward sigh of relief, and the two of them embraced.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t take long for Meng Hao\u2019s smile to turn wry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour belly\u2026 is too huge,\u201d he said. Fatty was so fat that it made it hard to hug him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I got fat again,\u201d said Fatty, smiling and rubbing his head. \u201cRecently I\u2019ve been thinking of trying to lose some weight.\u201d He looked past Meng Hao toward the tens of thousands of murderous-looking Blood Demon Sect disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, um\u2026. Eldest Brother Meng Hao, what do you say we get down to business?\u201d Fatty looked extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d replied Meng Hao, blinking and looking back at Fatty with an enigmatic smile.</p><br/><p>Fatty sighed and then just directly explained. \u201cThe sect\u2019s Spirit Severing Patriarch sent me here to sue for peace. How about\u2026 we don\u2019t fight!? The sect will surrender as long as they can preserve their core Daoist teachings and doctrines\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two of them chatted, the disciples of the Golden Frost Sect looked on nervously from within their sect, wondering what the result would be.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if Elder Brother Li will succeed or not\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao really values friendship. He shouldn\u2019t have a hard time convincing him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say for sure. Meng Hao is the Blood Prince of the Blood Demon Sect. He\u2019s killed countless people, and is completely cruel and ferocious. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll agree to our demands so easily.\u201d Even as they discussed the matter, Meng Hao was listening to Fatty make his demands. An even wider smile broke out on Meng Hao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, you\u2019re working so hard to represent the sect and sue for peace, but what has the sect offered you in return?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty gaped for a moment, then suddenly slapped his thigh. A look of fury appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge! You\u2019re right! Those bastards didn\u2019t offer me anything!! Alright, Meng Hao, don\u2019t agree to anything yet. I\u2019m gonna go back to the sect and tell them that the negotiations didn\u2019t go well. After they offer Young Master Fatty something good, then I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao chuckled and shook his head. Then he flicked his sleeve, causing the blurriness around them to fade away. As it cleared, everyone in the outside world could see the two of them.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face darkened, and Fatty\u2019s eyes gleamed. Realizing that it was time to put on the show, he flew into a rage and then roared, \u201cMeng Hao, how could you be like this!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Burning with rage, he turned and headed back to the Golden Frost Sect.</p><br/><p>The faces of the Golden Frost Sect cultivators fell, and their hearts began to thump.</p><br/><p>Fatty angrily returned to the sect, and was immediately surrounded by anxious-looking disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with that fool! Done!\u201d cried Fatty. \u201cMeng Hao doesn\u2019t care at all about friendship! I\u2019m through trying to reconcile with him!\u201d Hearing Fatty\u2019s ranting caused the Golden Frost Sect cultivators to grow even more alarmed.</p><br/><p>The only Spirit Severing Patriarch immediately strode forward and asked, \u201cHe didn\u2019t agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs soon as I brought up the matter of suing for peace, he asked me what authority I had to negotiate for the sect! On what authority?!?! I\u2019m a Golden Frost Sect disciple, dammit! What an insult!\u201d As he spoke, Fatty\u2019s eyes shifted back and forth craftily.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Golden Frost Sect disciples had been suppressing themselves for too long now. They had placed all their hope on Fatty, and now that he had failed, they couldn\u2019t suppress themselves any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell if he\u2019s going to be like that, then let\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! It would be better to die in battle than be insulted like this! Even Elder Brother Li couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Let\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFIGHT!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their desire to go to battle soared, and soon, the entire sect was filled with a murderous aura. People even began to rotate the sect\u2019s spell formations into battle readiness.</p><br/><p>Fatty was stupefied. He thought he had made things pretty obvious, and was shocked that no one had picked up on his hidden meaning.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Severing Patriarch stood there silently, looking at Meng Hao floating in midair off in the distance. He sighed inwardly. He had no desire to go to war; the Golden Frost Sect didn\u2019t even come close to matching up with the Blood Demon Sect. But now\u2026 what other options did they have?</p><br/><p>Normally speaking, he would have picked up on the hidden message in Li Fugui\u2019s words just now. However, he was so anxious and alarmed that he simply didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to fight, then we should make the first move!\u201d said the Spirit Severing Patriarch, gritting his teeth. \u201cFight now, and worry about everything else later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s eyes went wide, and his heart started to pound. Realizing that things were getting out of control, he quickly stepped forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s still some hope\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Li, there\u2019s no need for further discussion. We\u2019re going to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Junior Brother Li, we\u2019ve been pushed into a corner. The only option now is to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll show them who the Golden Frost Sect is! We might be down and out now, but we still have the power to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatty was now extremely nervous. \u201cHey everybody, you need to listen to me! I think\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Fugui, there\u2019s no need!\u201d said the Spirit Severing cultivator, his eyes cold. \u201cI made an error in judgement. It seems we\u2019ll have to fight first before we can have a shot at turning this around. Disciples, heed my command\u2026.\u201d He flicked his sleeve and was about to issue orders when, all of a sudden, Fatty lifted his head up and roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, give me one more chance! I, Li Fugui, will put my life on the line to secure peace for the sect!\u201d He was so nervous that his throat was hoarse.</p><br/><p>Immediately, everyone turned to look at him in shock, even the Spirit Severing Patriarch.</p><br/><p>Li Fugui slapped his chest so hard that it stung, and tears welled up in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an amazing kid,\u201d said the Spirit Severing expert, clearly moved. \u201cYou\u2026 you really don\u2019t need to put yourself in such danger. We will fight them, and show them the true power of the Golden Frost Sect! That\u2019s our only hope!\u201d With that, he prepared to give combat orders.</p><br/><p>Fatty was trembling, and veins bulged out on his forehead. Once again, he let out a mighty roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Patriarch. I\u2019m a disciple of the Golden Frost Sect. Even if I die the most cruel death, I will help the sect to pass through this crisis! This time I\u2019ll just tell that Meng Hao that I\u2019m a disciple of the Golden Frost Sect, and its future Golden Prince. If he doesn\u2019t agree to our terms, I\u2019ll kill myself right in front of him!\u201d With that, he flew up into the air, his face calm and unflinching.</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through the Spirit Severing Patriarch, and the other disciples were completely moved to see Fatty\u2019s tear-soaked face and calmness in the face of death.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of whether or not you succeed,\u201d said the Spirit Severing Patriarch, \u201cyou are now the Golden Prince of the Golden Frost Sect!!\u201d By this point, he felt that something fishy was going on, but considering the crisis they were in, he couldn\u2019t focus too much on that.</p><br/><p>Fatty immediately started to get excited. In his opinion, it was the time to push things a bit further, so he took a deep breath and then ripped off the top of his robe, revealing his rolls of fat. His expression serious and filled with the determination to die for his sect, he cried out, \u201cPatriarch, please bestow me with a titular tattoo!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease carve the characters \u2018Golden Prince of the Golden Frost Sect\u2019 onto my back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Spirit Severing Patriarch stared in shock, and his face twitched.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by John Doh, Juan S Santana, Nararat Vachiramanaporn, and Anonymous</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

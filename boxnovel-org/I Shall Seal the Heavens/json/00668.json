She truly was worried about what would happen if Meng Hao lost. The price he would pay would be incredible\u2026.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was expressionless as he pulled out a bag of holding and tossed it onto the Nine Dragons Demon Heart Scale. As soon as the bag of holding touched its surface, one of the dragons carved onto the stone slab started glowing with a bright light.</p><br/><p>Everyone watched closely as the scene played out, especially the seven old men. Their expressions flickered, and then quickly began to shine with happiness.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t worried about losing; they were worried that Meng Hao\u2019s bag of holding wouldn\u2019t have very many Demon hearts in it. Seeing that it had 10,000, they knew that even after splitting it up, the seven of them would make a tidy profit.</p><br/><p>As smiles appeared on the faces of the seven, Honor Guard Zhou\u2019s eyes went wide and he felt a bit of regret. Before, he had assumed that Meng Hao would have a few hundred Demon hearts, or at the most a few thousand. However, it turned out that he actually had 10,000.</p><br/><p>His regret quickly vanished, though, as he realized that there was no way Meng Hao could win. He would lose in the end, and then the Seven Tycoons would have more Demon hearts to exchange.</p><br/><p>It was in this moment that the second dragon started to glow, until it was half-lit. That indicated that Meng Hao\u2019s bag of holding had 15,000 Demon hearts in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lose!\u201d he said immediately. Joy and excitement appeared on his face, although he appeared to be struggling to suppress it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaid who?\u201d laughed the old man standing in front of him. \u201cThe competition is between you and the seven of us. The contest isn\u2019t over until it\u2019s over, and no one is allowed to interfere. In this competition, one party must hand over all Demon hearts to the other in the end.\u201d The other six men all started nodding.</p><br/><p>The first old man walked back a few steps, and a second old man proudly stepped forward. He produced a bag of holding, then looked contemptuously at Meng Hao as he tossed it onto the stone slab.</p><br/><p>A buzzing sound could be heard, and the stone slab began to vibrate. The dragons on its surface almost seemed alive, and were emanating pulsing ripples. The second dragon was now completely glowing, making it look very lifelike. Furthermore, the third dragon was also fully lit.</p><br/><p>\u201cA total of 30,000 Demon hearts!\u201d said Honor Guard Zhou excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have more?\u201d asked the old man, looking at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The other six men were doing the same thing. All of them were imagining a situation in which Meng Hao had a few more Demon hearts, but not many, and the competition would end on a relatively anti-climactic note.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was grim as he slowly placed his right hand into his robe. Then, he pulled out another bag of holding, which he threw over to the stone slab. As soon as it landed, the third dragon completely lit up, as did ten percent of the fourth dragon.</p><br/><p>Honor Guard Zhou gasped and looked over at Meng Hao. \u201c31,000\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Yunliang\u2019s eyes were wide, and he almost couldn\u2019t believe it. Inwardly, he was laughing bitterly. If he had known Meng Hao possessed so many Demon hearts, there would never have been such a commotion.</p><br/><p>Even the seven old men were shocked. Each of them possessed over 10,000 Demon hearts, but none had an accumulation that exceeded 20,000. And yet, their opponent unexpectedly produced 30,000. As of now, they couldn\u2019t help but start to form various speculations about him.</p><br/><p>It only took a moment, though, for the seven men to exchange glances. All of their eyes were burning with passion, as they realized that they were actually much more interested in this contest than they had been before. Considering that their opponent had around 30,000 Demon hearts, if they won, it meant each of them would get approximately 5,000. The mere thought of it caused their hearts to begin to thump rapidly.</p><br/><p>Then, the seven of them began to chuckle. It was at this point that the second old man stepped back and the third walked forward. He waved his right hand, causing a bag of holding to fly out. Immediately, the fourth and fifth dragons lit up, although the fifth was only ninety percent lit.</p><br/><p>\u201c49,000 low-grade Demon hearts!\u201d said Honor Guard Zhou, who then looked over at Meng Hao. It wasn\u2019t just him. Everyone, including Wei Li, were now staring at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse to believe that you can continue to compete,\u201d said the third old man, his voice cool.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao said nothing. It seemed as if he had an endless supply of bags of holding in his robe. He produced yet another, which he tossed out, causing the fourth, fifth, and sixth dragons to completely light up!</p><br/><p>The bag of holding turned out to have 30,000 Demon hearts in it!</p><br/><p>Honor Guard Zhou\u2019s mind was spinning, and he was breathing heavily. He stared blankly at the six glowing dragons on the stone slab.</p><br/><p>\u201c60,000\u2026 Demon hearts!\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of the seven old men flickered, and they stared dead at Meng Hao. Then they exchanged glances, and reached a consensus. In their opinion, this had to be the last bag of holding their opponent would produce.</p><br/><p>\u201c60,000 Demon hearts! No wonder he was so domineering!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never imagined that he would have so many Demon hearts. However, compared to the seven of us, he can\u2019t match up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe best would be if he had 70,000, then each of us would get 10,000. That\u2019s quite a hefty profit. Well, even if this guy has someone powerful backing him, does he really think he can fight back against the seven of us altogether?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The seven old men chuckled as the fourth and fifth of their number stepped forward at the same time. The two of them tossed out bags of holding, which, as soon as they landed onto the stone slab, caused a blinding light to shine out. It wasn\u2019t the just the sixth dragon which lit up; the seventh did too, and even fifty percent of the eighth.</p><br/><p>\u201c75,000 low-grade Demon hearts!\u201d said Honor Guard Zhou, his amazed voice echoing about.</p><br/><p>The fifth old man laughed heartily. \u201cFellow Daoist, however many low-grade Demon hearts you have, bring them out. We\u2019ll keep up with you until the end.\u201d His expression was proud, and his heart was filled with joy that he could not cover over.</p><br/><p>The others also smiled complacently as they pondered what it would be like to split up all of Meng Hao\u2019s Demon hearts.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao blinked, and then reached yet again into his robe. The eyes of the seven men narrowed as Meng Hao produced another bag of holding, which he tossed over to the stone slab.</p><br/><p>A rumbling sound echoed out as the seventh and eighth dragons lit up. Only the ninth dragon remained dark.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the seven old men burst into hearty laughter. Even Honor Guard Zhou let out a sigh of relief. Clearly, Meng Hao only had 80,000 Demon hearts, otherwise, the ninth dragon would already have begun to shine with light.</p><br/><p>Sun Yunliang had long since begun to pant, and his heart was pounding. When he saw Honor Guard Zhou\u2019s expression, he truly wished he could simply step over and slap the man across the face. \u201cWhat an idiot! Someone who possesses 80,000 Demon hearts is not someone to provoke lightly. Perhaps he just didn\u2019t dare to fight against the power of the seven combined. But now we have this situation here in the Sun Soul Society. He definitely won\u2019t give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis farce is over,\u201d said the sixth old man. \u201cFellow Daoist, it\u2019s time for me to teach you a lesson. Never forget, there are always Heavens beyond the Heavens you know, and there are always people out there who are better than you.\u201d He didn\u2019t even step forward. He simply tossed out a bag of holding. It landed with a bang onto the stone slab, causing the eight dragon to light up completely, along with seventy percent of the ninth dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201c87\u2026 87,000 low-grade Demon hearts!\u201d gasped Honor Guard Zhou.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s brow furrowed, and he felt around in his robe. However, he did not produce another bag of holding. All of the low-grade Demon hearts that he possessed had been there in his robe.</p><br/><p>When she saw the expression on Meng Hao\u2019s face, Wei Li\u2019s heart began to pound. The expressions on the faces of the seven old men were of completely complacency. One of them stepped forward, and reached out toward the bags of holding which Meng Hao had placed onto the stone slab.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say you could touch those?\u201d said Meng Hao. He waved his right hand, causing a mild attack to fly out that pushed the old man back. The old man\u2019s face flickered, and as he looked over at Meng Hao, the other six old men stepped forward, displeased expressions clouding their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing a sore loser, Fellow Daoist?\u201d asked one.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you are, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said another. \u201cYou must admit your defeat. You lost, so those Demon hearts belong to us now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever. Then he smiled, a faint, bashful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe competition isn\u2019t over yet, so how could I have lost?\u201d His words caused the hearts of the seven old men to suddenly sink, and they exchanged flabbergasted looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have more low-grade Demon hearts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLow-grade Demon hearts? No, I\u2019m out,\u201d replied Meng Hao. It was at this point that he slapped the bag of holding at his side, from within which unexpectedly appeared another bag of holding. This was one of the special bags of holding that he had purchased in Seahold.</p><br/><p>Hefting it, Meng Hao looked at the Nine Dragons Demon Heart Scale. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we use something else other than this slab? It would be a shame for an incredible treasure like it to be damaged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the seven old men could only stare in shock at the bag of holding in Meng Hao\u2019s hand. Then, however, one of the old men sneered. \u201cThe stone slab only has nine dragons, but if the number exceeds 100,000, then they will change color. To date, I have never heard of anyone being able to use Demon stones to damage a Nine Dragons Demon Heart Scale.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked over at Sun Yunliang, who hesitated for a moment before smiling wryly and nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, then,\u201d said Meng Hao, tossing over the bag of holding. When it landed on the stone slab, it caused a boom to ring out that was audible even down on the first floor. At the same time, the ninth dragon completely lit up.</p><br/><p>Looks of concentration appeared on the men\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>Next, the first dragon began to change color, turning blue.</p><br/><p>The sight of it caused the faces of the seven old men to fall.</p><br/><p>After that, the second dragon, the third dragon, in fact, all of the nine dragons turned blue.</p><br/><p>Then they changed color again, starting with the first and going all the way to the ninth, until they all glittered with bright violet light.</p><br/><p>The seven old men were trembling, and looks of shock and disbelief covered their faces. A few even said, \u201cImpossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the changes didn\u2019t stop with the violet light. Once more, the dragons began to change color, this time to orange.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrange light\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s orange light!\u201d The minds of the seven old men were spinning, as if they were being struck by lightning. They shook, their eyes blank with astonishment.</p><br/><p>However, the light was not finished changed. Once again it began to transform, for the fifth time, causing the dragons, one after another, to shine with a glow the color of blood!</p><br/><p>The changes in color left the people in the area completely and utterly shocked. They stared with wide open mouths, their minds roaring, as the nine dragons turned completely the color of blood. And then\u2026</p><br/><p>The nine dragons flickered brightly, as if\u2026 they were about to change to yet another color.</p><br/><p>However, the Nine Dragons Demon Heart Scale had apparently reached its limit, and the color couldn\u2019t change. A rumbling sound filled the building, and soon was audible even outside. Shockingly, the sound was coming from the Nine Dragons Demon Heart Scale itself. Cracking noises could be heard as, in the full vision of everyone present, it suddenly\u2026 completely disintegrated!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat. As he looked around at the shocked people around him, he thought to himself that being rich\u2026 felt great!</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Atettmara</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

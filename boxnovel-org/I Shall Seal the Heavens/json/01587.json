The Ghost could not see it. The Devil was not qualified to activate it. Even the God didn\u2019t trigger it. But today, you will see it, Meng Hao. You will see it....</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a curse fueled by the power of my true form, unleashed by the last scrap of my will within the starry sky of the Vast Expanse. It is my curse, created countless years ago....\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to Allheaven\u2019s words, Meng Hao\u2019s pupils constricted, and his heart began to pound. Clearly, Allheaven was not simply trying to sound mysterious and impressive. He had no reason to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>His words revealed a very disturbing truth: if this so-called curse had been created during Allheaven\u2019s prime, then considering the current level of Meng Hao\u2019s cultivation base, it would most likely be impossible for him to break it.</p><br/><p>In his prime, Allheaven had commanded terrifying, unimaginable power. In fact, he was so powerful that neither the Ghost, the Devil, nor the God had been able to do anything more than destroy one of his fingers!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes began to widen. Allheaven\u2019s connection to the starry sky of the Vast Expanse was utterly and thoroughly severed. Even still, though, Meng Hao could not prevent a sense of dread from seeping into his heart.</p><br/><p>He was not disheartened, though. Although he wasn\u2019t sure about the exact nature of the curse, he was sure it had something to do with Karma. Therefore, as long as he was willing to pay the price, he should be able to fight back against it. Even Allheaven at his prime would not be able to kill him with just a curse.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was very grim as the crumbling, vanishing Allheaven spoke in a voice that seemed to contain bizarre and mysterious power: \u201cAny person who kills me....\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, his words began to resonate with the entire starry sky!</p><br/><p>Shockingly, despite the fact that Meng Hao had completely severed Allheaven\u2019s connection to the starry sky of the Vast Expanse, he was still able to form a resonance with it. That caused Meng Hao\u2019s expression to become even grimmer than before.</p><br/><p>\u201c... shall find that his people, his bloodlines, everyone connected to him by Karma, everything connected to the Karma of those people, and anyone connected to that greater web of Karma, will be cursed!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will spread from this one point outwards, and it will spread yet again from those it spreads to, on and on until it has nowhere left to spread!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone within that range, everything within that scope, all lives... shall be cursed by Allheaven!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy curse upon them is thus: in their lives, time is limited!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo type of cultivation magic, no type of bloodline power, no type of precious material, no type of reincarnation, will be even slightly effective in breaking the curse!</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the curse does not affect Transcendent cultivators, it can exist for all eternity!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Allheaven\u2019s words rang out, it was clear that he was speaking them in the present, and yet somehow, it seemed as if they were being spoken countless years in the past. In fact, if one listened closely, it almost seemed like two different voices, one in the past, one in the present, joining together, melding, causing everything to shake!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it seemed as if the resonance with the starry sky wasn't being formed by Allheaven\u2019s current power, but rather, by the Allheaven of the past, when he was in his prime. He had created this curse countless years ago, then buried it, where it had remained hidden until this day.</p><br/><p>After the words were spoken, Allheaven looked at the shock on Meng Hao\u2019s face, and laughed mockingly. Then his body exploded.</p><br/><p>Allheaven\u2019s clone, the former lord of the entire starry sky of the Vast Expanse, was dead in body and soul!</p><br/><p>From this moment on, Allheaven\u2019s true form could exist only in the void outside of the Vast Expanse. It would be impossible for him to come inside the Vast Expanse, regardless of what power he unleashed. Meng Hao had become the Heavens, and because of that, there would be only one voice inside the Vast Expanse, one will. And that was... the will of Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked grimly at the spot where Allheaven had exploded. Countless motes of light could be seen there, and instead of fading away, they began to shoot toward Meng Hao. He was now the ultimate lord of the starry sky, so as the motes fused into him, rumbling sounds echoed out, and his soul experienced incredible growth. In the blink of an eye, his soul, his fleshly body, and his cultivation base all reached an unprecedented level of power.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, his Dao Essence, the Essence of the world which he had created inside of him, also experienced exponential growth. After fully absorbing the clone of Allheaven, that world inside of him lit up with dazzling light, and life began to flourish there.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, he was no longer half a step into the Ancestor Realm. He had taken that final step, and was... fully within the Ancestor Realm!</p><br/><p>In the Ancestor Realm, one\u2019s body became a world, with its own starry sky!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s will spread out, filling the starry sky of the Vast Expanse. He saw all the living creatures, and looked at them silently as he contemplated the curse of Allheaven. After a long moment, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Demon Sovereign!\u201d</p><br/><p>In that moment, all cultivators within the starry sky of the Vast Expanse felt their minds trembling as a voice that contained the weight of the Heavens spoke to them.</p><br/><p>Countless individuals dropped down to their knees to kowtow. The people of innumerable planets, land masses, and worlds all offered worship, as did the countless beings who had been involved in the war.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom this moment on, the starry sky of the Vast Expanse will no longer contain any mist!\u201d As soon as the words left Meng Hao\u2019s mouth, the entire starry sky cleared of mist. Everything trembled as it simply vanished. Within the space of a few breaths of time, not a single bit could be seen anywhere within the Vast Expanse!</p><br/><p>Brilliantly lit planets suddenly became visible, as well as a boundless, majestic starry sky....</p><br/><p>All living beings were profoundly shaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom this moment on, the starry sky of the Vast Expanse will have a new name. It will be called... the starry sky of the Mountains and Seas!\u201d With that, he waved his sleeve, and boundless life force spread out. Suddenly, the river of Time appeared, along with the giant crocodilian creature, who immediately prostrated in worship. Countless motes of light began to fly out from the river, as everyone from the Vast Expanse School army who had died in the fighting was resurrected!</p><br/><p>Having accomplished this, Meng Hao turned and headed off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Behind him, the voices of the Vast Expanse School\u2019s army joined together in a powerful cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur respect, Demon Sovereign!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur respect, Demon Sovereign!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Vast Expanse School cultivators cried out, the other living beings from the other parts of the starry sky all prostrated to the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur respect, Demon Sovereign!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound echoed out in astonishing fashion.... For a cultivator to have reached this level was like reaching the ultimate peak.</p><br/><p>And yet Meng Hao felt no joy. His heart only continued to sink as he contemplated the curse of Allheaven. He slowly strolled through the starry sky until he found the location where the Mountain and Sea Realm had once stood.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

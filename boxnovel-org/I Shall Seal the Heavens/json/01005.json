Planets trembled, and innumerable ripples shrank down into the form of an eye.</p><br/><p>Within that eye, an old man sat cross-legged. He had white hair, and looked very ancient, and as he spoke, he lifted his right hand and pointed toward Planet East Victory.</p><br/><p>As he pointed, boundless ripples spread out through the starry sky, covering Planet East Victory as if to prevent the first generation Patriarch from attacking.</p><br/><p>Up to now, the first generation Patriarch hadn\u2019t spoken a single word. Now, his hoarse voice echoed out, speaking a single sentence that caused the ripples in the starry sky to suddenly stop in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI demand rectification!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ji Xiufang screamed miserably. The sound echoed out as her head was separated from her body. Her body was then crushed into nothing but fragments, as if by a gigantic hand.</p><br/><p>She was annihilated, destroyed in both spirit and body!</p><br/><p>Even an almighty Dao Realm expert couldn\u2019t stand up to a single blow from the killing intent of the first generation Patriarch!</p><br/><p>In the moment that Ji Xiufang died, a boom could be heard as the killing intent slammed violently into the sealing shield surrounding Planet East Victory. Cracking sounds could be heard as the spell, being maintained by the combined forces of three of the Ji Clan\u2019s Dao Realm experts, collapsed into pieces.</p><br/><p>It shattered into countless tiny pieces that were swept up by a massive wind, which then blew them away from Planet East Victory. Innumerable fissures then opened up in the void, spreading out in a way that resembled a spider web.</p><br/><p>The three Dao Realm experts were scared witless, and their minds filled with roaring. Their faces fell as they did everything they could think of to escape, even to the point of unleashing Essence power.</p><br/><p>However... the killing intent from Planet East Victory was as intense as ever, enough to shake all of the Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, save us!!\u201d The three Dao Realm experts were so scared they felt as if their scalps were about to explode. An intense sensation of deadly crisis filled them, a feeling of fear that they had not experienced for a long, long time. It was as if... the killing intent from Planet East Victory wanted to wipe them clean away from the Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>Any one of these people could set foot onto any planet in the Ninth Mountain and Sea and make it tremble. A mere glance from them could send a sect rising to the top, or could destroy it. But now, they were so terrified that their hearts were trembling.</p><br/><p>They knew that the killing intent of the Fang Clan\u2019s first generation Patriarch... could prevent them from entering reincarnation. They would never be reborn, and would truly be erased from the world.</p><br/><p>They could only watch as the killing intent bore down on them, three Dao Realm Patriarchs of the Ji Clan. It was at this point that more ripples spread out through the starry sky, as if some power were forcefully interposing itself between the killing intent and the three old men. The ripples formed together into a huge, illusory eye.</p><br/><p>The eye appeared to be ancient, and as soon as it appeared, it stared fixedly at the killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Fang, enough! You're not a match for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The killing intent came to a stop in front of the eye. Scintillating light spread out as it formed into the shape of a person. It was the first generation Patriarch, who hovered there, formed from countless motes of shining light that made his visage somewhat blurry.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the old man sitting cross-legged within the eye looked over calmly at the first generation Patriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cI might not be able to seal the Heavens, but I can shatter the Heavens of the Ninth Mountain and Sea,\u201d the first generation Patriarch said coolly. As his voice echoed out, Meng Hao was standing down on Planet East Victory. Even with the level of his cultivation base, he was able to see what was happening. He looked up into the sky and saw the killing intent of the first generation Patriarch. He watched him slaughter a Dao Realm expert, and then cause the other three Dao Realm cultivators to flee for their lives. All of this caused Meng Hao\u2019s eyes to gleam with a strange light.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of these days, I\u2019m going to be just as powerful as him!\u201d he thought, panting. When he heard the first generation Patriarch's words, an even stranger expression rose up on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come it seems like these two guys are playing chess? One of them knows he can't outplay the other, but he still gives the impression that if he gets pissed off enough, he could just flip over the game board....\u201d Meng Hao cleared his throat. For some reason he suddenly realized that he quite liked the style of the first generation Patriarch.</p><br/><p>Up in the starry sky, the old man in the giant eye didn't respond to the Fang Clan\u2019s first generation Patriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ji Clan is not permitted to step half a pace into the starry sky surrounding Planet East Victory,\u201d the first generation Patriarch said slowly.</p><br/><p>The old man in the giant eye looked deeply at the first generation Patriarch, then slowly nodded. Finally, the eye flew backward, enveloped the three Dao Realm experts, and then vanished.</p><br/><p>The matter of Ji Xiufang and the three Quasi-Dao old men wasn\u2019t brought up.... Apparently, the Ji Clan was willing to give them up as the price to pay to the Fang Clan to end the situation.</p><br/><p>When the giant eye faded away, the image of the first generation Patriarch also disappeared. No figure was visible, and the killing intent vanished. Everything went back to normal.</p><br/><p>However, the Ninth Mountain and Sea was only beginning to be shaken.</p><br/><p>All of the sects and clans of the Ninth Mountain and Sea witnessed the rise of the Fang Clan that day. They personally watched as the Fang Clan of former glory, which had remained quiet and silent for so many years, once again became one of the most domineering forces in the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>Even the Ji Clan had to pay the price, which caused all cultivators to gasp. Now, they looked toward the Fang Clan with expressions of shock and fear.</p><br/><p>The Fang Clan had remained quiet for a long time, leading many people in the Ninth Mountain and Sea to believe that their strength was just for show. Now, such notions were shattered. The Fang Clan made it very clear to everyone that they were just as domineering as they always had been!</p><br/><p>The reappearance of the first generation Patriarch, despite him being a clone, or more accurately, the soul of Planet East Victory, caused everyone who witnessed the event to be thoroughly shaken. Furthermore, it became known that, in addition to the first generation Patriarch, the Fang Clan had two Dao Realm experts. In the end, though, it was the first generation Patriarch himself that was the most shocking deterrent.</p><br/><p>Considering the Ji Clan was incapable of exterminating the Fang Clan, how could any of the other sects and clans possibly be qualified to be on an equal footing with them?</p><br/><p>The Ninth Mountain and Sea was completely and utterly shaken.</p><br/><p>The Dao Realm Patriarchs of the various sects and clans mused on the matter silently. It was now with great caution and fear that they looked toward Planet East Victory and the Fang Clan.</p><br/><p>The first generation Patriarch had slaughtered Dao Realm experts, instilling such fear that they could only gasp in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering the Fang Clan is like this, they fully deserve to be called... the despots of the Ninth Mountain and Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the Fang Clan revealed all their trump cards in that battle, and allowed everyone to see, you would think that would remove some of their air of mystery. And yet... that final trump card is simply too astonishing....\u201d</p><br/><p>After much thought, the Dao Realm experts sighed and returned to their various organizations.</p><br/><p>It was in this manner that the upheavals of the Fang Clan ended. The Fang Clan was the clear winner. The fangs bared by the Ji Clan were shorn clean, and they were forced to pay the price of one Dao Realm expert and three Quasi-Dao cultivators.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the problem of the traitors within the Fang Clan was handled perfectly. After the baptism of blood, the Fang Clan... was more stable than ever.</p><br/><p>In addition to the presence of the first generation Patriarch, the Fang Clan also had a worthy successor. First was Meng Hao, who was already stunning beyond compare, a person the Ninth Mountain and Sea would never forget. Joining Meng Hao was Fang Wei.</p><br/><p>The fact that Fang Wei was focused on defending the clan to the death was something that many people had noted.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao and Fang Wei were now objects of admiration and envy on the part of the other sects and clans.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst they have Meng Hao, who stifled all of the members of his generation! His path... will definitely stretch far and wide. And then there\u2019s Fang Wei. He might be a bit weaker than Meng Hao, but he's strong enough to defend the clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne will wage battle outside the clan, the other will remain inside to defend it! With the two of them, the Fang Clan will only achieve greater heights of glory....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder the Ji Clan attacked the Fang Clan. It won\u2019t be too long before... the Fang Clan might be strong enough to contend with Lord Ji for control of the Heavens again. After all, they\u2019re the Fang Clan, ya know? They used to be just like the Ji Clan, a powerful clan of warriors!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ji Clan has their Karma, and the Fang Clan has their reincarnation. Two warrior clans who caused a rain of blood to fall upon the Ninth Mountain and Sea back in the day....\u201d</p><br/><p>The war of the Fang Clan ended. However, it didn't take long before the various sects and clans of the Ninth Mountain and Sea sprang into action. Various Patriarchs prepared to personally take their Chosen to Planet East Victory to offer congratulatory gifts due to the appearance of the first generation Patriarch.</p><br/><p>After the Ji Clan left, Planet East Victory returned to normal. The only thing that remained of the traitorous clan members was their blood that stained the ground, and the reek of gore that filled the air. The resurrected clan members were filled with complex feelings. Under the direction of the Grand Elder, the recovery work began.</p><br/><p>Fang Wei stood there silently. After looking around, bitterness rose up in his heart, and he bowed his head.</p><br/><p>The first generation Patriarch did not stay. The whole clan bowed deeply in respect as he reentered the rift to the ancestral land. In the moment before he disappeared, he turned and looked at Meng Hao for a moment.</p><br/><p>In that moment, a tremor ran through Meng Hao, and the first generation Patriarch's voice suddenly rang out in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have signs of the legacy of Lord Li on you.... The legacy of Lord Li is connected to East Victory. At the same time, it is no longer on Planet East Victory; it has already been acquired by a cultivator from this planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the Ji Clan sowing chaos here in the Fang Clan, that also had to do with the legacy. Actually, the legacy was used simply to draw out the Ji Clan; a strategy, that\u2019s all. However, when the time comes to activate it, if it is connected to you by destiny, then you should be able to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne Thought Stellar Transformation.... Without a bloodline clone, it\u2019s impossible to cultivate it to the final degree!</p><br/><p>\u201cNirvana Fruits... use them well. The members of the Fang Clan have four lives. If you combine them together at the right time, then you can open... the door to the Ancient Realm!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and I are connected by destiny, drawn together by blood.... The Ancient Realm begins with Dao Fruit, but you... if you begin with Nirvana Fruit, then you can accomplish something completely unheard of and shake the entire Nine Mountains and Seas!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ancient voice echoed in Meng Hao\u2019s ears before fading away. Meng Hao trembled as he watched the first generation Patriarch step into the rift and then vanish.</p><br/><p>After hearing the Patriarch\u2019s words, Meng Hao's eyes began to shine. Gradually he came to a new understanding. Before, he had been confused as to the role played by the Nirvana Fruits in the whole matter. How effective would they have been if Fang Heshan had been able to resist the urge to spring into action? If that had happened, wouldn\u2019t it mean that the entire series of events simply wouldn\u2019t have occurred?</p><br/><p>Meng Hao now understood that the core element of the plan hadn't been his Nirvana Fruits, but rather, the revelation regarding the legacy of Lord Li. That was why the Ji Clan had made their move.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne Thought Stellar Transformation... a Daoist magic that, when cultivated to the ultimate degree, can be used to incarnate into a planet....\u201d The starstone in his left eye glittered, causing his heart to pound even faster. According to what the first generation Patriarch had said, the Ancient Realm... was not too far away for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have two Nirvana Fruits from the first generation Patriarch, and two of my own. Nirvana Fruits can allow members of the Fang Clan bloodline to live four lives!</p><br/><p>\u201cFour Nirvana Fruits, when I can absorb all of them with no time limit... that... is when I will step into the Ancient Realm!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes shone with a bright light. The sight of the first generation Patriarch slaughtering members of the Dao Realm once again flashed in his mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

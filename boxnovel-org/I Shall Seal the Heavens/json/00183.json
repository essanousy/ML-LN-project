He wasn\u2019t the least bit moved. He looked calmly at the sneering Li, and Zhou Shanyue, who stood next to him, face grim.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan looked angry. He knew that Elder Brother Li and Zhou Shanyue were on good terms, and that neither of them liked him very much. It was only because of his flying dagger that they never did much to him.</p><br/><p>However, having Meng Hao at his side had caused innumerable difficulties with this sinister pair.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want a fight, how about you two versus me?\u201d said Chen Fan coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs fellow Sect members, we have nothing to learn from each other,\u201d laughed Li. \u201cI want to see if I can pick up a move or two from this outsider. Junior Brother Chen, you aren\u2019t really going to prevent such an exchange, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan gave a cold snort, grabbing Meng Hao to leave. Meng Hao smiled. He found the whole situation quite amusing. However, Chen Fan seemed devoted to keeping Meng Hao safe, and he didn\u2019t want to refuse his good will. He was just about to follow along with Chen Fan when Zhou Shanyue\u2019s dark voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re scared, we understand.\u201d The surrounding Solitary Sword Sect disciples all laughed loudly. \u201cHow about this: Elder Brother Li will restrict his power to that of the mid Foundation Establishment stage. That would make things fair. We really want to see what magic you outsiders have. Junior Brother Chen, this matter has nothing to do with you. You can\u2019t keep him hiding behind you forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Solitary Sword Sect Cultivators generally stay away from outsiders. Many of them, although they didn\u2019t want to sneer at Elder Brother Chen, were getting excited at the scene which was playing out in front of them.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan ignored them, continuing to pull Meng Hao away. However, hearing Zhou Shanyue\u2019s words caused Meng Hao to suddenly stop in his tracks. He turned and looked at Li and Zhou Shanyue, forcing an outraged expression to appear on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince a battle to the death is out of the question, we need to make a wager,\u201d he said, making his voice seem out of control.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the surrounding Solitary Sword Sect Cultivators burst into more laughter. Many of them had Cultivation bases lower than Meng Hao, but they were disciples of the Solitary Sword Sect, the number one Sect in the Southern Domain. It was only natural for them to feel somewhat superior.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shanyue laughed, as did middle-aged Li.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d said Li. \u201cIf you stop hiding behind Junior Brother Chen and dare to fight me, then there\u2019s no harm in making a little wager. I have a treasured sword as well as several tens of thousands of Spirit Stones!\u201d Laughing, he slapped his bag of holding to produce an azure-colored sword. The sword aura which swirled around it wasn\u2019t spectacular, but wasn\u2019t ordinary either.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother, you\u2026.\u201d said Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>He was about to continue when Meng Hao, eyes bloodshot, interrupted him. Glaring, he said, \u201cA handful of Spirit Stones and a sword aren\u2019t enough for Meng Hao. Put some more onto the table, sir, and then I\u2019ll fight you!\u201d His loud voice rang out. The words he had spoken, and the expression on his face, were something he had long since become accustomed to using. He had faced many situations like this in the State of Zhao. Furthermore, he still had an unused golden spear in his bag of the Cosmos\u2026.</p><br/><p>The crowd around them laughed loudly. Li looked at Meng Hao, his sneer growing larger.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever you put up as stakes, sir, I will match in value.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to him, Zhou Shanyue laughed. \u201cNo matter,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever you produce, if Elder Brother Li matches it in value, then so shall I!\u201d He glared at Chen Fan, and deep in his eyes, killing intent swirled.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gasped. His eyes darted around as if he wished to run away. \u201cAre you serious?!\u201d he said, his voice sounding forced.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the Solitary Sword Sect, now,\u201d said Zhou Shanyue haughtily. \u201cDo you really think we would lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan grabbed Meng Hao\u2019s arm and was about to say something.</p><br/><p>Trembling, Meng Hao looked over at him and said, \u201cElder Brother Chen, can you please loan me your flying dagger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan looked at Meng Hao for a long moment. Finally, he lifted his hand up, and the black flying dagger appeared, a blade which could unleash the power of the Core Formation stage!</p><br/><p>This dagger was extremely important to Chen Fan. If he lost it, his position within the Sect would immediately become unstable. The repercussions would be dire. However, it only took the space of a few breaths for him to make up his mind to place it in Meng Hao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>This display of brotherly affection caused Meng Hao to look deeply at Chen Fan. A warm feeling filled his entire body, creating a memory that would exist for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother,\u201d said Chen Fan, his eyes glowing with encouragement, \u201cif you\u2019re really going to fight, then do so with a light heart. If you lose, it won\u2019t matter. No big deal. And if you win, then win something good!\u201d Although he didn\u2019t have much faith that Meng Hao could win, this was his style.</p><br/><p>Everything was quiet around them as the crowd stared at the black flying dagger in Meng Hao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The silence lasted only for a moment before a buzz of conversation filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Patriarch Zhou\u2019s Core Formation flying dagger!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the symbol of the Seven Solitary Sword Sons, and Elder Brother Chen is actually giving it to a stranger to put up as stakes for a bet\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese stakes are incredible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding disciple\u2019s eyes shone brightly, and more than a few produced transmission jade slips to notify other fellow disciples of what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what I\u2019m putting up. Now it\u2019s your turn. No bet, no fight!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s voice was resolute, and his eyes shone with a do-or-die look. To the onlookers, however, it appeared that his coolness was forced, and that he was simply trying to bluff Zhou and Li into leaving him alone.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shanyue\u2019s body trembled as he glared at the black dagger in Meng Hao\u2019s hand. He panted, as did middle-aged Li. They exchanged an excited, shocked glance.</p><br/><p>They had never imagined that Chen Fan would actually take out the flying dagger and give it to his Junior Brother to put up as stakes in the bet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything to bet, then you can\u2019t blame me for not participating,\u201d repeated Meng Hao, preparing to hand the flying dagger back to Elder Brother Chen. Zhou Shanyue obviously couldn\u2019t allow this to happen. His hand shot up and he ripped open the top of his robe to reveal a jade pendant hanging around his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a life-saving jade forged by my father himself with blood from his Cultivation base. It has no attack power, but it can stand up against an attack from the Nascent Soul Stage! If you win, then it\u2019s yours. I\u2019ll even give you some of my Cultivation base blood to use to refine it! I, Zhou, never go back on my word!\u201d His tone of voice could chop nails and slice iron. As they rang out, Chen Fan, along with the rest of the onlookers, gasped. Chen Fan stared at the life-saving jade. It was a treasure his master had bestowed upon his son to protect him. In terms of value, it definitely exceeded his flying dagger.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao put on a look of complete shock. He began to breathe heavily, causing Zhou Shanyue to laugh coldly, his eyes shining coldly.</p><br/><p>In a seemingly forced voice, Meng Hao said, \u201cThat\u2019s not enough. You just said that both of you would match the value of whatever I put up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, middle-aged Li laughed heartily. He glared coldly at Meng Hao, and then gave pale-faced Chen Fan a sinister look. At the moment, he was convinced of what to do. He knew Chen Fan and Chen Fan\u2019s personality. He wouldn\u2019t do anything devious, so clearly his expression revealed his true feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Li, don\u2019t have any precious treasures like Junior Brother Zhou. However, I do have some Spirit Stones saved up. Fellow disciples, if you are able to loan me some Spirit Stones, it will be to your benefit. I will pay them back with an additional one stone for every hundred you give.\u201d He laughed again, watching as the hundreds of surrounding Cultivators saluted him respectfully. A few of them flew over to him, and then more and more.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, Elder Brother Li. Of course we can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! I don\u2019t have a lot of Spirit Stones, just a few thousand, my savings from the past few years. If you need them, Elder Brother Li, then they\u2019re yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elder Brother Li. We can definitely help you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of hundreds of Cultivators filled the air. All of them produced Spirit Stones, in amounts ranging from hundreds to thousands. Soon, they had been piled together into a group of several tens of thousands of Spirit Stones.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese Spirit Stones can\u2019t compare in value to Junior Brother Zhou\u2019s precious treasure. Fine, fine, I won\u2019t try to take advantage of you. I have some magical items in my bag of holding that are worth tens of thousands of Spirit Stones. In total, their value is roughly 500,000!\u201d He flicked his sleeve, and then shot into the air, transforming into a beam of light which shot toward the Battle Arena. Amidst the excited cries of the surrounding Cultivators, he landed in the middle of the arena and turned to stare at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan looked at Meng Hao with a forced smile. He was just about to give some advice when Meng Hao put the flying dagger on the ground and then flew up in the air toward the Battle Arena.</p><br/><p>No one made a move to stop him.</p><br/><p>As he entered, the surrounding Cultivators craned their necks to watch. Middle-aged Li stood there arrogantly. He pressed his finger down onto the space between his eyebrows. Immediately, his Cultivation base sank down from the late Foundation Establishment stage to the mid Foundation Establishment stage, as if he had six Dao Pillars.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi is not the sort of person who would bully you,\u201d he said, sticking his jaw out, \u201cso I\u2019ll only use the power of the mid Foundation Establishment stage. Under no circumstances will I use the power of late Foundation Establishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s no need for that,\u201d murmured Meng Hao. He stood there in the Battle Arena, his expression very different than before. There was nothing fake about his expression now. He smiled, and within the smile was happiness, as well as a bit of shyness.</p><br/><p>The people here weren\u2019t familiar with this shyness. But the people from the Violet Fate Sect who had traded with him years before in the State of Zhao would know it well. It would cause their scalps to grow numb if they saw it. They would think themselves to be in some kind of nightmare, and would most likely fly into a violent rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a bit, you\u2019ll have to eat your words\u2026.\u201d said Meng Hao shyly. He looked just like the young scholar that had stood there on Mount Daqing years ago. He seemed a little embarrassed as he took a step forward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Such a feeling of superiority would often turn into a type of happiness.</p><br/><p>Oftentimes, that feeling of superiority really is\u2026 the source of happiness.</p><br/><p>For example, the feeling that you are safe while someone else is not, can be happiness. Another example would be drinking a cup of water when you are thirsty, while someone else has nothing to drink except their own saliva. That can also be a kind of happiness.</p><br/><p>The people in the boat were currently experiencing exactly that type of happiness.</p><br/><p>Because of such happiness, they were not as nervous about the danger that surrounded them. Instead, they were laughing and chatting about the unlucky fool on the outside who had overestimated himself.</p><br/><p>Of course, Meng Hao was the unlucky fool to whom they referred. Booming surrounded him as the mountain around him collapsed. At the same time, the gigantic battle-ax also started to collapse too.</p><br/><p>The backlash rocked the battle-ax, causing it to be torn to pieces right in front of Meng Hao. However, the magical symbols that had formed it did not disperse; instead, they formed back together into a huge hand. Instantly, the hand grabbed toward Meng Hao, radiating intense ferocity and hatred.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was calm as he lifted his hand and pointed forward. Instantly, his finger turned the color of blood. This was the Blood Finger!</p><br/><p>Next was a second finger, a third\u2026 and finally, five fingers stretched out, turning into the Blood Palm! It was fully thirty meters wide, seemingly illusory, but at the same time, incredibly realistic. Backed by the power of the Ninth Anima, it shot directly toward the ax-cum-hand.</p><br/><p>A huge boom could be heard as both the Blood Palm and the huge hand formed of magical symbols both exploded into little pieces. Meng Hao didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment; he instantly moved forward, performing an incantation gesture with his right hand and then waving his sleeve. A killing air immediately spread out. The glow of the Greenwood Tree could be seen, along with the extinction of the Violet Sea, raging flames, and the Frost Soil.</p><br/><p>This was a five elements magical technique that instantly caused five characters to appear. They exuded vicious pressure down onto the dissipating magical symbols of the battle-ax.</p><br/><p>A rumbling could be heard as the hundreds of magical symbols which had made up the battle-ax began to tremble. They seemed to be struggling to escape, but before they could, Meng Hao neared. His hand clenched into a fist, which then punched out, backed by the intense power of his fleshly body.</p><br/><p>The air vibrated, and a gust from the surrounding storm winds bore down on him. It slashed into the magical symbols, instantly cause them to scatter and disperse.</p><br/><p>This time, the magical symbols flashed, but did not re-form back together. Meng Hao gave a cold snort, then performed another incantation, simultaneously rotating his Cultivation base. Instantly, no less than a thousand tiny mountains appeared and then shot out.</p><br/><p>This thousand mountains technique was formed by the Mountain Consuming Incantation, and as it descended, each mountain exerted intense pressure onto a magical symbol. Instantly, they were all suppressed. Meng Hao waved his hand, and the mountains crushed down onto them.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the mountains began to consolidate together. Rumbling could be heard as a thousand-meter tall mountain appeared, sealed inside of which, shockingly, was a battle-ax.</p><br/><p>It struggled, attempting to free itself, but Meng Hao waved his hand through the air and the mountain shot toward him. As it did, it grew smaller and smaller, until it could fit onto the palm of his hand.</p><br/><p>The battle-ax inside was suppressed down, shrunken. It struggled more and more fiercely, until cracking and popping sounds could be heard. After the space of a few breaths of time, the battle-ax successfully destroyed the mountain, and then began to charge out from within.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was calm as the index finger of his left hand pushed onto the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Sealing, Eighth Hex!\u201d</p><br/><p>His coolly spoken words caused a \u2018hex\u2019 character to appear and cover the mountain peak, sealing it. The battle-ax let out a mournful wail. It was completely incapable of extricating itself now.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao felt a bit relieved, finally. He left behind a strand of Divine Sense, added a few more restrictive spells, and then finally smiled and put the mountain into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will count as a treasure,\u201d he thought, his eyes glittering brightly. Although it had seemed a simple matter to subjugate the item, it actually took all the power of his Cultivation base, as well as the support of his incredibly powerful fleshly body. Were it some other Spirit Severing Cultivator along the likes of Patriarch Huyan, they could by no means collect up the battle-ax in the relaxed manner which Meng Hao just had.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more spirit treasures I have like this the better,\u201d he thought. \u201cWho knows what kind of price I\u2019ll be able to sell them for in the future.\u201d Eyes shining brightly, he looked around until his gaze fell upon a group of one hundred magical symbols floating around off in the distance.</p><br/><p>The collection of symbols seemed to possess a certain amount of sentience. Perhaps because he had been touched by the aura of the battle-ax, as soon as he looked at the one-hundred symbol spell formation, it instantly appeared to be shocked, and then attempted to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this entire area was planned out like a structure to block Sea Demons, it wouldn\u2019t be very reasonable of me to take away all the spell formations. Besides, the one-hundred symbol formations can\u2019t even form into anything specific, so it would be mostly useless to try to take them away.\u201d Muttering to himself, Meng Hao turned and flew off into the distance, ignoring the one-hundred symbol spell formations.</p><br/><p>Quite some distance away, the passengers on the pitch-black ship could hear the muffled booms off in the distance, and their smiles grew even happier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy must be dead already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe overestimated his own ability, and didn\u2019t even have enough Spirit Stones to pay to get on the ship. No wonder he wanted to risk it all in the Third Ring. What a pity he\u2019s not very intelligent. Who does he think he is to try to charge through the Stormwind Divide? One of the Three Saints?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the others chatted and laughed, the two calm Cultivators closed their eyes and ignored the goings on. The three old men from the Sun Soul Society who were responsible for the boat looked more arrogant than ever. They had been running this boat for a full sixty-year cycle of time, and during that time had never heard of anyone successfully charging through the Stormwind Divide.</p><br/><p>However, after a few days passed, the sense of happiness felt by everyone had lessened a bit. But then, more of the magical symbols in the area, as well as the lightning and even the gusts of wind, seemed to be under pressure, even nervous. More explosions could be heard from off in the distance.</p><br/><p>The sounds caused the group to grow even more excited. This time, they didn\u2019t need any explanation from the three old men. Everyone knew exactly what the sounds were, even if they couldn\u2019t see the source. Soon, the sound of their conversation could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Don\u2019t tell me another person is trying to charge through?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother person who doesn\u2019t know their own limits? I never imagined that this trip to the Third Ring would be so fascinating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pity. I truly wish I could watch with my own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was excited, but the three old men were actually somewhat shocked. Just about every time they piloted the ship, they would hear explosions like this. However, it was very rare to hear such a series of explosions twice, like they had this time.</p><br/><p>The three old men exchanged smiles, but didn\u2019t think too much about it, and focused instead on piloting the ship forward.</p><br/><p>The sounds didn\u2019t last for very long, only as long as it takes an incense stick to burn. Then they faded away, and another round of talking and chuckling began on the ship.</p><br/><p>However, about four days later, the sounds could be heard once again. The passengers on the ship were astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How could there possibly be three people all trying to cross the Stormwind Divide?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething doesn\u2019t seem right\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone; do you think\u2026 that perhaps the person from the very beginning didn\u2019t actually die?\u201d These final words were spoken by the person with the weakest Cultivation base of the whole group, the young Core Formation Cultivator.</p><br/><p>As soon as he spoke the words, everyone went quiet. The two Cultivators who had sat there calmly the entire time suddenly opened their eyes, seemingly astonished by the implication of the young man\u2019s theory.</p><br/><p>The three men in charge of the ship also looked shocked, but quickly recovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo unfounded ravings allowed onboard!\u201d growled one of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Stormwind Divide!\u201d said another. \u201cOther than the Three Saints of the Milky Way Sea, nobody can cross it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously what we\u2019re hearing is an entire Sect trying to cross. It\u2019s not the first time something like that has happened.\u201d The rest of the passengers weren\u2019t quite sure whether or not to believe the words of the old men. In any case, the happiness of their mood had clearly lessened by quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Meng Hao flew quickly through the storm wind gusts. Currently, he faced a 150 meter long whip. The whip was about three meters wide, and completely savage in appearance. However, it was surrounded by an enormous mountain, which was gradually suppressing it.</p><br/><p>After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, it made an unyielding howl. Then the mountain descended, completely sealing it. It shrank down into Meng Hao\u2019s hand, after which he put it into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber four!\u201d he said, eyes shining brightly. With a smile, he turned and proceeded to speed along his way.</p><br/><p>Two more months passed by. During that time, the group on the ship heard one set of explosions after another. Soon, they had heard the sounds seven times. By now, their mood had changed from one of curiosity to shock.</p><br/><p>By the time the thirteenth set of explosions rang out, they were filled with dread. Even the three old men were panting.</p><br/><p>After the two months passed, and the twentieth set of explosions reached their ears. Everyone on the boat was now completely and utterly dumbfounded. That was especially so after they realized\u2026 that the sounds of the explosions were getting closer!</p><br/><p>During the two months, Meng Hao ran into more magical symbols in the shape of treasures. Whenever he did, he would instantly attack and exert full power to subdue them.</p><br/><p>By this point, he was in the very depths of the Stormwind Divide, and was getting much closer to the pitch-black ship.</p><br/><p>As he got deeper in, his speed was continually reduced. The intensity of the wind was now hurting him, and was even causing his body to start to break apart.</p><br/><p>Right now, he had to continuously disseminate power from his Cultivation base in order to hang on.</p><br/><p>As for the lightning, it was now possible to see illusory figures within it that apparently possessed sentience. Meng Hao was shocked.</p><br/><p>At one point, he suddenly caught sight of a bright white light in the otherwise pitch blackness. It seemed to be consuming lighting, which caused Meng Hao to take a deep breath and then change his course.</p><br/><p>What he saw was a toad, gobbling up lightning. This was the first time he had seen magical symbols shaped into the form of a beast. The toad was at least three hundred meters long, and in Meng Hao\u2019s estimation, was formed from around ten thousand magical symbols.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how far away I am from the edge of this place\u2026.\u201d he thought, avoiding the toad. The toad noticed him, but completely ignored him as it continued to consume lightning.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked away, and was just about to speed off into the distance when suddenly he made a slight \u201ceee?\u201d sound. He turned his head and sent Divine Sense out. Sure enough, he could sense a ship, speeding along through the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect. I can jump onto this ship and rest a bit while I go the rest of the way.\u201d His eyes glittering, he proceeded on toward it.</p><br/><p>------</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Edward Smith</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

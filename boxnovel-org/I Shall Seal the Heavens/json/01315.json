Even though we don't know how long it will last, it\u2019ll happen eventually anyway; we might as well get on with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Numerous shouting voices rose up from all parts of the Mountain and Sea Realm. As they echoed out, Meng Hao remained silent, and yet, his eyes flickered with an intense desire to do battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps after some preparation I could focus even more of the Mountain and Sea Realm\u2019s power,\u201d he thought. \u201cHowever... by that time, the two other terrifying enemies will have arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, why not fight now? If we can wipe out the 33 Heavens before the other two forces arrive... perhaps victory won\u2019t be an impossibility!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered. Now was not the time for silent contemplation. He looked up into the starry sky at the golden-armored hand which was still holding Lord White. He did not cry out that he wanted to fight, but instead, sent his divine sense roaring out, bursting with power equivalent to eighty percent of that of a Paragon.</p><br/><p>If the war was starting, then Lord White could be of significant aid to Meng Hao\u2019s Eternal stratum. Therefore... he could not be allowed to escape. Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense rumbled toward him....</p><br/><p>The golden-armored Outsider from the 1st Heaven had an expression of shock on his face. The reaction of all the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm caused him to subconsciously fall back, simultaneously trying to drag Lord White out of the Mountain and Sea Realm. However, it was in that same moment that Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense closed in.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense transformed into an enormous blade capable of sundering the Heavens, which then slashed viciously at the arm, moving at incredible speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a grain of rice fighting back against the sun and moon!\u201d the golden-armored Outsider said with a cold snort. Dazzling golden light then began to shine off of his hand, as if he was simply going to ignore Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense, and would continue to extract Lord White.</p><br/><p>However, even as his words echoed out, Meng Hao\u2019s blade of divine sense smashed into the golden light, which instantly distorted, and then began to tremble, apparently on the verge of shattering!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s....\u201d the golden-armored Outsider shouted in alarmed disbelief. His eyes had gone wide and his mind was reeling.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense blade pierced the golden light and then made contact with golden-armored Outsider\u2019s enormous arm. Cracking sounds echoed out as the golden armor shattered, revealing a long scaled arm.</p><br/><p>The arm trembled as Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense blade bit into it. The arm was apparently not even qualified to resist; in the blink of an eye, it was completely severed!!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered with killing intent as he stared at the severed arm and then shouted out in a thunder-like voice, \u201cAll invading Outsiders shall DIE!\u201d</p><br/><p>A massive roar echoed back in response from the 1st Heaven. The golden-armored Outsider\u2019s eyes went wide as the pain from his severed arm exploded out in his body. His heart began to thump as he realized that Meng Hao had accomplished this using only his divine sense; such a level of power left him completely terrified.</p><br/><p>\u201cParagon!\u201d shouted the golden-armored Outsider. \u201cThat\u2019s the power of a Paragon. Y-you\u2019re... you\u2019re a Paragon!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other Outsider cultivators from the 1st Heaven all gasped, and their faces flickered.</p><br/><p>Back in the Mountain and Sea Realm, the severed arm\u2019s hand slowly loosened its grip on Lord White, who turned to face Meng Hao with complete shock and despair on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll who betray the Mountain and Sea Realm shall DIE!\u201d Meng Hao hefted Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, then blasted toward Lord White as fast as lightning. In the blink of an eye, the spear stabbed into Lord White\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>A miserable scream echoed out, and complete disbelief could be seen in Lord White\u2019s eyes. He stared blankly at Meng Hao for a moment before his head completely exploded, followed by his entire body!</p><br/><p>The Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea was dead!!</p><br/><p>As Lord White died, the crown that he had worn began to fall. Cracking sounds could be heard as it then shattered into innumerable pieces. Simultaneously, Lord White\u2019s palace on the Seventh Mountain was transformed into ash, as if it had been crushed by an enormous hand!</p><br/><p>The only thing that was left behind there in the starry sky was a solitary crown, which floated down to rest atop the Seventh Mountain. There it waited... for a new Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea to appear!</p><br/><p>In the celestial pond atop the Seventh Mountain, the Xuanwu turtle's eyes glowed with a white light. Apparently, the connection that had sealed it to the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea was now gone.</p><br/><p>Boundless power of the Mountains and Seas began to spread out from the crown, filling the Seventh Mountain and Sea. At the same time, all of the cultivators who had been born in the Seventh Mountain and Sea could feel that power, and also could tell that...</p><br/><p>Now that the Lord had lost his position, everything under Heaven was up for grabs!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, back in the Eighth Mountain and Sea\u2026. In the moment that Lord White died, his corpse transformed into vast quantities of qi and blood, some of which was then absorbed by Demon Weapon Lonelytomb. However, most of that power actually transformed into strands of white mist, which Meng Hao then absorbed through his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, in the spot where Lord White had died, a green leaf appeared, which began to emanate resplendent light, as if a magical technique were forming. In that same moment, Meng Hao\u2019s Eternal stratum began to operate at full power, pulling the leaf toward him. A moment later, he completely absorbed it.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s entire body trembled, and he felt a boundless life force erupting out within him. Although his fleshly body didn\u2019t experience a breakthrough, the sudden buildup of energy left him shocked.</p><br/><p>He had the intense premonition that, if he used God blood to achieve a fleshly body breakthrough, then the power of his fleshly body would exceed that of a Dao Lord, and step directly into the Dao Sovereign level!!</p><br/><p>In fact, he could also tell that his 6th Soul Lamp... was apparently on the verge of being extinguished!</p><br/><p>Even as Meng Hao cut down Lord White, the shocking sounds of battle began to rise up in the Mountain and Sea Realm. Meng Hao could also sense the fluctuations of a towering power rising up from the Eighth Mountain. As of that moment, Meng Hao knew that his Grandpa Meng... had finally awoken.</p><br/><p>At long last, the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm once again spoke!</p><br/><p>\u201cFight!\u201d It was a single word, but the instant that it rang out, the nine Xuanwu turtles on the nine Mountains all threw their heads back and roared. Next, both the sun and moon of the Mountain and Sea Realm blazed with intense, dazzling light!</p><br/><p>Shocking rumbling sounds echoed out as nine beams of light shot up from the Nine Mountains, then slammed into the golden net up above. The net instantly began to shake, and then... started to collapse!</p><br/><p>As the net collapsed, the 1st Heaven of the 33 Heavens, regardless of whether or not it wished to... began to descend!!</p><br/><p>Now, what could be seen beyond the starry sky was not a boundless expanse, but rather, an enormous land mass.</p><br/><p>The 33 Heavens shook as countless streams of powerful divine sense exploded out. Shocking ripples also emanated out from the 1st heaven as a cold, ancient voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWar! Since the Mountain and Sea Realm desires this war to come early, well then... we shall fight!!\u201d As the voice echoed out, countless roaring sounds rose up from within the 1st Heaven. Next, figures could be seen emerging from the 2nd Heaven, the 3rd Heaven, from all of the 33 Heavens; more people wished to join in the battle!</p><br/><p>However, even as that happened, the sun and moon of the Mountain and Sea Realm sent two beams of radiant light shooting up into the 33 Heavens, toward the spot where the 1st Heaven and the 2nd Heaven connected!</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>The two beams of light instantly pierced through that connection, apparently cutting the 1st Heaven off from the other 33 Heavens. Immediately afterwards, another huge net appeared, completely enveloping the 1st Heaven and separating it!</p><br/><p>The other figures descended from beyond the 1st Heaven were temporarily halted in place. Enraged roars could be heard, and the 33 Heavens began to shake as the voices of countless cultivators echoed out. Back in the 1st Heaven, all of the Outsiders maintained their silence. However, it didn\u2019t take very long before they began to fly off of the land mass and charge toward the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p><br/><p>The war... was really beginning!</p><br/><p>The battlefield was not one location within the Mountain and Sea Realm, but rather... the entire Realm!</p><br/><p>The Outsider cultivators from the boundless 1st Heaven scattered out in various directions. These Outsiders from the 1st Heaven were vicious in appearance, and looked nothing like ordinary cultivators. They looked more like beasts, beasts which radiated shocking murderous intent.</p><br/><p>At the same time, all of the lands in the Mountain and Sea Realm were springing into action. Soon, the fighting had already broken out in full force.</p><br/><p>The Seventh Mountain and Sea was almost instantly transformed into a sea of flames. Few cultivators had been left behind there, ensuring that the Outsiders from the 1st Heaven met little resistance. Instead, most of them focused on fortifying the area to serve as their base.</p><br/><p>Clearly, the 1st Heaven had been preparing for this invasion for years!</p><br/><p>A similar scene was also playing out in the Sixth Mountain and Sea!</p><br/><p>The fighting immediately intensified. However, there had already been wars playing out in both the Eighth and Fifth Mountains. Although the forces present in those wars had sustained casualties, each front currently contained the combined power of two Mountains and Seas. Furthermore, because of what Meng Hao had done in the Eighth Mountain and Sea, the fighting there had not been as intense, and thus the armies there were still relatively intact.</p><br/><p>Now that the true war was beginning, all of the cultivators there fought back enthusiastically, and the booming sounds of battle echoed out.</p><br/><p>As for the other Mountains and Seas, there had been no fighting going on. The only thing they lacked was time to organize themselves. However, the Outsiders from the 1st Heaven were equally unprepared, so chaotic fighting immediately broke out.</p><br/><p>In the First Mountain and Sea, the Echelon cultivator Dao-Heaven took the lead in the fighting, and as for all the other sects and clans there, they had no other choice than to join in.</p><br/><p>It was the same in the Second Mountain and Sea and the Third Mountain and Sea. The only exception... was the Fourth Mountain and Sea!</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1315: Lord White Falls, The Battle Commences!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

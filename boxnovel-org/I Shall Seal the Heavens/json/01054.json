Although he was truly convinced that his own excessive killing had caused this irreconcilable conflict, the regret he felt was mostly gone thanks to the actions of these Demonic cultivators.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t matter who is right or wrong. Sometimes the only thing that matters... is who has the power to back up their words!</p><br/><p>Only the powerful could back up what they said!</p><br/><p>As soon as Meng Hao heard the Sea Realm Demon mention the word 'bet,\u2019 he thought for a moment and then smiled. It was a bashful smile, and a bit apologetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said hesitantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap!\u201d said the Demonic cultivator. \u201cDo you have the guts to make the bet, or not!?\u201d Immediately, the other Sea Realm Demons started laughing. As for Long Tianhai, he looked over with cool indifference.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know Meng Hao, so they had no idea that concealed beneath that bashful smile was a temper so violent that even words like conniption or paroxysm couldn\u2019t describe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo bets for me!\u201d Meng Hao took a deep breath and decided to take the high road for once. He once again turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it turns out that the Crown Prince of the Fang Clan doesn\u2019t dare to make real bets,\u201d said the seventh of the nine Demonic cultivators. \u201cThe only thing he can do is bully Fan Dong\u2019er!\u201d His words were venomous and cold, and instantly put Meng Hao in a bad position with the other disciples of the Nine Seas God World.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown Prince?! Pshhh, weak. Seems like the Fang Clan... is nothing special after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even mention the thing about being a joint disciple of the Three Great Daoist Societies. This guy is as cowardly as a mouse!\u201d The Demonic cultivators continued to spew increasingly vitriolic words. Their taunts were reaching the point of being direct verbal attacks.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao once again stopped in place and slowly turned around. His face was bright red, as if he was barely capable of containing his rage as he stared at the nine cultivators, panting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a bore! This guy can't do anything other than cheat! Useless! Even when making bets, the only thing he can do is bully girls! Screw him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, what do you want to bet!?\u201d growled Meng Hao through gritted teeth. He glared at the Demonic cultivators and took a few steps backward, as if he were bracing himself to do something he didn't want to do, but had no choice but to do.</p><br/><p>The Nine Demons of the Sea Realm looked at him with cold smiles. The person to reply was the third Demon, a woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cobviously we\u2019ll bet to see if you can get into the top ten of one of the other golden gate stone steles! Without cheating like you did in the ninth stele, of course.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the stakes, let's say 100,000 Immortal jades, as well as 5,000,000 spirit stones!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t get into the top ten, you don't have to pay any spirit stones, you just have to get the hell out of the Ninth Sea! And if you ever step half a foot back inside, you\u2019ll be killed in body and spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao's face twitched slightly, and after taking a deep breath, he started laughing loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat piddly stakes! You want to bet with me like that? Fan Dong\u2019er and I have a long-standing friendship that you don't even know about. Our bet from before was just for fun! If you really want to make a wager, then you have to put up 10,000,000 Immortal jades!!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have the guts to make the bet, or not!?\u201d Meng Hao spoke the words especially loudly. After pausing for the space of a few breaths without hearing a response, he started to laugh coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the guts, then forget about it,\u201d he said, quickly backing up as if he wanted to take advantage of the silence to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d Long Tianhai said coolly, his first time speaking. \u201cHowever, if you lose, you\u2019ll have to leave behind your four limbs for us as a souvenir.\u201d His words instantly caused the other eight Demonic cultivators to look very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou....\u201d said Meng Hao, appearing to be very shocked. His face was extremely grim as he stared back at Long Tianhai. Finally, he took a deep breath, gritted his teeth hard and said in a cautionary tone, \u201cWhat I said was 10,000,000 immortal jades PER golden gate stone stele. With eight steles, that means that if I can get into the top ten of all of them, you\u2019ll owe me 80,000,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gasps could be heard in the crowd, from both ordinary cultivators and Demonic cultivators alike. This was an incredible, shocking wager, the types of which were rarely seen in the Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>\u201c80,000,000 Immortal jades.... Heavens! How many spirit stones would that be worth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough to equal the life savings of an entire mid-sized clan of cultivators!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people are crazy....\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as the crowd went into an uproar, the nine Sea Realm Demons were internally shaken by Meng Hao\u2019s words. Even Long Tianhai\u2019s face fell.</p><br/><p>10,000,000 pieces of Immortal jade was a sum they could just barely scrape together. As for 80,000,000... that far exceeded their limit. Even for the Demonic Cultivator Horde as a whole, it was no small amount.</p><br/><p>The other eight Demonic cultivators hesitated. Their plan to make a bet with Meng Hao had been come up with on the fly, and had quickly reached the point that they didn\u2019t dare make any decisions unilaterally. All of them turned to look at Long Tianhai.</p><br/><p>An unsightly expression could be seen on his face as he stared at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao seemingly sighed inwardly, and was just about to speak up as if he were going to give the Demonic cultivators a way out of the bet, when Long Tianhai\u2019s eyes glittered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou're on,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we're going to change things a bit. If you don\u2019t get into the top ten of all of the golden gate stone steles, then not only do you have to forfeit your four limbs, you also have to give me... your place in the Echelon!\u201d After the words left Long Tianhai's mouth, utter silence reigned.</p><br/><p>Most people had no idea what the Echelon was. However, from the way the Three Great Daoist Societies treated Meng Hao, people could speculate. The matter of the Echelon was not something that could be kept secret forever, which Meng Hao knew. That was why he had taken the initiative to bring up the matter publicly earlier.</p><br/><p>Sometimes a matter being public rather than secret can lead to certain unexpected advantages.</p><br/><p>Deep in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes was a flickering coldness that no one could detect as he looked at Long Tianhai. They stared at each other for a moment, and within Long Tianhai's eyes, Meng Hao saw no trace of the coolness and disregard from earlier. Instead, he saw schemes and deceit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was putting on an act earlier!\u201d he thought, eyes glittering.</p><br/><p>Finally, he smiled coldly and said, \u201cWell in that case, I don\u2019t need 80,000,000. I want 300,000,000 Immortal jades! Add in one Dao weapon, and Meng Hao will take this bet with your Demonic Cultivator Horde!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s words were met with a chorus of gasps from the audience.</p><br/><p>300,000,000 Immortal jades was an astronomical sum. It was terrifying even to think about. Even for the Four Great Clans it would be a deleterious blow to be forced to hand over so much money. As for the Nine Seas God World, their reserves might be deep, but the Demonic Cultivator Horde only had access to thirty percent of the clan\u2019s resources. If they lost, it would be a severe blow to their foundation.</p><br/><p>As for a Dao weapon, that was a magical item that only a Dao Realm expert could wield. Such things were rare in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, and in fact, only three existed, one of which was in the possession of the Demonic Cultivator Horde.</p><br/><p>If they lost the bet, and the weapon, it couldn't quite measure up to the value of a place in the Echelon. However, if they won... it would all be worth it!</p><br/><p>The crowd was in an uproar, and the noise only continued to get louder. An incredible wager like this was enough to cause cultivators of all Realms to be filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>The nine Sea Realm Demons all sucked in deep breaths.</p><br/><p>Long Tianhai remained silent for a moment before a bizarre gleam appeared in his eyes. Considering that Meng Hao had mentioned the Demonic Cultivator Horde, he knew that Meng Hao had already pieced together some clues as to what was really going on.</p><br/><p>However, he didn't care. What he wanted... was Meng Hao\u2019s place in the Echelon. Before Meng Hao had arrived in the Ninth Sea, he had put various plans in place. He had never imagined that one of the first things Meng Hao would do after arriving would be to immediately reveal publicly that he was in the Echelon. Now that many people knew about the matter, most of his plans were rendered unusable.</p><br/><p>However, the stakes Meng Hao had mentioned just now were vast, and were somewhat imbalanced when compared to a place in the Echelon. It was a decision he couldn\u2019t make on his own, so he stood there silently for a moment, apparently conferring with someone. Finally, he gritted his teeth and looked over at Meng Hao, a gleam of determination in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dao weapon is off the table. But the 300,000,000 pieces of Immortal jade... we can do!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Meng Hao sighed with relief. He had brought up the Dao weapon as a way to test out how determined the Demonic Cultivator Horde was. If they were even willing to put a Dao weapon on the table as stakes, then... he would have immediately declined the wager. No matter how much face he lost, he would never have agreed.</p><br/><p>The fact that the Demonic Cultivator Horde refused to put the Dao weapon up as stakes revealed that there was a possibility that the result of the bet would be upheld. This matter most likely involved the machinations of a Dao Realm expert. However, Meng Hao knew that in all matters, risks had to be taken!</p><br/><p>His eyes shone with a strange light as he looked over at Long Tianhai.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a big matter. I\u2019ll give you my answer in a month!\u201d Having said that, he turned and shot off into the distance. Waiting for a month gave him the option of both going on the offensive, or remaining on the defensive. Furthermore, it negated the previous comparisons that had been made between him and the nine Sea Realm Demons. Everyone was now completely focused on the matter of the wager.</p><br/><p>Long Tianhai also realized this. He watched coldly as Meng Hao left, his eyes flickering with a gleam of killing intent.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao transformed into a beam of light that shot back toward his Immortal\u2019s cave. After passing down through the water and the shield, the first thing he saw was the parrot, surrounded by the two trembling blackpod imps.</p><br/><p>The parrot started singing, after which the Demonic cultivators chimed in.</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>I was a bad kid when I was young, I\u2019m a little seafood dish, lalalalala, little seafood dish, dobedobedoooo, little seafood dish....</em>\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stood there silently for a moment, staring at them, after which they switched to a different song.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, come,\u201d the parrot shouted excitedly. \u201cLast night Lord Fifth had a dream about another song. Once we get it down, Lord Fifth is going to host a big singing contest for the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea! Alright, sing with me!\u201d Off to the side, the meat jelly started to beat a drum enthusiastically.</p><br/><p><em>\u201cWe\u2019re all seafood, our whole family is seafood! Righteous Lord Fifth, mighty Lord Third, lalalalala, we have to make the seafood be good! Dobedobedoooo, we have to make the seafood be good....</em>\"</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao heard this, his mind spun, and all of a sudden the world seemed like a worse place. He felt bad for the Demonic cultivators, as well as Su Yan. At the moment, Su Yan seemed to be deeply shaken. She was staring at the parrot with gaping jaw, as if... the parrot had completely turned her world upside down.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and waved his hand toward the blackpod imps that seemed to be acting like backup singers next to the parrot. Instead of resisting him, they gladly flew toward him as if he were rescuing them from a disaster. Immediately, they transformed into black pods that came to rest on his palm, after which he stowed them away in his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>The parrot didn't look happy. Glaring at Meng Hao, it said, \u201cCome, come. Lord Fifth just thought of a new song. Let\u2019s all sing it together.</p><br/><p>\u201c<em>Little Haowie needs to be a good boy....</em>\u201d</p><br/><p>A brutal gleam appeared in Meng Hao's eyes as he stared at the parrot for a moment. Then he ignored it, turning and walking back into his residence. The wave of a hand caused a sealing shield to appear that blocked out all of the racket from outside.</p><br/><p>Moments later, the puppet boy flew out to go collect his reward from the ninth golden gate stone stele, and the smaller rewards for making it into the top 100 of the other eight stone steles.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sat down cross-legged, took a deep breath, and then gazed at the copper mirror with a look of anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I\u2019m pretty sure I got enough Immortal jade to complete my work with the Paragon's blood!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

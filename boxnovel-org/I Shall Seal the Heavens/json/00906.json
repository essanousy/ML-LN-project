This is Impossible!!\u201d Fang Xuzhong\u2019s heart trembled violently. He had no idea how the medicinal plant had been grafted together and no way of knowing whether Meng Hao was correct or not. However\u2026 based on his skill in the Dao of alchemy, he was fairly certain that what Meng Hao had said was true.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, the tier 5 alchemist from whom he had acquired this medicinal plant had indeed given him a pill formula to use with it. Furthermore, the words that alchemist had used to describe the plant were exactly the same as the words Meng Hao had uttered just now!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding apprentice alchemists noticed Fang Xuzhong\u2019s pale face, the fact that he had backed up, and his facial expression. Virtually all of them understood exactly what it meant; Meng Hao had been completely correct in what he had said.</p><br/><p>There was no other reason for Fang Xuzhong\u2019s expression to change the way it had.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Hao was right again!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even Alchemist Fang Xuzhong is capable of outdoing Fang Hao when it comes to plants and vegetation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I kept good notes from when Fang Hao was lecturing about plants and vegetation earlier. I\u2019m going to go back and review them thoroughly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding apprentice alchemists were abuzz. After all, as mere apprentice alchemists, they didn\u2019t really understand much about alchemy. Even the tier 1 alchemists were panting and looking on with wide eyes. Then they exchanged glances, and saw similar looks of disbelief on each other\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>They were alchemists, and though they might only be tier 1, their knowledge base far exceeded that of apprentice alchemists. Since they couldn\u2019t identify the medicinal plant Fang Xuzhong held in his hand, they initially hadn\u2019t felt that there was anything special about it. However, after Meng Hao spoke, and especially after he revealed the grafting technique, their minds trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 that grafting technique is a top secret method of a tier 5 alchemist!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNineteen medicinal plants! I\u2019m afraid only a tier 5 alchemist could create something like that. But\u2026 but Fang Hao is so inhuman that he actually\u2026 easily identified the grafting method by simply looking at the plant!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is the full extent of his skill in plants and vegetation, and his Dao of alchemy? How frightening! It\u2019s almost like no secrets that relate to plants and vegetation can be kept from him!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of their advanced understanding, the tier 1 alchemists were thoroughly astonished.</p><br/><p>Fang Xuzhong\u2019s face was pale white as he looked at Meng Hao, who in his view had become completely inscrutable and terrifying. He could never have predicted that anyone would be able, with a single look, to see through an alchemist\u2019s top secret technique and reveal the grafting method.</p><br/><p>To him, such a thing was vastly terrifying.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, he knew that he was absolutely no match for Fang Hao when it came to skill in plants and vegetation. He simply didn\u2019t stand a chance of winning when up against an inhuman like this in a competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you, Fang Yunyi!\u201d he thought. \u201cYou just wait until I get back. I\u2019ll teach you a thing or two!\u201d Fang Xuzhong was filled with bitterness, as well as a sudden, bone-deep hatred of Fang Yunyi. As for Meng Hao, he didn\u2019t dare to hate him.</p><br/><p>Because the Dao of Alchemy Division had its own way of doing things, he could ignore the fact that Meng Hao was Chosen. However\u2026 after getting a sense of Meng Hao\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation, he was frightened to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith skill like that,\u201d he thought, \u201ceven if he\u2019s not very good at pill concocting, he\u2019ll still rise to complete prominence\u2026. Furthermore, what if he\u2019s just as gifted in pill concocting? That would be petrifying. He\u2019ll certainly exceed me in the Dao of Alchemy Division. Now, thanks to Fang Yunyi, I\u2019ve offended him. It definitely wasn\u2019t worth it\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Xuzhong took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and was just about to admit defeat when suddenly his heart quivered. He suddenly realized that this defeat could actually be turned into an opportunity. He hesitated for a moment, then clasped hands and bowed to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlchemist Fang, your skill in plants and vegetation is profound. I\u2019m no match for you. I was crude and rash earlier, and I hope you can look past that. Please take the spirit stones in that bag of holding as my gift to you upon our first meeting. I admit defeat\u2026.\u201d His words sent the apprentice alchemists into an uproar. However, the tier 1 alchemists had already surmised that he would take such action.</p><br/><p>There would obviously be something wrong with any of them who would still feel confident enough to continue even when faced with someone so inhuman as to be able to identify a top secret grafting technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I would also like to ask for some pointers, if that\u2019s okay. I\u2026 I saw a medicinal plant a while back. I\u2019ve asked many people about it, but no one can tell me exactly what it was.\u201d Fang Xuzhong once again clasped hands and bowed. \u201cAlchemist Fang, if you can help me out a bit, I\u2019d be more than happy to give this grafted medicinal plant to you as an expression of my thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was as calm as ever. However, inwardly, he sighed, thinking that he should have acted a bit weaker earlier. Showing off so much had only deprived him of a chance to fleece this fat sheep.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad,\u201d he thought. \u201cI have a lot more spirit stones in my bag of holding, and I was planning to con this guy even harder. Now I\u2019ve lost the chance.\u201d Feeling a bit depressed, he waved his hand to collect Fang Xuzhong\u2019s bag of holding. After scanning it with divine sense and seeing how many spirit stones were inside, he felt a bit better.</p><br/><p>Then he looked up at the grafted medicinal plant. He knew that the value of such a plant would be significant. Besides, the grafting techniques that had been used were intriguing. As a result, he nodded to Fang Xuzhong.</p><br/><p>Fang Xuzhong\u2019s expression brightened, and he immediately produced a jade slip from his bag of holding, which he respectfully handed over to Meng Hao, who accepted it and scanned it with divine sense.</p><br/><p>Immediately, an image of a violet flower appeared in his mind, growing on top of a tiny, hand-sized horse, which was galloping at top speed.</p><br/><p>That was all he saw before the image vanished.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression became more serious, and he scanned the jade slip again. After a moment of thought, he asked, \u201cWhere did you see this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn an island in a sea district here on Planet East Victory. I just randomly happened to see it, and chased after it for a while to no avail. I asked some of the local fisherman about it, and all of them reported seeing it before on occasion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, even after returning to the location on a few times, I was never able to find it again.\u201d Fang Xuzhong had shown this jade to slip to numerous alchemists, but none of them had ever been able to identify it. The best he had gotten were speculations that it was some type of rare medicinal plant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that horse is actually the root of the medicinal plant,\u201d said Fang Xuzhong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou would be wrong,\u201d said Meng Hao, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not a medicinal plant. It\u2019s\u2026 a medicinal pill! A sentient medicinal pill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?!?\u201d exclaimed Fang Xuzhong, feeling both shock and disbelief. None of the numerous alchemists he had asked about this image had ever come to the conclusion that it was a medicinal pill. No matter how you looked at it, the only answer that made sense was that it was some kind of medicinal plant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d said Fang Xuzhong, mostly to himself. \u201cMedicinal pills are medicinal pills! They\u2019re concocted by people! How could a medicinal pill come to life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch things do exist,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them.\u201d Without providing any further explanation, he handed the jade slip back to Fang Xuzhong, then clasped hands and bowed to the crowd. Finally, he turned and left.</p><br/><p>Even after Meng Hao left, Fang Xuzhong was still in a state of disbelief. The surrounding apprentice alchemists all began disperse excitedly.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Fang Xuzhong returned to his residence, whereupon he took out Fang Yunyi\u2019s jade slip and then grimly transmitted a stream of divine will into it.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fang Yunyi was in the ancestral mansion, meditating in his residence as he waited for news from the Dao of Alchemy Division.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlchemist Fang Xuzhong is a tier 2 alchemist. His skill in the Dao of alchemy is incredible. Once he shows up, that Meng Hao will definitely get put in his place. Forcing him to kneel there for three days will definitely lighten my heart a bit.\u201d He chuckled coldly, and he felt incredible anticipation for the moment when he could visit the Dao of Alchemy Division and personally look at Meng Hao kneeling there.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour dad was there on Planet South Heaven, and that\u2019s why you could be so arrogant and despotic. But here, you\u2019re an outsider. Let\u2019s see you try to be pompous here!\u201d A wide smile appeared on his face. It was at this point that his expression flickered as he produced a jade slip from his bag of holding. Then he laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlchemist Fang sent me a message!\u201d His expression one of anticipation, he sent his divine sense into the jade slip. After a moment, the jade slip began to glow, and an illusory version of Fang Xuzhong\u2019s face appeared. His expression was grim.</p><br/><p>As soon as he saw Fang Xuzhong\u2019s expression, Fang Yunyi gaped in shock. Before he could even say anything, Fang Xuzhong had already begun to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Yunyi, what enmity is there between us?! You set me up, you bastard! You wanted me to humiliate Fang Hao? His skill in plants and vegetation is inhuman! Fang Yunyi, I\u2019m not going to forget the trouble you\u2019ve caused me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Yunyi\u2019s face fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlchemist Fang, this\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Alchemist Fang! From this day forth, when you want pills concocted, don\u2019t come looking for me! Furthermore, none of my alchemist friends will concoct for you either!</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Yunyi, what you\u2019ve done is far too excessive!\u201d Fang Xuzhong glared at Fang Yunyi for a moment, then gave a cold snort and severed the divine will connection.</p><br/><p>Fang Yunyi\u2019s face flickered with various emotions, and then suddenly, he shot to his feet and pulled out another jade slip, which he used to connect with the apprentice alchemist he had sent away earlier. After finding out what had happened between Meng Hao and Fang Xuzhong in the Dao of Alchemy Division, his face darkened. He wrathfully smashed the jade slip, and his face twisted with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao!\u201d he howled, and his hatred for Meng Hao grew even more intense.</p><br/><p>In the Dao of Alchemy Division, everyone watched Meng Hao leave, and then dispersed. It didn\u2019t take long before Meng Hao\u2019s name began to be spread by all of the apprentice alchemists who had been present. The story of the bet between Meng Hao and Fang Xuzhong was especially popular.</p><br/><p>When the apprentice alchemists from the outer mountains learned that Meng Hao had actually defeated Fang Xuzhong in terms of plants and vegetation, it only made Meng Hao all the more mysterious, and the subject of even more debate.</p><br/><p>He had a 30,000 meter Bloodline Gatebeam, he had experienced the Seventh Year Tribulation, was the eldest grandson of the direct bloodline, and was a Chosen of the Fang Clan.</p><br/><p>Word of all of these things spread, and soon, Meng Hao\u2019s name began to rise to prominence among the apprentice alchemists. There were even some low-level alchemists who took note.</p><br/><p>In the ancestral mansion, Fang Wei\u2019s father and grandfather sat in a temple, their faces grim as they listened to a tier 1 alchemist retell the story of what had happened that day at the Dao of Alchemy Division.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, the tier 1 alchemist left. Fang Wei\u2019s father, Fang Xiushan, looked incredibly gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, if that son of a bitch keeps doing things like this, it\u2019s going to cause waves of disturbance\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the old man said somberly. \u201cHe won\u2019t live much longer. Besides, even if he becomes famous in the Dao of Alchemy Division, the rules of the Fang Clan are clear; anyone who practices cultivation must contribute merit points.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe just arrived, and will be provided with a set monthly allowance of merit points. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s in terms of cultivation or pill concocting, he won\u2019t be making any waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, if he wants to earn more merit points, he\u2019ll have to accomplish tasks set forth by the clan\u2026. When that happens, it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s avoided death so far, he\u2019ll be on the outside, where accidents can happen at any time.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

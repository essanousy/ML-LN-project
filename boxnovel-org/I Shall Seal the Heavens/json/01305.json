His eyes turned bright red as he apparently remembered something, whereupon he roared, \u201cMeng Hao you little bastard, I'm going to end things between us right now! Take THIS!\u201d</p><br/><p>Howling, energy surging, Patriarch Reliance began to move his relatively stumpy legs in a special pattern. His eyes began to glow brightly as, unexpectedly, his qi and blood began to flow in a unique way, as if he really were going to go all-out in a fight to the death.</p><br/><p>However, what actually happened was that an enormous teleportation portal popped into existence around him. In the blink of an eye, it activated, teleporting Patriarch Reliance away.</p><br/><p>Even as he vanished, his smug laughter echoed out, along with the following words: \u201cThe Patriarch is out! Don\u2019t bother to come looking for me ever again, I\u2019m sick of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could only imagine how pleased Patriarch Reliance must be with himself at the moment. A strange look on his face, Meng Hao took a step forward and then vanished.</p><br/><p>In another stretch of the starry sky of the Eighth Mountain and Sea, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s massive form suddenly appeared, along with ringing laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, the Patriarch, am intelligent, dashing, extraordinary, and completely invincible! Did that wimpy little Meng Hao really dare to try to compare himself to me?\u201d Patriarch Reliance looked extremely proud, as though he were standing at the pinnacle of all intelligence, looking down at everyone else far, far below.</p><br/><p>However, even as he was sighing emotionally, a dry cough could be heard coming from off to the side.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance gaped in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHallucinating,\u201d he said. \u201cI must be hallucinating. How come that cough sounded so much like that little bastard?\u201d Heart thumping, Patriarch Reliance looked to the side to find Meng Hao right there next to him. His eyes widened.</p><br/><p>In terms of size, Meng Hao was like nothing compared to Patriarch Reliance\u2019s enormity. But that didn't stop him from reaching out, grabbing one of Patriarch Reliance\u2019s whiskers, and then flinging him out through the starry sky, sending him spinning round and round.</p><br/><p>Then, a huge boom could be heard as he landed not too far off in the distance.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance roared in rage, then shot back toward Meng Hao, mouth wide open to devour him. But then Meng Hao snorted coldly, and Patriarch Reliance let out a yelp and closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaahhhhhh! I\u2019m going crazy! Dammit! Dammit! I can't fight you, can\u2019t run away from you, can\u2019t even eat you! The League of Demon Sealers is full of bastards! I'm going to kill all of you people!!\u201d Patriarch Reliance\u2019s roars transformed into sound waves that rumbled out through the starry sky. At the same time, he backed up at top speed, shaking his back slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisciples of all generations of the Reliance Sect, get out here and kill this guy!\u201d When Patriarch Reliance shook his back slightly, it was like an earthquake as far as the State of Zhao was concerned. Almost immediately, hundreds of people flew out, after which they stared at Meng Hao in astonishment. It was hard to say who did it first, but after a moment of gaping, they began to clasp hands and bow to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Junior Patriarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Junior Patriarch? Greetings, Junior Patriarch....\u201d</p><br/><p>These people actually recognized who Meng Hao was. After all, Meng Hao had encountered this group of people back in the Milky Way Sea on Planet South Heaven. Back then, Patriarch Reliance, believing himself to be a profound schemer with incredible foresight, had publicly acknowledged Meng Hao\u2019s Patriarchal status, all in an attempt to divert his suspicions. [1. Meng Hao got called Patriarch by the cultivators in the State of Xiao/Zhao back in chapter 647]</p><br/><p>When Patriarch Reliance saw all of the cultivators clasping hands and bowing to Meng Hao, the rage in his heart burned hotter than ever. Now, instead of trying to consume Meng Hao, he tried to crush him with his head.</p><br/><p>By this point, he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape. Meng Hao was so fast that it left him sighing, so the only thing he could do now was ram Meng Hao with his body, which at this moment seemed as big as a planet whizzing through space.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop fussing,\u201d Meng Hao said with a frown, then smacked out with his right hand.</p><br/><p>An intense slapping sound echoed from Patriarch Reliance\u2019s head, and he was sent staggering backward. Angered to the point of madness, he roared, \u201cWho\u2019s making a fuss? I'm perfectly calm! Y-y-you... you tyrant!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn all my years of roaming the Mountain and Sea Realm, the worst thing that ever happened to me was running into you bastards from the League of Demon Sealers. You people are so unreasonable!!\u201d Patriarch Reliance appeared to be on the verge of tears. By now, he could sense how powerful Meng Hao was, and his heart was pounding as a result. However, he still didn't want to give in. Eyes burning with decisiveness, he opened his mouth and roared, causing innumerable magical symbols to flicker all over his body. Apparently, he was attempting to break through the seals on his body.</p><br/><p>Rumbling could be heard as a massive energy burst out, something that caused even Meng Hao\u2019s eyes to widen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, the people from the League of Demon Sealers had to team up to seal him,\u201d Meng Hao said softly. \u201cIt seems Patriarch Reliance really is remarkable.\u201d With that, he slapped his hand out again.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out as Patriarch Reliance was once again sent spinning. At the same time, his enraged roar echoed out.</p><br/><p>This time the sound was multiple times louder than his previous shouts. It transformed into a roaring windstorm that swept out. Simultaneously, a huge, terrifying image was projected behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and me are going at it to the death!\u201d he raged. \u201cYou piss me off so much! SO MUCH!\u201d The countless, densely-packed magical symbols flickered brightly, looking almost like a huge net covering Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>However, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s energy spiked, and the golden magical symbols began to separate from him and float out into the starry sky, as the shocking energy on Patriarch Reliance grew even stronger.</p><br/><p>As the starry sky rumbled and shook, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes shone with a strange light. This was not his first time getting into a showdown with Patriarch Reliance. However, on the previous occasions, his cultivation base had not been powerful enough, and he hadn\u2019t pushed Patriarch Reliance into such a corner. Now, the old turtle had no options left, and was really going crazy!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered as he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and then pointed at Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cEighth Demon Sealing Hex!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, Patriarch Reliance ground to a halt. At the same time, the golden magical symbols floating around him blazed with light and then pressed back down onto him. Patriarch Reliance went stiff, and his eyes widened as he glared furiously at Meng Hao. However, there was simply nothing he could do against the Demon Sealing Hex.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a good boy,\u201d Meng Hao said, stepped forward and patting Patriarch Reliance on the head. Patriarch Reliance glared at him angrily, but was incapable of even moving, and could only make slight whimpering sounds.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao felt a bit bad, so he looked at Patriarch Reliance and said, \u201cPatriarch, I have my own problems to deal with. Just stop struggling. You know, even becoming my mount wouldn\u2019t be too embarrassing, right? Look, how about this? Just let me get Lord Li\u2019s legacy, and then if you don\u2019t feel like coming along with me after that, you can just go on your own way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance looked up in thought, and even Meng Hao could tell that he was planning something. However, he ignored that and flickered into motion, appearing down on Patriarch Reliance\u2019s back. The hundreds of cultivators that had flown up all continued to bow to him respectfully from a distance, not daring to get near him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked around before stepping forward to appear in one of the low-lying areas in the State of Zhao, on the shore of a lake. Guyiding Tri-Rain was standing there looking very charming, and as Meng Hao approached, she smiled.</p><br/><p>Their gazes met, and they laughed happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten about my promise to you,\u201d he said. \u201cI will help you become a sea one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve already become a sea,\u201d she replied, covering her smile with her hand.</p><br/><p>Startled, Meng Hao looked out at the lake, and then looked at Mount Daqing off in the distance. Finally, he nodded thoughtfully. Then he suddenly sank down into the ground, moving downward into the depths of the State of Zhao. Down and down he went, sending his divine sense ahead to lock down onto a certain position at the very bottom of the State of Zhao, where it actually met with Patriarch Reliance\u2019s back. There... was a door!</p><br/><p>However, as Meng Hao got close to it, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s body suddenly shuddered as he violently cast off the Eighth Hex. At the same time, a violent energy began to build up.</p><br/><p>Rumbling could be heard as the golden magical symbols seemed to once again be on the verge of being cast off.</p><br/><p>The lands trembled, a sensation Meng Hao could clearly experience considering how far down he was. Frowning, his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture. This time, the wave of his finger unleashed the Seventh Demon Sealing Hex. Patriarch Reliance once again roared, body trembling. However, Meng Hao\u2019s Seventh Hex formed a resonance with the hex inside of him, and once again he was stabilized.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon't get so excited,\u201d Meng Hao consoled calmly. \u201cI\u2019m just here to take the legacy. After that you can go. I've known for years that you were here in the Eighth Mountain and Sea and still never came looking for you to be my mount.\u201d With that, Meng Hao took a step forward toward the door.</p><br/><p>A faint light surrounded the door, and as Meng Hao neared it, he could sense familiar fluctuations. It even seemed as if something were calling to him!</p><br/><p>Those fluctuations were those of the League of Demon Sealers, and the calling seemed to send his Demon Sealing Hexing magic into sudden motion. In fact, the ancient Demon Sealing Jade inside of his bag of holding was also vibrating.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely the League of Demon Sealers.... In that case, I wonder... what generation Demon Sealer Lord Li was?!\u201d A strange light shone in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes as his previous speculations were confirmed by at least seventy percent.</p><br/><p>However, even as Meng Hao neared the door, and the sensation of a resonance grew even stronger, Patriarch Reliance once again began to struggle mightily, as if he had been pricked. As he roared, the golden magical symbols once again began to shake, as if... they were just about to collapse.</p><br/><p>Even more shocking was that a powerful aura was rising up within Patriarch Reliance. Unexpectedly... it was similar to the Dao Realm, and it was rising rapidly!</p><br/><p>1-Essence. 2-Essences. 3-Essences Dao Lord....</p><br/><p>Amidst all the rumbling, Meng Hao frowned. If he couldn\u2019t get Patriarch Reliance to calm down, it could affect his attempt to acquire the legacy.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, calm down. Be a good boy.\u201d Meng Hao stamped his right foot down, shattering the connection between Patriarch Reliance\u2019s shell and the land mass above it. As that happened... a pitch-black turtle shell was revealed, as well as numerous shocking spikes which were imbedded therein!</p><br/><p>Furthermore... something else was visible on the turtle shell, off in the distance. It was... something that had slowly been twisted over time as Patriarch Reliance had grown up. It was... a line of writing.</p><br/><p>As soon as Patriarch Reliance realized what was happening, he roared in fury and embarrassment: \u201cHey, don't look at that!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

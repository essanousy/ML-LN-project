Their eyes glowed at the thought of Furnace Lord promotion. This type of good fortune was incredibly amazing!</p><br/><p>If they could seize such good fortune, it might almost amount to destiny!</p><br/><p>It was an opportunity, which, if taken advantage of, would allow them to soar to the heavens!</p><br/><p>The master alchemists rushed forward, even the ones down below at the foot of the mountain. Eternal Mountain had never predicted that Lin Hailong would say what he did. His eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Based on his understanding of Lin Hailong, he knew that the man wouldn\u2019t make such an offer for no reason. There was definitely some deeper meaning within his words. After thinking for a moment, Eternal Mountain\u2019s eyes suddenly began to gleam. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me he\u2019s trying to \u2026 flush out Grandmaster Pill Cauldron!?\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>It seemed Chu Yuyan and the ten or so other Furnace Lords present were thinking the same thing. Each and every one watched on with glittering eyes. A faint smile could be seen on the face of An Zaihai, and he glanced briefly at Meng Hao. He was well aware of Lin Hailong\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>In the entire East Pill Division, An Zaihai was the only person other than Grandmaster Pill Demon who knew the true identity of Grandmaster Pill Cauldron. He wouldn\u2019t announce it, of course. He wasn\u2019t sure of Grandmaster Pill Demon\u2019s intentions, but he had stated three times in a row that An Zaihai was not to do anything about Grandmaster Pill Cauldron. An Zaihai wouldn\u2019t even mention the name to anyone.</p><br/><p>One by one, the master alchemists of the East Pill Division arrived. Fatty was growing more and more complacent. He stood there, grinding his teeth with the flying sword. They glinted brightly. His air of complacency began to fill with more and more arrogance.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome come,\u201d he said haughtily. \u201cMy teeth are feeling a bit itchy. If you have the skill, please concoct me a pill that will break them. Anyone who can, I\u2019ll call them grandpa!\u201d One of the master alchemists stepped out from among his hundreds of comrades. He clasped hands in salute to Lin Hailong and An Zaihai, then began to concoct a pill.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just him. Seven other master alchemists stepped forward and began to work. Everyone watched as the master alchemists concentrated on their medicinal plants and concoction. It was a dazzling sight. Time passed, and soon one pill after another flew out toward Fatty.</p><br/><p>These pills had been concocted with utmost care by the handful of master alchemists, all of whom had utmost faith in their handiwork. Fatty yawned, and threw all the pills into his mouth. The crunching sounds which emanated out pierced into the hearts of the eight master alchemists. Their faces fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlech!\u201d said Fatty, spitting the medicinal pills out. \u201cWho else!?\u201d he yelled, looking very pleased. He seemed to feel that his teeth deserved utmost respect in Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Seeing the defeat of the eight master alchemists, others who had been planning to participate now hesitated. They eyed Fatty\u2019s teeth. In their estimation, it was like he had a mouthful of sharp swords. It seemed any medicinal pill that entered his mouth would be reduced to rubble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>No one responded to Fatty, nor did anyone step forward to concoct a pill. Fatty arrogantly pulled another Spirit Stone out, popped it into his mouth, and then crunched it into pieces.</p><br/><p>The surrounding master alchemists gasped. Moments ago, many of them had found it easy to muster their courage, think of a pill formula, and then attempt to concoct it. Seeing the spectacle in front of their eyes, however, caused them to change their minds.</p><br/><p>They looked at Fatty angrily. They sighed inwardly as various thoughts ran through their minds:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is inhuman! What pill could possibly stand up to teeth like that\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, this fatso must have been growing these teeth from birth. He\u2019s not a Cultivator, he\u2019s a monster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he worried he might accidentally bite his tongue off one day\u2026? He actually eats the Spirit Stones? What kind of a stomach does he have? Can he digest them?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them seemed to think that there would be no good fortune for them on this day.</p><br/><p>Fatty swallowed the Spirit Stone and then began loudly grinding his teeth again. From the moment he had joined the Golden Frost Sect, he had been doted upon, and had never been embarrassed. He of course took this opportunity to show off, and was currently glancing around, looking for pretty female alchemists.</p><br/><p>He ignored Chu Yuyan, of course. In his opinion, Chu Yuyan clearly belonged to his brother Meng Hao, and he wouldn\u2019t interfere. After all, Fatty completely revered Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Even as Fatty was in the midst of his arrogant complacency, Meng Hao coughed lightly. He wasn\u2019t stupid, and could tell that Lin and An were trying to use this occasion to determine the identity of Grandmaster Pill Cauldron. This was the main reason why he had been hesitating. However, he\u2019d made up his mind. Coughing lightly, he stepped out from the crowd and began to walk over. This of course, drew the attention of all the master alchemists.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuyan frowned, then gave a cold harrumph. After a single glance, she ignored him. An imperceptible glimmer appeared in An Zaihai\u2019s eyes, and a faint smile touched his mouth.</p><br/><p>Lin Hailong\u2019s eyes filled with a deep look. He looked Meng Hao over closely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it him\u2026?\u201d he murmured to himself.</p><br/><p>Eternal Mountain also looked at Meng Hao, his expression the same as ever.</p><br/><p>No one could determine any clues whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao clasped hands and bowed to An Zaihai and Lin Hailong. \u201cI am Fang Mu. I would like to take a shot at concocting a pill. Would the two members of the senior generation grant me permission to do so?\u201d</p><br/><p>An Zaihai said nothing. Lin Hailong gave a light nod, then tossed over a fire crystal, which came to float in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeyo!\u201d cried Fatty, glancing at Meng Hao out of the corner of his eyes. \u201cAnother kid steps forward. Don\u2019t forget to concoct a really hard pill. My teeth are itchy. I want to bite down on something super tough!\u201d His tone of voice made it sound like his whole life was filled with loneliness, and his annoying expression was one that made you want to thrash him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t immediately being the concoction process. He looked at Fatty, and smiled.</p><br/><p>Fatty wasn\u2019t sure why, but he got a good feeling when he looked at Meng Hao. Patting his stomach, he said, \u201cWhat are you looking at me like that for? Aiii, I\u2019m such a nice guy. You know what? This time I won\u2019t crush it in one bite, I\u2019ll take three bites.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sighed, and a guilty look appeared on his face. He clasped hands and bowed toward Fatty. In truth, he didn\u2019t want to embarrass Li Fugui, but this opportunity was too rare to pass up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? What kind of an expression is that? Aiiii, fine, fine. Five bites. I\u2019ll take five bites to crush it. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Lin Hailong\u2019s face grew even darker, as did the faces of the surrounding master alchemists. Chu Yuyan glared ferociously at Fatty, and then at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Fatty,\u201d thought Meng Hao. \u201cBig bro really doesn\u2019t want to trick you like this, but I really don\u2019t have any other option\u2026\u201d With another cough, he waved his hand and produced the Blood Crane pill furnace, sending it to float above the fire crystal.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes were fixed upon Meng Hao as he concentrated and stoked the pill furnace to a glowing red color. Then, he began to produce medicinal plants. Some he catalyzed, from others, he extracted sap. The entire process took roughly an hour. Finally, Meng Hao produced some gray-colored powder. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything special about. When concocting pills, it isn\u2019t always necessary to use fresh ingredients. There are certain medicinal powders which will turn gray over time, as well as other ingredients, such as Flying Ash Leaf, which are gray to begin with.</p><br/><p>Only Meng Hao knew that his confidence in being able to produce a pill that Fatty couldn\u2019t crush, was largely because of this gray powder. It was no ordinary item. It was\u2026 powder created by the explosion of the meat jelly\u2019s shedding process.</p><br/><p>Some of the skin had directly turned into powder, which was what Meng Hao had just used as one of the ingredients in his medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly\u2019s skin was extraordinarily tough. In the past, Meng Hao had tested it on multiple occasions. The meat jelly had a mysterious background, and was virtually indestructible. Meng Hao was sure that there was no way Fatty would be able to destroy the shed skin of the meat jelly. However, his true killing move in this little competition wasn\u2019t the powder, but something else inside the medicinal pill\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty, please forgive me\u2026.\u201d he thought. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes gleamed as a black medicinal pill flew out, which he grabbed. The pill furnace slowly returned to its original color.</p><br/><p>The pill was about the size of a fingernail, and looked ordinary in every aspect. However, it was filled with the meat jelly skin powder. The powder couldn\u2019t be melted; however, Meng Hao had fused it into the medicinal plant ingredients. It was less a concoction than an amalgamation.</p><br/><p>The pill emitted no medicinal fragrance, and was as black as night. He tossed it over to Fatty with an apologetic look.</p><br/><p>Fatty grabbed it haughtily. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a liking to you,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll crush it with five bites, no less.\u201d Looking pleased, he popped the pill into his mouth, posing heroically as he glanced at a few of the female alchemists he\u2019d noticed.</p><br/><p>As soon as the pill entered his mouth, he laughed, then closed his eyes and slowly bit down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee! One bite!\u201d The words were a bit garbled, but everyone understood what he was saying.</p><br/><p>The alchemists of the East Pill Division all looked embarrassed. Clearly, they found Li Fugui to be completely repulsive.</p><br/><p>Continuing to talk, Fatty bit down a second time, secretly using quite a bit of strength. His heart began to tremble. Keeping his expression calm, he laughed a few more times, then continued to blabber incoherently about how he would keep his word and bite down five times.</p><br/><p>He was starting to get nervous. The first time he had bit down, he\u2019d only used thirty percent of his strength. The second time, he\u2019d used eighty. However, he hadn\u2019t even been able to put a tiny dent in the medicinal pill. It seemed to have some sort of elastic element to it. His teeth actually hurt a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cFatty seems like he\u2019d rather die than lose face. When did he become like this?\u201d thought Meng Hao, looking both sympathetic and apologetic.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Nicholas Harkes</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

From then on, he had begun to speculate about the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavengod. Heavengod.... has no surname attached to it.\u201d Eyes flickering, he looked at the statue, sensing the qi flow of the Mountain and Sea Realm. That was something that no one other than him could detect.</p><br/><p>Based on the fact that the statue\u2019s face had been scraped off, Meng Hao got the feeling that there was some secret connection between Heavengod and the Meng Clan in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home!\u201d Meng De shouted. \u201cFinally... we're home!! Meng Chen, we're home!\u201d Meng De stood next to Meng Hao, looking excitedly at the Meng Clan continent and taking in a deep breath. From the look on his face, it was as if he suddenly had a new lease on life.</p><br/><p>\u201cHome....\u201d Meng Hao murmured. When he thought about the members of his grandfather\u2019s bloodline, his eyes flickered and turned to focus on one of the nine smaller continents attached to the larger one.</p><br/><p>According to the Soulsearching he had performed on the Meng Clan cultivators on the ship, his grandfather\u2019s bloodline was on the smallest continent among the nine.</p><br/><p>Soon, the ship landed on the central continent, in the huge city that surrounded the statue. That was also the location of the Meng Clan ancestral mansion.</p><br/><p>Meng De flew out, to where hundreds of Meng Clan cultivators were all waiting to receive him. Once he appeared, they clasped hands, bowed, and said, \u201cWe offer respectful greetings, Ninth Young Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Meng De was the Ninth Young Lord, and almost as soon as he heard that greeting, he seemed to revert to his old silkpants self. He nodded slightly as people clustered around him to escort him off into the distance. His father and mother had long since departed, and just as Meng De was about to leave, he seemed to remember Meng Chen, and turned. He looked at Meng Hao with a smile, then waved his hand, sending a jade pendant flying out.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao caught it, after which Meng De spoke in a loud voice: \u201cI\u2019ll come looking for you in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hefted the jade pendant and smiled. At first, nobody in the area had paid the slightest attention to him, but after Meng De gave him the jade pendant, people began to take notice of him, and their eyes glittered.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t care about all of that. He disembarked from the ship, and then looked around at all the buildings. The entire place was unfamiliar, and the architecture was circular in design, much more flowing and unconstrained than the Fang Clan\u2019s orderliness and stark, angular layout. As for the ancestral mansion, it was also constructed in a circular shape, and gave off a sophisticated, courtly air.</p><br/><p>Numerous cultivators could be seen in the ancestral city as Meng Hao walked down the streets, and he quickly noticed that most of them were in the Spirit Realm. Immortal Realm cultivators were less common; for every hundred people he saw, only a handful were Immortals.</p><br/><p>There were no shops in the area, nor were there any inns. In fact, it would probably be more appropriate to call this place the outskirts of the ancestral mansion, rather than a separate city. However, in size alone it was comparable to a city.</p><br/><p>It was divided into certain districts, just like the Fang Clan was. There were the districts in the east, west, south and north, within which were huge courtyard residences where important clan members from the various bloodlines resided.</p><br/><p>There was no Central District, nor was there a mausoleum, which might be expected. However Meng Hao could sense five unique auras inside the huge statue itself. Those auras were clearly auras of the Dao Realm!</p><br/><p>However, of those five auras, two were very dim, almost on the point of being extinguished. The other three were much more vigorous, with one of them belonging to Meng De\u2019s grandfather.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive Dao Realm cultivators.... Three have flourishing auras, two of them being 1-Essence, and one 2-Essences. Of the weak auras, there's one Dao Lord and another... who I can\u2019t ascertain. However, from what I can tell, that aura is on the verge of being extinguished.\u201d Meng Hao looked away from the statue, eyes flickering as he sent his divine sense spreading out even further.</p><br/><p>It only took a moment for his divine sense to fill the entire ancestral mansion, and for all the living beings therein to appear in his mind.</p><br/><p>He glanced back at the statue, surprised that none of the five cultivators inside had detected his divine sense, nor activated any of the Meng Clan\u2019s defenses. Meng Hao then thoughtfully began to retract his divine sense and head in the direction of the continent where his grandfather\u2019s bloodline resided.</p><br/><p>However, in almost the same moment that he made to leave, he suddenly stopped in place. There was a scene playing out somewhere nearby that he could see within his divine sense, which he then focused on.</p><br/><p>An older woman could be seen in a courtyard residence, face ashen as she pleaded with a cold, arrogant middle-aged man. A younger woman lay at the man\u2019s feet, covered with bruises and wounds. Her right hand was clenched tightly around something, and her face was deathly pale as the middle-aged man kicked her viciously over and over again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro, stop!\u201d the older woman pleaded. \u201cMeng Ru is just worried about her bloodline relative, that's why she stole the medicinal pill. Big bro....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only a servant,\u201d the man spat, \u201cand she actually dared to steal a medicinal pill! It doesn\u2019t matter why she did it, she deserves to die! If I don\u2019t beat her to death, then wouldn\u2019t everyone else try to imitate her?!\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes gleamed with killing intent as he reached down and grabbed the young woman by the hair. She was pretty, but had a red birthmark on her face, which the man seemed disgusted by. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad except for that birthmark. How nauseating!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro, Ru\u2019er\u2019s older cousin is in the Immortal Realm. He\u2019s one of the Ninth Young Lord\u2019s bodyguards. All she took was a medicinal pill, you... you don\u2019t have to go so far.\u201d The older woman continued to plead anxiously, occasionally glancing down at the younger woman, who lay there, blood oozing out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>The older woman had no way to know that, even as the words left her mouth, Meng Hao was actually only a few streets away in the ancestral mansion. A tremor ran through him, and he turned, his expression icy.</p><br/><p>He had already heard that most of the members of his grandfather\u2019s bloodline were stationed in the houses of other clan members, where they worked as servants in exchange for cultivation resources. As of this moment, Meng Hao was certain that the young woman he was seeing with his divine sense was a member of his grandfather\u2019s bloodline, a younger bloodline cousin of Meng Chen.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t hesitate for even a moment. He took a step forward and vanished, his action undetectable even by the five Patriarchs.</p><br/><p>Back in the courtyard residence, the middle-aged man began to laugh coldly in response to the words just spoken to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer older cousin? You mean that pretty boy Meng Whatshisname? Meng Chen, right? You think a bodyguard deserves to get face from me?\u201d The man knelt down and grabbed Meng Ru\u2019s hand. Expression icy, he began to break her fingers one by one. She trembled from the pain, but gritted her teeth and didn't make a sound.</p><br/><p>Soon, the medicinal pill in her hand was revealed, which was already dissolving because of the blood that had oozed onto it. The middle-aged man grabbed it and threw into a nearby pond.</p><br/><p>Meng Ru\u2019s eyes went wide. She hadn\u2019t shed a single tear before this moment, not even when her fingers were being broken. But now that she saw the medicinal pill dissolving in the pond water, tears began to flow down her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAww, what\u2019s this? Crying?\u201d The man laughed and reached down as if to wipe away the tears. Before he could touch her face, though, a hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed his own hand.</p><br/><p>The man stared in shock, then let out a shriek as he saw Meng Hao standing there next to the young Meng Ru. Without even thinking about it, he took a step backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Chen! How dare you!!\u201d Although the man had been frightened, after realizing who it was, he seemed to regain his courage. With a shout, he unleashed his cultivation base, which was only in the Dao Seeking stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro....\u201d Meng Ru said, slowly looking up. When she laid eyes on Meng Hao, she began to weep and shake from the humiliation she had just endured.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet your hands off me, Meng Chen,\u201d the middle-aged man said. \u201cDammit, what gall you have! If you dare to hurt me, I\u2019ll tell my big bro, and he\u2019ll wipe out your entire bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently you\u2019ve forgotten that I\u2019m also surnamed Meng. Or is that you don't consider us to be part of the Meng Clan any more?\u201d Meng Hao had put some thought into the current miserable state of his grandfather\u2019s bloodline, but to see what was actually happening made him feel like a knife was slicing away at his heart.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao suddenly clenched his hand down, causing cracking and popping sounds to ring out. The middle-aged man screamed as Meng Hao crushed his hand into a bloody pulp. Terror and pain washed through him, but even as the scream left his mouth, Meng Hao patted his back.</p><br/><p>That motion caused more cracking sounds to echo out as each and every last bone in the man\u2019s body was shattered into powder. Without a skeleton to hold him up, the man collapsed into a pile of twitching flesh.</p><br/><p>No more sounds came out of his mouth as he lay there, no longer in the shape of a human. His current state was one of pain that far exceeded that of death. The woman standing off to the side was so frightened that her jaw dropped. The suddenness of what had occurred left her in a state of disbelief.</p><br/><p>As for Meng Ru, she was also staring in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro....\u201d she murmured as Meng Hao helped her to her feet. He placed his hand over hers, healing her broken fingers and injured internal organs. As she regained lucidity, she began to pant as she suddenly recalled something. Grasping Meng Hao\u2019s forearm, she said, \u201cBig bro, hurry, we have to get back. It\u2019s grandmother, she\u2019s... dying....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmother.... Grandma Meng!!!\u201d A tremor ran through Meng Hao. Without the slightest hesitation, he picked Meng Ru up in his arms and flew off into the distance. [1. As you may be aware, there are numerous very specific forms of address for relatives in Chinese. In this case, Meng Ru specifically mentions her \u201cpaternal grandmother\u201d which causes Meng Hao to think of his \u201cmaternal grandmother.\u201d This would indicate that Meng Ru is an actual member of the Meng Clan, with her father having been surnamed Meng, whereas Meng Hao is related to them through his mother, but would not be considered an actual member of the clan. After all, his father's surname is Fang. I\u2019m going to forgo translating the literal forms of address because they tend to get very clunky, especially when used in dialogue as a form of address. Instead, Meng Hao's \"maternal grandmother\" will be \"Grandma Meng\" or simply \"grandmother\" depending on the context. Please note, her surname is not Meng; in Chinese culture women don\u2019t change their surname upon marriage. However, you can address a female by the surname of her husband in Chinese culture, assuming you use the right form of address. If I remember correctly, Meng Hao\u2019s mom Meng Li was even called \u201cMadam Fang\u201d at one point. Similar forms of address exist for other relatives. I did the same thing in the past with Meng Hao\u2019s grandfathers. Instead of referring to them as paternal and maternal grandfathers, I\u2019ve been calling them Grandpa Fang and Grandpa Meng. I think this way makes it much more simple to understand who is being referred to, and at the same time keeps the same familial feeling as the original Chinese. By the way, astute readers might remember a few times where an \u201cOld Lady Meng\u201d was mentioned, a real mythological character who serves people the tea of forgetfulness in the Underworld. Meng Hao\u2019s grandmother does not have any connection to that woman!]</p><br/><p>When he left, the older woman who remained behind in the courtyard finally screamed, which attracted the attention of other clan members. When they arrived, they saw the bone-less middle-aged man lying there, and they gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did this? This... is a cruelty worse than death!\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1254: Grandma Meng!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

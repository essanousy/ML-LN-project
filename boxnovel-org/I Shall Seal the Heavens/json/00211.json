It was a very large mountain valley, filled with a variety of buildings. Off in the distance were areas devoted to growing medicinal plants. As soon as they arrived, Meng Hao could smell a fragrant aroma wafting through the air.</p><br/><p>There were many young people in the valley, all of whom wore short, light yellow garments. Some were picking medicinal plants and others were lost in thought as they studied jade slips. Some sat beneath the evening sunshine, staring at medicinal plants which they held in their hands. The plants swayed back and forth in a very bizarre fashion.</p><br/><p>After landing, the old man flicked his sleeve and cried, \u201cBai Yunlai!\u201d [1] The young people nearby all looked up. Catching sight of the old man, their faces filled with respect, and they saluted with clasped hands.</p><br/><p>An average-sized young man ran out of one of the buildings and approached them. He looked to be about thirty years of age.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Xu, sir, I\u2019m here,\u201d he said in a flattering tone. \u201cWhat orders do you have? I can help you with absolutely anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man glared at him. \u201cThese are two new apprentice alchemists who just joined the Sect. Explain things to them and then take them to get their medallions.\u201d With that, the old man turned to look at Meng Hao and the young woman. He nodded encouragingly, then transforming into a beam of light and shot away.</p><br/><p>Now that the old man was gone, the surrounding youths ignored Meng Hao and the others and continued on with their various activities. They didn\u2019t seem to have any good or bad will toward Meng Hao whatsoever. Their expressions were calm and even.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was going to have to get used to being in a Sect like this. Life in the Reliance Sect had been very different. This was now the second Sect he had joined. He sighed inwardly.</p><br/><p>The young woman next to him clasped hands toward Bai Yunlai and said, \u201cGreetings, Elder Brother Bai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, no Elders here, and no need for saluting.\u201d Bai Yunlai laughed heartily, looking back and forth between Meng Hao and the young woman. \u201cYou two came just at the right time. Most of the apprentice alchemists in the Sect have been very busy with the Pill Auction. There aren\u2019t very many people left behind. Alright, you two don\u2019t worry. With Old Bai here, you\u2019ll quickly get into the swing of things. Come come. Let\u2019s walk around a bit, and I\u2019ll introduce the place to you.\u201d After asking their names, Bai Yunlai led the way as they began to walk around.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want a description of the Violet Fate Sect\u2019s East Pill Division, well, that\u2019s a massive topic. There are no less than a hundred valleys just like this one. Each one is home to nearly a thousand apprentice alchemists. Most of our time is spent growing medicinal plants, memorizing the names of various medicines, and occasionally harvesting the plants. Do you know who the most tired people in the whole Southern Domain are? Us Violet Fate Sect apprentice alchemists, that\u2019s who!</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred thousand apprentice alchemists, each with their own work to do. Actually, we have to participate in all the different activities. We need to memorize the names of over one hundred thousand medicinal plants, we have to care for the growing plants, plus we have to find time to practice Cultivation. If we didn\u2019t do that, then we wouldn\u2019t be able to catalyze the plants into growth. As for you two, well, you\u2019ll figure everything out eventually.</p><br/><p>\u201cUs apprentice alchemists are real peons. Only if you stick out like an awl poking through a sack, and distinguish yourself in some way, can you possibly become a master alchemist and study true alchemy. Then Inner Sect disciples will come looking for you to concoct pills. According to Sect rules, they have to provide compensation to us when we concoct pills for them. It\u2019s always a good day when that happens.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo bad there are one hundred thousand apprentice alchemists. How many do you think become master alchemists? There are only a thousand in the entire Sect! It\u2019s so difficult!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yunlai spoke very quickly as he led Meng Hao and the young woman through various valleys.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee here? This is one of the places where only master alchemists can go. We aren\u2019t allowed in\u2026.\u201d They continued on. \u201cThis area belongs to the Violet Qi Division, although it\u2019s not the Inner Sect, just the Outer Sect.\u201d Bai Yunlai had led the two of them to one of the valleys toward the front of the Sect. Here were congregated quite a few Cultivators of the Violet Qi Division. Courteous expressions appeared on their faces when they saw Bai Yunlai. It seemed he was a relatively influential person within the Sect.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and then said some flattering things to Bai Yunlai, who instantly looked very happy and said, \u201cYou know, I know almost everything about the Sect, and there aren't many things I can\u2019t take care of. Junior Brother Fang, if you ever have any problems in the future, you just come look for me and I\u2019ll take care of everything for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Bai Yunlai stopped in his tracks. He pointed up toward the center of the valley, where an iron spear was stabbed into the side of the mountain. The spear was bent, and having been exposed to the wind and rain, was covered in rust.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunlai looked around, then lowered his voice and said, \u201cDo you see that iron spear? There\u2019s a story behind it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange expression appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face. He had noticed this valley when they\u2019d flown past earlier. He looked up at the spear, coughing slightly, and feigning extreme interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who put that spear there? It was Wu Dingqiu of the senior generation. They say that ten years ago, on a dark and stormy night, Elder Wu returned to the Sect in a foul rage, with that spear in his hand. He threw it with all his might, and it landed right there!</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the rumors from that year, he wanted all the Outer Sect disciples to remember the shame caused by that spear. He said, \u2018You fools are always stupid to the point of death! If you keep being this stupid, you really will die one day!\u2019\u201d Bai Yunlai\u2019s voice was very quiet as he spoke, and yet extremely vivid. The young woman\u2019s eyes went wide as she listened.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao spontaneously gave another light cough.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did the spear come from?\u201d asked the young woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did it come from? Heh heh. You might not believe it. According to the legend, ten years ago, a group of Outer Sect disciples participated in an Outer Sect promotion test. It was held in an extremely dangerous location, where they met a vile creature of a man. That guy ended up selling the iron spear to the two strongest of the disciples!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price they paid reduced them to poverty and ruin. They even borrowed Spirit Stones from fellow disciples to pay for it. They thought it was a precious treasure, which was why they bought it. Ai, it wasn\u2019t until a few years ago that they finally paid back all the Spirit Stones. Anyway, when Wu Dingqiu heard what happened he felt it was an utter humiliation. And he was the leader of the group! What do you two think, was that man despicable or what?\u201d [2. Meng Hao sold the spear to Qian Shuihen and Lu Song in Chapter 56]</p><br/><p>The young woman had been listening with wide eyes and gaping mouth. She looked up at the iron spear, which looked in all respects to be completely normal. She couldn\u2019t understand why the two strongest of the disciples would waste so much money on it.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao felt a little guilty. Then he noticed that Bai Yunlai was looking at him, so he nodded and solemnly said, \u201cThat fellow is definitely matchlessly despicable. It\u2019s enough to make one\u2019s hair bristle with anger!\u201d Actually, after meeting Qian Shuihen and Lu Song back in the Song Clan, he had guessed that the matter from that year had had a profoundly negative effect on the two of them, which continued on down to this day.</p><br/><p>What he had never imagined was that it actually affected the entire Violet Fate Sect. Suddenly, he felt a bit sorry for Qian Shuihen and Lu Song. And now he understood why they had been gnashing their teeth with fury back at the Song Clan.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunlai sighed and shook his head. \u201cThe spear is here as a reminder to all Violet Fate Outer Sect disciples. They are never to forget this matter\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was the person who sold them the spear?\u201d asked the young woman, her curiosity piqued.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name is Meng Hao,\u201d said Bai Yunlai quietly. \u201cHave you heard of him? Recently, everybody in the Southern Domain has been talking about him. At the Song Clan search for a son-in-law, he revealed himself as the successor of the Sublime Spirit Scripture. He\u2019s the same person who was involved in that scandal with Chu Yuyan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao?\u201d said the young woman, gaping.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d said Bai Yunlai quickly. \u201cThat name is taboo in the Violet Fate Sect! No one dares to speak it aloud\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stood off to the side, feeling even more guilty. He continued to clear his throat. He suddenly had the feeling that coming to the Violet Fate Sect might not have been the best decision.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that his facial expression suddenly flickered. He had just caught sight of a beam of light approaching from the distance. It transformed into a grim-faced young man who stared ferociously at Bai Yunlai. This was none other than\u2026 Qian Shuihen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yunlai, what are you doing sticking around here?! Why haven\u2019t you moved on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yunlai suddenly shivered, and a flattering expression appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Qian, I\u2019m just showing these two apprentice alchemists around the Sect. We were just leaving, just leaving.\u201d With that he grabbed Meng Hao and the young woman and hurriedly led them away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see? That was one of the two who bought the spear that year. In the future, you must never under any circumstances utter the name Meng Hao in front of him. If you do, he\u2019ll fly into a violent rage.\u201d He continued on with some more earnest exhortation: \u201cFurthermore, if you two ever leave the Sect to do training in the future, you must be extremely careful if you ever run into Meng Hao. His deviousness knows no bounds!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wide-eyed young woman\u2019s face was covered with disbelief. However, she quickly nodded, clearly placing the warning deep in her heart. Inside, Meng Hao laughed bitterly. Now he knew why they had looked so wary back in the Song Clan when they heard his name, and yet he didn\u2019t even recognize them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d Bai Yunlai repeated, \u201cthe name Meng Hao is taboo in our Sect. Don\u2019t forget that! Okay, now we need to go get your identity medallions and handle your living arrangements.\u201d As of now, the girl clearly viewed Meng Hao as a fearsome tiger. Meng Hao could only laugh bitterly inside as Bai Yunlai led them away.</p><br/><p>Soon they arrived at a valley which was relatively large and crowded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve joined the Violet Fate Sect, you\u2019re obviously from local Cultivator Clans. As you know, we all have limits to our Cultivation bases. As apprentice alchemists, you must master the first technique of alchemy. Pay attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis technique is called Violet Cloud Spirit. With this technique, you can feed a plant with your spiritual energy, and catalyze its effectiveness, which is based on its medicinal age. Depending on your skill and the nature of your Cultivation base, the catalyzation will produce different results.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were several hundred people here. Most sat cross-legged, looking at the medicinal plants rocking back and forth in their hands. In the very front was a solemn, middle-aged man who was currently giving a lecture about some alchemic technique. He held up his hand, within which was a growing medicinal plant. In the blink of an eye, it grew up two inches.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked around, focusing especially on the medicinal plant in the hand of the middle-aged man. His eyes gleamed with a strange light. Bai Yunlai led them to the center of the valley, where an unimposing man old man in a gray robe sat there with eyes closed. He looked like he was asleep. It was impossible to tell the level of his Cultivation base. Seemingly out of habit, Bai Yunlai walked over and retrieved two medallions and a bag of holding from the old man\u2019s side. He pulled out two violet-colored jade slips which he then handed to Meng Hao and the young woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it a try,\u201d he said solemnly as the two looked at the jade slips. \u201cThe technique is very simple. You should be able to master it very quickly. Then, you\u2019ll have a chance to try catalyzing for the first time. It\u2019s very important, though. It will reveal your aptitude toward alchemy, and we have to record the results.\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Collin Brinkmans</em></p><br/><p></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><ol><li><span id=\"footnote-1\">Bai Yunlai\u2019s name in Chinese is  b\u00e1i y\u00fan l\u00e1i - Bai is a common surname which means \u201cwhite.\u201d Yun means \u201ccloud.\u201d Lai means \u201ccome.\u201d<i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-left\"></i></span></li></ol></div><br/>\n</div>"}

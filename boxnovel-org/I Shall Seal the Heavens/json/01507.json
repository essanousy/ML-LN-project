There wasn\u2019t the least bit of unfamiliarity to this Chen Fan. Quite the opposite. Meng Hao was sure that he knew him. Not only did he exist in Meng Hao's memories, he also had a place deep within his intuition.</p><br/><p>As Chen Fan walked in and sat down cross-legged in front of him, Meng Hao felt stabbing pain in his head. Within his mind, Chen Fan was like a drop of water falling into a pot of boiling oil.</p><br/><p>The resulting explosion caused random, scattered memories to flit through Meng Hao\u2019s mind. They were like a cyclone that roared through his thoughts, none of them connected, and yet all of them featuring Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>They were like memories from another life, and they left Meng Hao trembling, his eyes bloodshot. Demonic qi roared, and finally, he clenched his hands into fists and roared, unleashing the power of his cultivation base. That power was definitely not the power of the Ancient Realm, it was the peak of the 9-Essences level.</p><br/><p>Although the room was being destroyed around them, Chen Fan wasn\u2019t affected at all. He leaned forward, grabbed Meng Hao by the shoulders, and shouted, \u201cLittle Junior Brother!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao began to pant, staring at Chen Fan, chaos raging within him. Not only was he bewildered by what was going on, he felt as if there were a voice inside of him yelling something at him, something he couldn\u2019t quite make out.</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao\u2019s cultivation base erupted out, the entire sect was shaken, and countless individuals flew over anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother, wake up!!\u201d Chen Fan roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of that is real! Everything you experienced in the Vast Expanse Realm was an illusion!!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are back in the real world now. The Vast Expanse Realm is just an Arcane Pocket Realm, the ruins of a place which died ages and ages ago!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan\u2019s shouting grew louder, and it eventually pierced its way into Meng Hao\u2019s mind. Meng Hao was panting even harder than before, and his eyes were crimson. More and more memories were flying about in his mind.</p><br/><p>In one moment, he was experiencing familiar sensations in an unfamiliar world. The next moment, he was experiencing unfamiliar sensations in a familiar world. It made it impossible for him tell clearly what was real.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot real?\u201d he asked hoarsely. He didn't recognize his own voice, as if it weren\u2019t even him speaking. It sounded hoarse and grating, like metal rubbing against rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot real!\u201d Chen Fan replied. \u201cIt was all a fantasy we experienced in the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm. You\u2019re not the only one to go through this. I had the same feelings. In fact, everyone who escaped from the Arcane Pocket Realm had the same experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>He clasped Meng Hao by the shoulders and anxiously continued: \u201cA big group from the Hundred Sects went into the Arcane Pocket Realm together. Who would have ever guessed that as soon as we entered, we were sucked into a fantasy? Of course, there were upsides. For example, both you and I were able to find our own path of cultivation within the confusing fantasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bewilderment in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes grew more intense. He believed Chen Fan, but deep inside, there was something shouting at him, and he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember a woman,\u201d Meng Hao blurted subconsciously. \u201cShe--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWas her name Xu Qing?\u201d Chen Fan interrupted. Meng Hao\u2019s jaw dropped. As soon as the name Xu Qing entered his mind, a tremor ran through him. The expression of struggle on his face grew more intense; it felt as if he were stuck in a nightmare.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink carefully,\u201d Chen Fan said, \u201cand you\u2019ll realize that the Xu Qing you are thinking about is exactly the same as Xu Qing from the Dao of Water Sect, right? Junior Brother, you were in a relationship with Xu Qing from the Dao of Water Sect, but in the end, she chose the path of Immortality, not you.\u201d As Chen Fan spoke, memories rose up within Meng Hao\u2019s mind. He suddenly remembered that Xu Qing had been a fellow disciple of the Blue Sea Sect. However, because of various circumstances, she ended up defecting to another sect, and severing any connections she had to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Meng Hao murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s also Fatty and Wang Youcai. What about my dad and mom, and my sister? What about Sun Hai and my Master, Pill Demon...?\u201d However, as more memories appeared in his mind, he had to admit that he saw images of everyone he had just mentioned.</p><br/><p>Virtually all of them were cultivators from the Hundred Sects, the same ones who had gone into the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it really all just an illusion...?\u201d Meng Hao murmured bitterly.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan nodded, mixed emotions flickering within his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother,\u201d he said softly, gripping Meng Hao\u2019s shoulders, \u201cyou were stuck within the Arcane Pocket Realm of the Vast Expanse Realm for far longer than me. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so much more confused, and also why it will take you longer to fully awaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had the same suspicions as you when I first awoke. I had many confusing impulses, and felt as if I didn\u2019t want to awaken. I even tried to get back into the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther people might not understand what you\u2019re feeling right now, but your Elder Brother does!\u201d Chen Fan seemed very earnest as he looked at Meng Hao, and his expression was one of deep care.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao maintained his silence, and yet his eyes seemed more confused than ever. He didn\u2019t want to believe what he was being told, and yet everything around him seemed so real. He could see the images of the people around him within his memories. That was especially true of his wife, who had always cared about him even when he was infatuated with Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>And then there was his son, his own flesh and blood. Via divine sense, he could tell that the blood pumping through the boy\u2019s veins was the same as his own.</p><br/><p>Most real of all was Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he muttered, \u201cthe Mountain and S--\u201d Before he could finish, Chen Fan interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d he said, his grip on Meng Hao\u2019s shoulders tightening, tears welling up in his eyes. \u201cLittle Junior Brother, you need to wake up. All of that was an illusion. I know that you were just about to bring up the Mountain and Sea Realm. That\u2019s because the first place we all ended up in after going into the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm was the ruins of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of us got sucked into the same place. I remember the Mountain and Sea Realm too, as well as the Reliance Sect. Back then, I was your Elder Brother, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath and looked up at Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was an illusion, all of it,\u201d Chen Fan said. \u201cThe Mountain and Sea Realm wasn\u2019t destroyed in our time, that happened long, long ago. Many years in the past, the Vast Expanse Realm really did exist, and inside of it, there was also a Mountain and Sea Realm. But the people who lived there were not you and me!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was all a dream, a dream of Mountains and Seas. We were taken back into ancient times, and that had a big impact on all of us.\u201d Every word spoken by Chen Fan was like a bolt of lightning striking Meng Hao\u2019s mind. \u201cStop thinking about it. It was all an illusion. What you see around you is reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all real?\u201d Meng Hao murmured. Bitterly, he closed his eyes. His head hurt, and every time he tried to think about the Vast Expanse, it felt like he was being stabbed to the bone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all real!\u201d Chen Fan replied earnestly. If anyone else had tried to convince him, Meng Hao wouldn\u2019t have believed them. But this was Chen Fan, and both in the clear memories, and the vague ones, he remembered that his Eldest Brother always took care of him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled bitterly, and then took a long breath. \u201cElder Brother, I understand. I sank into a dream of the Vast Expanse Realm, and it was so realistic that now I'm having trouble telling the difference between what is real and what is not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, and he seemed older than before, exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust give me some peace and quiet, and I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said quietly.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan looked at him, patted his shoulder, then rose to his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet some rest, and always remember that this place... is real. You are not Meng Hao from the Mountain and Sea Realm. You are the Scion disciple of the Blue Sea Sect, from outside the Vast Expanse. Meng Hao, you are a Chosen from the Hundred Sects of the Vast Expanse Cosmos.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded bitterly. However, there was something that no one could possibly know, which was that the copper mirror inside of his bag holding was sending a hot current of energy into Meng Hao. It swirled around inside of him as he closed his eyes, slowly calming him. The surrounding members of his sect finally breathed sighs of relief, although they still continued to look at him with caring concern.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan looked deeply at Meng Hao, then turned and left, looking completely exhausted. After he was gone, Meng Hao\u2019s wife and son returned, looking very anxious and worried. The boy lingered off to the side, looking a bit scared, as though his father was a stranger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's fine,\u201d Meng Hao said, opening his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d He forced a smile onto his face.</p><br/><p>A few days passed. During that time, numerous fellow disciples came to offer greetings. Most of them seemed to care for him, but there were also some who secretly wished that he had died in the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm.</p><br/><p>Within Meng Hao\u2019s memories, he didn\u2019t recall seeing those people act in such a way, but now, all it took was a look, and he could sense their true feelings.</p><br/><p>His Master came, as did other Senior members of the sect. All of them asked a few questions here and there, and left him with some encouraging words.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan came to visit several times. Each time he would sit cross-legged in front of Meng Hao and chat, helping him to remember things from the Blue Sea Sect and the Vast Expanse Cosmos.</p><br/><p>Whenever they talked about the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm, they would sigh.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gradually came to accept his identity, although confusion continued to lurk deep within him.</p><br/><p>A month later, when everyone believed Meng Hao to have fully recovered, he was sitting there cross-legged on one rainy night, looking at his wife, when he suddenly stood and walked out into the rain. Deep in his eyes, confusion blossomed.</p><br/><p>Within the rain was a stiff wind which lifted his hair up as it whistled through the trees of the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this place actually... real?\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come I just can't forget everything that happened in the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm? There are so many faces I can\u2019t forget, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about the Mountain and Sea Realm....\u201d He reached his hand out, and as the freezing rain fell onto his palm, it felt like he was being stabbed to the bone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He flicked his sleeve, unleashing the explosive power of his cultivation base. It wasn\u2019t the power of the Immortal Realm, but the Ancient Realm. Dots of light could be seen all over his body, which made him shine brightly.</p><br/><p>Massive booms could be heard as the 10,000 lightning bolts were destroyed. Meng Hao\u2019s garments and hair fluttered, and as he looked at the black clouds, he took a step upward.</p><br/><p>In response to that step, the clouds rumbled, and tens of thousands of lightning bolts fell, transforming into a lake of lighting that enveloped him. He snorted coldly, performing a double-handed incantation gesture and then waving both hands out.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!</p><br/><p>All of the lightning was destroyed. Then the black clouds churned, as a roar of rage echoed out from inside. 100,000 lightning bolts began to fall, seemingly endlessly, as if the Heavens were infuriated. After the 100,000 lightning bolts were destroyed, another 100,000 came. Then another.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if the lightning would never end, as if the Tribulation wouldn\u2019t stop until Meng Hao was dead.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered as he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing boundless mist to build up around him, which was a divine ability he had picked up from the Vast Expanse School. He extended his right hand, and the mist rapidly transformed into streams of smoke which shot out to meet the incoming Tribulation Lightning. Booms could be heard as they all exploded.</p><br/><p>The sound was shocking. It was as if in all creation, the only thing that existed were the Heavens and Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>One man was personally fighting the Heavens!</p><br/><p>Everyone present was completely shaken, and the Dao Realm experts were clearly moved.</p><br/><p>Another 100,000 lightning bolts collapsed, and behind them came yet another 100,000. It was then that Meng Hao\u2019s laughter began to echo out. His hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture as he stepped forward again, energy surging in spectacular fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm seeking enlightenment of what it means to seal the Heavens, in order to complete the Ninth Hex. If I can\u2019t seal some Tribulation Lightning, then how could I possibly strive to seal the Heavens!\u201d Laughing, he took another step forward, raised his hands up and pushed them toward the Heavens.</p><br/><p>The aura of the Ancient Realm erupted out, and countless shining lights appeared. Heaven shook and the Earth quaked as he fought against one round of 100,000 lighting bolts after another.</p><br/><p>Booms rang out constantly as the lightning collapsed. At the same time, Meng Hao remained in place in mid-air, clearly visible to everyone down below. The crowds were shaken by this sight of someone actually fighting the Heavens.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao flicked his sleeve, glaring at the clouds as he said, \u201cBring it on! Let\u2019s see how many lightning bolts you can send against Fang Mu this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only someone with profound character... could say something like that!</p><br/><p>Countless gasps of shock could be heard from the crowd down below. It was an intense image that was burned into their minds: Fang Mu standing there, facing off against the endlessly seething black clouds and crackling lightning.</p><br/><p>Anyone who saw such a scene couldn\u2019t help but gasp in astonishment.</p><br/><p>The Chosen had already forgotten about how they didn't want to accept Fang Mu. Their eyes were shining brightly because of his brazen attitude, his domineering nature, and the heroic and shocking way he fought against the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu!!!\u201d It was impossible to say who began to shout it first. But soon, all of the Chosen, and all of the other male cultivators in the Ninth Sect, could sense Meng Hao\u2019s heroic nature. It was a madness that could fight against the Heavens, and it left them shaken, eyes bloodshot, roaring at the tops of their lungs.</p><br/><p>Their voices became a sound wave that shook Heaven and Earth, causing everything to tremble, as though energy itself were erupting from their mouths.</p><br/><p>The Dao Realm experts were all moved. They looked at the disciples, and then looked at Meng Hao, their expressions filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>Morale and spirit are extremely important in a sect, and as of this moment... a seed of valor seemed to have been planted in the hearts of all the disciples.</p><br/><p>And it was all because of Meng Hao. He had successfully captured the hearts of all of the disciples of the Ninth Sect. Not only were they crying out to him as Eldest Brother, but their hearts were also brimming with ardor and reverence for him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the surrounding female disciples were looking at Fang Mu with unprecedented glows in their eyes. To see him fighting the Heavens had imprinted his image onto their hearts for all eternity.</p><br/><p>It was the same kind of look that the female disciples had given Wang Tengfei back in the days of the Reliance Sect, or the looks that the female alchemists had given to Chosen in the Violet Fate Sect. It was the exact same look given to Meng Hao in the various sects in which he had become a legend, a Dao Child among Chosen!</p><br/><p>The female disciples gazed at Meng Hao with adoration and envy; they were attracted to him in a way that far exceeded the passions of the male cultivators.</p><br/><p>It took only a moment for all of the disciples of the Ninth Sect to be whipped into an unheard-of frenzy, all thanks to the sight of Meng Hao fighting the Heavens, viciously battling the lightning, and everything else.</p><br/><p>Yan\u2019er stood there in the crowd, and was suddenly not very happy. She felt a sensation of crisis, something extremely, profoundly intense.... She was excited just like everyone else, but her young heart was also filled with a secret joy because of Meng Hao; somehow, he had become everything to her. Then she realized how everyone was looking at him, and she suddenly felt as if they were having aspirations regarding something that belonged to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d she thought, gritting her teeth. \u201cThere\u2019s only one of that old man. What do you people think you\u2019re doing? Trying to steal him? He\u2019s my Master. MINE!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotions of the Ninth Sect\u2019s disciples bubbled over, as if they had been lit with flame. Meanwhile, the clouds churned, and more lightning formed, this time, not 100,000 bolts, but instead, more than 1,000,000.</p><br/><p>1,000,000 lightning bolts began to fall, a shocking spectacle difficult to put into words. As they fell, they resembled, not a lake of lightning, but rather, an enormous hand!</p><br/><p>It was a huge hand composed of lightning, emanating crashing booms as it descended toward Meng Hao. A sensation of imminent crisis rose up within him, and his eyes began to shine brightly. He threw his head back and roared, throwing both hands up into the air, causing numerous dots of light to appear.</p><br/><p>10. 30. 50. 80... 108! [1. The number 108 is important in some Eastern religions. More info here.]</p><br/><p>The 108 major qi meridians on his body were all shining brilliantly. Shockingly, within each of those 108 qi meridians, it was possible to see an image.</p><br/><p>Closer examination revealed that those figures were, astonishingly... Immortal Soul Lamps!!</p><br/><p>108 meridians, 108 lamps!</p><br/><p>It was a complete and shocking sight to everyone. This was the first time for Meng Hao\u2019s clone to reveal how many Soul Lamps he had, and the result was almost beyond belief.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, all 108 Soul Lamps were blazing with light, casting Meng Hao in complete brilliance. As the enormous palm fell, he harbored no thoughts of putting up a defense, or of evading. Instead... he attacked!</p><br/><p>He was fighting the Heavens with an incisive will!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took the initiative to fly out, a blur of light that shot toward the enormous lightning hand. Everything shook violently, and all eyes were fixed upon the scene, filled with both nervousness and anticipation. To them, it was as if nothing else existed other than Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Time seemed to slow. Everyone watched as Meng Hao made contact with the hand. Then, time seemed to return to its normal speed, and even increased explosively.</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth trembled, and rumbling sounds echoed out. The hand, filled with endless destructive power, intent on wiping Meng Hao out of existence, collapsed into countless fragments. The light shining out of Meng Hao dimmed somewhat, but he laughed nonetheless.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it on!\u201d he yelled, as brazen as ever, his hair whipping about.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds emanated out from within the black clouds. The clouds suddenly shrank, converging in upon themselves, sending a terrifying pressure out to cover everything. The disciples of the Ninth Sect had just begun to feel relieved moments ago, but suddenly got nervous again.</p><br/><p>Crackling sounds rang out as the shrunken clouds suddenly exploded with an insane rain of lightning. 100,000 bolts. 1,000,000. 2,000,000. 3,000,000. 5,000,000. 8,000,000!!</p><br/><p>8,000,000 lighting bolts converged, seemingly covering the entire world. They descended like a downpour, and from a distance, they almost looked like... a huge finger!</p><br/><p>Although it was simply an outline, the resemblance was striking!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s pupils constricted as the finger closed in on him. Just when his true self was preparing to converge some divine sense to send out in assistance, all of a sudden, a voice could be heard. It came from the group of Chosen down below; they had witnessed Meng Hao fighting the Heavens, and they could see how mismatched and unfair the battle was.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother Fang, you\u2019re fighting the Heavens alone! I hope you don\u2019t mind if I, Sun Mou... join you in fighting the Tribulation Lighting!?\u201d Even as the words rang out, a figure flew out from the crowd.</p><br/><p>Almost simultaneously, more people began to call out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother Fang, count me, Liu Mu, in as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd me, Chen Ao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I, Zhang Yunqi, possibly stay out of something like this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother, I, Cai Wei, will also join you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTribulation Lighting? Zheng Yuan will join you to fight it, Eldest Brother Fang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless individuals flew up, and innumerable voices cried out. There were men and women, all of whom flew up into the air.</p><br/><p>1,000 disciples. 5,000. 30,000. 200,000. 1,000,000. 3,000,000... Soon, 10,000,000 disciples were up in the air, flying together!</p><br/><p>The Dao Realm experts were shocked, and the Paragons gasped. In the blink of an eye, the 8,000,000 lightning bolts suddenly... lurched to a halt!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

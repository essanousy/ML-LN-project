He immediately lost all will to fight back. Being at early Foundation Establishment, he simply didn\u2019t have the courage to attempt to fight with someone of the great circle of Foundation Establishment.</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao calmly approached him, he retreated backward several paces. Without hesitation, he clasped hands and saluted.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, senior,\u201d he said. Then to the others, \u201cHey you, why haven\u2019t you paid respects to the Elder?!\u201d Mumbling and trembling, the Second Brother Huang hurried over and bowed deeply to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>His heart quivered with fear. How could he ever have imagined that what he previously believed to be a weak little lamb could instantly transform into a devilish fiend that could slaughter him hundreds of times over?</p><br/><p>Third and Fourth Brothers, as well as the yellow-robed man, immediately joined the violet-robed man. Trembling, the five brothers all bowed repeatedly to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The most bitter and regretful of all, of course, was the yellow-robed man\u2026.</p><br/><p>He glanced over at the violet-robed man to find him staring over with an expression of deep, venomous hatred. The yellow-robed man\u2019s eyes darkened, and he very nearly fell into a coma out of fright.</p><br/><p>Coughing lightly, Meng Hao sat down onto the crystal throne. The five men were now standing where he had been just moments ago\u2026.</p><br/><p>The old painter stared in frightened awe.</p><br/><p>The violet-robed man\u2019s heart was filled with anxiety and his scalp was numb. \u201cSir\u2026.\u201d he said. He was just now wrapping his mind around what had happened. His body trembled.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at him and said, \u201cI can see that you have some problems with your Cultivation base. You\u2019ve been stuck with only one Dao Pillar for years. How about this: I have a medicinal pill that would be very beneficial.\u201d He lifted up his hand, in the middle of which was a medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>It was a very common pill for the Foundation Establishment stage. However, its effectiveness was a bit\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many Spirit Stones are you willing to pay for it?\u201d asked Meng Hao coolly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d The violet-robed man gritted his teeth, then pulled out his bag of holding and handed it over to Meng Hao. Meng Hao frowned slightly, causing the trembling violet-robed man to turn and glare ferociously at the four men other behind him. Each and every one was shaking in their boots. One by one, they pulled out all of their belongings. In the end, the violet-robed man procured all of the items and wealth they had saved up over the years in their Immortal\u2019s Cave, as well as the cave itself, and offered it to Meng Hao. All in exchange for one medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>His expression the same as ever, Meng Hao collected up the various valuables. Then he glanced at the yellow-robed man, who looked back sullenly, and then the Second Brother Huang.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you mention there\u2019s a teleportation portal here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes there is,\u201d replied Second Brother Huang. Not daring to leave out any information, he quickly gave a full description: \u201cActually, we didn\u2019t bring the portal here; it's a natural function of the Immortal\u2019s Cave, which we accidentally discovered. It works, but it will only teleport to one fixed location.\u201d His heart was filled with virtual agony, as well as complete enmity for the yellow-robed man. \u201cDammit, Fifth Brother,\u201d he thought, \u201cwho is this that you brought back with you? He\u2019s some kind of Patriarch!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded. He had already used his Spiritual Sense to confirm the location of the teleportation portal. Looking back at the five men, he suddenly waved his arm. Unable to resist, the five of them were instantly swept up. All they could see was a blur as they entered the world of the blood-colored mask which lay inside Meng Hao\u2019s bag of the Cosmos.</p><br/><p>Everything was the color of blood. The meat jelly was in the midst of educating the Li Clan Patriarch, who sat there, emaciated, a blank, agonized look in his eyes. He looked more dead than alive, his body slack.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly immediately noticed Meng Hao appear with the five Huang Clan men. Its eyes filled with excitement, and he instantly cast aside the Li Clan Patriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullies!\u201d he cried, flying over. \u201cI smell bullies! They\u2019re all bullies, all immoral!!\u201d It flew a few circles around the five Huang Clansmen, who were clearly disoriented and terrified. The meat jelly was getting more excited.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and said, \u201cSenior, these are the bullies I promised to bring you a few days ago. They need education from you to bring them back from the path of wickedness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent, excellent,\u201d said the meat jelly with a nod. \u201cYou kept your word, as shall I. First, let me count.\u201d It flapped its wings as it settled onto the shoulder of the large, violet-robed man.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026\u201d The meat jelly began to count, starting with the violet-robed man and the proceeding onto the Second and Third Brothers. When its eyes fell upon the Fourth Brother, it suddenly stared in shock. \u201cOne\u2026 two?\u201d It flapped its wings as it reached the yellow-robed man. Suddenly, an angry, humiliated expression appeared on its face. It spun and glared at Meng Hao. \u201cLiar!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gaped at the meat jelly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook!\u201d roared the meat jelly furiously. \u201cOne, two, three, one, two!! You\u2019ve brought me two bullies, and I asked for three! I wanted three bullies!!\u201d It clearly believed itself to have been swindled.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stared with wide eyes. Suddenly, everything became clear. This damned meat jelly really could only count the numbers one, two and three?</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Meng Hao quickly swept up the yellow-robed man as well as the Fourth Brother. Instantly, they disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was just a little mistake,\u201d said Meng Hao quickly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you count again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The meat jelly carefully began to count again. \u201cOne, two, three\u2026 Haha! There are three! Three bullies. Excellent, excellent.\u201d Excited once again, it beat its wings and flew around in a few more circles. Suddenly, a glow like lightning shot out from it toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t evade. The lightning glow slammed into him, melding with his Spiritual Sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my will of lightning,\u201d said the meat jelly, which had already landed on the shoulder of the violet-robed man. \u201cYou can use it to change forms one time. Make sure to bring back some more bullies!\u201d It looked at the violet-robed man with a friendly expression. \u201cHey. Hello. My name is Ultimate Vexation. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>The large, violet-robed man stared in shock. Not waiting for him to reply, Meng Hao quickly left the blood-colored mask. He could only imagine what would happen after the man responded. A sea of suffering awaited him\u2026.</p><br/><p>Back in the Immortal\u2019s Cave, Meng Hao sat there, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe meat jelly can only count from one to three\u2026. Very useful.\u201d After a moment, he looked over at the old painter, who sat there with a dull expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwhat village are you from? I can take you back home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked scared. He hesitated for a moment, then said in a trembling voice, \u201cBut\u2026 my painting isn\u2019t finished yet. Do you mind if I paint you?\u201d His eyes shined with anticipation.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was shocked for a moment. Then his eyes narrowed, and he looked closely at the old man. No matter which way he looked at him, the man seemed mortal. After a while, Meng Hao nodded. \u201cThank you so much, sir,\u201d he said, continuing to sit there on the crystal throne.</p><br/><p>The old man took a deep breath, and then lifted the paintbrush, hand trembling. Looking at Meng Hao, he began to paint.</p><br/><p>Time passed slowly. It took about four hours, during which time Meng Hao waited patiently. The man painted earnestly, and Meng Hao sat without moving.</p><br/><p>After a while, the old man put down his paintbrush. He eyed the painting in front of him, and a satisfied expression filled his eyes. He looked up at Meng Hao and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinished,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a look? Does it look like you?\u201d His face was filled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled. He stood up and walked over to stand next to the old man. What he saw on the canvas was a young man sitting upright in a chair, surrounded by mountains. You couldn\u2019t say that the painting wasn\u2019t good, but there was something about it that just didn\u2019t seem right. It only bore a thirty percent resemblance to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d said Meng Hao, smiling and nodding his head. \u201cWhat are these two marks here?\u201d He lifted his hand to point at the painting, where two long, thick marks could be seen. Meng Hao wasn\u2019t sure what they meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s above all of us?\u201d asked the old man, smiling.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at him in surprise. Then, he smiled. \u201cThe sky,\u201d he said quietly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it for a moment,\u201d said the old man, gazing at Meng Hao. His smile seems to contain some sort of hidden meaning. He looked completely different than he had just moments ago. Meng Hao thought for a moment, and then looked up. His eyes glittered as his vision passed through the Immortal\u2019s Cave to look up at the sky outside.</p><br/><p>After some time passed, Meng Hao lowered his head. The instant he did, his pupils constricted. The old man\u2026 was nowhere to be seen!</p><br/><p>An archaic voiced suddenly filled the Immortal\u2019s Cave, causing Meng Hao\u2019s body to quiver. His Spiritual Sense suddenly scattered. \u201cBecause of the ten thousand year old will of the World Tree, my residual self is here today. It is fate that I came here today to paint for you. I have sealed the true form of the Resurrection Lily, refined its nature talent and fused it with your spirit. While it is sealed, it cannot harm you. Furthermore, you will be able to draw upon the Resurrection Lily\u2019s nature talent of plants and vegetation. When enough time passes, you can cast away my residual will which seals the flower. Every ten thousand years, I commit one person to memory. Furthermore, a person who exists in my memory cannot be exterminated by the Karmic Severing of those surnamed Ji.\u201d</p><br/><p>A long moment passed before Meng Hao took a deep breath. His eyes shone brightly as he turned once again to look at the painting. He gasped and stared in shock.</p><br/><p>The image on the painting was not that of Meng Hao, but of a\u2026 Resurrection Lily!</p><br/><p>It looked savage, unwilling, and even insane. It appeared to be sealed inside the painting! The image was incredibly lifelike!</p><br/><p>There were also some words written on the painting.</p><br/><p><em>The day the Resurrection Lily blooms with seven colors, the flower falls, Immortal Ascension, one thousand years. Karma is hidden in the Immortal Mountain. Ask not the Heavens regarding the path to slaying the flower.</em></p><br/><p><em>Painted in the Southern Domain, Planet South Heaven, for my young friend.</em></p><br/><p>Shui Dongliu. [1.

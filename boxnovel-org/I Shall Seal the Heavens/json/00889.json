From a distance, the asteroid field almost looked like a river of stars floating through space.</p><br/><p>This portion of space was actually not completely black; occasional dots of sparkling light glittered to and fro. At first glance, the starry sky seemed without end, but in fact, it was not so. It also seemed to pulse with life.</p><br/><p>The asteroid field was filled with many large asteroids that were apparently surrounded by shocking power, almost like shields.</p><br/><p>One of those asteroids was tens of thousands of meters wide, and emanated glittering light. It was possible to see numerous teleportation portals carved into its surface, over a thousand of them packed tightly together.</p><br/><p>One of those teleportation portals was currently emanating dazzling light, and the figures of Meng Hao and 19th Uncle slowly became visible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er,\u201d 19th Uncle said with a smile, \u201cthere is a vast distance between Planet South Heaven and Planet East Victory. It would be difficult to teleport there directly. That\u2019s why we need to transfer teleportation portals here.\u201d When he looked at Meng Hao, the emotion and love in his gaze was apparent.</p><br/><p>He was very pleased that his older cousin\u2019s son had successfully transcended his tribulation, and was finally able to return to the clan.</p><br/><p>When he thought of the steep price Fang Xiufeng had paid over the years, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can take a look around,\u201d 19th Uncle continued. \u201cThis asteroid belongs to the Fang Clan, so we\u2019re in no danger. I need some time to make some adjustments to the teleportation portal. The way it is now, your body probably couldn\u2019t handle it. I need about\u2026 enough time for an incense stick to burn.\u201d With that, he began to make adjustments to the teleportation portal.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded in response, then stepped out of the teleportation portal to look around.</p><br/><p>There was no sun and no sky. The only things he could see were sparkling stars amidst pitch black darkness. Although this was not Meng Hao\u2019s first time stepping out into the starry sky, it was different than those other times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve really left Planet South Heaven\u2026.\u201d He looked off into the distance, but actually had no sense of direction, and no way to determine where Planet South Heaven might be. His heart felt a bit empty, and he was also nervous about arriving as a stranger on Planet East Victory.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was where he had been born, and was also a planet that belonged to his own Fang Clan.</p><br/><p>He patted his bag of holding, within which was a jade slip given to him by his father. It contained a map of the Ninth Mountain and Sea, along with various paths among the stars.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce I\u2019ve finished making these adjustments, we can be on our way,\u201d 19th Uncle called out, smiling as he continued to adjust the teleportation portal to suit Meng Hao. \u201cThe Patriarchs are all in secluded meditation, and have left the Grand Elder in charge. He was very happy to hear that you\u2019re returning, and has arranged for large numbers of clan members to gather together and receive you.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very lively! Hahaha! Once we\u2019re back, you really have to help me get my son in line!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded, and for some reason, he wasn\u2019t able to keep a bit of warmth from rising up in his heart. That was the warmth of family, a warmth that had begun to grow cold almost as soon as he left Planet South Heaven and stepped out into space.</p><br/><p>\u201c19th Uncle, does all of Planet East Victory belong to the Fang Clan?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father didn\u2019t tell you? Well, that makes sense. Cousin is a bit resentful of the clan. Ai\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, you probably already know that all the lands and stars are actually part of nine mountains and seas. Another way of putting it is that nine mountains exist in the starry sky, and each mountain has a sea, thus, nine seas.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Nine Mountains and Seas are divided into groups of mountains and seas, and thus nine worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn each of those, there are four planets which rotate eternally around their respective mountains. Outside of the Nine Mountains are two enormous heavenly bodies; the sun and a moon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the reflections cast by the sea of stars, the sun and moon look different on each of the planets, but in fact, there is only a single sun and a single moon for all the Nine Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Ninth Mountain and Sea, one of those four planets is Planet East Victory, which belongs completely to the Fang Clan. Although there are other sects and power structures on the planet, if the Fang Clan wanted to, we could unify the other powers. Instead, we permit them to exist.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, the largest planet in the Ninth Mountain and Sea is not Planet East Victory, but rather Planet North Reed. It is several times larger than Planet East Victory, and is where the Wang Clan, Song Clan, and Li Clan, the Three Great Clans, all call home.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there is Planet West Felicity, where you can find the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto, one of the Three Great Daoist Societies, as well as other illustrious sects.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo further analyze matters, you have to look at the Ninth Mountain and the Ninth Sea as a whole.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to everything else, Planet South Heaven is special. Since your father didn\u2019t tell you the details about that, then I won\u2019t presume to talk about them.\u201d After providing his explanation, 19th Uncle smiled and continued with his adjustments to the spell formation.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered with an intense light. 19th Uncle\u2019s description overlapped with his own understanding of matters to provide a much larger picture in Meng Hao\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201c19th Uncle, what other sects are on Planet East Victory?\u201d he suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most famous are the Church of the Blood Orchid and the Church of the Puppet God, which are listed among the Three Churches and Six Sects. In addition to them is the Medicine Immortal Sect. They might not be listed among the Three Churches and Six Sects, but when it comes to the Dao of alchemy, in all the Ninth Mountain and Sea, they are second only to the Kunlun Society.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost accurately speaking\u2026 the Medicine Immortal Sect has a deep connection with the Fang Clan. Ai\u2026 it was actually founded by a Patriarch of the Fang Clan who got angry and left to start his own sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter we get back to the clan, my son, your cousin, can tell you more about all that.\u201d 19th Uncle extended his right hand and pushed down onto the surface of the teleportation portal, causing bright light to glitter up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s it! Let\u2019s get going, Hao\u2019er. After enough time passes for an incense stick to burn, you\u2019ll be able to lay eyes on Planet East Victory!\u201d Laughing loudly, 19th Uncle stepped into the teleportation portal, followed closely by Meng Hao. As the light of teleportation surrounded them, a glow of anticipation could be seen in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao and 19th Uncle soon vanished with the light. However, in the moment that they faded away, a black-robed cultivator appeared above the teleportation portal.</p><br/><p>He wore no expression at all on his face, which was as cold as ice. He almost seemed completely devoid of emotion. He appeared without making a single noise, and when he saw that Meng Hao and 19th Uncle had disappeared into the portal, he stamped down viciously with his right foot, instantly shattering the teleportation portal.</p><br/><p>The teleportation portal was fundamentally very difficult to shatter. Otherwise, Meng Hao and 19th Uncle would not have been so confident in using it; after all, this asteroid belonged to the Fang Clan, and was protected by a shield, making it very difficult for outsiders to get into the place.</p><br/><p>The black-robed man pulled out a jade slip and sent some divine will into it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarget acquired. Teleportation portal\u2019s foundation destroyed.\u201d With that, he vanished.</p><br/><p>Almost in the same moment that he vanished, brilliant lights could suddenly be seen at a point somewhere between the asteroid and Planet East Victory, accompanied by massive rumbling. In the middle of the light was a hole that had been ripped in the void, from which a multicolored glow surged out, as well as deadly ripples. A roar could be heard, which was 19th Uncle, who shot out from within the hole, his hair in disarray, his expression that of rage, and his cultivation base rotating at full power. Next, Meng Hao stepped out from within the hole, surrounded by thunderous roaring.</p><br/><p>19th Uncle\u2019s face was grim, while Meng Hao\u2019s eyes gleamed with an intense light. Moments ago, they had been in the midst of teleportation, when suddenly, the teleportation tunnel collapsed. If 19th Uncle hadn\u2019t protected Meng Hao with his powerful cultivation base, then Meng Hao would definitely have been killed.</p><br/><p>Almost as soon as 19th Uncle and Meng Hao appeared, ripples began to spread out all around them. In the blink of an eye, nine completely emotionless black-robed figures appeared. From the look of things, they had already calculated any avenues of escape that would be open to 19th Uncle and Meng Hao, and had sealed them off; this was a deadly ambush!</p><br/><p>Rumbling echoed out as the nine people attacked in unison\u2026 all with peak Immortal Realm power!</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d roared 19th Uncle. \u201cYou people really have gall! Didn\u2019t you know that was a teleportation portal of the Fang Clan!?\u201d He immediately performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing an explosively destructive aura to surge out in all directions.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this point that a faint aura suddenly materialized in the void, and then roared out explosively. This aura was not that of the Immortal Realm, but a step beyond that, the early Ancient Realm!</p><br/><p>The appearance of this new aura caused 19th Uncle\u2019s face to flicker. He gritted his teeth, and a look of determination appeared on his face. He quickly grabbed Meng Hao and threw him off into the distance, as well as some other object, which turned into a beam of light that followed Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, they\u2019re probably after me. You get out of here, and I\u2019ll come after you later!\u201d 19th Uncle then began to perform a double-handed incantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Heavenly Void!\u201d cried out 19th Uncle. His entire body suddenly transformed into an enormous vortex that instantly sucked in the hidden Ancient Realm aura, as well as the nine peak Immortal Realm cultivators. Then, they all vanished.</p><br/><p>Everything happened extremely quickly. From the collapse of the teleportation to 19th Uncle unleashing his divine ability and swallowing up his opponents, barely enough time passed to blink an eye.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was panting as he tumbled through the void. The beam of light that had been following him materialized into a flying shuttle, which surrounded Meng Hao and sped off into the distance. The shuttle would provide Meng Hao protection from the starry sky for quite some time.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face flickered, and he turned to look back at the spot where 19th Uncle had fought the mysterious assailants. There was nothing to be seen; apparently, Meng Hao was now the only person out here among the stars.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere those people after 19th Uncle, or were they\u2026 coming after me!?\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered. He was not a novice in the Cultivation world. Contrariwise, he was extremely discerning. After all, he had traveled the road of cultivation all the way to the peak of Dao Seeking completely on his own power and ability, all without even knowing his father and mother. The tempering he had gone through had left him with shocking willpower and intuition.</p><br/><p>Without pausing for a moment, he sent some divine sense into the flying shuttle. After a moment of thought, he realized that while he didn\u2019t distrust 19th Uncle, he also knew that if those people weren\u2019t targeting him, then he could do whatever he wished right now. However, if they were targeting him, then that meant they had the ability to determine not just 19th Uncle\u2019s location, but his own. Therefore\u2026 he was not safe in this shuttle.</p><br/><p>He decided not to use the shuttle after all. He took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and then flew out of the shuttle into the starry sky.</p><br/><p>As soon as he left the shuttle, a suffocating pressure bore down on him. His body was immediately sent out of balance, and he began to sweat profusely. Fundamentally speaking, anyone who was not Immortal could not tread among the stars.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have eighty percent of the power of a true Immortal. I can kill false Immortals as easily as turning over my hand, and I\u2019m actually comparable to a 40-meridian Immortal. Plus, my fleshly body is incredibly powerful. Therefore\u2026 I can rely on myself to fly through the stars!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough my speed might not be that great, I can still do it safely!\u201d He lightly tapped the shuttle, sending it flying off in another direction, and splattered some blood onto it at the same time, which instantly transformed into a crude Blood Clone that could not wield divine abilities.</p><br/><p>The flying shuttle speedily drifted off into the distance carrying his Blood Clone.</p><br/><p>With that, Meng Hao turned into a beam of light that shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 889: Killing Intent Lurking Everywhere!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

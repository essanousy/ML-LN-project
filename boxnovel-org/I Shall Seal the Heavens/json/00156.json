No one moved to interfere with the woman. The man in the gray robed sat meditating with his eyes closed. Xu Youdao was aware of Meng Hao\u2019s extraordinariness, so naturally he did nothing.</p><br/><p>As for Han Bei, she had speculations regarding Meng Hao\u2019s incredible power, but wasn\u2019t certain. She just knew a bit of secret information, which had fueled her conjectures. For her, this situation would be a good chance to observe Meng Hao\u2019s battle prowess.</p><br/><p>She still wished to offer some words of caution, but would the Li woman really listen? The woman's Cultivation base was at the late Foundation Establishment stage, but in terms of thinking ability, she was one of the weakest present. The only way she had reached late Foundation Establishment was good fortune accumulated by her ancestors that had been passed down to her.</p><br/><p>Regarding Xie Jie, he had intentionally manipulated the whole thing, so obviously did nothing to stop it from happening. He watched Meng Hao from off to the side, a smile on his lips. He was very curious as to why the Elders of the Sect had instructed him to keep an eye on Meng Hao. After arriving at the Blessed Land, he hadn\u2019t paid too close attention, but having run into Meng Hao again, he wanted to feel him out.</p><br/><p>Everyone had their own plans and schemes. Meng Hao glanced them over, and although he wasn\u2019t able to fully grasp their various motivations, he had a pretty good idea. He watched the Li woman approaching, her pink whip whistling through the air. His face was expressionless, and he didn\u2019t take even a single step backward. In fact, in the midst of her approach, he took three steps forward.</p><br/><p>As he did, he lifted his right hand and struck out.</p><br/><p>As his palm struck out a fierce wind sprang up, causing the surrounding grass to whip about in a frenzy. Without pausing, Meng Hao struck out a second time, then a third, a fourth and a fifth time!</p><br/><p>These five strikes were the Nineteen Clear Sky strikes that Meng Hao had acquired from the violet-robed young man, by means of the rattan vines. The manual was incomplete, but the first five strikes were whole.</p><br/><p>Each of these five strikes were filled with the complete power of Meng Hao\u2019s Perfect Dao pillars. After striking out five times, an enormous magical palm the size of a person appeared in front of him. Wind whipped about in all directions as the palm shot forward.</p><br/><p>When the five Clear Sky strikes appeared, Han Bei and Xie Jie\u2019s expressions changed. They instantly recognized the enormous palm. This was a magical technique from the Black Sieve Sect; there was no way for outsiders to know it. Yet, here was Meng Hao, using it right in front of their eyes. There was no denying it, and this caused their hearts to tremble.</p><br/><p>The Li woman was of the late Foundation Establishment stage, but she only had seven Dao Pillars. Furthermore, they were not even Cracked, but Fractured. Disdain covered her face as her illusory whip slammed into Meng Hao\u2019s enormous palm. She knew in her heart what was going to happen. The palm would collapse into pieces as her whip sliced through it like a hot knife through butter. After it disintegrated, her whip would fall upon her opponent\u2019s body, severing tendons and crushing bones.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>An explosion reverberated out. There was a collapse. But it wasn\u2019t Meng Hao\u2019s palm. A soon as the middle-aged woman\u2019s magical whip made contact with the giant palm, it shook, and then broke apart into pieces. The Li woman\u2019s face fell when she saw this unexpected turn of events. A look of disbelief covered her face.</p><br/><p>How could she possibly have imagined that this would happen? She had used a magical whip powered by late Foundation Establishment. Her opponent\u2019s palm exceeded her wildest imagination; dread seeped into her eyes.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s giant palm instantly destroyed the whip. It shot forward with shocking power, accompanied by gale force winds. The Li woman no longer scorned Meng Hao; instead, as the area began to shake, a sense of imminent danger rose up inside her. She retreated immediately, raising her right hand, into which a small shield appeared. She bit down on her tongue and then spit up some blood from her Cultivation base. When it landed on the little shield, it began to spin, expanding outward and meeting Meng Hao\u2019s giant palm.</p><br/><p>Another explosion rippled out. The shield shook, and was tossed backward several meters, just barely able to resist the palm. Meng Hao continued to stride forward. His Spiritual Sense, which far outmatched any late Foundation Establishment Cultivator, exploded out, crushing down onto the Li woman.</p><br/><p>She screamed under the pressure. It felt like a sharp sword was stabbing through her brain, as if her own Spiritual Sense were about to shatter. She coughed up blood and staggered backward. By this time, Meng Hao had reached the small shield. He waved his hand, causing the massive illusory palm to wrap around the shield and drag it back to him. Using his Spiritual Sense, he erased the branding mark on the shield and then put it into his bag of holding. He looked at the woman surnamed Li.</p><br/><p>The woman was in shock, her Spiritual Sense suppressed, her treasure un-branded and taken by Meng Hao. She retreated backward at top speed, coughing up blood, her face pale, her head buzzing. After she had moved backward a dozen or so meters, she finally came to a stop. She looked up at Meng Hao, astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Her scalp was numb. It was clear that Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base must not be at the early Foundation Establishment stage. She had never seen an early Foundation Establishment Cultivator display such incredible battle power. Nor had she ever experienced such terrifying Spiritual Sense.</p><br/><p>Not even a Flawless Foundation could be like this, as far as she was concerned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis art contains a total of nineteen strikes,\u201d Meng Hao said coolly, his expression the same as always. He didn\u2019t even mention anything about the treasure he\u2019d snatched from her.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, the Li woman sucked in a breath, and her face went a few shades more pale. Her body began to tremble. The attack just now had rattled her Dao Pillars, caused her to cough up blood, and had forced her to utilize a treasured item. If more than five strikes had been used, she wasn\u2019t sure if her treasure could have resisted it. In that case, her Dao Pillars would surely have been damaged.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist, your Cultivation base is unfathomable,\u201d she said in a strained voice. \u201cI was crude and rash, please don\u2019t take offense. Please keep my Cloud Peak shield as a token of my apology.\u201d She clasped hands and bowed deeply to Meng Hao, her eyes filled with dread.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just her. Xu Youdao\u2019s gaze was fixed on Meng Hao. He was now completely reassured that he had made the right decision not to attack Meng Hao earlier. Meng Hao could not be an early Foundation Establishment Cultivator. If he really was\u2026 then that was exponentially more frightening.</p><br/><p>The gray-robed man\u2019s eyes flickered open and came to rest on Meng Hao. He nodded.</p><br/><p>Han Bei looked at Meng Hao thoughtfully, a light smile appearing on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist Meng, you\u2019re not late. The hour has arrived. Our chances of acquiring the Classic of Time has now increased thirty percent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Jie laughed and said nothing. He didn\u2019t bring up the Nineteen Clear Sky strikes. Fear of Meng Hao now existed in his heart, and he now knew that Meng Hao was not a person to be provoked lightly. After all, he had only seen Meng Hao\u2019s colossal Spiritual Sense, and had no inkling what magical techniques or items he might have.</p><br/><p>Whenever he dealt with people he didn\u2019t understand, he would be careful not to provoke them. Only after coming to understand them completely would he strike like lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget about the Classic of Time for a moment,\u201d said Meng Hao calmly. He looked at Han Bei, his expression the same as ever. \u201cI came to this Blessed Land at the request of Fellow Daoist Han. However, your Sect controls this place. I\u2019m very curious. If I help you to acquire the Classic of Time, will my Dao Pillars be ripped out afterward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Bei and Xie Jie\u2019s eyes flashed. Before they could respond, Xu Youdao laughed grimly and said, \u201cFellow Daoist Meng doesn\u2019t beat around the bush. I\u2019m also very curious about this matter. Would the two Fellow Daoists care to provide an explanation to dispel our doubts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, too, would like to know the answer to this question,\u201d said the gray-robed man. His eyes flashed with a cold light as he looked at Han Bei and Xie Jie.</p><br/><p>It seemed the Li woman was also concerned with her safety. She said nothing, but moved back a few paces, effectively closing a circle around Han Bei and Xie Jie.</p><br/><p>Han Bei smiled. \u201cFellow Daoists, I must request that you do not press us regarding Sect matters. I really can\u2019t speak about it. Even if I did, you most likely wouldn\u2019t believe me. In any case, it\u2019s a Sect secret. Even though I\u2019m a Conclave disciple, I don\u2019t know a lot about it. However, as for the place we\u2019re going to, I will of course take responsibility for your safety.\u201d She waved her hand and four jade slips flew out toward Meng Hao and the others.</p><br/><p>Han Bei continued, \u201cWithin this jade slip is a detailed explanation of how to exit this place. Use the method described therein, and you can leave without a hitch. There are several exits to this ancient Blessed Land. If you don\u2019t believe me, read the jade slip and then check to see where the exits are. Then you\u2019ll understand why I selected this location as our rendezvous point.\u201d She smiled, looking as earnest as always.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s Spiritual Sense swept over the jade slip, and he looked around the area he stood. According to the jade slip, there were three exits. One of them\u2026 was the area they were standing on top of.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s hands flashed the incantation method recorded within the jade slip and he immediately felt a teleportation power rising up from beneath his feet. However, now was not the time to test it out, so he did not continue to bind the incantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere are four Spirit Seal insects,\u201d said Han Bei. \u201cIf you wish to conduct further inspection, you can. Send some Spiritual Sense into them and then send them out of the exit. Then you can be assured that my words are not false.\u201d She waved her right hand. Four white, thumb-sized insects flew out toward Meng Hao and the others.</p><br/><p>Xu Youdao grabbed one. After examining it for a moment, he nodded. Branding it with Spiritual Sense, he used the technique described in the jade slip to send the insect down into the earth. It disappeared.</p><br/><p>The Li woman did the same. The gray-robed Cultivator completely ignored Han Bei\u2019s insects, instead slapping his bag of holding to produce a scorpion.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I believe you, Fellow Daoist Han,\u201d said Meng Hao. He glanced at the insects and then selected one. He continued with his incantation, sending the insect through the exit using the method from the jade slip. However, in addition to the bug, he sent one of the rattan vines that were hidden deep in the earth. From the insect, he caught the indistinct impression of another location. It was definitely somewhere else, somewhere far, far away.</p><br/><p>However, at the same time, he suddenly caught a sense of intense danger from the vine. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Almost immediately the vine died. As it did, it transmitted a final image to Meng Hao. It appeared clearly in his mind, an enormous bronze cauldron. It was incredibly imposing, appearing to be tens of thousands of meters tall.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

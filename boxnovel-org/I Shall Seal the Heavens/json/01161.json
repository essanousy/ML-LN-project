He ceased any pursuit of Guru Heavencloud, and looked extremely innocent and charming as he clasped hands and bowed to Patriarch Fang Shoudao.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior offers greetings, Patriarch,\u201d he said, clearing his throat, as if he wasn\u2019t the instigator of the current predicament, and was very curious to see how Fang Shoudao would resolve the situation.</p><br/><p>What he actually wanted to know, though was... exactly how important he was to the Fang Clan, and to Fang Shoudao.</p><br/><p>He wanted to know if the title of Crown Prince... was actually worth something! Perhaps it was just a title, and wasn\u2019t worth anything. Meng Hao\u2019s attitude would be dependent on how the question was answered.</p><br/><p>If the Fang Clan handled the situation with no regard for him, then he would simply attack. He would show the Fang Clan the true meaning of what an Allheaven Clan Patriarch was!</p><br/><p>Fang Shoudao sent a vicious glare in Meng Hao\u2019s direction, but then, a moment later, his eyes widened almost imperceptibly. Behind him were five or six clan Elders, including the Grand Elder Fang Tongtian, all of whom heard Guru Heavencloud\u2019s enraged words as they walked out of the teleportation portal.</p><br/><p>Once again, Guru Heavencloud said, \u201cSenior Shoudao, please take the lead in presiding over justice!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, the magenta-robed cultivators in the bazaar all clasped hands toward Fang Shoudao and joined their voices together to say, \u201cSenior Shoudao, please take the lead in presiding over justice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their conjoined voices boomed out like crashing waves, causing an unsightly expression to appear on Fang Shoudao\u2019s face. Inwardly, he was slightly suspicious about exactly what was happening. He once again looked over at Meng Hao, expression grim.</p><br/><p>After a long moment passed, he gave a cold harrumph and said, \u201cFang Tongtian, you and the other Elders resolve this situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Tongtian looked back at him in shock. Even as he stood there hesitating, one of the other Fang Clan Elders stepped forward, clasped hands, and bowed toward Guru Heavencloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist Heavencloud, please calm yourself. This truly was an instance of carelessness on the part of the Fang Clan. We can explain.\u201d Meng Hao had seen this old man before. He was an Elder from one of the neutral bloodlines. As the words left the man\u2019s mouth, Meng Hao\u2019s expression remained completely calm. However, his eyes turned icy cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, immediately apologize to Guru Heavencloud, and give back the thing you stole!\u201d the Elder said harshly. \u201cAs the Crown Prince, you must set a proper example for others! What you\u2019ve done here is simply outrageous!\u201d There were two reasons this Elder rushed to be the first to speak. The first was that he sensed that Patriarch Shoudao wasn\u2019t very pleased with the situation. The second was that he had many connections with the Heavencloud Bazaar, and wished for the situation to be resolved as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>From his perspective, his decision not to side with Meng Hao was quite proper. After all, the Fang Clan wasn\u2019t in a position to be antagonizing too many people, not even for the sake of the Crown Prince. Although Meng Hao had performed some incredible services for the clan, personal interests should never be placed above the interests of the group. Sometimes, it was simply necessary to back down.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one who had similar thoughts. The other Elders, even the two who were members of Meng Hao\u2019s bloodline, all felt that the best way to resolve the situation was to chide Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>One by one, the Elders began to chime in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, you shouldn\u2019t have killed anyone here. Apologize immediately! Fellow Daoist Heavencloud, this was just a matter of the Fang Clan\u2019s Crown Prince acting a bit impulsively. Let\u2019s drop the matter, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat's right. Hao\u2019er, what are you doing just standing there? Apologize right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Elders spoke one after another, Guru Heavencloud began to laugh coldly in his heart, and also sighed with relief that the Fang Clan members were reasonable people.</p><br/><p>In his mind, after Meng Hao apologized, there would be no way for him to pursue the matter further. He himself would be able to sell the jade pendant to the Fang Clan, although for a higher price than before. After all, he couldn\u2019t quite resolve himself to the idea of letting Meng Hao away completely scot-free after what he had done.</p><br/><p>He felt certain that the Fang Clan wouldn't be willing to antagonize people like himself lightly. After all, his cultivation base was at the point where all he had to do was make a breakthrough, and he could be a powerful enemy to any sect or clan.</p><br/><p>Once that happened, unless they went all out to exterminate him, he would be able to cause them unending problems in the future.</p><br/><p>Similarly, he didn\u2019t dare to deeply offend any of the powerful clans. That was why he always tried to maintain a certain level of imperiousness in his actions. He would never exceed that level too much, but he would likewise never become more submissive.</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard what the Elders were saying, his face relaxed, and he clasped hands and bowed to the Fang Clan Elders.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this was a misunderstanding, then I\u2019ll let it go,\u201d he said with a light, casual sigh. \u201cWe can simply blame my Junior Brother for being too boorish, which led him to an unfortunate and terrible death.... As for the stolen item, since the Crown Prince of the Fang Clan took a liking to it, then please, take it. In fact, I don\u2019t even want to have it returned. I just hope that the Fang Clan... won\u2019t slaughter me and my people!\u201d Although he was smiling bitterly, his heart was filled with venomous malice. In this situation, he was using a tactical retreat to advance his interests, using weakness to defeat strength. He couldn't go so far as to demand that they strip Meng Hao of his title, but he could certainly get them to punish him. He wouldn\u2019t just deal him a flesh wound, he would stab him to the bone!</p><br/><p>After all, he viewed himself to be the reasonable one. The people who had died were from the Heavencloud Bazaar. Not only had Meng Hao killed them, he had also stolen their goods. Guru Heavencloud was counting on all of that to lend weight to his demands.</p><br/><p>In the end, it seemed to work out exactly as he had expected. In response to Guru Heavencloud\u2019s words, the group of Fang Clan Elders frowned and began to rebuke Meng Hao even more harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, this is disgraceful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApologize right this instant, Hao\u2019er! Do you really want to humiliate the entire clan because of your personal affair!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, get down on your knees!\u201d The last sentence was uttered by the first Elder who had begun speaking moments ago, the one from one of the neutral bloodlines.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face had remained placid from start to finish. He offered no explanations, instead choosing to stand there looking coldly at the other members of the Fang Clan. To all the other cultivators looking on, Meng Hao seemed to be holding himself in a way that implied that even the Senior members of his clan weren\u2019t qualified to talk down to him.</p><br/><p>But then Meng Hao heard that one particular Elder say the words \u2018get on your knees,\u2019 and his eyes flickered coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Fang who?\u201d he said. \u201cI forget your given name. In any case, I dare you to repeat what you just said about me kneeling. Go ahead and try it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elder\u2019s eyes flickered with rage, and he was just about to speak when....</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d said Grand Elder Fang Tongtian, his face darkening, his voice echoing out in all directions. Although his cultivation base was not as high as Guru Heavencloud\u2019s, it was still high enough that Guru Heavencloud wouldn\u2019t look down on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Fang Shuidan, what you said just now was completely inappropriate,\u201d he said, his voice crackling like thunder. \u201cHave you forgotten that you are also surnamed Fang?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for you, Fellow Daoist Heavencloud, don\u2019t try to take a mile when we give you an inch. Meng Hao is the Crown Prince of the Fang Clan. You say he killed some people? Well, even if he killed the entire Heavencloud Bazaar, what would it matter?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say he stole something from you? How absurd! The Fang Clan lacks nothing! We have no need to go around robbing people! Besides, Meng Hao is our Crown Prince, the future Clan Chief! If he did rob you... then you should think of it as an honor!\u201d All the surrounding cultivators\u2019 eyes went wide when they heard Fang Tongtian\u2019s words. Guru Heavencloud\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly as he glared back at Fang Tongtian.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such an aggravating smart-aleck,\u201d Fang Tongtian continued, his eyes flickering with killing intent. \u201cAnd don\u2019t put on such a show of histrionics. The Crown Prince of the Fang Clan apologizing to you would be giving you plenty of face as it is. Let\u2019s drop the matter here. And if you disagree... go ahead and say so, then see what happens!\u201d Although Fang Tongtian was no match for Guru Heavencloud, his status in the Fang Clan was such that he could easily cow Guru Heavencloud with his words.</p><br/><p>Fang Tongtian\u2019s diatribe caused the other Fang Clan Elders to stare in shock. The other surrounding cultivators were even more astonished.</p><br/><p>Even Meng Hao had a strange look in his eyes as he looked over at Fang Tongtian. If he remembered correctly, Fang Tongtian had been punished, locked away in secluded meditation because of the chaos that had broken out on Planet East Victory on his watch. For him to appear here now indicated that he must have been pardoned.</p><br/><p>Guru Heavencloud glared at Fang Tongtian, then began to laugh in fury. He had never imagined that the Fang Clan\u2019s Grand Elder would dare to speak to him in such a way. He was so disrespectful that it almost seemed as if he didn't care at all about Guru Heavencloud.</p><br/><p>He had practiced cultivation for ages, and in the many years after taking control of the Heavencloud Bazaar, he had had dealings with all the major sects and clans. They were always amiable, and neither he nor they ever tried to offend or antagonize each other.</p><br/><p>They always spoke very politely to him, so this was the first time he had ever heard any person from any sect or clan talk to him in such a way.</p><br/><p>As his angry laughter rang out, Guru Heavencloud seemed to struggle to control himself. He took a deep breath and then clasped hands and bowed deeply to Fang Shoudao.</p><br/><p>Gritting his teeth, he angrily said, \u201cSenior Shoudao, is this the Fang Clan\u2019s stance in this matter? You kill my disciples and steal my belongings. Do you want to force me into a corner?!?!</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Shoudao, I once again ask for you to take the lead--\u201d Before, Guru Heavencloud could even finish speaking, Fang Shoudao suddenly flicked his sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d he said, his voice booming like thunder. The entire asteroid field shook, and the Heavencloud Bazaar trembled on the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>Numerous surrounding cultivators coughed up blood, and Guru Heavencloud was shoved backward, blood spraying out of his mouth, his eyes shining with shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he had never encountered Dao Realm experts before. On the contrary, he had actually met most of them. Considering his status and cultivation base, Dao Realm cultivators usually treated him very respectfully and even kindly.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that anyone in the Dao Realm had ever disregarded him in this way.</p><br/><p>When Fang Tongtian saw Fang Shoudao\u2019s burst of anger, his eyes flickered, but he didn't say anything. However, the other Elders\u2019 faces fell, and their hearts suddenly seized with fear. That was especially true of the Elder who had rebuked Meng Hao and told him to get on his knees. That man\u2019s heart began to pound with confusion. From his perspective, Meng Hao had performed services for the clan, but even the Crown Prince, a direct bloodline descendant of the Fang Clan, would be forced to back down in the face of the interests of the clan as a whole. And yet... Fang Shoudao\u2019s attitude seemed to be the opposite of that.</p><br/><p>Fang Shoudao suddenly turned to look at the clan members responsible for maintaining the teleportation portal. \u201cLet me ask you, when Hao\u2019er sent word to us, what exactly did he tell you to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The clan members immediately began to tremble, and one of them responded, \u201cThe Crown Prince... he said... to ask the Patriarch, you sir, whether or not you wanted to change the name of the Heavencloud Bazaar to the Fang Clan Bazaar....\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Shoudao paused to think for a brief moment, then looked up and spoke, his booming words echoing out through the entire asteroid field, and even echoing out into the void beyond. \u201cThe Heavencloud Bazaar is in collusion with enemy clans! They plotted to harm the Crown Prince of the Fang Clan in order to foment civil war in Ninth Mountain and Sea. They even falsely accused our Crown Prince of robbing them, all with the intention of provoking us. This crime cannot be forgiven! Transmit orders to the entire Fang Clan. Exterminate the Heavencloud Bazaar. Leave no one alive! Henceforth, this place will be called... the Fang Clan Bazaar!\u201d</p><br/><p>Guru Heavencloud\u2019s mind spun, and his face was filled with an expression of shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Shoudao!!\u201d he cried.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

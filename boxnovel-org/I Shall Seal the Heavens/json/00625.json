Here are some of the definitions of the character itself: road, way, path, course, direction, say, talk, speak, truth, principle, and of course \u201cThe Dao\u201d of Daoism. Keep these things in mind as you read!</em></p><br/><p>His Cultivation base instantly began to rotate, and his hair rose up into the air around him. Power of Heaven and Earth came out of the Reincarnation Mountain, filled with a unique aura, to pour into Meng Hao\u2019s body. It entered through his pores, merging with him, causing his Cultivation base to spin more and more rapidly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could hear his own heartbeat. Each thump gave rise to a rumbling that filled his body. Cracking sounds could be heard as his body gradually grew taller.</p><br/><p>He became more slender, more charming, and as his hair danced around him, the Demonic air about him grew even more intense.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base was already half a step into Spirit Severing. In fact, when he entered the Eighth Anima, he could be considered true Spirit Severing; his battle with the Patriarch Huyan had thoroughly established how truly powerful he was.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to, Meng Hao could simply close his eyes for a bit and attempt his first Severing. If he succeeded, he would have a Domain.</p><br/><p>However, the matter of a Domain was far too important. Spirit Severing was a demarcation between Immortal and mortal, so that decision was not one that Meng Hao would make lightly. He needed enlightenment, from his life force, from his life in general. He needed to search for the path that led to understanding, then naturally, gain enlightenment of his own Domain. When he took that first step from being a mortal to being Immortal, that was the time for Spirit Severing!</p><br/><p>In addition to those reasons, there was another reason. Meng Hao was very stubborn when it came to his Cultivation base. He did not want to use the Eighth Anima to enter Spirit Severing. He had a Perfect Foundation, as well as a Perfect Core. As for his Nascent Souls, he had used his own methods to acquire Perfection.</p><br/><p>And yet, although merging his eight Nascent Souls into one seemed Perfect, that was not the limit!</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to form a ninth Nascent Soul!\u201d A strange light gleamed in his eyes, and the ambition within him grew even stronger. He had started upon this path in his Cultivation, so he would do everything possible to acquire the pinnacle of good fortune.</p><br/><p>Right now, his body rumbled as the power of Heaven and Earth from the Reincarnation Mountain\u2019s aura surged into his body. His Cultivation base climbed up until it reached a certain point where it couldn\u2019t go any higher. In accord with Meng Hao\u2019s will, it settled and began to form together in his dantian region.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Five Elements Nascent Souls stem from my own enlightenment. Any outside power is auxiliary!\u201d Within Meng Hao\u2019s dantian region, the power of Heaven and Earth continued to surge in, slowly transforming into a vortex.</p><br/><p>Surrounding the vortex were Meng Hao\u2019s eight astonishing Nascent Souls!</p><br/><p>\u201cWind power of the roc was gifted to me by the benefactor in the Rebirth Cave. It was hidden within my body for years, to eventually be refined into my sixth Nascent Soul!\u201d A strange light shone in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes. With every breath he took, more power of Heaven and Earth flowed into him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLighting of Heavenly Tribulation. I experienced it on multiple occasions, starting with Foundation Establishment, all the way to the Nascent Soul stage. After enough accumulated within my body, I refined it into my seventh Nascent Soul!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s insides rumbled as if with thunder, and the vortex in his dantian region spun faster and faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cFleshly Sanctification allowed me to step foot into Spirit Severing. I congealed Qi and blood to form my eighth Nascent Soul!\u201d The roaring grew more intense, causing Ke Jiusi to stare, and a strange gleam to appear in the eyes of true spirit Night.</p><br/><p>A look of disbelief could be seen on Zhixiang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I will form a ninth Nascent Soul\u2026 purely with power from the outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, if I want to make a ninth Nascent Soul purely from outside power,\u201d thought Meng Hao, \u201cwell then\u2026 what I need to first do is reach\u2026 Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, and finally, concoct them into a Nascent Soul!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s hair whipped about in chaos, as if a wild gale was sweeping by. His clothes also fluttered madly. He was now thoroughly submerged in the power of Heaven and Earth from the aura of the Reincarnation Mountain, which surged around him in a vortex.</p><br/><p>The vortex rapidly shrank, sucked in by Meng Hao. As that happened, his eyes grew increasingly radiant. Within his dantian region, a rumbling sound could be heard. The vortex was condensed to the maximum, to the level of the great circle of Qi Condensation. Then it began to form into Dao Pillars!</p><br/><p>Dao Pillars indicated Foundation Establishment!</p><br/><p>The sight of it caused Ke Jiusi to watch with even more concentration.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to form another Nascent Soul. He\u2019s cultivating\u2026 the Sublime Spirit Scripture!\u201d</p><br/><p>True spirit Night watched on silently, staring deeply at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Most shocked of all was Zhixiang. Her eyes were wide as she watched Meng Hao absorbing the spiritual energy. She couldn\u2019t help but clench her teeth, a pained expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the aura of the Reincarnation Mountain. Meng Hao\u2026 is actually using that aura to form a Nascent Soul!! If I were able to absorb the aura, it would be incredibly beneficial to my Demon Immortal Body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as desperate pain filled Zhixiang\u2019s heart, the rumbling vortex around Meng Hao completely disappeared, having been fully absorbed by him. Meng Hao was now a full head taller than he was before. An illusory aura surrounded him, making his entire person seem as if he were alternating between reality and illusion.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath, clasped hands and then bowed toward the Reincarnation Mountain.</p><br/><p>The mountain did not need bows, but Meng Hao bowed anyway, because of the kindness of the mountain.</p><br/><p>When he rose up, the Reincarnation Mountain rumbled again. Black smoke roiled out, and flames shot up into the air, filling the sky. The smoke gradually formed together into a figure.</p><br/><p>It was a man, wearing a black robe, his features unclear. However, he emanated a feeling of indescribable age that spread out in all directions.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be looking at Meng Hao. After a moment passed, a hoarse voice could be heard, filled with cold emotionlessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Withering Flame left the mountain, he wished to borrow a Demon heart from me. At that time, I asked him a question.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018What is the Dao!?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI have asked the same question of many people, and only three have given me answers worthy of remembering. One of them said that the Dao is a path. There are three thousand great Daos, and thus, three thousand paths. Different paths for different people, nothing more, nothing less. One should continue forward, regardless of whether or not there is a path beneath one\u2019s feet! The person who provided that answer\u2026 became Lord Li!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second answer was that the Dao is eternal and unchangeable. It is the only truth in Heaven and Earth. It is possible to look at it, but never touch it\u2026 to understand it, but never be able to explain it. If you understand, you understand. If you don\u2019t understand\u2026 then even spending your whole life searching will not gain you enlightenment. The person who spoke those words became Lord Ji.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third answer was provided by Withering Flame. He said that the Dao is the heart, and that the heart is obsession. His desire to eradicate the sea of bitterness was an obsession that took him over. It grew deeper and deeper. Were he to have truly eradicated the sea of bitterness, then his Dao\u2026 would be a natural law of Heaven and Earth!</p><br/><p>\u201cEternity is always here. He may have perished, but the Dao exists forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that all the rules and laws that exist in the world have their basis in the powerful experts that existed on the path, as well as the realization of their Daos!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a person\u2019s Dao is the belief that the sky must be separated into periods of night and day, then the Heavens will provide such a cycle.</p><br/><p>\u201cLife can be extinguished, but the Dao exists forever. Life\u2026 is lived in order to leave a good name throughout the ages after one dies, to cause one\u2019s Dao to remain, to transform into natural law, to be without regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of his answer, he was able to borrow one of my three third-grade Demon Hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, you must answer me. In your belief, what is the Dao? You have the time it takes one incense stick to burn, and you may not refrain from answering.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao listened to the words of the Reincarnation Mountain, his heart filled with great waves. He could identify with Lord Li\u2019s answer. As for Lord Ji\u2019s answer, it also contained truth.</p><br/><p>As for the answer given by Greater Demon Withering Flame that year, it caused Meng Hao\u2019s mind to tremble like a seething ocean. Perhaps that answer was also the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the reason that the Reincarnation Mountain can only remember these three answers, because those three answers fully explain the meaning of the character Dao  ?\u201d He stood there silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the Dao?\u201d he asked himself. A glow appeared in his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t think of an answer. He had heard many people use this character, Dao, but down to this day it only felt as if he were groping about on the edges of its meaning.</p><br/><p>Even as Meng Hao sank into thought, a second incense burner appeared from within the black smoke. The smoke churned, and the incense stick began to burn.</p><br/><p>Everything was still and quiet. The incense stick burned slowly, and time passed. However, Meng Hao still did not provide an answer. His eyes were filled with a blank look.</p><br/><p>Soon, the incense stick was reaching its end. Ninety percent had burned. Ke Jiusi sighed as he looked at Meng Hao, a look of pity in his eyes.</p><br/><p>True spirit Night was silent, but it also sighed inwardly. \u201cSo, it turns out he is not the person Lord Li is waiting for\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhixiang\u2019s heart was filled with complex emotions. She looked at Meng Hao, and then the incense stick which was almost burned out. She shook her head.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that Meng Hao\u2019s eyes began to shine brightly. The blankness from before vanished. He looked up at the Reincarnation Mountain and slowly began to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy Cultivation base won\u2019t permit me to understand what the Dao is\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo me, the Dao is very simple. It is talking, speaking, opening your mouth, and letting other people open their mouths. All of that is the Dao, speaking. Speaking the words from your heart, speaking out the thoughts you wish to express.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t require enlightenment, nor obsession. It doesn\u2019t require a path beneath your feet. Perhaps it is the first voice of all living creatures, of everything under the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen that voice can be heard, it is the Dao, it is speaking!\u201d Meng Hao had organized his thoughts and spoken out what he understood about the Dao, based upon his current realm.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if what he had said was true or correct. In fact, he hadn\u2019t wanted to speak at all, but he had no choice but to ignore those feelings. All he could do was explain what he understood about the Dao.</p><br/><p>By this time, the incense stick had burned down to the end. It flickered, on the verge of being completely extinguished. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhen that voice speaks, it represents a direction!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boundless Heavens and Earth are the final resting place of all living things. Life is like a journey, filled with various scenery, various paths.</p><br/><p>\u201cSometimes, you might think there is only one path for you. Sometimes, your heart\u2019s obsession creates a path.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the Dao, it is a direction. That direction can guide you through your life. When you are faced with countless decisions, it can lead you down the paths you must tread. In the end\u2026 it can help you pick which path to take!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is formed after one experiences the vicissitudes of life, the cleansing of time, and the understanding which comes from experiencing the world. It can be hidden in any time, place, direction, or action\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is my understanding of the Dao. It points in a direction, and gives me the strength to proceed onward. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t even exist, or perhaps it is everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for me, I am still searching for it\u2026.\u201d He lifted his head up to look at the Reincarnation Mountain.</p><br/><p>The Reincarnation Mountain was silent. Ke Jiusi was silent. True spirit Night was silent.</p><br/><p>Zhixiang was also silent.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Alex Wong, SeanL, Anonymous, Angel Ortiz, Chesly Mason, and Harvey Zhou</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

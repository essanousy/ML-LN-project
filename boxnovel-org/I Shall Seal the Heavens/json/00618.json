The spirits of the Demon Immortal Sect won\u2019t offer help, but won\u2019t resist either. Not even true spirit Night will wake up because of this. Sleeping Night is intelligent, but awakened Night has no mind. It will not awaken, because it does not wish to awaken!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the body of true spirit Night, where its brain exists. They won\u2019t be able to escape, nor flee the Demon Immortal Sect. When the ancestor\u2019s Divine Clone is fully fused with me, they will become my Demon horde!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for you, Meng Hao\u2026 you will be beneath the sacred ancestor and myself to act as Dharma protector!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d replied Meng Hao, looking coldly at Han Danzi. He performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, then pointed down at the land. At the same time, the Demonic Qi in the area began to swirl around Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Whistling sounds could be heard intermittently. Meng Hao suddenly began to perform an incantation gesture which seemed to cause everything in the area to tremble.</p><br/><p>In that instant, all of the Demonic Qi in the entire world began to rotate, as if it were being pulled. Every region began to distort, making the entire world seem as if it were being twisted.</p><br/><p>The sight of it caused Han Danzi\u2019s face to fill with a look of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you can actually affect Demonic Qi!!\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cHow can that be? You\u2019re a Cultivator, you cultivate the power of Heaven and Earth. That\u2019s different than Demonic Qi. They can\u2019t be mixed! How can you manipulate Demonic Qi!?!?\u201d He was thoroughly shaken, as this was his first time ever seeing Demonic Qi being manipulated by a Cultivator.</p><br/><p>As far as he was concerned, it was inconceivable and unbelievable. Most importantly, it was clear that Meng Hao\u2019s manipulation of the Demonic Qi was real, and not an illusion. It was in complete contrast to himself. Whereas his apparent manipulation of Demonic Qi was actually trickery, Meng Hao really was stirring all of the Demonic Qi in the entire world.</p><br/><p>Even as Han Danzi was feeling shaken, Meng Hao took a deep breath. He could sense a resonance between himself and this world. In the outside world, he was incapable of absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth. However, in this place, it was as if a hole had been opened up, and all the Demonic Qi was rushing into it without the slightest impediment.</p><br/><p>And yet, it didn\u2019t cause any transformations within him whatsoever. Inside of him, it turned into pure power. It was not Demonic Qi, nor was it spiritual energy. It was a unique power that belonged only to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>That power circulated about within him, filling him with an indescribably pleasurable sensation. A bizarre light shone in his eyes as he looked down at Han Danzi and the giant head floating there in mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Sealing, Eighth Hex!\u201d said Meng Hao slowly. It almost sounded as if he were issuing orders. The words echoed about like the peals of thunder.</p><br/><p>Four words exploded like thunder. Four words\u2026 spoken by Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>As the words sounded out like thunder, all of the Demonic Qi around Meng Hao began to coalesce together. In the blink of an eye, the enormous character for \u2018seal\u2019 appeared directly in front of him.</p><br/><p>The character was fully three hundred meters tall, and it absorbed more and more Demonic Qi as it shot down toward the ground.</p><br/><p>In this moment, within the Eighth Anima, Meng Hao was\u2026 the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer!</p><br/><p>The speed with which the character moved was indescribable. Han Danzi\u2019s face filled with disbelief as he felt an unprecedented pressure weighing down on him, along with a sense of deadly crisis. All of a sudden, he realized that Meng Hao was his archenemy.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps it could be said that he was the archenemy of all Greater Demons!</p><br/><p>Han Danzi began to pant, and suddenly, he recalled a legend.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to legend, within the Nine Mountains and Seas, there are a people who can cultivate the Dao and can also fuse with Demons. No type of expulsion is effective on them. They call themselves\u2026 Demon Sealers!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe character \u2018seal\u2019 has two meanings. One is to restrict, the other is to aid!\u201d [1. In Chinese, the character  can mean to \u2018seal\u2019 in the sense of sealing an envelope. It can also mean to \u2018cover\u2019 or \u2018bestow.\u2019 In Meng Hao\u2019s Art of Righteous Bestowal, the \u2018bestow\u2019 word is this same character] Han Danzi\u2019s mind trembled as the \u2018seal\u2019 character formed of Demonic Qi descended. All of the Demonic Qi seemed to be affected, making it so that Han Danzi was incapable of dodging or evading. He could only try to fight back directly.</p><br/><p>A huge boom lifted up into the sky. Blood sprayed from Han Danzi\u2019s mouth as, in the blink of an eye, he was surrounded by glowing hex light. From a distance, the hex light looked liked strands of silk, binding up Han Danzi.</p><br/><p>It sealed his life force, sealed his Cultivation base, sealed all of him. It sealed him, and it sealed the enormous head.</p><br/><p>Shockingly, the light of the Eighth Hex also thoroughly enveloped the enormous head. From a distance, it looked as if there were some enormous net covering over it.</p><br/><p>The giant net was fused with the ground in the area, and pulled down viciously. Blood oozed out of Han Danzi\u2019s mouth, and he trembled. Unable to control his body, he kneeled down onto the ground, his expression vicious. It sounded like he wanted to roar with rage, but was incapable of making a single sound come out of his throat.</p><br/><p>Beneath the power of the Eighth Hex\u2019s giant net, the head slowly stopped emerging out. In fact, it began to show signs of sinking back. Meng Hao hovered in mid-air, trembling slightly, his finger still pointing down at the ground. From the time he became a Demon Sealer until now, this was his first time\u2026 truly sealing a Demon.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Qi in the area continued to rush toward him. He alone had shaken the world and used its power to push down a Demon.</p><br/><p>Han Danzi was pushed down closer toward the ground, his face pale, his eyes filled with frenzy and an unyielding look. The giant head sank back, and soon, half of its mouth was back in the other world.</p><br/><p>However it was then that\u2026 the Greater Demon in the world of the mirror suddenly looked up. Its gaze seemed to pierce out from the mirror into the outside world.</p><br/><p>A strange look appeared in its eyes, and its mouth twisted into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cTAI!\u201d it said. As the bizarre word echoed out, a change occurred to the giant head emerging from within the mirror world. The aura of death which had previously swirled around it, suddenly seemed to fill with the power of life. Although it did not open its eyes, it did open its mouth.</p><br/><p>The voice which emerged was the exact same voice which had been heard moments ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cTAI!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound turned into an attack which spread out in all directions, sweeping over everything. Heaven and Earth filled with roaring, and countless fissures spread out everywhere. The net of the Eighth Hex that covered the head began to shatter into small pieces. In the blink of an eye, it was destroyed and dissipated.</p><br/><p>The Eight Hex which suppressed Han Danzi was also swept away, completely destroyed!</p><br/><p>The Demonic Qi in the world began to roar like exploding thunder. Up in mid-air, Meng Hao coughed up a mouthful of blood and his face went white. He staggered back several paces.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a Demon Sealer!!\u201d said Han Danzi. A strange light appeared in his eyes, and he lifted his head back to laugh, then shot up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares about Demon Sealers!? I\u2019ll kill you, take your blood, absorb your soul, and make a Demon Sealing precious treasure!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the will of Heaven!\u201d Han Danzi seemed overjoyed as he shot up into the air. Demonic Qi surged toward Meng Hao, and at the same time, the head began to emerge again. All of a sudden, a neck and two shoulders could be seen!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe will of Heaven, huh?\u201d said Meng Hao, stabilizing himself. He looked coldly at approaching Han Danzi, and the gigantic Greater Demon that he apparently couldn\u2019t prevent from emerging. \u201cThere was no enmity between us. Neither you absorbing the power of that Demon, nor the prospect of bringing it back to life, have anything to do with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I want isn\u2019t you or that Demon, but rather\u2026 this entire place!\u201d A bizarre light shone in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes. The current situation now fit in perfectly with his requirements. There was nobody left, so he felt confident enough to\u2026 take out the copper mirror!</p><br/><p>Even as Han Danzi closed in, Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding with his right hand. Instantly, the copper mirror appeared, the same mysterious copper mirror that he had acquired back in the Reliance Sect all those years ago, which had accompanied him all this time!</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t look like anything special at all, and was even a bit rusted in places. It looked like a completely ordinary item.</p><br/><p>\u201cA crappy mirror?\u201d laughed Han Danzi. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that\u2019s supposed to be some kind of precious treasure or something?!\u201d He stopped in place, looking as if he didn\u2019t care at all about Meng Hao and his mirror. However, inwardly, the fact that Meng Hao had retrieved this magical item in a critical moment left him worried in a way that was quite the opposite to the way he made it look.</p><br/><p>As soon as the copper mirror appeared, the mirror continent below suddenly trembled. Ripples spread out, looking almost like waves on the surface of the mirror-like continent.</p><br/><p>Within the world of the mirror, everything that was alive suddenly stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Even the head which was emerging from inside stopped in place. However\u2026 it was in this moment that the eyes began to twitch, as if they were struggling to open and awake.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that!?\u201d gasped Han Danzi. He was just going to attempt to stop Meng Hao when Meng Hao pointed the mirror directly down toward the mirror continent.</p><br/><p>The two mirrors shone on each other, and anyone who could see them would be able to spot an majestic black hole inside each one. Each black hole seemed endless, as if it contained truths inside that no one would ever be able to understand.</p><br/><p>The great mirror land below began to rumble and shake. The ripples continued to spread out, thicker and more numerous. At the same time, the mirror Meng Hao held began to grow warm, as if it were thirsting for something, as if it\u2026 wanted to consume the entire mirror continent below</p><br/><p>It was then that the mirror continent, which Meng Hao could not even see the ends of, suddenly began to shrink. It grew smaller rapidly, accompanied by a roaring sound that lifted up into the sky.</p><br/><p>It shrank and shrank, and if you were able to stand in a position far far above, you would see that the lands below\u2026 shockingly, were actually shaped like a mirror! And as of this moment, the mirror\u2026 was shrinking down at a rapid rate.</p><br/><p>As the mirror continent shrank, it was possible to see that the shape of the mirror was\u2026 absolutely identical to the copper mirror that Meng Hao held.</p><br/><p>Han Danzi\u2019s face fell. Even as he was about to charge at Meng Hao, his body began to be pulled back by the great mirror continent. His body was out of his own control, and he was incapable of nearing Meng Hao. Instead, a gravitational force pulled him down toward the lands below.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the eyes of the Greater Demon head that was emerging from the mirror land suddenly\u2026 cracked open. An indistinct, growling voice echoed out, filled with ancientness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 actually have\u2026 the Mountain and Sea Mirror\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by David Mah and Anonymous</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

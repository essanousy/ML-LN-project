Then, he lowered his hands and pointed his finger at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The flying swords began to vibrate loudly, the sound of which merged together into a shocking sound wave that sent everything shaking as the swords... shot directly toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>It almost looked as if the entire sky was nothing but flying swords. Unending swords and sword light poured down onto Meng Hao as if to slice him to bits!!</p><br/><p>A sense of crisis loomed within Meng Hao, but that was no surprise. In fact, it caused the desire for battle to grow more intense within his eyes. He wanted to fight, to fight someone extremely powerful, to fight many powerful people! That was how he would transform himself.</p><br/><p>Almost in the same moment that the hundreds of millions of flying swords bore down on him, azure light sprang up around Meng Hao, which then turned black. He vanished, and when he reappeared, he was an enormous black roc!</p><br/><p>The roc rapidly grew larger. 300 meters. 3,000 meters. 30,000 meters. In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao was a huge black roc over 30,000 meters long. Then, a piercing cry could be heard as all of the feathers shot off of his body and swirled out into the air. Although there weren't hundreds of millions of them, there were at least a million!</p><br/><p>A million feathers spun in the air, becoming a tempest that spread out to meet the hundreds of millions of flying swords.</p><br/><p>When they clashed, the resulting boom cracked the sky and shattered the land. The roc feathers were like rowboats on a stormy sea, battered relentlessly by the flying swords.</p><br/><p>However, even as the tempest of feathers was whittled away, Meng Hao let out a powerful roar, sending some of his life force aura into the feathers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMourning-Death, Divine Augmentation!\u201d This was a divine ability he had gained from Shui Dongliu when absorbing his good fortune. [1. As a brief reminder, half of Shui Dongliu was a Mourning-Death soul, a type of being that comes from Beseech the Devil]</p><br/><p>It was not the type of divine ability that would unleash a deadly attack. Instead, it allowed him to split his divine sense into a million portions, each of which entered one of the feathers.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, each one of the million feathers trembled and then suddenly expanded. Roc heads sprouted out, and then... they transformed into huge rocs!!</p><br/><p>Each and every feather transformed, filling the sky with a million huge rocs. The previous tempest increased in size by a thousand-fold, completely blotting out the sky!</p><br/><p>The hundreds of millions of flying swords rumbled as they slammed into the rocs. The Heavens shook as the swords and the rocs began to fight a majestic battle!</p><br/><p>It was difficult to put into words how shocking this display of divine abilities was!</p><br/><p>The flying swords had the advantage of numbers by far, but the incredible power of the rocs ensured that it took hundreds of flying swords to take down just one!</p><br/><p>Massive rumbling booms filled the sky, as though a war were being fought. Even as the destruction was carried out, Meng Hao suddenly appeared, blood oozing out of various wounds, but a vicious expression covering his face. He suddenly lifted his hand up, and a painting appeared!</p><br/><p>It was none other than the painting he had created when he sealed the Sixth Paragon. Without the slightest hesitation, Meng Hao ripped that painting in half!</p><br/><p>What appeared as a result was not the Sixth Paragon, but rather, his life force, his cultivation base, his Essences, and his soul. Everything that was the Sixth Paragon flew out and was absorbed by the numerous rocs, unexpectedly\u2026 massive booms rang out, and the world quaked. The group from the Vast Expanse School all gasped; this was the loudest noise which had echoed out since the fighting had begun. The rocs collapsed, and the hundreds of millions of flying swords all shattered!</p><br/><p>At the same time, a massive shockwave blasted out, sweeping across all creation.</p><br/><p>The shockwave shoved Meng Hao backward, coughing up blood, his face pale. However, his eyes were brighter than ever as he stared at Jin Yunshan, who had an unsightly expression on his face as blood seeped out of the corners of his mouth!</p><br/><p>Jin Yunshan was completely and utterly shaken. Although he had known all along that Meng Hao\u2019s battle prowess was incredible, he had never imagined that he would be this strong, or that he would be able to put up such a good fight.</p><br/><p>After all, Jin Yunshan was not just in the peak of the 9-Essences level, he was at the great circle, which meant that his cultivation base and battle prowess were such that he could crush all other 9-Essences cultivators!</p><br/><p>Not only was he shaken, everyone from the Vast Expanse School was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this going to be the induction of a new sage...? There are only four peak 9-Essences experts on Planet Vast Expanse, and yet the Ninth Paragon is actually fighting back against Jin Yunshan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand up to that Exalted Celestial Magic, the hundreds of millions of swords....\u201d Even as everyone was reeling in astonishment, Jin Yunshan threw his head back and laughed.</p><br/><p>The laughter was icy and vicious, and filled with intense killing intent, which became a sinister, murderous aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cThroughout all these years, you are the first person who is not in the peak of the 9-Essences level to force me to use my second divine ability. Meng Hao... you can die with a smile on your face.\u201d Golden light began to shine from Jin Yunshan\u2019s eyes. He threw his hands into the air, causing a terrifying, indescribable power to radiate out of him.</p><br/><p>The crushing power contained a horrifying aura, and if you looked closely, you would see that he was sending all of his cultivation base power into his hands!</p><br/><p>His hand were gradually turning golden, as if they weren\u2019t the hands of a cultivator, but were actually made from pure gold!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis divine ability is something I picked up years ago from the Immortal God Continent. It's called... Heaven Ripping!\u201d With that, he extended his hands toward Meng Hao and made a ripping gesture! [2. Heaven Ripping is an ability Wang Lin used in Renegade Immortal. There was even an entire chapter with the exact same title as this chapter]</p><br/><p>Rumbling echoed out, and the Heavens shook. Meng Hao\u2019s pupils constricted. As Jin Yunshan\u2019s hand pulled apart, Meng Hao felt as if he were suddenly locked in place, fused with the air.</p><br/><p>And then, intense pain exploded out within him. Rumbling filled the air as a huge rift were tearing open, starting from above Meng Hao and stretching down. Apparently, a power capable of ripping open the starry sky was now trying to rip open Meng Hao!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When the power ripples out, nothing remains unwithered!</p><br/><p>\u201cMost intriguing of all is that every sword flower contains thousands of variations. When the ten lotuses turn into the massive formation, the variations increase exponentially. There must be tens of thousands of variations hidden within!</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a large formation requires a shocking level of Divine Sense to control. All of that, however\u2026 is merely secondary. Most importantly, the formation requires both a physical form and an internal spirit. His Lotus Sword Formation has both of those things!\u201d Saint Sun Soul\u2019s mind trembled. He already had a high opinion of Meng Hao, but now, he couldn\u2019t stop his pupils from constricting as he realized that he actually had underestimated him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it turns out that he was actually only using a portion of his power in our initial fight. If he used this sword formation, then even I\u2026 would have a hard time extricating myself from it!</p><br/><p>\u201cTime Cultivators are inherently rare, but he is even more shocking than I expected. And then there\u2019s that flagon of alcohol\u2026. I think there\u2019s an eighty percent likelihood it really is from his hometown. The only problem is that I don\u2019t know where exactly that is!\u201d Having personally witnessed the power of Meng Hao\u2019s sword formation, Saint Sun Soul was inwardly shaken. Currently, hundreds of thousands of Sea Demons were now rushing toward them.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the sea was completely thrown into chaos. Roaring sounds echoed out as Meng Hao\u2019s sword formation rotated at an incredible speed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was mentally calculating how many Demon hearts were building up with each Sea Demon he killed. Seeing Saint Sun Soul standing there in a daze, he couldn\u2019t help but get annoyed. \u201cHey, swindler! If you don\u2019t make a move soon then I won\u2019t even give you a thirty percent discount!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul gave a snort and then waved his right hand. Instantly, 100,000 magical symbols flew out from his sleeve, swirling around to form into ten magical symbol beasts. They roared as they charged into the surrounding Sea Demons and began to slaughter them.</p><br/><p>Now that Meng Hao and Saint Sun Soul were working together, the speed of the massacre increased rapidly. Without the stimulus provided by the Resurrection Lily, it would be impossible to kill so many Sea Demons in the Third Ring. Right now, the Sea Demons seemed to have lost any ability to reason and were filled with madness.</p><br/><p>Blood dyed the sea red as the slaughter continued for approximately an hour, when suddenly four earth-shattering roars echoed out from the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>It was at that point when, shockingly, four enormous Sea Demons with Whitebone Lilies on them approached, one from each direction.</p><br/><p>One of the four Sea Demons was a huge jellyfish. Of the other three, one was a gigantic violet sea turtle, and the other two were sea dragons that looked completely identical.</p><br/><p>As they neared, huge waves rolled out across the sea as the aura of Spirit Severing rippled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo for each of us, huh?\u201d Meng Hao said as quickly as he could. \u201cYou want to have a little competition to see who can kill them faster? If I win, the discount will be ten percent. If you win, I\u2019d be willing to set it at forty percent. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul blinked. He had never met someone so shameless. After directly refusing Meng Hao\u2019s offer, he waved his sleeve, causing two illusory, glowing swords to appear in front of him. They scraped against each other, causing ghost images to appear. Hundreds of swords turned into a sword rain that shot toward the two sea dragons.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Saint Sun Soul couldn\u2019t be easily fooled, Meng Hao said nothing more. He turned back around and then performed an incantation gesture with his right hand. Immediately, five Time Sword tips flew out, shooting with incredible speed toward the gigantic violet sea turtle. At the same time, the Time Sword Formation vanished and then reappeared, surrounding the jellyfish.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was located in the middle of the two formations, surrounded by a tempest of 10,000 magical symbols.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack!\u201d he growled. Instantly\u2026 the five Time Sword tips circulating around the gigantic sea turtle began to rotate and emit a shocking power of Time. The gigantic sea turtle howled, and the Whitebone Lily on its back began to sway. It was about to rush forward, but when the aura of Time power entered it, it shuddered, and then a look of astonishment appeared on its face. Without any hesitation, it retracted its head into its shell to defend itself.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, nothing can remain unwithered under the power of Time!</p><br/><p>Five sword tips emanated a power of Time exceeding 100,000 years. As the power circulated out, the body of the giant sea turtle rapidly withered. A bloodcurdling shriek could be heard, then a boom. A giant sea turtle which possessed the power of Spirit Severing was instantly turned into nothing but ash and smoke\u2026.</p><br/><p>The speed and savagery of the kill caused even Meng Hao to suddenly focus in concentration. His eyes gleamed with a brilliant light.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Spirit Stones were not spent in vain!\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the jellyfish was trapped in the Lotus Sword Formation. It struggled, but its body was beginning to wither. After the space of about ten breaths, a bang could be heard as the sword formation transformed it into nothing more than ash drifting about in the seawater.</p><br/><p>By this point, Saint Sun Soul had only managed to kill one of the sea dragons. He jerked his head to look over his shoulder and saw the impressive power of Meng Hao\u2019s Time treasures. His pupils constricted, and suddenly he found Meng Hao to be even more profoundly enigmatic.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Several hours later, they were still surrounded by densely packed groups of Sea Demons, who charged at them one after another. The seawater was stained red. Even Saint Sun Soul was shocked at the level of carnage.</p><br/><p>However, as they continued to kill and kill, his excitement only grew greater. He even summoned the three swords of Seahold; wherever they passed, they left nothing but death in their wake.</p><br/><p>In the end, Meng Hao actually didn\u2019t need to do anything. He just stood there, maintaining the circulation of the sword formation and the magical symbols. Saint Sun Soul was in a frenzy as he slaughtered the Sea Demons. It was almost like he had turned into a different person, flying back and forth and crying out at the top of his lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIIIIEEEE!!!!\u201d he shouted, laughing the entire time. Despite being under the water, his Cultivation base caused his muffled laughter to fill the entire area.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at blood-soaked Saint Soul Sun and thought. \u201cIn the future, I definitely shouldn\u2019t provoke this guy\u2026.\u201d The man\u2019s formerly somber face was twisted ferociously, and his previous taciturn personality was now deranged with madness as he continued rant and rave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone crazy\u2026.\u201d thought Meng Hao, blinking. \u201cCould it be that the little swindler has just repressed himself for too long?\u201d The more he watched, the more he got the impression that Saint Sun Soul really was a bit crazy.</p><br/><p>At some point the parrot appeared and perched on Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder. Its eyes went wide when it saw the slaughter being carried out by Saint Sun Soul. \u201cHe really has gone crazy\u2026.\u201d it said.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly was off to the side, nodding vigorously. \u201cDon\u2019t offend that lunatic, Meng Hao. I\u2019ve seen people like him before, and they\u2019re all psychos!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out there collecting the Demon hearts!?\u201d snapped Meng Hao. The parrot and the meat jelly, eyes glittering, immediately flew out and began to make their way back and forth across the seafloor to pick up the Demon hearts.</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul saw this, but didn\u2019t pay any heed. At the moment, he was happy to be killing things.</p><br/><p>More time passed. Saint Sun Soul was thoroughly engrossed in the slaughter. He even employed a multitude of magical items, causing the sounds of explosions to fill the air. As for Meng Hao, he was even more idle than before. He finally just sat down cross-legged inside the spell formation and closed his eyes to meditate, focusing on fusing the three portions of Cultivation base power within him.</p><br/><p>Time passed by. The slaughtering continued for four more hours. Saint Sun Soul\u2019s voice was getting hoarse, and yet his desire to kill had not lessened, but rather, had increased.</p><br/><p>After a while, Meng Hao opened his eyes. The seawater that surrounded them was now thoroughly red. After glancing at Saint Sun Soul, he closed his eyes again.</p><br/><p>After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, a tremor ran through him. He suddenly stood up and turned his head to look at the seafloor off in the distance. A feeling of imminent disaster suddenly washed over him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Resurrection Lily sprang into action, and a feeling of excitement radiated out from it, as if it desired to burst out from inside. Such an omen filled Meng Hao\u2019s mind with a roaring sound. He suddenly strode forward toward Saint Sun Soul and then waved his hand, causing the war chariot to appear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is fun!\u201d laughed Saint Sun Soul, his eyes completely bloodshot.</p><br/><p>\u201cFun my ass,\u201d Meng Hao immediately growled in exasperation. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d With that, he reached out to grab Saint Sun Soul. Saint Sun Soul\u2019s eyes went wide, but he did nothing to stop Meng Hao, allowing himself to be pulled onto the war chariot.</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>The war chariot shot out, smashing into countless Sea Demons. After it broke through them and charged towards the water\u2019s surface, a sinister aura rose up from deep within the sea that caused Saint Sun Soul to feel incredibly cold.</p><br/><p>A faint voice could suddenly be heard within the cold and sinister aura. \u201cMy son\u2026. come back\u2026 come back\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the voice echoed out, a huge tentacle shot out from the depths of the sea, like an enormous black shadow. In the blink of an eye, it was upon them.</p><br/><p>It moved with such incredible speed that it seemed to be on the verge of wrapping around Meng Hao\u2019s war chariot. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes instantly went bloodshot. As fast as possible, he circulated the little bit that remained of the Qi of Immortal Shows the Way.</p><br/><p>The power of the Qi caused Saint Sun Soul\u2019s eyes to go wide. Then he looked back at the enormous tentacle, and his scalp went numb. However, at the same time, an even stronger desire to go to battle welled up within him.</p><br/><p>He waved his right hand, causing the three swords that circulated around him to shoot toward the tentacle.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked up, and his eyes flickered with killing intent. He also waved his right hand, causing five Time Sword tips and the one hundred sword Lotus Sword Formation to appear and follow the three swords.</p><br/><p>A huge boom could be heard. Blood sprayed from the mouths of both Saint Sun Soul and Meng Hao. However, the combined power of the two, and their shocking magical items, caused the tentacle to suddenly pause.</p><br/><p>Even in the instant in which they called back their magical items, the war chariot started to move. It shot out of the ocean at incredible speed, and then vanished.</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Lily branch exploded out from the red seawater, but then slowly descended back down. Red waves spread out for a while, but then the water grew calm again.</p><br/><p>Far away, closer to Seahold, a swishing sound could be heard as the war chariot suddenly appeared. Meng Hao\u2019s face was pale, as was Saint Sun Soul. The two of them exchanged a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, what the hell was that?!\u201d said Saint Sun Soul through clenched teeth. \u201cAnd how did you manage to attract its attention? You\u2019re simply too adept at causing trouble. First there\u2019s the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, and now that damned thing!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t hesitate at all in responding, \u201cI seem to remember you saying something about you controlling everything in the Third Ring. If you don\u2019t know what it is, then how do you expect me to know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two snorted and then stared at each other angrily. For a moment, neither spoke.</p><br/><p>Finally, Saint Sun Soul said, \u201cHow many Demon hearts did we get?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao did some calculations, and then his eyes began to shine. \u201cAbout twice as many as last time,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>When Saint Sun Soul heard this, he instantly smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Seahold and rest for a few days, then we\u2019ll do it again, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Kevin Ram Mayo, Jules Wada, and XYY</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

He worked hard to make himself sound as antagonistic as possible.</p><br/><p>In a rage, the meat jelly instantly transformed into a shining, golden bag of holding. It was transparent, and within could be seen a square cauldron as well as four circulating demonic swords. The four swords revolved around the cauldron, and at a single glance, it was obvious that it was a precious treasure.</p><br/><p>Even more realistic was how the cauldron and four swords seemed to be trying to push their way out of the bag of holding, as if they wanted to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what do you think\u2026?\u201d The voice of the meat jelly emanated out from the bag of holding.</p><br/><p>Inside, he was surprised, but on the outside, a look of disdain covered his face. \u201cThere\u2019s no glow!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a rustling sound, and even as the words left his mouth, the bag of holding began to emit a blinding glow which shot up into the sky. The golden light shined up, instantly catching the attention of the eight Cultivators. Immediately, they flew in Meng Hao\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe me n\u2026.?\u201d came the voice of the meat jelly from within the bag of holding. Before it could finish speaking, Meng Hao grabbed the bag of holding and threw it toward the approaching Cultivators.</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve your granny!!\u201d Meng Hao had been raised not to curse, but in this case he couldn\u2019t help it. He shot away from the meat jelly as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>He had thrown the glowing, golden bag of holding away from himself with all the power he could muster from his Cultivation base. As it neared the approaching eight Cultivators, they stared open-mouthed. They all had slightly different expressions. Some were suspicious, some were cautious, some even looked pleasantly surprised. However, each and every one reached out with outstretched arms to snatch the bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou tricked me! That pisses me off!\u201d sounded out the voice of the meat jelly. Just when it was about to be grabbed by one of the Cultivators, it vanished. Then it reappeared off in the distance, directly on Meng Hao\u2019s head. It once again transformed into a green hat.</p><br/><p>As if that didn\u2019t satisfy it, popping sounds rang out as one hat after another piled up on his head, over and over again, high up into the air\u2026.</p><br/><p>Soon, the stack of hats was taller than Meng Hao\u2019s entire person. The eight Cultivators looked on, completely dumbfounded. They had never seen something like this in their entire lives.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face grew even more unsightly. He felt like he was about to go nuts. If the meat jelly took this shape, then he would be the center of attention no matter where he went\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist with the green hats,\u201d said one of the Cultivators coldly, a middle-aged man with a frown. \u201cThis is Blood Demon Sect territory. Outsiders are not welcome. Even less welcome are people who come here to make fools of us. Take your green hat and get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had just been about to leave when the words reached his ears. He suddenly stopped, turning to look at the eight Cultivators. His eyes shone fiercely. At the moment, he was in a horrific mood, and these words did not please him whatsoever.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still dare to turn your head back?\u201d said the middle-aged Cultivator with a cold laugh. \u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t you leave your eyes with me after you leave. With those green hats, you\u2019ll be a laughingstock anyway.\u201d With that, he and his companions shot toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off!\u201d said Meng Hao, suddenly lifting his hand and waving his sleeve toward them. The power of his Cultivation base exploded out. A massive wind screamed out and then slammed into them.</p><br/><p>A booming filled the air, and blood sprayed from the mouths of the eight patrolling Blood Demon Sect disciples. Their bodies trembled. A look of disbelief covered the face of the man who had taunted Meng Hao, and his pupils constricted. From what he could see, Meng Hao was at the mid Foundation Establishment stage, but his attack just now had been filled with the might like that of the late Foundation Establishment stage. Blood oozed out of his mouth as he skidded backward in retreat. When he saw the cold look in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes, his heart shook.</p><br/><p>Realizing he had been rash, the middle-aged Cultivator said, \u201cFellow Daoist, this\u2026.\u201d Even as he began to speak, however, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes shone with even more ferocious iciness.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s face fell. He and his companions turned into beams of prismatic light that shot away into the distance. When they were far away from Meng Hao, they finally came to a stop and exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy is just too aggressive. Where did he come from? Elder Brother, let\u2019s report him to Master. Master will surely dispatch some people to apprehend him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. Elder Brother, this is Blood Demon Sect territory. Can we really allow that guy to just run amok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d growled the middle-aged man, his face dark and unreadable. \u201cHe\u2019s young, and with just a single sweep of his hand, look at what he did to us. Do you really think he\u2019s just some random person? He\u2019s obviously not a Cultivator of the Solitary Sword Sect. With war brewing between our Sect and the Solitary Sword Sect, we can\u2019t afford to provoke the wrath of additional Sects! He\u2019s obviously just passing through and doesn\u2019t want to make enemies, that\u2019s why he went easy on us. All of you, shut your mouths. Forget about what happened here. There will always be friction among Cultivators like us. There\u2019s no need to report some trifling incident like this to the Sect.\u201d Having made his decision, he continued on into the distance, his fellow Cultivators in tow.</p><br/><p>After they were some ways away, the vines on the ground beneath them that they hadn\u2019t noticed this entire time, burrowed into the earth and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Back in Meng Hao\u2019s location, Meng Hao stamped his foot onto the ground. The soil seethed as the dark red vines emerged to sway back and forth in front of him. Moments later, they transformed into a small, dark red fruit, which he placed into his bag of holding. Finally, he turned his attention to the hat on his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that! It\u2019s wrong. If you let them go, you should trust them completely. You can\u2019t secretly dispatch something to follow them. That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s immoral. Eee? I just remembered something. You cussed at me just now!!</p><br/><p>\u201cCussing is wrong. It\u2019s immoral. My granny never did anything to offend you. Why did you have to bring her up? It\u2019s very strange. What relationship do you have with her? Unless\u2026\u201d Suddenly, the meat jelly\u2019s pedantic voice filled with a strange tone. \u201cUnless the two of you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao ignored it. He slapped his bag of holding to produce a set of clothing. He ripped off some strips of fabric and stuffed them into his ears. Immediately, the meat jelly\u2019s voice became quieter. But then, the meat jelly gave a dry cough. It started to talk, and this time, its voice could be heard directly inside of Meng Hao\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was somewhat haggard. He stared off into nothing for a while, then finally sighed and tossed the strips of cloth away.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I know why people call you Ultimate Vexation,\u201d he said. Immediately, the meat jelly began to tremble with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Why?! This name was given to me a very, very, very long time ago by an old friend. I asked him about it many times, but he would never tell me what it means.\u201d The meat jelly\u2019s full and undivided attention was now focused on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he pondered why the person who named the meat jelly wouldn\u2019t explain the meaning of the name. Then he thought of the meat jelly\u2019s long-windedness, and he shivered. He understood. By providing an answer regarding the name, it would give the meat jelly a conversation topic that would certainly last for months.</p><br/><p>The thought of that made his scalp go numb. Anyone who had no experience dealing with the meat jelly couldn\u2019t comprehend the nature of the torment it brought. He decided to change the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith you looking like this, we really can\u2019t proceed onward,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cIs there any way you can take some form other than a pile of hats?\u201d He was careful in his wording, fearful of agitating the thing. He could only imagine what it would look like if it decided to become a mountain of green hats perched on top of his head. What would happen then?</p><br/><p>His tone was non-argumentative, but inside, his heart was filled with helplessness. He thought of the Blood Mastiff, and suddenly missed it terribly. Unfortunately, it was sleeping now.</p><br/><p>Actually, Meng Hao\u2019s words seemed to excite the meat jelly. \u201cEee? If I\u2019m not a hat, then what shape should I take?\u201d Meng Hao was used to this, so he didn\u2019t say anything at first. He sat cross-legged within the mountain forest and retrieved the Time-refining jade page. He cast his Spiritual Sense into it and began to study the contents.</p><br/><p>Some time passed, and then Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered. He began to mutter to himself. \u201cTime of Spring and Autumn requires a Spring tree and the frost of Autumn. The fire of mid-Winter, the spirit of Summer. Refine the four seasons, fuse with the Cultivation base. Refine the four seasons again to produce a small sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sword must be carefully nurtured. With enlightenment of Time, the veins of a hundred years can fill the sword. After the hundred years, a thousand years will pass, and it will take shape. In ten thousand years, it will appear to shake heaven and earth, the first Sword of Time.\u201d Meng Hao frowned as he gazed at the jade page. The sword contained no small might, but the time involved in its creation seemed too vast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Bei is really focused on this sword, so it can\u2019t really take that much time, can it\u2026? There must be other methods that can be used to speed up the appearance of the sword.\u201d Lost in thought, Meng Hao thought to the third jade page that the meat jelly had swallowed, as well as the first jade page, which had been sucked back into the circular cauldron.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe answer must be on the third page. Too bad this damned meat jelly ate it.\u201d Meng Hao lifted his head and looked at the meat jelly. About an hour had passed since he began studying the Time refining information. Of course, the meat jelly had been talking the entire time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I change into? What do I change into? What do I change into?\u201d It had flown off of Meng Hao\u2019s head and was now hopping back and forth in front of him. It looked very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you change into that jade page you swallowed?\u201d Meng Hao said suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Ok\u2026\u201d It agreed, and then immediately changed its mind. \u201cEee? Wait a second. What are you trying to pull? No way! It's mine. You\u2019re not getting your hands on it.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

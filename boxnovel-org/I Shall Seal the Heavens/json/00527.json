He really did look like a bug.</p><br/><p>But who would care about that!?</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao\u2019s fist struck the finger, an enormous boom shook the Heavens and the Violet Sea. Giant waves rolled out across the surface of the waters. Of course, only Meng Hao was there to see it; if anyone else did, it would probably be the most shocking thing they would ever see in their life.</p><br/><p>As the explosive bang rang out, blood sprayed from Meng Hao\u2019s mouth. Although he was sent shooting backward, his laughter continued to echo in the area.</p><br/><p>As he laughed, he looked up at the seven-colored finger and watched as it collapsed into countless pieces. A seven-colored lake of lightning was formed, composed of endless seven-colored arcs of electricity. Many of them bored into Meng Hao\u2019s body. Even as Meng Hao laughed, the Tribulation lightning\u2026</p><br/><p>Was completely destroyed!</p><br/><p>Amidst the lingering echo, the Tribulation clouds up above were thinning, and seemed to be on the verge of dissipating. Apparently, this Heavenly Tribulation was quite simple for Meng Hao to overcome.</p><br/><p>In truth, it was not. It was actually much more intense than the previous Tribulations. However, Meng Hao\u2019s feeling regarding it\u2026 was influenced by the fact that his more than one hundred years of secluded meditation ended with him rising to what was virtually the peak of the mortal realm in South Heaven!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wiped the blood from his mouth. In the Sixth Anima, he was at his strongest. He hovered for a moment in mid-air and then once again kicked down with his foot. A bang could be heard as he flew up toward the dissipating Tribulation clouds.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao knew that when the Tribulation clouds were spreading out like this, their destructive power was actually growing stronger. They seemed to be dissipating but actually\u2026. if he wasn\u2019t careful, he would surely perish.</p><br/><p>In the moment in which Meng Hao charged in attack, a roaring sound suddenly could be heard from the thin Tribulation clouds. Suddenly, all the clouds rapidly contracted to form\u2026 a shocking, enormous fist!</p><br/><p>The fist was formed completely of Tribulation clouds, within which swirled innumerable lightning bolts. Seven colors swirled about. This was no longer just lightning\u2026 it was the direct power of Tribulation clouds!!</p><br/><p>All the Tribulation clouds had formed together into a Heavenly Tribulation, here to exterminate everything in existence.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao rocketed through mid air, looking at the seething Tribulation clouds that had formed into an enormous fist. He could clearly sense the complete will of destruction therein.</p><br/><p>His eyes glowed brightly as his left hand suddenly gestured down toward the sea beneath him.</p><br/><p>\u201cViolet Sea!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Violet Sea was him, and he was the Violet Sea!</p><br/><p>Even as the words left his mouth, the entirety of the Violet Sea that was the Western Desert Apocalypse suddenly began to move. A huge vortex spun, causing massive waves to surge across the surface of the waters.</p><br/><p>In the center of the vortex, which was directly beneath Meng Hao, a gigantic column of water suddenly rose up. It was thousands of meters wide and surrounded Meng Hao, making him its center as it shot into the air.</p><br/><p>As the column of water shot into the air, the rest of the surface of the Violet Sea sank down. At the same time, the index finger of Meng Hao\u2019s right hand pointed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecters!\u201d</p><br/><p>The specters of all the neo-demons and Cultivators who had died in the Apocalypse now existed parasitically within the Violet Sea. Right now, they responded to Meng Hao\u2019s summons, instantly surging in from all directions. They shot into the column of seawater, filling it, forming a soul of the column!</p><br/><p>Except, that soul was fragmented. The true soul\u2026 was Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The column of seawater, thousands of meters wide, shot out past Meng Hao, magically transforming into a gigantic arm!</p><br/><p>Further up in the direction of the sky, the arm ended in a fist.</p><br/><p>A violet fist and a violet arm. This was like\u2026 the arm of the Violet Sea!</p><br/><p>If there had been any eyewitnesses observing from a distance, they would have felt an unprecedented level of shock, and would have had the image forever engraved in their minds.</p><br/><p>What they would have seen was Tribulation clouds transformed into a fist, representing the Will of Heaven. Another fist stretched out from within the sea, representing the heart of the Apocalypse. One of these two enormous fists was descending from up above. The other rose up from the middle of the sea. There in mid-air\u2026 they slammed into each other.</p><br/><p>The boom rang out in all directions, shaking Heaven and Earth, causing the Violet Sea to vibrate. This scene was indescribably shocking, so monstrous it was impossible to describe.</p><br/><p>Transcending Tribulation in this fashion was unprecedented!</p><br/><p>Before Meng Hao, no one had ever done anything like this, and after this day there would not likely be someone else who did!</p><br/><p>The will of the Violet Sea had transformed into an arm that exterminated Heavenly Tribulation. The arm contained the pinnacle of the power of extermination, a power like that belonging to an enormous Greater Demon. If Meng Hao had not engaged in Demonic Transmigration before, he would never have been able to do this.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Tribulation Clouds emitted shocking, explosive claps of thunder. The lightning inside of the clouds exploded out, transforming into a roar that could be heard clearly even in the ten outpost cities on the surface of the sea.</p><br/><p>Countless lightning bolts slammed into the power of extermination, and were then transformed into innumerable sparks of electricity. The electricity merged into the Violet Sea, causing large numbers of specters to vanish. Some of the electricity also merged into Meng Hao\u2019s body and spread out to fill it.</p><br/><p>Finally, after the last bit of lightning dissipated, no more fist was visible. The lightning vanished. Since it was incapable of destroying Meng Hao, it seemed the Heavenly Tribulation chose to retreat.</p><br/><p>As for the Violet Sea arm that Meng Hao was in, it lost its spirit, lost its will, and collapsed back down into the sea. A huge boom could be heard as the water spread back out into the sea, causing it to rise up once again.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hovered in mid-air, lightning sparking constantly through his body. He coughed up a big mouthful of blood and then shot back down toward the sea. Just when he was about to splash directly into the waters, he stopped to stand on its surface. Lightning danced about on his body. His face was pale as he looked up into the sky; the disappearing Tribulation clouds suddenly stopped in place.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the Heavenly Tribulation had a bit of power left after all, and wanted to make one final strike of lightning!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes narrowed and his Cultivation base began to rotate. Sharp pains stabbed out in his body and he coughed up some more blood. However, when he coughed up the blood, his mind suddenly trembled.</p><br/><p>The reason was that within the blood he had just coughed up could be seen vast quantities of electric sparks. He could only imagine that right now he must look almost like a\u2026 human-shaped lightning bolt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder. Lightning\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s mind shook, ignoring the Tribulation clouds overhead, and everything else. His mind suddenly seemed to be filled with primordial chaos as an incredible, even astonishing, idea took form.</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning is a manifestation of power, something that could form a totem tattoo\u2026. In that case\u2026 it could also make\u2026 a Nascent Soul!! My seventh Nascent Soul\u2026. Lightning Nascent Soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can really form a seventh Nascent Soul, then when I entered the Seventh Anima, I would be able to wield battle prowess equivalent to sixty-four peak late Nascent Souls!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. It wouldn\u2019t be a peak late Nascent Soul, it would be of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage!\u201d Meng Hao was panting. Without hesitation, he produced all his remaining One Color Soul Procurement Pills from his bag of holding. Leaving only one as a backup, he placed the remainder into his mouth.</p><br/><p>The instant the medicinal pills entered his mouth, he felt that special Divine Sense sweeping through his body. Suddenly, he experienced pain everywhere in his body.</p><br/><p>As the pain appeared, strands of lightning were forced out of him. This lightning contained the power of Heavenly Tribulation both from the current Tribulation, as well as remnants left behind from the Perfect Gold Core and Perfect Foundation Tribulations. All of the lightning was forced out and then sucked into his dantian region.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, all of the sparks of electricity began to merge together. Meng Hao immediately sat down cross-legged on the surface of the sea. He ignored the Tribulation clouds up above and focused completely on meditation. More and more lightning sparks began to coalesce in his dantian.</p><br/><p>All of the lightning in the entire area stopped moving and then was sucked toward Meng Hao. Lightning in both the air and the sea writhed and glowed as it bore into Meng Hao\u2019s body and came to his dantian.</p><br/><p>Using his body as the pill furnace, his will as the pill formula, and his life as the flame, he began to concoct!</p><br/><p>The process was quick. In the blink of an eye, a roaring sound filled Meng Hao\u2019s mind as the lightning in his dantian region coalesced into a gigantic ball. The ball began to writhe and then shattered into pieces. A small, seven-inch tall person appeared!</p><br/><p>The person looked exactly like Meng Hao in all respects. This was Meng Hao\u2019s seventh Nascent Soul, that by a random chance he had been able to concoct\u2026. Lightning Nascent Soul!</p><br/><p>As soon as the tiny person appeared, Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base exploded upward. This was no longer the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage. He had now broken through into\u2026 the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage!</p><br/><p>His hair whipped about him as he rose up to the pinnacle of Nascent Soul power!</p><br/><p>At the same time, the thin Tribulation Clouds up in the sky seemed to have been thoroughly provoked. No one ever dared to have a Cultivation base breakthrough in the middle of Heavenly Tribulation! On top of that, who had ever dared to absorb the power of the Tribulation itself!?</p><br/><p>All of this caused the Tribulation clouds to disperse and then transform\u2026 into a human-shaped lightning bolt!</p><br/><p>The lightning bolt wasn\u2019t complete, and was in fact a bit blurry, its features unclear. However, it still emanated a terrifying and shocking pressure. Instantly, it shot toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh Anima!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes shone with a destructive light as the Lightning Nascent Soul overlapped and then combined with the other Nascent Souls to push Meng Hao into the Seventh Anima.</p><br/><p>Boom!!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s body was already incredibly powerful. But now, it changed again. He was again taller, even more valiant. He was now not Demonically evil, but rather, more like an Immortal Devil!</p><br/><p>His long hair whipped about and his body radiated a fearsome aura of destruction. Now that he had entered the Seventh Anima, he exploded with\u2026 the power of sixty four great circle Nascent Souls.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Meng Hao\u2026 was not just the number one figure under the Spirit Severing stage. Right now, if he ran into a Spirit Severing Cultivator\u2026 he might lose in the end, but he could still offer up a fight!</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Joenathan Tanumihardja, Micha\u0142 Dranicki, Luis Valle, Ganesh MVJ, Austin Gremillion, David Chism, and Leonel Castaneda</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

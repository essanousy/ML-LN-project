The only thing that kept them from completely collapsing was the hope that Patriarch Huyan would come to save them.</p><br/><p>They truly believed that Patriarch Huyan would come to save them!</p><br/><p>Huyan Yunming was THEIR Patriarch!</p><br/><p>The slaughter intensified yet again. The sound of killing rose up to the Heavens. Meng Hao was the peak power on the battlefield. Not a single Heavenly Pursuit Cultivator dared to get close to him. No totemic Sacred Ancient had the gall to attack him. Wherever he went, enemy Cultivators scattered immediately.</p><br/><p>Finally, Meng Hao\u2019s gaze came to fall upon Zhang Wenzu. In that instant, Zhang Wenzu began to tremble, and without pausing for a moment, he fled backward. His mind was reeling with shock, and yet, even as he began to flee, Meng Hao turned into a green smoke and then appeared directly next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI surrender to the Golden Crow Tribe!!\u201d cried Zhang Wenzu, his face flickering. The pressure bearing down on him from Meng Hao was too intense, filling him with a sense of deadly crisis. Fearing that Meng Hao wouldn\u2019t believe him, he actually dropped all of his defenses.</p><br/><p>\u201cI surrender!\u201d he gushed anxiously. \u201cI\u2019m the Chosen of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. If I join the Golden Crow Tribe then I can give you\u2026.\u201d Before he could finish, Meng Hao\u2019s hand flashed out like lightning to grab his neck with an iron grip.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember you,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cYou were there that year at Blackgate Fort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Wenzu\u2019s body trembled, and his face filled with fear. It felt as if an enormous vice were clamped down onto his neck. In response to Meng Hao\u2019s words, he instantly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Meng Hao, \u201cthe Golden Crow Tribe doesn\u2019t need turncoats.\u201d With that, he tightened his grip. Zhang Wenzu was the Chosen of this generation of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. He had practiced cultivation for two hundred years to reach the early Nascent Soul stage. Right now, a tremor ran through his body as his Nascent Soul was crushed and he died in both body and spirit.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao loosened his grip and turned. Currently, only ten thousands members remained of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. Of the previous force of one hundred Nascent Soul Cultivators, only twenty were left.</p><br/><p>As far as totemic Sacred Ancients went, only five remained.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe could already be considered destroyed. However, with Patriarch Huyan still around, they could still count as a great Tribe!</p><br/><p>Under the leadership of the High Priest, the members of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe had all formed together. In fact, they were now in much the same position that the Golden Crow Tribe had been in before. They were surrounded by enemy Tribe members, hundreds of thousands of specters, and seven Violet Sea Giants.</p><br/><p>In the very middle of the group from the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe was the High Priest. His face filled with grief, he held his staff aloft and then plunged it down into the ground. Blood sprayed from his mouth as he sat down cross-legged.</p><br/><p>His voice shrill, he cried, \u201cPatriarch, why haven\u2019t you come!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Pursuit Tribe is about to be destroyed\u2026 Of 80,000 Tribe members, only 10,000 are left! Patriarch, why\u2026 why haven\u2019t you come!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as he howled up to the Heavens, the staff in front of him began to glow with a white light that then shot up into the sky. As soon as it slammed into the red light of the mastiff, it vanished. However, despite the fact that it vanished, it was still able to use a special bloodline method to pierce out into the outside world. It shot toward the location of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe directly into the mind of Patriarch Huyan, who sat there cross-legged.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Meng Hao hovered there in mid-air, looking out over the scene. His eyes glittering, he waved his right hand, causing the three Spirit Extermination Spikes to appear. He sent his Divine Sense into the spikes, then, borrowing the power of the Mastiff, wiped the brands off of them and replaced them with his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you did to the Golden Crow Tribe,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cMeng Hao will do to you. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d With that, he tossed one of the black spikes out into the air, where it rapidly increased in size. Roaring could be heard as Meng Hao waved his hand, causing the spike to be stabbed half-way down into the ground.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a black field of light sprang up to envelop the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe.</p><br/><p>Next, a second spike flew out in a different direction to then stab down into the ground. The black field of light grew stronger, and the members of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe began to tremble and whither.</p><br/><p>A third spike stabbed down. The Spirit Extermination Spike spell formation having been fully activated, all of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe members were now in the same position the Golden Crow Tribe members had been. Their flesh withered, and their life force drained away at a rapid pace.</p><br/><p>They stood there shaking, expressions of despair appeared on their faces as they looked toward the High Priest. In turn, the High Priest looked up into the sky. As his body wasted away, his voice once again raised out, filled with hopelessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch\u2026 save your people\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, why haven\u2019t you come\u2026? Have you forsaken us\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the spectacle from up above, but said nothing. He looked off into the distance, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Golden Crow Tribe members watched on silently. They were not inherently fond of killing, but when they saw the hopelessness on the faces of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe Cultivators, they couldn\u2019t help but think of their own situation earlier.</p><br/><p>If Meng Hao had not returned, then perhaps they would have begun to cry out just like the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Within the black field of light, the life forces of the withering members of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe were beginning to wink out. They turned into corpses which toppled to the ground. As they died, their life forces were completely absorbed by the spell formation, causing a white cyclone to gradually appear.</p><br/><p>As more Tribe members became shriveled corpses, the High Priest continued to waste away. He now looked like a body just climbed up out of a grave, emanating a strong aura of death. Despite that, he continued to gaze up listlessly into the sky. His voice echoed out continuously.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch\u2026 Did we make a mistake\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, please respond. Did we err? Why haven\u2019t you come\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>1,000. 3,000. 5,000. Finally, all 10,000 Tribe members became desiccated corpses and toppled to the ground. Soon, only the Nascent Soul Cultivators and the totemic Sacred Ancients were left. They trembled and cried out helplessly, and the High Priest began to laugh bitterly.</p><br/><p>The laughter became sadder until it was filled with resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, why haven\u2019t you come for us!?!?\u201d Even as his resentful words rang out, the remaining Nascent Soul Cultivators lifted their heads up to release the last howl they would release in their entire lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026 haven\u2019t you come?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The Nascent Soul Cultivators in the field of light were now dried up corpses. The totemic Sacred Ancients were all dead. The only person left was the High Priest. He continued to chuckle hatefully as the flame of his life force was finally extinguished.</p><br/><p>After they were all dead, the white cyclone floating within the black field of light transformed into a white pearl. Meng Hao had assumed the pearl would disappear, but it did not. It remained there, floating in the air until members of the Golden Crow Tribe approached to take it away.</p><br/><p>The scene caused Meng Hao to frown and look off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what are you planning, Patriarch Huyan\u2026.\u201d he thought. After a moment, a tremor ran through his body. He looked down into his bag of holding at the Demon Spirit he had acquired all those years ago in the Realm of the Bridge Ruins. It was now shining with a brilliant light.</p><br/><p>It grew more and more intense, and began to emanate a gravitational force.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered. After calculating the days, he realized that the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane would be opening soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch Huyan, I don\u2019t care what you\u2019re planning. The fight between the two of us cannot be avoided!\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked over the Golden Crow Tribe. Big Hairy was there, and the Wild Giant too. Finally, he waved his hand, causing the glowing red shield to shrink back down and transform back into the mastiff.</p><br/><p>He stood on the mastiff\u2019s head and looked off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Eventually he looked back at the members of the Golden Crow Clan, and they looked back with expressions of fervent ardor. Meng Hao could clearly sense the intense faith power in the area. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Heavenly Pursuit Sect. As for all of you\u2026 there\u2019s no need for you to come along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Faith power circled around Meng Hao, transforming into ghost images that superimposed with his body. It slowly fused into his Cultivation base in such a way that no magical technique could cause it to diffuse.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked over at Big Hairy, who floated there in mid-air, and gave him an encouraging look. Big Hairy let out a few yips in response.</p><br/><p>The Thorn Rampart vines swayed back and forth in the air, seemingly looking up into the air as Meng Hao prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao turned and opened up his bag of the Cosmos to suck in all the bodies of the members of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe. Then he and the mastiff flashed and shot up into the air.</p><br/><p>Behind him, all the members of the Tribe clasped hands and bowed. Wu Chen and Wu Ling were there. They watched Meng Hao, their hearts filled with dolorousness. It was Wu Chen who finally spoke. The gratefulness in his heart toward Meng Hao was different than the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cSacred Ancient, sir\u2026 will you return to us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Yes!\u201d was the soft reply.</p><br/><p>The old-timers who had accompanied Meng Hao during the migration felt deeply melancholy. They knew that it would be years before any of them would have a chance to see him again. They themselves might not even be alive at that time.</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao sped off into the distance, the parrot and the meat jelly looked back from their position on his shoulder toward the Outlander Beast, who stood there amongst the Golden Crow Tribe members.</p><br/><p>They had the sudden premonition that it would be hundreds of years before they met again, or perhaps even longer\u2026. However, it was at this point that the parrot suddenly looked at the mastiff, and its eyes began to shine with burning passion. When the meat jelly sensed this, it shuddered.</p><br/><p>The mastiff seemed to sense it as well, and gave the parrot a look. The parrot suddenly struck a graceful pose and smiled benevolently toward the mastiff. Subconsciously it looked back at the Outlander Beast. The Outlander Beast\u2019s emotional expression caused the parrot to let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, far, far away a fissure suddenly opened up in mid-air above the Western Desert Violet Sea. A beautiful woman dressed in a flowing pink gown emerged. She looked irritated..</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Primordial Demon Immortal Plane is opening and the teleportation power is strong. Everyone with Demon Spirits will be entering.\u201d This was none other than Zhixiang. She ground her teeth as she looked down at the Violet Sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, there is one badass bitch who hasn\u2019t forgotten about you! Eee? You stopped the Demonic Transmigration?\u201d She stared in shock for a moment, and then raised her eyebrows happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you do have some conscience after all. You still owe me, don't forget it.\u201d With a snort, she picked a mountain-island and sat down cross-legged to wait for the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane to completely open.</p><br/><p>Back in the Black Lands, there were other forces who noticed the teleportation power, and were similarly waiting.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Alain Bloch</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

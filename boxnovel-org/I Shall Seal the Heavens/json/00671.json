He lifted up the glass of alcohol and then tossed it down his throat.</p><br/><p>After it went down, his body suddenly started shaking, and veins bulged out on his face. A pained expression appeared but he doggedly endured, raising his hand to rotate the full power of his Cultivation base. His wife\u2019s face flickered, and she was about to rise to her feet when Saint Sun Soul stopped her with a look.</p><br/><p>He panted for the space of about ten breaths, then suddenly pointed out with his right index finger. A blue aura appeared, filled with an intense sharpness. It shot out through the wall of the tower, after which, a monstrous Sword Qi sped off over the horizon.</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul breathed deeply, and his face was pale white. He looked over at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes everyone in your hometown drink this type of alcohol?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression the same as ever, Meng Hao lifted up the bronze alcohol flagon and took a long drink, all the while staring Saint Sun Soul in the eye.</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul\u2019s face twitched again. He watched as Meng Hao had no reaction whatsoever to the alcohol, and in fact, even took another drink. He sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn all the years I\u2019ve practiced Cultivation, this is the first time someone has ever threatened me with some alcohol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could treating you to some alcohol be a threat?\u201d asked Meng Hao, sounding a bit hurt. \u201cIn my hometown, everyone really does drink this. It\u2019s just that when I left, I was in a bit of a hurry, so I didn\u2019t bring very much with me. Next time, I\u2019ll make sure to bring you a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul sat there quietly. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of Meng Hao\u2019s arrival. The Sword Qi in the alcohol was very strong, and moments ago he had actually been rocked both physically and mentally. Then he saw Meng Hao drink it without any reaction at all. He couldn\u2019t help but think that Meng Hao was even more mysterious than he had seemed at first.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can attract Sea Demons to the point of driving them crazy,\u201d he thought. \u201cHe has this strange sword alcohol and a shocking fleshly body, and even canceled out my freezing Qi\u2026. On top of that he\u2019s also a Time Cultivator. So\u2026 why exactly is he here?\u201d He lifted up the glass with the freezing alcohol and took a drink.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you exchange your Demon hearts with the Sun Soul Society? The exchange rate won\u2019t be incredibly high, but neither will it be very low.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked back silently at Saint Sun Soul for a moment. Then he asked, \u201cWhy do the three Sects value Demon hearts so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGenerally speaking, that is a secret,\u201d replied Saint Sun Soul coolly. \u201cHowever, considering the level of your Cultivation base, you\u2019ll figure it eventually on your own.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe history of the three Sects go back a long way,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs for how long exactly, even I\u2019m not too sure. I only know that the first generation of Patriarchs of the Sects jointly summoned the Stormwind Divide. After that, this area was sealed off all the way down until this day.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs to whether those Patriarchs are still alive or dead, nobody knows. However, they left behind a legacy treasure that requires Demon hearts to ensure that it will continue to exist. Furthermore, the cultivation techniques of the Cultivators of the three Sects are different from that of outsiders. To us, Spirit Stones are only moderately effective. Demon hearts, on the other hand, are a different story.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, and most importantly, every rotation of the great spell formation that protects the three Sects requires a shocking amount of Demon hearts. Without the Demon hearts, it can\u2019t be operated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard all of this, Meng Hao chuckled a bit. \u201cI suppose there is another reason, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d replied Saint Sun Soul, staring at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has something to do with the yellow springs Underworld Ship in the Stormwind Divide,\u201d said Meng Hao, smiling and eyes glittering.</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul looked back at him expressionlessly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to probe for information. That matter is a secret of the three Sects, which cannot be told to outsiders. However, you know of the yellow springs Underworld Ship\u2026. That\u2019s a bit unexpected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although his tone of voice was the same as ever, inwardly, Saint Sun Soul was shocked to hear Meng Hao mention the yellow springs Underworld Ship. Yet again, he found himself more in awe.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that a jade slip suddenly began to glow inside Saint Sun Soul\u2019s bag of holding. He took it out and looked it over, then placed it down onto the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell me, then forget about the matter,\u201d said Meng Hao, giving up on his efforts to probe for information. \u201cAs for the Demon hearts\u2026 as long as you give me a huge enough quantity of Spirit Stones, then of course I\u2019ll exchange them with you!\u201d He pulled out a bag of holding, which he loosened and then placed on the table.</p><br/><p>Glancing at the jade slip on the table in front of Saint Sun Soul, Meng Hao smiled and said, \u201cYou most likely know exactly how many Demon hearts are inside. Name a price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c5,000,000,000 low-grade Spirit Stones,\u201d replied Saint Sun Soul. He waved his hand, causing a ring to fly out which Meng Hao then snatched.</p><br/><p>He scanned it with Divine Sense, whereupon he saw that the inside of the ring was densely packed with a vast quantity of Spirit Stones!</p><br/><p>They were not low-grade, nor even mid-grade. No, all were high-grade Spirit Stones!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s pupils constricted. According to his understanding, even great Sects and Clans would have a hard time accumulating so many high-grade Spirit Stones. And yet Saint Sun Soul\u2019s attitude was\u2026 relatively cavalier.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao muttered to himself inwardly about how this cold-faced man turned out to be the truly rich one. However, he still couldn\u2019t wrap his mind about why the trifling Sun Soul Society would have so many Spirit Stones.</p><br/><p>His eyes flickered as all of a sudden, he thought about Demon hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that there is something about the Demon hearts themselves that cause the Sun Soul Society to be so rich?\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur transaction is complete, you can take your leave now.\u201d Saint Sun Soul closed his eyes and paid no more attention to Meng Hao, as if even looking at him caused him to feel somewhat annoyed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled, clasped the ring in hand as he stood up and prepared to leave. However, after taking only two steps, he suddenly stopped and looked back.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering how many Spirit Stones your Sun Soul Society has,\u201d he said, \u201cperhaps you would be interested in forming a cooperation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul opened his eyes and looked at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sort of cooperation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of us join forces to kill Sea Demons. I\u2019ll help you to draw them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul\u2019s eyes glittered, and after a moment of silence, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the split?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor every ten we acquire, you keep nine and I keep one. Furthermore, when it comes to exchanging the Demon hearts for Spirit Stones, I\u2019ll give you a ten percent discount!\u201d [1. Just to forestall any questions, Meng Hao's offer is translated correctly. He gives Saint Sun Soul nine for every one that he gets]</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty percent!\u201d retorted Saint Sun Soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d said Meng Hao, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to attract the Sea Demons, and that\u2019s my responsibility. It\u2019s just that with your help things will go a bit faster. Also, the Third Ring belongs to your three Sects. If it weren\u2019t for that, I could just do it all myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you do know what it means to be in the Third Ring after all!\u201d shot back Saint Sun Soul. The two of them continued to negotiate the terms of their cooperation. Off to the side, Saint Sun Soul\u2019s beautiful wife covered her smile with her hand as she watched on. She hadn\u2019t heard Saint Sun Soul speak so much in years.</p><br/><p>She understood her husband well. He seemed cold on the outside, but he viewed the people he approved of as close friends. As for the people he didn\u2019t approve of, even people who were incredibly powerful, they would not hear more than three sentences come out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>She could see that although her husband and Meng Hao didn\u2019t seem to get along, in truth, they both admired each other.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao slapped his hand down onto the table, causing the jade slip to fly up into the air. \u201cYou listen to me, swindler, I\u2019ve been going easy on you so far, don\u2019t make me get serious! You\u2019ve tasted my hometown alcohol, so you know that a fifty percent discount is not going to happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul gave a cold snort. \u201cFor hundreds of years in the Third Ring, the Saints have controlled everything! Without my permission, will you be killing any Demons at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them faced off angrily. Smiling, Saint Sun Soul\u2019s wife rose to her feet to refill their glasses of alcohol. Her voice soft, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to act like this, you two. Instead of sticking to fifty percent or ten percent, why don\u2019t you both back down a bit and settle on thirty percent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao thought for a moment and then nodded in agreement. \u201cFine, thirty percent it is!\u201d After all, this was the Third Ring, and when it came to Saint Sun Soul, unless he used some of his trump cards, he wouldn\u2019t quite be a match. Although the two of them didn\u2019t quite know how to deal with the other, Meng Hao couldn\u2019t help but think about how annoying it was to try to earn his Spirit Stones only to be interfered with by other random people.</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul hesitated for a moment and then nodded.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao rose to his feet, \u201cAlright, swindler. Since we\u2019re in agreement, then we\u2019ll head out in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Saint and my name is Lin Tao!\u201d said Saint Sun Soul through gritted teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for telling me, swindler,\u201d replied Meng Hao, flicking his sleeve and preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Saint Sun Soul\u2019s eyes flickered, and he suddenly swept his sleeve across the jade slip sitting on the table, sending it flying toward Meng Hao. Meng Hao turned and grabbed it, then looked at Saint Sun Soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaint Flying Immortal and Saint Sea Divinity sent me some news. Take a look.\u201d He took another drink of alcohol, then closed his eyes and said nothing further.</p><br/><p>A serious expression on his face, Meng Hao sent his Divine Sense into the jade slip. After looking at the information therein, a tremor ran through him. According to the jade slip, Saint Flying Immortal and Saint Sea Divinity were currently on their way to the Third Ring, along with seventy thousand of their disciples.</p><br/><p>In addition to that information, there was also a picture of Meng Hao, as well as an message to Saint Sun Soul, inviting him to join in the search.</p><br/><p>Finally, there was a message indicating that the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch was coming personally to meet with Saint Sun Soul to explain the rewards he would receive for participating in the search.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was expressionless as he tossed the jade slip back, where it hovered in the air in front of Saint Sun Soul.</p><br/><p>Saint Sun Soul took and put it away, then coolly said, \u201cHan Feng.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Han Feng teleported into the room to stand in front of Saint Sun Soul. He clasped hands and bowed.</p><br/><p>His voice calm, Saint Sun Soul said, \u201cGo out into Seahold and get rid of any information about Master\u2019s friend here. It doesn\u2019t matter how many people saw him or had dealings with him, go take care of everything. Spare no cost.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat includes people who have left the city in the past few days. Clean it all up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng gaped for a moment, then bowed his head and voiced his assent. He glanced over at Meng Hao and then turned and left.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he watched these things happen, but he didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaint Flying Immortal and Saint Sea Divinity are passing through the Stormwind Divide. Given the speed they can attain, it will take them two months to get here. As for that 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, even if he does have a Dao Seeking Cultivation base, it will also take him about two months.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will agree with the requests of the other Saints, as well as of the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. That way, it will be much harder for traces of your passage to be picked up in my territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was silent for a moment before clasping hands and bowing. \u201cMany thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helping you, I\u2019m helping our business,\u201d replied Saint Sun Soul coolly. Then he cleared his throat and looked at Meng Hao. \u201cEighty percent discount!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gritted his teeth. Although his expression was the same as usual, he glared at Saint Sun Soul, who was beaming in self-satisfaction. \u201cForty percent, that\u2019s the most you\u2019ll get!\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Please e-mail typos and mistakes to <span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"5f362c2c2b37723b3a3e2b373d333e3b3a1f263e373030713c3032\">[email\u00a0protected]</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

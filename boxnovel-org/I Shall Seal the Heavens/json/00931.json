Keeping his arm wrapped around Sun Hai, he looked around at some of the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Song Luodan! And Taiyang Zi! Wang Mu, you\u2019re here too! Wonderful! You\u2019re all here. Well then\u2026 when are you going to be paying back the money you owe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s handful of sentences instantly provoked a reaction from the various Chosen in the East Ascension Pavilion. Some burst out angrily, others glared at him furiously, and some had bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your trap!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, you\u2019re pushing people too far!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, if you dare to insult me one more time, we\u2019re going to have a blood feud the likes of which has never been seen before!!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fang Xi saw all of this happening, he stared at Meng Hao in blank shock. Then he looked at the enraged Chosen, and took a deep breath. He had no idea what Meng Hao had done to provoke such widespread indignation, to cause these Chosen to be so wrathful.</p><br/><p>Fang Xi was even more thunderstruck by the words exchanged between Meng Hao and Li Ling\u2019er, as well as Fan Dong\u2019er. Actually, Fan Dong\u2019er was the celestial goddess of Fang Xi\u2019s dreams\u2026.</p><br/><p>And yet, in the blink of an eye, that celestial goddess had summoned deadly weapons. Any rapturous illusions Fang Xi had about her were instantly dispelled by her vicious wrath.</p><br/><p>Fang Xi wasn\u2019t the only shocked one. Fang Hong also stared with wide eyes. She couldn\u2019t imagine what disputes Meng Hao had with these people to make them act in this way. Apparently, Meng Hao\u2019s brief words had stabbed deep into their hearts.</p><br/><p>Even Fang Wei was at a loss as to how Meng Hao could be so familiar with these people\u2026.</p><br/><p>Only Fang Xiangshan and Fang Donghan truly knew of the inspiring and tragic connection between all of them, and how world-shaking those events had been.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Fang Clan members stared in shock at Meng Hao and the Chosen, their minds reeling.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s appearance in the pavilion made him the complete center of attention. Even Fang Wei was somehow surpassed.</p><br/><p>The Chosen\u2019s response to his words caused Meng Hao\u2019s face to suddenly darken.</p><br/><p>Before he could even say anything though, the parrot, which had maintained silence up to this point, rolled its eyes and then glared at all the people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe who owes shall repay!\u201d it squawked. \u201cThis is a principle of Heaven and Earth! You shameless bunch had better repay what you owe immediately!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have no money, then find some furred or feathered beasts for Lord Fifth! If Lord Fifth is satisfied, then he\u2019ll help you pay back the debt! What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao snorted coldly and glared at the crowd. Then he slapped his bag of holding and produced a stack of promissory notes. He began tapping his finger on the notes, and then looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite paper and words written in blood. The handwriting is very clear, yes? Do you people really dare to renege on your debts?\u201d Meng Hao was clearly incensed. He was well aware that concocting the Skypalace Sunspirit Pill had temporarily resolved his spirit stone quandary. However, according to his calculations, what he had earned still wouldn\u2019t be enough. Now, his joy at finding so many people who owed him money was turning into fury.</p><br/><p>In the instant that Meng Hao pulled out the stack of promissory notes, Fang Xi gasped. Fang Hong\u2019s eyes went wide, and even Fang Wei stared in shock.</p><br/><p>All of the surrounding members of the Fang Clan stared blankly in disbelief at Meng Hao standing there, tapping his finger on the promissory notes. This image of Meng Hao was now deeply ingrained in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 how many promissory notes does he actually have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Fang Hao come from Planet South Heaven? How could there be so many people who borrowed money from him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly does this guy do? Is he a cultivator? How come he just doesn\u2019t seem like a cultivator to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fang Clan\u2019s Chosen gaped as their minds filled with buzzing thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSun Hai,\u201d said Meng Hao, sounding very displeased. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start first.\u201d He patted Sun Hai\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t think that because you\u2019re bald now that I can\u2019t grab ahold of you. There\u2019s always going to be some place on your body that has hair, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing these words, the parrot\u2019s eyes suddenly shone brightly, and it stared at Sun Hai with interest.</p><br/><p>Sun Hai began to quiver. He gritted his teeth and was about to protest, when Meng Hao\u2019s words suddenly reminded him of his nightmarish experience on Planet South Heaven. Finally, he scowled.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh...can I pay back a little less than I owe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was instantly pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d he said, eyes shining. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the interest, how about that?\u201d Sun Hai grimaced, clenched his teeth, and then slapped his bag of holding, producing some spirit stones that he handed over to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao quickly collected them up, licked his lips, and then eyed Sun Hai\u2019s bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering how rarely we run into each other, why don\u2019t you repay a bit more than that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t,\u201d said Sun Hai. \u201cI\u2026 I actually came to the Fang Clan to buy something particular\u2026. It\u2019s\u2026 well, I know this girl from the Fang Clan, and I really want to buy her a gift. Hey, you never know, we might end up being family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s how it is,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you repay a bit more of your debt, and I\u2019ll put in a good word for you.\u201d He smiled and patted Sun Hai\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>He suddenly realized that patting Sun Hai\u2019s head actually felt very good, so he patted it a few more times for good measure.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi\u2019l Hai, don\u2019t worry. Pay back those spirit stones, and I\u2019ll help you out. In the Fang Clan, the highest Elders and the lowliest branch members all have to give me face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Hai hesitated for a moment. He knew that Meng Hao was the eldest grandson of the direct bloodline. Even though the direct bloodline was in decline, Meng Hao\u2019s father was still alive, and Meng Hao had certainly been throwing his weight around the clan recently.</p><br/><p>Based on his earlier inquiries, none of the other Chosen in the clan were familiar with the girl he liked, which was making Sun Hai anxious. Now that he saw how domineering Meng Hao was, he figured\u2026 he might as well give Meng Hao\u2019s suggestion a shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if he\u2019ll really put in a good word for me\u2026.\u201d Sun Hai thought, gritting his teeth. He was thoroughly entranced with this Fang Clan girl, to the point where he wasn\u2019t even acting rationally. Finally, he slapped his bag of holding and passed an even larger sum of spirit stones over to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao saw them, his eyes shone with brilliant light.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi\u2019l Hai, don\u2019t you worry. You leave everything to your Big Bro.\u201d Meng Hao put the spirit stones away, and before Sun Hai could say anything more, began to walk over to Li Ling\u2019er.</p><br/><p>She stared at him, furious, her expression icy.</p><br/><p>He hesitated for a moment, then glanced down at her rear end. Sighing, he thought about his actions as Fang Mu, and realized that there was an eighty percent certainty that Li Ling\u2019er had recognized him. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t push her too far.</p><br/><p>He turned to look at Fan Dong\u2019er, but when he saw the deadly-looking violet flying daggers swirling around above her hand, his expression turned somber, and he turned to walk toward Taiyang Zi and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaiyang Zi, Song Luodan, Wang Mu!\u201d he barked. \u201cAll of you owe me money. It\u2019s time to PAY UP!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taiyang Zi and the other two glared back at Meng Hao, flames of rage flickering in their eyes.</p><br/><p>They all stared at each other for a few breaths of time, after which Meng Hao took a step forward toward them. At this exact moment, Taiyang Zi and the others attacked simultaneously. Booms echoed out as all four of them flew out of the pavilion and began to fight.</p><br/><p>Rumbling filled the air as Meng Hao transformed into a golden roc that slashed its talons toward Taiyang Zi. At the same time, a chain of mountains rumbled out next to him, crushing down toward Song Luodan. A moment later, he flapped a wing, causing the air to shred as power shot toward Wang Mu.</p><br/><p>Booms echoed out in all directions. Even though it was late at night, and very dark, the light of magic filled the air, and all of the Fang Clan members down below stared up to watch. When they saw Meng Hao single-handedly battling three amazing Chosen, their minds trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Song Luodan from the Song Clan. And Taiyang Zi from the Five Great Holy Lands! The last one is the Wang Clan Chosen, Wang Mu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll three of them are in the process of rising to be true Immortals! Once they do, they\u2019ll definitely be even more famous than they are now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Fang Hao is fighting all three of them at the same time!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Booms echoed out as the four of them fought back and forth constantly. Meng Hao clenched his fist and then punched out, unleashing the Nine Heavens Destruction. Blood sprayed from Song Luodan\u2019s mouth. As for Wang Mu and Taiyang Zi, one of them called wind and summoned rain, while the other transformed into blinding sunlight. Even as they closed in on Meng Hao, he snorted coldly. A Blood Demon head appeared, which head butted Wang Mu. Simultaneously, the Ninth Mountain materialized, slamming toward Taiyang Zi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are a lot stronger than the first time we fought,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cUnfortunately for you\u2026 I could put you in your place last time, and I can do the same thing today!\u201d His cultivation base surged with power, and he extended his hand. Rumbling filled the sky as numerous mountains descended, cutting off all avenues of escape for Taiyang Zi and the others.</p><br/><p>Roaring, the three of them materialized their Dharma Idols. Meng Hao responded in kind. The Dharma Idols belonging to Taiyang Zi and the others all bore visible traces of Immortality Illumination Vines.</p><br/><p>As they fought, Taiyang Zi and the others were continuously forced to retreat. Finally, a boom could be heard, and blood sprayed from their mouths as they tumbled backward. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered, and he prepared to rush forward in pursuit.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this point that an archaic voice rumbled out from the ancestral mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMagical battle is prohibited during the rise of the East Ascension Sun. If anyone makes another attack\u2026 their right to bathe in the sunlight will be revoked!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the voice echoed out, two ancient figures noiselessly appeared in midair around the East Ascension Pavilion. Massive pressure radiated out, separating Meng Hao from Taiyang Zi and the others.</p><br/><p>These two old men were Elders of the Fang Clan. They looked over at Meng Hao, frowned, then looked at Taiyang Zi and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you get back into the pavilion. Sunrise is almost upon us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taiyang Zi and the others took deep breaths. Then they clasped hands and bowed to the two old men. Glaring angrily at Meng Hao, they flew back into the pavilion.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao glared back at them, then headed back to the pavilion himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill won\u2019t pay me back?\u201d he said with a cold smile. \u201cFrom now on, any time I run into you, I\u2019ll definitely put you in your place!\u201d After setting foot back into the pavilion, he looked around until he saw Fang Xi and Sun Hai, after which he walked over to Sun Hai.</p><br/><p>As time passed, most everyone in the pavilion sat there cross-legged. Fang Wei remained quite subdued; after Meng Hao returned to the pavilion, he remained mostly silent. His expression did not reveal anything either, as if the previous clash between the two of them didn\u2019t matter to him at all. In fact, when Meng Hao had fought with Taiyang Zi and the others, he had taken one glance and then looked away as if he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>Soon, everything quieted down. Daybreak was nearing. Eventually, it reached that darkest of pre-dawn moments in which everyone knew that the East Ascension Sun\u2026 was about to rise!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes shone with a strange light, and he took a deep breath. It was at this point that Sun Hai hesitated for a moment, then quietly began to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao\u2026 um\u2026 about that thing you promised earlier\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d said Meng Hao, yawning. \u201cOh, right, how far along are you in your relationship with this girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Hai\u2019s face reddened, and he lowered his voice even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d he said. \u201cShe always beats me up\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao heard this, he suddenly perked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that won\u2019t do!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name? Is she here in the pavilion? Of all the nerve! How could she dare to beat people up?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Sun Hai hurried to respond. \u201cEvery time she hurts me, I actually feel very happy\u2026. She\u2019s not here now, though. She\u2019s a disciple of the Church of the Emperor Immortal. Her name is Fang Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 931: Her Name is Fang Yu!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

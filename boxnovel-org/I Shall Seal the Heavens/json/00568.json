He rubbed the bridge of his nose for a moment. It felt as if extra memories were suddenly available inside his head. The memories were not his, and were rather obscure. The addition of these new memories caused Meng Hao\u2019s head to ache and be filled with an intense muddle-headedness.</p><br/><p>A gentle breeze pulled at his hair and caused his robes to ripple. However, he was unable to dispel the incredible shock that filled him, nor the absent-mindedness he felt because of this new identity.</p><br/><p>One of the seven great Elite Apprentices!</p><br/><p>He remembered from what Fang Yu had told him that acquiring an identity like this was virtually impossible. In the Demon Immortal Sect, a person with a status like this could summon wind and rain, so to speak, and stir up a lot of trouble. They were above other disciples in all ways, and even wielded the power over life and death!</p><br/><p>From the very beginning of the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane until now, no one had ever acquired such a fearsome identity. Regardless of who its was in the past, the very highest identity ever acquired was that of a Conclave disciple.</p><br/><p>However, in the face of the identity Meng Hao currently possessed, Conclave disciples\u2026 were like insects!</p><br/><p>Such an identity only existed in legend, and really was impossible to acquire. The Demon Immortal Sect had Legacy Apprentices, which were also referred to as Elite Apprentices, seven of them in total.</p><br/><p>Elite Apprentices actually outranked Sect Elders, and were second only to eminently respected Grand Elders and Sect Priest Paragons of the various peaks!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s heart trembled. He truly had never imagined that he would be able to acquire fortune such as this. He now possessed an identity that was fearsome to the extreme, had never been acquired before in the past, and most likely never would be again in the future. It was absolutely one-of-a-kind!</p><br/><p>Elite Apprentice of the Fourth Peak, Ke Jiusi!</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, that person I saw before was none other than\u2026 Ke Jiusi!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven after the Demon Immortal Sect was destroyed, he didn\u2019t die. He gave me his identity, but for what purpose I wonder\u2026?\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered and his throat felt tight.</p><br/><p>\u201cEllldeesstt Broootherrrrr!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Based on her tone of voice, the woman seemed extremely irritated. She was almost screaming by the time she finally interrupted Meng Hao\u2019s train of thought. He raised his head to look at her.</p><br/><p>Seemingly completely dissatisfied with his reaction, the woman stamped her foot and then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Her leaving didn\u2019t faze Meng Hao at all. He was still in shock regarding his identity. After a long moment passed, he sighed and looked around.</p><br/><p>The mountain peak was beautiful, covered with lush vegetation. The blue sky up above looked almost like lakewater. The air was filled with thick spiritual energy, and countless disciples could be seen, meditating, dueling, and chatting. The entire place was buzzing with activity.</p><br/><p>Up in the sky, an enormous, resplendent Flying Rain-Dragon flew back and forth. Everywhere it passed, wind gusted. There were all sorts of Immortal Beasts that soared about. It truly looked like a place of Immortals.</p><br/><p>Far off in the distance an old man was visible, floating cross-legged in the air above the Third Peak. He was giving a sermon regarding the Dao, and speaking of truths of various scriptures.</p><br/><p>It all looked exactly like the blurry scene he had witnessed earlier when entered the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane. The only difference was\u2026 Meng Hao\u2019s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><br/><p>He had just noticed that high up in the sky, shockingly\u2026 three inverted mountains could be seen!</p><br/><p>Each of these three mountains almost seemed bigger than all the lands beneath. Unless you looked at them from a distance, you wouldn\u2019t be able to take in the entire sight. Green vines hung down from them, and each of them seemed like three worlds unto themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d He had seen nothing similar to them in the First Plane. Upon first glance, all he could do was gape in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Of the three mountains, one appeared to be an ice mountain covered with frost. Another looked like a lava-filled volcano. The third mountain\u2026 was crimson, almost as if it were a mountain of blood!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao once again kneaded the bridge of his nose. The three mountains were bizarre, and his memories were fuzzy and mixed. He couldn\u2019t quite get himself to think straight at the moment. Muttering to himself, he looked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Immortal Sect\u2026. I wonder what unforeseen things might happen because of my status as a Demon Sealer\u2026? Also, I wonder if Demon Weapon Lonelytomb exists in this era.\u201d A mysterious glow flickered deep within Meng Hao\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother, what\u2019s wrong? Have you thought back to what you did?\u201d Apparently, the young woman who had left earlier had returned. She stood in front of him, seeming to be a bit unwilling to be there.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath to collect his thoughts. With a smile, he said, \u201cThought back to what I did? Uh, I\u2019m not really sure. I think I was dreaming just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDreaming? Of what?\u201d she responded, sounding even more curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve woken up, I can\u2019t remember,\u201d he said. Seeing that the woman was about to ask more questions, Meng Hao looked at her with a solemn expression and said, \u201cYou are about to reach a critical point in your cultivation. I think you need to go meditate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his words caused the woman\u2019s eyes to go wide. \u201cYou dare to lecture me?! Humph! You\u2019ve got yourself into a lot of trouble this time. The Sect Priest sent me here to ask you if you\u2019ll admit your mistake!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the woman gave him a wink, then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Seeing the woman making her way off, Meng Hao frowned. He actually understood her deeper meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Yu said that when people enter the Second Plane, they don\u2019t awaken for a few hours at the soonest, and sometimes even a few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the time before everyone else wakes up, my advantage is virtually limitless!\u201d He rubbed the bridge of his nose as he thought no more regarding what the woman had said just now, and instead thought about this ancient, illusory world.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering my status, none of the others are even close to being a match for me. If I find any of them, I could see them dead with a mere thought!\u201d A cold glow appeared in his eyes. Regarding the exact rights enjoyed by an Elite Apprentice, the chaos of his memories made it impossible for him to recall all the details clearly. However, he had a general sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not sure what host bodies were selected by the others. Although, I do know that the best one would be that of the Ji Clan, the Conclave disciple. In that case\u2026 I\u2019ll go find that one, and bring that person to ruin!\u201d With that Meng Hao stood up. However, in the instant he rose to his feet, thunderclaps filled the sky as eight lightning bolts shot down toward him. Instantly, they slammed into him.</p><br/><p>The lighting fell too quickly, causing his entire body to tremble as he coughed up a mouthful of blood. He instantly fell down onto the ground, a look of shock on his face. The intense power of the lightning was fearsome. Despite the fact that this world was illusory, he still felt a sense of deadly crisis that caused him to gasp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d he thought. He quickly looked up into the sky. It was as blue as ever, except\u2026 the area surrounding him was filled with various disciples of the Demon Immortal Sect. Some were human, other had the bodies of Demons. All of them wore strange expressions.</p><br/><p>Some of them even appeared to be gloating in his misfortune. Those ones also appeared to be stifling rage, although they apparently hoped that he wouldn\u2019t notice. They quickly put looks of indifference on their faces and then departed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gaped. Something didn\u2019t seem to be right. After hesitating for a moment, he gritted his teeth and then quickly rose to his feet. Instantly, the surrounding nine cauldrons began to emit a buzzing sound. Nine chains of lightning appeared, quickly binding Meng Hao and then raising him up into the air.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s scalp went numb. Up in mid-air, eight lightning bolts boomed down to slam onto him. Blood sprayed from his mouth and his face went pale. It was at this point that he noticed all of the Demon Immortal Disciples in the area staring at him.</p><br/><p>Each one wore a strange expression. Some seemed to be enjoying themselves. Others appeared to be venting their anger. All of them seemed quite happy to watch him be struck with lightning. Some even looked like they were on the verge of bursting into applause.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! What the hell is going on?!?! Aren\u2019t I an Elite Apprentice? What\u2019s happening?!\u201d By this pointing Meng Hao was really starting to get scared. The power of the second round of lightning was such that his body felt as if it were on the verge of exploding.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he recalled what the woman had said earlier about thinking back to something he did. She had also mentioned he\u2019d gotten himself in a lot of trouble. At the moment, he really did seem to be in a lot of trouble. In fact, it seemed quite apparent that he was being punished!</p><br/><p>At the moment, quite a few Cultivators were now approaching the Fourth Peak at top speed.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of people arrived, all of them looking quite nervous, even pained. When they saw Meng Hao, they all began to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother, don\u2019t fight back. You\u2019re really in a lot of trouble this time. You\u2026 you still won\u2019t admit it, huh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Eldest Brother. The Sect Priest is really furious this time. Ai, you really should not have gone through with it. I can\u2019t believe you dared to steal the precious treasure of the Sixth Peak to give to that Demoness of the Zhao Clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! Eldest Brother was obviously seduced into wrongdoing by that Demoness. The person in the wrong isn\u2019t Eldest Brother, it\u2019s the damned Demoness!\u201d</p><br/><p>As their voices drifted out, Meng Hao\u2019s mind spun. All of a sudden, memories began to awaken in his mind. Now that the memories were clear, Meng Hao understood that originally, Ke Jiusi of the Fourth Peak didn\u2019t always have that name.</p><br/><p>Some people think three times before they act [1. There is a common Chinese saying that goes just this way: \u201cthink three times before you act\u201d]. However, Ke Jiusi\u2019s father, in his fury, had changed his son\u2019s name to Jiusi, which meant \u2018think nine times.\u2019 He had hoped that changing the name would remind his son to thoroughly consider all matters before taking action.</p><br/><p>Clearly, though\u2026 a change of name did not have any effect whatsoever on Ke Jiusi. In the Demon Immortal Sect he was an arrogant silkpants who ran amok at will. Even if you changed his name to Ke Jiubaisi, \u2018think nine hundred times,\u2019 it still wouldn\u2019t do any good.</p><br/><p>Yes, he was an Elite Apprentice. However, he had the lowest Cultivation base of all the Elite Apprentices. Furthermore, of all the Elite Apprentices, he was the one who embraced his silkpants lifestyle the most. There wasn\u2019t a single person in the entire Demon Immortal Sect who didn\u2019t know that he had a violent temper, got into fights easily, acted tyrannically, and was known as the number one Demon Immortal Sect bully.</p><br/><p>He had earned such a reputation that his name alone was enough to cause any Outer Sect disciple to drop to the ground and kowtow. Even Inner Sect disciples became terror-stricken when hearing of him, and Conclave disciples would tremble. The other Elite Apprentices frowned because of him, and all the Elders in the Sects, as well as the seven great Sect Priests, all felt headaches coming on whenever they heard his name mentioned.</p><br/><p>His life up to now had been filled with countless preposterous events. The things he did forced his father, Ke Yunhai, Sect Priest and Paragon of the Fourth Peak, to constantly be remedying his blunders. All of the disputes caused by him ended up being mediated by his father.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, he had stolen a precious treasure from the Sixth Peak, and given it to an outsider. The matter could be considering poking the Heavens in the eye. Even his father had been unable to do anything but let go of his pride to smooth the matter over.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could only smile bitterly as the lightning chains once again pulled him back down to the center of the platform. After a moment, the chains vanished. However, Meng Hao knew that if he dared to stand up again, the movement would cause more lightning to fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Patriarch, Eldest Brother, just admit your fault. Don\u2019t butt heads with the Sect Priest\u2026.\u201d The other disciples neared, looking at Meng Hao with expressions of pain on their faces. Although Ke Jiusi ran wild on the outside as a silkpants, in the Fourth Peak, he was viewed almost like a child. Everyone held deep feelings for him.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Freelance PR and Mototsugu Oba</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was now obvious that they were calling out to Meng Hao\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>He had felt that there was something familiar about Fang Wei\u2019s aura from the very beginning. He\u2019d had his speculations, but it wasn\u2019t until now that those speculations were validated. [1. Meng Hao mentioned in chapter 897 that he sensed something familiar about Fang Wei]</p><br/><p>From Fang Wei\u2019s second and third Dharma Idols, Meng Hao got the feeling that\u2026 they actually belonged to him.</p><br/><p>They were\u2026 manifestations of his Nirvana Fruits!</p><br/><p>Now that the truth had presented itself in front of Meng Hao, he was unexpectedly calm. The entire clan had witnessed the Grand Elder giving him \u201chis\u201d Nirvana Fruits, so bringing up the subject would be useless.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled, a cold smile that contained no anger, but rather, calmness.</p><br/><p>He slowly stood up, then began to fly upward, relying on no magical items to resist the sunlight and heat. He put the matter of the Nirvana Fruits aside for now, and instead focused on a Daoist incantation.</p><br/><p>Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao!</p><br/><p>Flame Character Incantation!</p><br/><p>A blistering heat rose up inside of him that rapidly spread throughout his entire body. The heat turned into a sea of flames that spread out from Meng Hao, raging up to merge with the violet sunlight and absorb its heat.</p><br/><p>His Dharma Idol appeared behind him, and it was also surrounded by a sea of flames, making it look incredibly shocking.</p><br/><p>In that moment, his fleshly body seemed to be on the verge of making a breakthrough as he madly absorbed all of the intense heat around him.</p><br/><p>Within his mind was not just the Flame Character Incantation; he also had the Withering Character Incantation and the Self Character Incantation. These three Daoist incantations all seemed to merge together inside of him. Under the intense heat, Meng Hao\u2019s body began to wither, and yet, within that withering was an intense life force. [2. Meng Hao acquired the Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao in the Demon Immortal Pagoda in chapter 584. He reached a culmination of enlightenment about it in chapter 720, outside the Ancient Dao Lake. He used the \u201cSelf Character Incantation\u201d to create his second true self, starting in chapter 733. He combined the \u201cWithering Character Incantation\u201d with his Blood Demon Grand magic in chapter 770, and killed a Dao Seeking expert with the same incantation in chapter 774. It was mentioned quite a few other times, these are just some of the highlights.]</p><br/><p>In fact, as he withered, more violet sunlight and even more intense heat were incited by the Flame Character Incantation, causing his body to recover. The withering was then focused inside of him, transforming into a true black hole.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s Flame Character Incantation rapidly solidified as it absorbed the vast amounts of violet sunlight, causing the incantation to become thoroughly completed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao contains seven incantations,\u201d Meng Hao murmured. As of this moment, he gained more understanding of this Daoist magic that he had picked up in that primordial Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, it doesn\u2019t quite measure up to the Fang Clan\u2019s Reincarnation Incantation.\u201d Meng Hao sighed. The One Thought Reincarnation Incantation was one of the four great Daoist magics of the Fang Clan, and was famous throughout the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>Those four great Daoist magics were Daos of the clan, and even Meng Hao couldn\u2019t study them unless he exchanged enough merit points for it. Even then, he wouldn\u2019t personally be able to master them without the help of a Patriarch-level expert.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire\u2026. Light\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao was suddenly lost in thought, and began to see images in his mind. Within the vision, he saw a spherical mass of fire and light that was like a sun, or an eye.</p><br/><p>It was none other than\u2026 the Essence of Divine Flame beneath the lands of South Heaven!</p><br/><p>That was the most intense mass of fire and light that Meng Hao had ever seen in his entire life!</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes and began to recall his experience with the Essence of Divine Flame. Things began to grow clearer as he remembered returning to the third level of the underground land. In the moment that he had acquired some of that Essence, what he had seen was not the light of a sun, but rather\u2026 the flaming eye formed by the Essence of Divine Flame!</p><br/><p>In the same moment that Meng Hao was experiencing this vision, back in the lands of South Heaven, in the third level of that underground land, a place guarded by all the bizarre beasts, within a world of flames, the eye of the Essence of Divine Flame suddenly\u2026 opened!</p><br/><p>The moment that the eye opened, it seemed to form a resonance with the image of the Essence of Divine Flame that existed in Meng Hao\u2019s mind. Rumbling sounds could be heard, and Meng Hao\u2019s energy level suddenly began to rise.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the sea of flames around Meng Hao suddenly turned black. They swirled around him, transforming into an enormous spherical globe.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao existed in the very center of that globe, held up by his Dharma Idol. From a distance, it almost looked like he had\u2026 become a sun!</p><br/><p>This sun was far bigger and more realistic than the sun created by Taiyang Zi\u2019s divine ability, and the heat it radiated was boundless.</p><br/><p>Down in the ancestral mansion, the faces of the Elders who were watching the scene instantly flickered with shock. Even the Grand Elder, who had remained completely calm this entire time, felt his eyes going wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a projection! A projection of the sun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat divine ability is Fang Hao using!? I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s created a projection of the actual sun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn all the past years, only two people have ever created a projection of the sun during the rise of the East Ascension Sun, and they were Patriarchs, tens of thousands of years ago! And yet Fang Hao\u2026 is actually doing just that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Deep down in the Fang Clan ancestral mansion, in a stony cavern, seven archaic old men sat cross-legged.</p><br/><p>These seven were all incredibly famous figures. If they emerged into the outside world, they would cause a huge stir in the starry sky, and could suppress all living things.</p><br/><p>They sat cross-legged in meditation, and looked as if no aura of life existed in them whatsoever. The color of their clothing was varied, and currently, the old man who wore a crimson robe suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>He slowly raised his head, and his gaze penetrated through the rock and stone into the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aura of Essence\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Back outside, in the 90,000-meter position up in the sky, Meng Hao slowly opened his eyes. To those looking on, it appeared as if he was surrounded by a projection of the sun. However, Meng Hao knew that this was not the case. Instead\u2026 he had used his memories of the Essence of Divine Flame, as well as the Flame Character Incantation, to borrow the power of the sun and copy its image.</p><br/><p>He looked up at Fang Wei in his position at the 180,000-meter mark, and his expression became even more placid than before. Then, he lifted his right leg and then pushed it down, propelling himself high into the air!</p><br/><p>It was one movement, but it caused massive rumbling to fill the air. The void rippled, and even the sun high in the sky seemed to distort. At the same time, the sun surrounding Meng Hao began to expand.</p><br/><p>The path that stretched out in front of Meng Hao\u2019s eyes seemed to shrink, as if the intervening 90,000 meters were nothing more than a single meter!</p><br/><p>One movement spanned a single meter\u2026 but caused him to leap 90,000 meters! [3. Because of how I convert the measurements to meters, and also because of how Chinese uses special words for certain units of measurement (they have a unique word for 10,000), this sounds a lot cooler in Chinese. \u201cZhang\u201d is about 3 meters and \u201cchi\u201d is about 1/3 of that, in other words, one meter. The direct translation would be: It seemed as if a three 10,000 zhang distance had become three chi! One movement was three chi\u2026 but he stepped three 10,000 zhangs!]</p><br/><p>He passed Li Ling\u2019er, superseded Sun Hai and Taiyang Zi, and appeared directly above Fan Dong\u2019er!</p><br/><p>He\u2026 moved directly to a height of 180,000 meters. When he appeared next to Fang Wei, Fang Wei\u2019s eyes widened, and he shook visibly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was now radiating boundless violet light in the shape of a sun. It was a sight that shook Heaven and Earth, leaving everyone astonished. People watching from down below even had the mistaken impression that the sun had descended!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!!\u201d said Fang Wei. This was the first time he had become flustered. His face flickered, and he was so shaken by Meng Hao that he involuntarily retreated backward.</p><br/><p>Fan Dong\u2019er was panting as she stared up at Meng Hao. She had to admit that as of this moment, Meng Hao was shocking even to her. He had formed a projection of the sun, and crossed 90,000 meters in a single movement! It was terrifying!</p><br/><p>Zhou Xin of the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto looked on with a sharp gaze, virtually unable to believe the feeling of defeat that existed in his heart.</p><br/><p>Li Ling\u2019er took a deep breath as she gaped in shock. She knew that Meng Hao was Fang Mu, and she knew that with his latent talent, he was the number one figure in the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Even still, she was once again completely shaken by him.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Meng Hao\u2019s position in her mind was reaching the pinnacle, like a huge mountain that was impossible to supersede.</p><br/><p>Song Luodan trembled and bitterly lowered his head. Taiyang Zi stared blankly for a long moment before sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a blessing to be able to live in the same age as him, and thus, bear witness to his actions. It is a curse\u2026 because his brilliance casts everyone else in shadow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mu\u2019s fists were clenched tightly, and deep inside, he wanted to fight. His gaze was defiant as he repeatedly told himself that his surname was Wang, and that the surname Wang\u2026 had a very special meaning!</p><br/><p>To be a Chosen of the Wang Clan meant that you didn\u2019t lose to anyone!</p><br/><p>Sun Hai was shaken, and chuckled bitterly. He actually had no desire to compete with Meng Hao, and yet, he still sighed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hovered at the 180,000-meter position. Here, the sky was deep violet, almost black. It was so dark that only by looking closely could you pick up the violet hues. In addition, the sunlight was vastly more powerful than at the 90,000-meter position, so much so that it seemed capable of melting the body.</p><br/><p>Even magical items would be instantly transformed into a liquid that would quickly become nothing more than steam.</p><br/><p>However, Meng Hao\u2019s expression was calm. He was like a black hole, furiously absorbing the sunlight and heat. The sun that surrounded him looked just as magnificent as the sun that hung up above in the Heavens.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao turned to look at the grim-faced Fang Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Wei,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cDo you want to have a little competition? Let\u2019s see\u2026 who can go the highest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Wei\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even need to bet anything specific,\u201d Meng Hao said with a slight smile. \u201cHowever, the winner will get to punch the loser. Once. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I really feel like punching you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Wei snorted coldly, declining to say anything in response. Instead, he responded with action. The three Dharma Idols behind him suddenly exploded with power, and he himself shot high up into the sky.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as usual. As soon as Fang Wei flew up, he followed, and the two of them turned into bright streaks of light that shot upward.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, they had reached 210,000 meters!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s entire body was covered in flames. The sun which surrounded him was still in place, despite the fact that the light and heat here was ten times as powerful as it had been at the 180,000-meter position. Fang Wei was trembling, and the Dharma Statues behind him fell to pieces. Gritting his teeth, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a medicinal pill, which he immediately swallowed.</p><br/><p>It was a Skypalace Sunspirit Pill, and as soon as he consumed it, he threw his head back and roared, then shot even higher than before.</p><br/><p>225,000 meters. 240,000 meters!</p><br/><p>The sky was now completely black. Fang Wei\u2019s body was in flames, and fissures were spreading out across his skin. Even with the Skypalace Sunspirit Pill, he was incapable of staying at such a height for very long.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s sun was beginning to collapse, and his body withered. His flesh and blood appeared to be evaporating and dispersing. The intensity at the 240,000-meter position was ten times as powerful as before, and the heat and light had reached a terrifying level. However, even as his body withered, he looked over at Fang Wei with a cold gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan\u2019t keep up?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Fang Wei, this incredible heat and light was terrifying. It was the same for Meng Hao. However, there was something unique about Meng Hao; however ruthlessly he treated others\u2026 he treated himself even more ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao also had a Skypalace Sunspirit Pill, and yet, he didn\u2019t consume it. He wanted to use Fang Wei\u2019s arrogance to bring him down, to openly, and without any tricks, mess with him until he was destroyed and brought to ruin!</p><br/><p>He also wanted to damage Fang Wei\u2019s Dao heart, by defeating him without even needing to consume a single medicinal pill. It would be like a mortal blow to Fang Wei.</p><br/><p>Considering Fang Wei\u2019s level of intelligence, how could he not understand that Meng Hao was leading him on? This was obviously\u2026 a battle for the position of number one Chosen in the Fang Clan!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, all of the Fang Clan\u2019s experts, all of the Elders, and even the Grand Elder, were paying rapt attention!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

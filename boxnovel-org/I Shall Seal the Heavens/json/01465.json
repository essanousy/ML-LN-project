Although it was only an outline, and illusory, it was complete.</p><br/><p>You could even say that the sealing mark was comprised mostly of Meng Hao's divine will, which was currently the only way he could unleash it.</p><br/><p>The flickering sealing mark instantly appeared on the surface of the wall.</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, the wall began to vibrate, and a rumbling sound emanated out.</p><br/><p>The name Fang Mu appeared, and it immediately took the 1st place spot, shoving all the other names downward. Next to it was a number slightly higher than 30,000,000....</p><br/><p>It was a number hundreds of times larger than the original 1st place spot holder, a number which could shake Heaven and Earth!!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t really care about the name or the number. However, he could sense that the wall was apparently capable of accepting more than one of the sealing marks. He quickly performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, then pushed it down onto the wall. The second sealing mark flew out, and once again the wall shook. Intense rumbling sounds echoed out, and it took even longer this time for things to quiet down.</p><br/><p>When that happened, the number next to Fang Mu\u2019s name... went in the briefest of instants from more than 30,000,000... to the shocking number of 300,000,000!</p><br/><p>The terrifying level of that number so vastly exceeded that of the previous number that to speak it out loud would cause even a Paragon to gasp in shock.</p><br/><p>According to the rules of the Vast Expanse Shrine, 100,000 indicated that the divine ability was powerful enough to use on Dao Realm experts. 1,000,000 was the threshold for Dao Lords, and 10,000,000 for Dao Sovereigns. 100,000,000 was for 7-Essences Paragons. 1,000,000,000 was for 8-Essences, and as for 9-Essences... the number was 10,000,000,000 and higher.</p><br/><p>This wall had revealed the divine ability\u2019s final level of power, which had nothing to do with one\u2019s cultivation base. Therefore, it was possible to tell that the combined two sealing marks of Meng Hao\u2019s Hexing magic was powerful enough to shake 7-Essences Paragons.</p><br/><p>The terrifying level of that power was something that left even Meng Hao shaken, and caused a gleam of focus to appear in his eyes. As of this point, he was certain that his current Seal the Heavens Hex was definitely incredibly powerful.</p><br/><p>Eyes glittering, he once again placed his hand onto the wall. Using his divine will, he placed the third, fourth, and fifth sealing marks down.</p><br/><p>When the third sealing mark fused into the wall, the wall stayed whole, and the number next to Fang Mu\u2019s name rocketed up, reaching 1,000,000,000, then 2,000,000,000 and finally 3,000,000,000. That meant that three of the sealing marks together could shake an 8-Essences Paragon.</p><br/><p>When the fourth sealing mark fused with the others, the wall shook so hard that cracks began to spread out over its surface, which almost immediately tried to close up. The number next to Fang Mu\u2019s name changed again, reaching an astonishing level. It went from 3,000,000,000 all the way to 10,000,000,000, then 20,000,000,000. It didn\u2019t stop at 30,000,000,000, but actually kept going all the way to 60,000,000,000!!</p><br/><p>That incredible number resulting from the fusion of four of the sealing marks, 60,000,000,000 indicated that the divine ability could kill half of all 9-Essences Paragons!</p><br/><p>And that... was only the combination of four sealing marks!</p><br/><p>Next... the fifth sealing mark appeared, and more cracks spread out across the surface of the wall. A boom rang out as the wall reached its limit and exploded!</p><br/><p>Just before it completely fell apart, Meng Hao was able to see that the number next to the name Fang Mu had broken past 100,000,000,000, and was continuing to climb. However, he wasn\u2019t able to glimpse the final result, as the wall collapsed.</p><br/><p>His jaw dropped, and he couldn\u2019t help but inhale sharply. He lifted his hand and looked at it, and then a bright glow appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive Seal the Heavens Hex marks combined is enough to kill... a 9-Essences Paragon, even someone at the peak!\u201d Meng Hao took a deep breath, his eyes shining brightly as his heart filled with the anticipation of seeing the final version of the Ninth Hex.</p><br/><p>It was in this same moment that the wall collapsed, in which massive rumbling sounds echoed out, accompanied by brilliant light. The tenth level of the tower that was the Vast Expanse Shrine began to emit the dazzling light of... the Tenth Heaven!</p><br/><p>Throughout the entire history of the Vast Expanse School, only one person had ever summoned the Ninth Heaven. Now, Meng Hao was the first to summon the Tenth! It was... completely unprecedented!</p><br/><p>On this day, the first tolling of bells throughout the entire Vast Expanse School was because of the Ninth Heaven. The sound of those bells had just faded away, and no one had recovered from what would be a conversation topic in the cultivation world for many years to come.</p><br/><p>And yet, it was at that point... that bells began to toll again. From the First, Second, Third... all the way to the Ninth Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Why are there bells tolling again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that just an echo? I... I think I\u2019m hearing things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s... what\u2019s happening now!?!?\u201d As the bells rang, the disciples in the First through Eighth Sects looked around in shock as, yet again, a cold, emotionless voice spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Sect. Fang Mu. Tenth Heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was flabbergasted, including the supposed eagle-like Chosen, the powerful experts in the Dao Realm, and the Dao Lords and Dao Sovereigns.</p><br/><p>For a moment, complete silence filled the Vast Expanse School, but then a massive commotion broke out in which virtually everyone was shouting out in disbelief and shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! This is completely impossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Tenth Heaven! How could it be? That's the Tenth Heaven.... The Ninth Heaven just appeared! How could Fang Mu possibly have summoned the Tenth Heaven?! This... this is the making of a legend, the forging of a myth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheater! He definitely cheated! Dammit, there\u2019s something wrong here!\u201d Numerous cries filled the entire Vast Expanse School, causing everything to tremble.</p><br/><p>Most people either couldn't believe it, or didn't want to. The faces of the Chosen were ashen. The blow which they had just received was difficult to put into words.</p><br/><p>Even the Paragons were shaken. The faces of the 7-Essences and 8-Essences Paragons flickered, and at the same time, the meditating 9-Essences Paragons opened their eyes.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for even figures such as them to ignore what was happening. The Ninth Heaven was a major event, but the Tenth Heaven... was a pinnacle that no one had ever reached before.</p><br/><p>When a disciple like that appeared in a sect, even 9-Essences Paragons had to pay attention.</p><br/><p>The Sect Leader was the first to send his divine will out. It only took a moment for his suspicions to be aroused, and after various speculations, a wry expression appeared on his face, and he looked away.</p><br/><p>Golden-robed Jin Yunshan and Sha Jiudong both looked similarly suspicious; their uncertainty gave them a bit of pause.</p><br/><p>They were the only ones who picked up on the clues. All of the other 9-Essences Paragons were extremely interested about this Chosen named Fang Mu.</p><br/><p>However, they then recalled that the Ninth Sect was run by the inhuman Ninth Paragon, and they looked away, no longer the least bit interested in Fang Mu.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they didn\u2019t dare to be interested.</p><br/><p>The Vast Expanse School was even more excited than it had been before. The name Fang Mu was now a legend. Within the Ninth Sect, people were calling out loudly, even Yan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Even as the excited cries echoed out, Meng Hao appeared at the top of the Vast Expanse Shrine. The tenth level was over, and he had become the first person in the Vast Expanse School to ever summon the Tenth Heaven. Now, he even appeared to be standing atop that very Tenth Heaven.</p><br/><p>He looked like an Immortal being, his garments rippling, his hair floating around him. Then he looked up into the sky, and the roiling, churning black clouds.</p><br/><p>At that point, the Ten Heavens began to fade from the Vast Expanse Shrine. It started with the First Heaven, which became a beam of light that shot up and entered Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind trembled, and as the beam of light entered him, he could sense it converging on the first of the nine sealing marks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this good fortune from the Vast Expanse Shrine?\u201d he wondered to himself. \u201cAn additional bonus after the conclusion...?\u201d At the same time, the Second, Third, and Fourth Heavens... also vanished, becoming beams of light that shot toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>As they fused into him, he got more excited; the first sealing mark was rapidly becoming more solid. Then the Ninth and Tenth Heavens faded and shot into him, filling him with rumbling sounds.</p><br/><p>In the end, he took a deep breath, and his eyes shone with delight. The first of the nine sealing marks was now thirty percent complete!!</p><br/><p>Before he could spend much more time observing it, lightning bolts began to appear in the black clouds up above.</p><br/><p>100. 1,000. 10,000!</p><br/><p>Boundless Tribulation Lightning began to fall toward Meng Hao, filled with death and destruction. The 7-Essences Paragon and the others ceased to offer assistance. After all, since the lightning was clearly there just for Meng Hao, then he would need to face it alone.</p><br/><p>As they fell back, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes gleamed with brilliant light. As the disciples of the Ninth Sect all watched, rumbling sounds echoed out, and Meng Hao flew up into the air above the Vast Expanse Shrine, taking the initiative... to attack the Tribulation Lightning!</p><br/><p>He flew up into the sky, fearless, laughing coldly, a gleam of disdain visible in his eyes. He clearly wanted to fight.</p><br/><p>When the countless disciples down below saw that, they began to cheer loudly. It was an image that would be forever imprinted on their souls.</p><br/><p>To the Chosen, Meng Hao was being extremely domineering, acting in a completely and utterly brazen fashion.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

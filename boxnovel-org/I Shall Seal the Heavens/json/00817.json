A look of vicious hatred could be seen on her face, and she quickly performed a double-handed incantation, causing the conch shell to appear again!</p><br/><p>Just when she was about to blow it, Meng Hao flung her forcefully toward the well in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get in that well and blow your shell for my Inky!\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s face filled with shock as, before she could blow the conch, she descended into the well, her body completely out of her control.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Meng Hao performed an incantation, summoning the Ninth Mountain and sending it rumbling down toward the well.</p><br/><p>A miserable shriek rang out from inside the well as the Ninth Mountain slammed down and sealed the mouth of the well, followed by rumbling booms. Meng Hao flitted up to the peak of the mountain, where he sat down cross-legged, his face somewhat pale. The murderous gleam in his right eye vanished, and boundless black mist surged out from within him, which then transformed once again into his second true self.</p><br/><p>Blood oozed out from the sides of Meng Hao\u2019s mouth, and his second true self\u2019s eyes were somewhat dimmer than usual.</p><br/><p>This was a result of the backlash from forcing a separation before fully fusing.</p><br/><p>Everyone outside the courtyard was thoroughly shocked, and stared at Meng Hao in amazement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 he actually sealed the Goddess of the Nine Seas God World inside a well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly\u2026 that head which looks like it\u2019s been soaking in water for millions of years\u2026 came out from that well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, I should kill him for treating the Goddess like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the buzz of conversation filled the air, Zhao Yifan\u2019s eyes flickered. He stared at Meng Hao, his desire for combat growing ever stronger. After all, he lived to fight!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re good enough to suppress Fan Dong\u2019er,\u201d he thought, \u201cthen\u2026 I can\u2019t wait for day to break so that we can fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Luodan couldn\u2019t help but gasp in response to what had happened, as did Wang Mu, Li Ling\u2019er, Fang Donghan and many others. When they saw Meng Hao fight Fan Dong\u2019er and then seal her up, it instantly left an indelible impression in their minds.</p><br/><p>Taiyang Zi\u2019s face flickered, but, not willing to be outshone, he snorted coldly and said, \u201cYou finagled your way to victory. If you step foot outside, I\u2019ll fuse your bones and blood, burn your soul, and then kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chosen from the other Holy Lands and sects now had a much clearer understanding of who Meng Hao was, as did the Dao Protectors, whose eyes glittered brightly.</p><br/><p>The night grew deeper. Meng Hao sat on top of the mountain, listening to Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s shrieks echoing out from down below.</p><br/><p>She was inside the well, half submerged in water. Her scalp was numb with terror as inky black hair swirled around her. Although her surroundings were pitch black, because of her incredible cultivation base, she could just barely see the water-soaked head gazing steadily in her direction.</p><br/><p>If you think about it, anyone in this situation would feel their blood run cold and their hair stand on end. Fan Dong\u2019er couldn\u2019t hold back from screaming.</p><br/><p>The tendrils of black hair began to wrap around her, and the soaking head got closer and closer\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, I won\u2019t let you get away with this!\u201d she screamed. However, it didn\u2019t matter what divine abilities or magical techniques she used, there was nothing that could get her out of the well. In fact, the more magic she used, the more the black hair wrapped around her, and at one point, the floating head even touched her own head.</p><br/><p>An icy sensation spread out across her skin, and Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s scream was even shriller than before.</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao sat on top of the mountain, he snorted and said, \u201cInky, if you take care of this wench for me, then you can have her!\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, he had recovered most of his wounds, and he glanced over to look into the temple hall, at the bronze lamp which, thanks to Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s failure to enter the temple hall, had not been extinguished.</p><br/><p>A strange light shone in his eyes, and suddenly a bashful gleam could be seen within.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese Chosen all have lovely treasures on them, don\u2019t they\u2026.\u201d He licked his lips and smiled, which the crowds on the outside found very surprising.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Meng Hao smiling like that for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. That smile looks\u2026 bashful! Is something fishy going on\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao flew down off of the mountain and, as everyone watched, dug a hole and carefully put some black-peeled medicinal pills in it. Then, he cautiously stood on top of it, looked up, and extended his hand. The Lightning Cauldron appeared.</p><br/><p>Electric light glittered, spreading out across his body, and the bashfulness in his smile grew even more apparent as he looked out at the crowd with anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, Meng Hao\u2019s about to pull a con!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has that Form Displacement Transposition cauldron, and black-peeled medicinal pills under his feet. If you step on that pill lightly, nothing happens. But when he switches positions with someone, the slightest force will cause it to explode!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge! How could someone be so evil!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless! I\u2019ve never seen a bastard as shameless as him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the crowd began to back up, their faces flickering with various expressions. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes finally came to rest on Taiyang Zi, whose face instantly went white, and his eyes wide. Before he could say anything, lighting from Meng Hao\u2019s cauldron flashed, and he switched places with Taiyang Zi.</p><br/><p>The instant the change occurred, Taiyang Zi appeared in the middle of the courtyard, screaming. Apparently, this method of entering the courtyard did not violate the restrictive spells, so he was not instantly transformed into a pool of blood. However, as soon as his foot made contact with the medicinal pills, four or five of them instantly exploded, and he was engulfed in black mist.</p><br/><p>Taiyang Zi let out a bloodcurdling shriek, along with a spray of blood. Meng Hao\u2019s second true self instantly closed in on him.</p><br/><p>As for Meng Hao, as soon as he appeared outside the courtyard, he instantly produced his war chariot. Rumbling filled the air as he shot back into the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Only an afterimage remained in the spot he had just occupied, which was then instantly inundated by various divine abilities and magical techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so polite, Fellow Daoists!\u201d he called out, looking back at the crowd and waving. \u201cI don\u2019t need your gifts, really!\u201d The ripples from the explosions couldn\u2019t catch up with him, leaving the onlookers so frustrated that their gums itched.</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he have such a high cultivation base but be so despicable!?\u201d Numerous such curses filled the air.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao just smiled nonchalantly and hummed a little tune as he watched his second true self grab hold of Taiyang Zi and restrain him.</p><br/><p>When Taiyang Zi saw Meng Hao approaching, he began to tremble, and his eyes shone with a brilliant light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m from the Holy Land of Mount Sun! Our founder was Patriarch Sun\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>SMACK!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao walloped Taiyang Zi directly across the side of the face, causing blood to spray from his mouth, along with a couple teeth. He turned back to look at Meng Hao, a vicious expression of madness on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the moment I started practicing cultivation,\u201d said Meng Hao, \u201cI've heard Chosen like you say things like that when they\u2019re about to die. Do you know how annoying it is!?\u201d Thinking about how often he had heard words similar to those uttered by Taiyang Zi, he kicked Taiyang Zi sharply with his right foot.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say you were going to burn my bones and blood, then roast my soul?\u201d Meng Hao kicked down again.</p><br/><p>The shocked crowd looked on, trembling, as Taiyang Zi\u2019s howls entered their ears. The Dao Protectors and other cultivators from Mount Sun were enraged, and several of them flew forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay your hand!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, if you harm him, you\u2019ll call a great disaster down on yourself that will affect your entire clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the sun comes up, you\u2019re dead! No one will be able to save you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Mount Sun Dao Protectors stood outside the courtyard, glaring at Meng Hao and threatening him with gruesome words. In response, Meng Hao kicked Taiyang Zi again, provoking another miserable shriek, then turned and stared a the two Dao Protectors.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m from the archaic Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite! My dad is\u2014\u201d Meng Hao suddenly stopped talking and cleared his throat. Quite a few hateful looks appeared among the crowd, especially from the people from Mount Sun. It was quite obvious that Meng Hao had just been mocking Taiyang Zi\u2019s words from moments ago.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao grabbed Taiyang Zi and dragged him over to the well. He lifted the mountain and then said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and the wench fool around together down there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taiyang Zi\u2019s eyes went wide, and he let out a panic-stricken yelp as he struggled against Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and then said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you one last chance. You probably have a lot of magical items on you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go, and you can have them all!\u201d Taiyang Zi blurted. He was truly frightened; down below, he could see Fan Dong\u2019er and the soaking head, which was obviously a mysterious evil spirit connected to the Daoist rite temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m a gentleman and a man of my word!\u201d replied Meng Hao sternly. \u201cWhat makes you think that I would contaminate my Karma by stealing your magical items!?\u201d His expression became colder so quickly that Taiyang Zi gaped in shock. However, it only took a moment for his mind to flash with understanding, and he quickly unfastened his bag of holding and held it aloft.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019m giving it to you as a gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took it, opened it up, and looked through its contents. His eyes lit up, after which he turned to look at the command medallion hanging at Taiyang Zi\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, that looks pretty nice\u2026.\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can have it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? This thing is pretty nice too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you can have it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen one of these before\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can have it\u2026.\u201d Taiyang Zi was on the verge of tears as he handed his belongings over to Meng Hao one by one.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s hand closed around a fist-sized chunk of golden-colored stone which emanated an intense heat and blinding light. From the feeling it gave off, it almost seemed like something was sleeping inside. When Meng Hao swept it with his divine sense, the music of a great Dao filled his mind, and he sensed a pulsating aura of danger.</p><br/><p>It almost seemed like this rock\u2026 was a sun!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes widened as he looked it over. He had never seen anything quite like this particular item.</p><br/><p>He slowly pulled the rock out of Taiyang Zi\u2019s bag of holding.</p><br/><p>Immediately, people on the outside began to comment in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cA treasured magical item! It\u2019s a treasured magical item from Mount Sun!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMount Sun is really getting the short end of the stick today\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taiyang Zi\u2019s face was pale white as he looked bitterly at the rock in Meng Hao\u2019s hand. He had never even had a chance to take it out and use it before Meng Hao took it away from him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao closed his eyes as he examined the rock with his senses. After a moment, the heat emanating off of the rock seemed to decrease, and Meng Hao put it away. Then he opened his eyes and looked at Taiyang Zi. Eyes narrowing, he pulled out a piece of paper and a pen from within his robe, then handed them over to Taiyang Zi, whose eyes went wide with shock.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Hundreds of Solitary Sword Sect disciples stared at Meng Hao in shock and disbelief. As the seconds ticked by, their eyes filled with intense fear.</p><br/><p>In the Cultivation world, respect is delivered to the powerful. Meng Hao was only at the mid Foundation Establishment stage, but the efficiency with which he had vanquished the great circle of late Foundation Establishment left a deep impression on everyone. Their fear transformed into respect. Respect for Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>No one said anything. They watched him as he left the Battle Arena, the shy look still on his face as he walked back to Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan gaped at him for a long moment. And then, a smile broke out on his face and he started to laugh. His laughter shattered the silence, and a hubbub immediately broke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that guy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the mid Foundation Establishment stage but actually defeated the great circle of Foundation Establishment! This type of Cultivation base\u2026 this type of power\u2026 he can\u2019t be a nobody!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 seems almost like a Dao Child! The magic he just used seemed somewhat familiar. It was like the Black Sieve Sect\u2019s 19 Black Cloud Strikes\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of discussion echoed about. Zhou Shanyue\u2019s face was pale as he staggered back a few steps. He tilted his head and stared closely at Meng Hao, the first time he had done so. Previously, he had thought Chen Fan was the one he needed to pay most attention to. His eyes filled with an intense, venomous hatred and rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou despicable, shameless bastard! You\u2019re a swindler!! You obviously know the power of your Cultivation base and pretended to be weak! You avoided battle before with the sole purpose of picking this fight!! Your depravity knows no bounds!!\u201d Zhou Shanyue was gnashing his teeth and cursing as middle-aged Li exited the Battle Arena, his face pale. He chuckled bitterly, looking at Meng Hao with complex expression that included hatred and other emotions.</p><br/><p>He still didn\u2019t understand. Clearly, he had been played. He\u2019d thought he had the situation completely under control, and yet it turned out that his opponent had effortlessly tricked him.</p><br/><p>Then he thought of the Spirit Stones he had wagered, which weren\u2019t even his. He had borrowed them from surrounding fellow Sect members and had to pay back everything with interest. His face grew even more ashen.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gave a light cough. His expression bashful, he said, \u201cYou were the ones who insisted on the match.\u201d Zhou Shanyue trembled. With the flick of a sleeve, he turned to leave, clearly intending to go back on his word and not hand over the jade pendant.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan gave a cold snort. \u201cJunior Brother Zhou,\u201d he said coolly, \u201cThe stakes of a bet mean nothing, but the prestige of the Solitary Sword Sect is everything. Don\u2019t tell me you intend to break your word!?\u201d Instantly, the eyes of all the surrounding Cultivators came to rest on Zhou Shanyue.</p><br/><p>They were all Solitary Sword Sect disciples. They might not always be able to measure up to others in terms of skill, but the importance of upright conduct had been drilled into them from the moment they joined the Sect. One\u2019s word could not be broken.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shanyue felt the eyes of hundreds of his fellow disciples upon him, and his expression flickered. He stamped his foot angrily on the ground. Heart aching, he took off his life-saving jade pendant and threw it toward Meng Hao. He also tossed out a drop of his own blood.</p><br/><p>He glared at Meng Hao, his eyes filled with fury and disgrace. If he could, he would kill Meng Hao hundreds of times over. Finally, his body turned into a colorful beam that shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao coughed lightly again. Such gazes were not unfamiliar to him, and he was actually used to them. His eager gaze next fell upon Li\u2019s bag of holding. Inside were the tens upon tens of thousands of Spirit Stones which he had put up as stakes in the bet.</p><br/><p>Pale faced, Li couldn\u2019t help but wonder how he would possibly pay back his fellow Sect members. Then he thought about how he owed literally hundreds of people, and his vision grew dim.</p><br/><p>Without the slightest trace of politeness, Chen Fan walked up and grabbed the bag of holding. Li did nothing to stop him. He could only smile sadly. Chen Fan was just about to turn and walk back, when Meng Hao coughed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother, there\u2019s also a sword worth tens of thousands of Spirit Stones.\u201d Could Meng Hao really forget that? Considering how much he cared about Spirit Stones, as well as desire to join a Sect, he might be able to forget about other things. But he could never forget matters related to Spirit Stones.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sword?\u201d Chen Fan said to pale-faced Li, holding his hand out.</p><br/><p>Face bitter, Li produced the sword. His heart trembled, and felt as if it would tear in half. He handed it over to Chen Fan, and from his expression, it looked like he was handing over the love of his life.</p><br/><p>He glared murderously at Meng Hao, the venom in his eyes growing stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo shame whatsoever!\u201d he said, clenching his jaw. He flicked his sleeve, turned and left.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan gave a cold snort, and then hurried away with Meng Hao and all the winnings. They returned to his house, their faces covered with smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother, we won out this time. But next time,\u201d he exhorted earnestly, \u201cyou can\u2019t do something like that. That was extremely dangerous, and also, you now have to worry about those two trying to get back at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded, knowing that Chen Fan was simply concerned for him. With a smile, he said, \u201cElder Brother, how about I take the Spirit Stones, and you keep the jade pendant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan thought for a moment, and then replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need it. You take it. Listen to your Elder Brother. You take everything. This is my Sect, so I have everything I need. As for the jade pendant\u2026 consider this: You take it, but when Master emerges from secluded meditation, return it. After all, you will eventually be a member of the Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao tried to convince him to take the piece of jade, but Chen Fan, although he didn\u2019t directly refuse, declined to take it. Finally, Meng Hao collected together all his winnings, whereupon Chen Fan produced some more alcohol. The two Brothers sat down to drink, and chatted about the Reliance Sect.</p><br/><p>A few days passed, and Chen Fan\u2019s master continued to remain in secluded meditation. The date of the banquet at the Song Clan drew closer. Finally, one morning at dawn, the sound of bells filled the Solitary Sword Sect.</p><br/><p>At the bottom of the mountain was a stretch of ground normally covered with restrictive spells. Currently, people were flying from all directions toward this very area.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was among them, flying alongside Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>As he approached, the first thing Meng Hao noticed was an enormous teleportation portal, surrounded by nine stone pillars. Not far away from it, a gray-robed old man sat cross-legged and motionless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the portal keeper,\u201d said Chen Fan quietly. \u201cHis only job is to keep watch over the teleportation portal.\u201d Meng Hao nodded, shifting his gaze to look at the portal itself as well as the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>Other than Chen Fan and himself, there were three others present. They all wore the Daoist robes of the Solitary Sword Sect, and had large swords strapped to their backs. When he looked at them, they looked back and gave him slight nods.</p><br/><p>With a smile, Meng Hao clasped hands and saluted them. They smiled back.</p><br/><p>Despite the lack of any words being exchanged, Meng Hao could tell that they knew who he was. Obviously, his match with Li had gained him no small amount of prestige in the Solitary Sword Sect over the past few days.</p><br/><p>Time passed, and more people arrived. After the time it takes half an incense stick to burn, there were about eighteen people present. None of them were very old; most were around thirty, and some seemed to be as young as twenty.</p><br/><p>They seemed to brim with vitality, and were all extraordinarily good looking. Furthermore, all of them were in the Foundation Establishment stage, two of the group being at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><br/><p>As they arrived, each one would look at Meng Hao. Some would then nod, others simply ignored him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon Elder Fan will arrive,\u201d whispered Chen Fan. \u201cHe\u2019ll lead us through the teleportation portal to the Song Clan. Your Elder Brother is going to work hard to get you a beloved!\u201d He chuckled, but his expression was very serious.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gaped. This was the second time Chen Fan had brought up the matter. Meng Hao had a strange feeling about this trip to the Song Clan.</p><br/><p>Time passed, and soon a beam of light appeared in the sky, a few dozen meters wide. In an instant, it had reached them, and an old man appeared, wearing a voluminous Daoist robe. His face was ruddy, and he had a full head of long, white hair. He carried a gourd of alcohol in his hand, and strapped to his back was a huge pitch-black sword.</p><br/><p>He had a brandy nose, and his entire body emanated the smell of alcohol. His robe was wrinkled and messy. He burped.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Elder Fan!\u201d said Chen Fan and the others, immediately clasping hands in salute. Meng Hao also bowed his head and clasped hands in greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you little brats. Let\u2019s see if any of you are lucky enough to take that Song girl in marriage and bring honor to the ancestors of the Solitary Sword Sect\u2026.\u201d The old man\u2019s sonorous voice echoed out, shaking Meng Hao, and even the very ground, it seemed.</p><br/><p>When he said the words \u201cbring honor to the ancestors,\u201d his voice grew especially loud, causing the gray-robed man to open his eyes and then slowly shake his head. He seemed to find the wording somewhat inappropriate. However, he said nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely not a Core Formation Cultivator,\u201d thought Meng Hao, taking a deep breath. He had seen Nascent Soul eccentrics before, and it seemed\u2026 that\u2019s exactly what this man was! Nascent Soul stage!</p><br/><p>Chen Fan stepped forward. Raising hands again in a respectful salute, he said, \u201cElder Fan, this is a disciple from my former Sect, my Junior Brother who\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. No problem! Don\u2019t forget to bring me a few jugs of your master\u2019s alcohol when we get back.\u201d The old man clapped Chen Fan on the shoulder. He glanced at Meng Hao, and then strode forward toward the teleportation portal.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hesitated for a moment and then said, \u201cElder Brother, this trip to the Song Clan\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan hurriedly replied. \u201cThe Song Clan has an urgent need for a son-in-law, so they\u2019ve invited the five Sects and two Clans to visit. Little Junior Brother, if you play your cards right, you might have a chance. Whether you join the Solitary Sword Sect, or become a member of the Song Clan, you will soon have a proper foundation upon which to practice Cultivation.\u201d He grabbed Meng Hao\u2019s sleeve and dragged him toward the teleportation portal.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was hesitant for a moment, and then made his decision. \u201cThe people from the Solitary Sword Sect are here, so I can\u2019t try to get the meat jelly to help me change my appearance. This isn\u2019t really working out how I want it to. Oh well, once we get to the Song Clan, I\u2019ll think of an excuse to get away.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

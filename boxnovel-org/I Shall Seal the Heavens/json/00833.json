This was especially true considering everything she had said in front of Meng Hao\u2019s parents. When she thought about that, her scalp went numb.</p><br/><p>Likewise, how could Meng Hao forget all of the venomous things she had said just moments ago? He reached out and took the bottle, looked at it, then threw it back to Fang Xiangshan. The bottle was not unfamiliar to him; there had been many like it inside the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple.</p><br/><p>Although it had the music of a Dao inside, that was simply because it had existed inside the temple for so long.</p><br/><p>Ignoring Fang Xiangshan, Meng Hao turned and transformed into a beam of light that shot off into the distance. When he finally disappeared, the three old Dao Protectors sighed and helped the injured Fang Yunyi to his feet, then took him and terrified Fang Xiangshan off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Several days passed by in a flash. During that time, Meng Hao traveled around in the Eastern Lands, mostly in the area surrounding the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple mountains. He didn\u2019t reveal his appearance or aura, but instead concealed it with the bamboo hat.</p><br/><p>As for clothing, he pulled out a long robe that had belonged to Sun Hai from the Church of the Emperor Immortal. He roamed through the area slowly, waiting.</p><br/><p>Waiting\u2026 for those two damned bandits!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare they steal business from me!\u201d he thought, his expression dark. Meng Hao had long since been brooding about the two mysterious bandits who had stolen all the items that belonged to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, I know exactly which bastards pulled such a shameless stunt!\u201d He snorted coldly as he flew through midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose two bastards fled during my battle with the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, and haven\u2019t dared to show their faces since then. This time, I\u2019ll definitely track them down!\u201d For some reason, Meng Hao was certain that there was no one other than the meat jelly and the parrot who could have accomplished something that caused him to lose out on so much.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough, those two little bastards aren\u2019t that strong. How could they have managed to rob so many Chosen?\u201d Meng Hao was very curious about this, and it was the one thing he couldn\u2019t figure out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they come across some sort of good fortune?\u201d he thought suspiciously. He continued to fly through midair in the region near the mountain range. Three days passed, until finally, he ran into one of the Eastern Lands\u2019 walled cities. He glanced at it, then slowly and deliberately flew around in the city a few times before finally making his way off into the distance.</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t notice was that in one of the city\u2019s inns, two pairs of eyes were surreptitiously peering out at him.</p><br/><p>Two burly fellows, tall and sturdy, were at a table slurping alcohol and chomping down on meat. One of them sat cross-legged in a chair, the other squatted down next to the table. Apparently, those were the only positions that were comfortable to these two.</p><br/><p>Even stranger, the burly fellow who sat there cross-legged would drink the alcohol in huge slurps, and would toss enormous quantities of food into his mouth with each bite. As for the other man, he\u2026 pecked at his food almost like a bird would.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d said the bird-like man. He blinked, and then a wily gleam appeared in his eyes as he watched Meng Hao disappear off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d said the other man, looking up to stare at Meng Hao\u2019s retreating figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot!\u201d said the bird-like man, smacking the other man hard across the head. \u201cFool! Get a brain, would you!! Lord Fifth has hauled you around for so many years now! How could you still be so stupid!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d roared the big man, food spraying from his mouth, revealing dancing electricity inside. \u201cYou\u2019re being immoral! You\u2019re being shameless! This isn\u2019t right! I\u2019m gonna convert you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet down,\u201d said the bird-like man self-assuredly. \u201cListen to me, did you see that guy with the bamboo hat? He was hiding his aura. That hat is definitely some kind of treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTreasure!?\u201d said the big man, his eyes lighting up.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Definitely a treasure. Based on my experience, people who carry treasures like that are usually weaklings. They\u2019re basically lambs waiting for the slaughter!</p><br/><p>\u201cHave faith in the Lord Fifth; that guy is definitely an easy mark! Furthermore, his cultivation base probably isn\u2019t very high, but his bag of holding is probably very deep. Did you see his clothes? Not too long ago, we robbed a guy who was wearing clothes exactly like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost important of all, he clearly doesn\u2019t want people to recognize him. That indicates he has secrets! Secrets, I tell you!\u201d The bird-like man was continuing to get more and more excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecrets!\u201d exclaimed the big man, his eyes glowing brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith secrets like that, and a weak cultivation base, plus a plump bag of holding\u2026 he\u2019s definitely ripe for the plucking. Besides, a single look, and you can tell he\u2019s the kind of person who knows how to dress well. He\u2019s the perfect mark for us. Trust me, if we can clean him out, then we\u2019ll be able to live in complete comfort.\u201d The bird-like man was even more excited than before.</p><br/><p>The big man\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly, but then he hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we failed so many other times, and even almost got captured. Especially in the past few days. Whenever you take on HIS appearance, we end up getting chased by everyone\u2026. Wait, is he a bully?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got it!\u201d said the bird-like man, nodding. \u201cOf course he\u2019s a bully. He couldn\u2019t be anything else! Look, we\u2019ll definitely succeed this time, just have faith in the Lord Fifth. All the other times were mere mishaps. Those Chosen have all left, so the only people left behind have got to be easy marks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStraighten him out!\u201d said the big man, clenching his jaw and nodding his head. \u201cFudge, Lord Third is gonna set him straight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, let Lord Fifth plan this out. A person like that, hmm\u2026 there\u2019s an eighty to ninety percent chance that he\u2019s a ladies man. Okay, we can\u2019t use the same tactic that we used before. This time, we\u2019ll directly implement plan #9. Quickly, transform into a hot babe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c#9? Which one is nine? How dare you ridicule Lord Third!!\u201d the big man raged.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 #3! Plan #3!!\u201d replied the bird-like man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell why didn\u2019t you say so earlier? Alright, who should I look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnybody, it doesn\u2019t matter, as long as she\u2019s hot and seductive. Come, hurry up, we need to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHot and seductive?\u201d The big man thought for a moment, and then a popping sound rang out as he changed form. Now he was a woman, extremely curvaceous and completely alluring, with a beautiful, entrancing face, and eyes that tugged at the heart and soul.</p><br/><p>If Meng Hao were here, he would instantly recognize that this was\u2026 Demoness Zhixiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo many clothes!\u201d said the bird-like man. \u201cCome on, less clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pop!</p><br/><p>The big man changed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re way too revealing! Y-y-you, you idiot! How could you even go outside looking like that!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After seven or eight adjustments, the bird-like man was satisfied and prodded the other man out the door.</p><br/><p>The big man in Zhixiang form wore extremely revealing clothes, and felt completely resentful because of it. Consequently, he started picking his nose and making big, manly strides as they walked down the road, causing the bird-like man to fly into a rage. More adjustments were made.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had just left the city. Beneath the bamboo hat, he was frowning. After traveling around the area near the mountain range for all these days, he still hadn\u2019t run into the two bastards he was looking for.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould they have left?\u201d he thought. \u201cOr maybe they detected my aura?\u201d Suddenly, his face flickered, and he spun around. There, in midair not too far off, a woman was approaching him. An anxious expression could be seen on her face, as if she were being pursued.</p><br/><p>The instant the woman appeared, Meng Hao\u2019s jaw dropped in astonishment.</p><br/><p>This woman was none other than Zhixiang, which was of course the big man in disguise.</p><br/><p>She wore revealing clothing, and smelled like a spring breeze. She possessed an alluring charm and grace, and had a flirtatious look in her eyes, eyes that seemed capable of enchanting anyone who looked into them. Most people who laid eyes on her would instantly find their hearts pounding.</p><br/><p>As she passed Meng Hao, she looked over and smiled shyly. Then she made to hurry off. However, before she could get very far, she turned and looked back at him, apparently having been attracted to him in some way. She gave him an entrancing, tantalizing look, then turned and walked off, her curves undulating gently. The sight of her slender figure from behind was enough to cause any man who saw her to palpitate with eagerness.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gaped.</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhixiang\u2019 was not happy at all, and was inwardly muttering about how obvious things had been made, and yet the mark didn't respond at all. Instead, he just stared with a slack jaw. Finally, \u2018Zhixiang\u2019 intentionally spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Her face went pale, and she staggered in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist, save me!\u201d she cried, looking back at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes were wide as he examined \u2018Zhixiang.\u2019 Then, a virtually imperceptible smile appeared in his eyes. Grinning, he approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith me here,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have nothing to fear, Fellow Daoist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s chasing me,\u201d said \u2018Zhixiang\u2019 lightly, her voice somewhat weak and yet even more enticing than before. \u201cAs I fled, I was injured. Fellow Daoist, if you can escort me to my Immortal\u2019s cave, then I\u2019ll definitely be very grateful\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inwardly, Meng Hao laughed loudly, and mused about how fake this whole act was, and yet he smiled the same as before, and immediately nodded. Then, he flew into the air with the woman. The two of them sped into the mountains, to an Immortal\u2019s cave. The woman gestured for him to follow her inside.</p><br/><p>At this point, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes narrowed. The Immortal\u2019s cave seemed extraordinary. The spell formation outside radiated a sense of danger, and based on Meng Hao\u2019s cultivation base, he knew that even he would have a tough time breaking out of it.</p><br/><p>After stepping into the Immortal\u2019s cave, the woman sighed, and then stopped and turned to Meng Hao with a charming smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Fellow Daoist,\u201d she said, intentionally edging closer to him. \u201cWould you mind acting as Dharma Protector for me here? Once my wounds are recovered, I\u2019ll definitely repay your kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, no problem!\u201d said Meng Hao, suppressing the urge to vomit. He backed up a few steps.</p><br/><p>The disguised man frowned. Things weren\u2019t going according to plan, and now he wasn\u2019t sure what to do. He quickly stamped his foot onto the ground, which instantly sent a secret notification to the bird-like man.</p><br/><p>After a few breaths of time passed, the door of the Immortal\u2019s cave slammed open, and a monstrous aura surged out that gave Meng Hao quite a shock. A man emerged, wearing black robes, his features handsome. He even emanated the aura of a scholar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re back, wife!\u201d said the young man, laughing. However, when he saw Meng Hao and \u2018Zhixiang,\u2019 he suddenly stopped in place, and then his eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlut! Y-you\u2019re actually committing adultery right here!?!?\u201d The young man\u2019s face twisted with rage, and his aura exploded with power. Heaven and Earth went dark, and everything began to tremble and seemed to be on the verge of exploding. The door of the Immortal\u2019s cave exploded, and the shocking spell formation Meng Hao had seen collapsed into pieces.</p><br/><p>A terrifying aura raged out that far exceeded the Spirit Realm. It was incredibly powerful, and made it seem as if an Immortal was descending. The entire area was instantly locked down, causing an intense sense of deadly crisis to rise up in Meng Hao\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if the person standing in front of him had an aura that could easily decide whether or not he lived or died.</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband, this is all just a misunderstanding\u2026.\u201d said \u2018Zhixiang.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstanding my ass! Get the hell out of my way! Since we're husband and wife, I won\u2019t kill you this day. However, this paramour of yours had better give me some compensation! I don\u2019t care what sect he comes from, when the one surnamed Meng wants a person dead, who would dare to save him!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered as he looked at the young man, and a strange expression appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>This young man looked\u2026 exactly like Meng Hao himself!</p><br/><p>Of course, Meng Hao was wearing the bamboo hat, which changed his appearance in such a way that no one would be able to recognize him.</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 833: An Amateurish Seduction Con</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

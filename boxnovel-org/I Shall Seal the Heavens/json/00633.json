During the seven days, the injures gradually healed by about thirty percent. Unfortunately, his fleshly body still couldn\u2019t hold together without the help of the meat jelly. It still needed time to grow stable. However, the wounds were gradually fusing shut.</p><br/><p>Every day, he would eat three meals of fruit, personally delivered by the young woman. She was always very respectful.</p><br/><p>She even offered up some Spirit Stones. Whatever Meng Hao requested was provided in full, and all his questions about the Milky Way Sea were answered in detail.</p><br/><p>In addition to healing himself, Meng Hao was able to gain quite an understanding about the area.</p><br/><p>During the seven days, the surface of the Milky Way Sea was calm and quiet. The Zhang ship from the Outer Sea bravely proceeded onward as it had from the beginning. Of course, now that Meng Hao was on board, everyone was a bit more nervous than before. However, nothing untoward occurred.</p><br/><p>As time passed and Meng Hao continued to stay in secluded meditation, the young woman gradually felt more at ease. Her previous cheerful and playful attitude returned. Occasionally, her laughter rang out, filled with a bit of childish naivety.</p><br/><p>The other three Foundation Establishment Cultivators on the boat were as nervous as ever. They understood what the Clan Leader was thinking, but in their opinion, what she was doing was like asking a tiger for its own skin, expecting a bad person to act against his own interest. In their opinion, young people like her didn\u2019t understand the ruthlessness of the Cultivation world. On the other hand, the three of them, having practiced cultivation up to the level of Foundation Establishment, and having maintained the position of the Clan on their island in the Outer Sea, had experienced many situations of deadly crisis.</p><br/><p>They well knew that in the Cultivation world, the law of the jungle prevailed, and danger was the norm. One bad thing could lead to complete destruction, and could even affect an entire Clan.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had randomly appeared out of a bizarre black hole. Although he was weak and severely injured, the look he had given them seven days ago had caused them to feel as if they were frozen dead in the middle of winter.</p><br/><p>They had the intense sensation that if Meng Hao wanted to kill them, then it wouldn\u2019t matter if he was even more severely injured, they would all be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Currently, all of three of them stood at the stern of the ship, frowning and giving voice to the same concerns.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter with the Clan Leader\u2026 it\u2019s not wise!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man was severely injured, and arrived via teleportation. From the look of things, he must but the subject of pursuit. If his pursuers catch up with him, it could bring about the destruction of all of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi! I know what the Clan Leader is thinking. This journey to Saint's Island is our last shot. If we succeed, we can strike some fear into the Liu Clan so that they don\u2019t dare to act recklessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can only hope that Nan\u2019er will fight to excel. Hopefully he can stick out in the Footloose Sect\u2019s competition for new disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them exchanged glances and then sighed lightly.</p><br/><p>The Patriarch of the Zhang Clan had founded their island in the Outer Sea. However, after he passed away in meditation, they had been forced to tread as carefully as if walking on thin ice. Another Core Formation Cultivator hadn\u2019t appeared in the Clan, which meant that the island they occupied soon came to be eyed greedily by surrounding neighbors.</p><br/><p>Were it not for the spell formation left in place by the Patriarch before he passed away, as well as the magical items and social connections he had made, then they would have long since lost their island and become an auxiliary Clan.</p><br/><p>They had managed to hold on for a while, until finally a crisis loomed. The Liu Clan, who occupied a nearby island, had long since begun to glare at them like a tiger eyeing its prey. Slaughter had been on the verge of breaking out.</p><br/><p>During that moment of critical danger, the Zhang Clan Leader, which was none other than the beautiful young woman, had made a difficult decision. She took all of her people and left the island in secret to deliver her son to the Footloose Sect.</p><br/><p>If he became a disciple of the Footloose Sect, then his identity would be enough to intimidate anyone in the Outer Sea. It would protect the Zhang Clan for at least around a hundred years.</p><br/><p>The three Foundation Establishment Cultivators continued to discuss matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis whole thing is going to be very difficult\u2026. There\u2019s no need to even mention that after arriving at Saint's Island, it\u2019s impossible to know if Nan\u2019er will be able to distinguish himself amongst the crowd and enter the Footloose Sect. Regardless of anything, our path is going to be one of extreme danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Rumors will have spread, and the news leaked. The Liu Clan won\u2019t be willing to accept this\u2026. We can only hope that they react too slowly. Hopefully we left early enough to seize a superior position and evade their pursuit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition to the Liu Clan, there are also the numerous sea beasts that roam between the Outer Sea and the Fourth Ring, not to mention the cruel rogue Cultivators. How could our path possibly be one of peace and security?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, this really is our only chance\u2026.\u201d The three once more sighed and then lapsed into silence. They understood what the Clan Leader was trying to do, and since she had already made her decision, there was no need to spend time worrying.</p><br/><p>Who knew? Perhaps\u2026 inviting the wounded expert to stay with them might have some extraordinary outcome.</p><br/><p>At the same time that the three of them were having their discussion, the Zhang Clan Leader, the young woman, stood at the prow of the boat, clasping her son\u2019s hand. She looked off into the sky up above, unable to conceal her expression of anxiety and unease.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur voyage will continue for three more days before we reach the Fourth Ring,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAfter leaving the Outer Sea behind, then we really will have evaded the Liu Clan\u2026.\u201d Although the Liu Clan was not weak, that was only when speaking in terms of the Outer Sea. In the Fourth Ring, they could be considered bugs. In the analysis of the young woman, once they entered the Fourth Ring, the Liu Clan would most likely give up any pursuit and not dare to follow.</p><br/><p>After all, she and her Clan were at the end of their rope, whereas the Liu Clan wouldn\u2019t dare to rashly put themselves in danger.</p><br/><p>She looked down at her son and patted his head. \u201cNan\u2019er, you need to remember, the Footloose Sect pays a lot of attention to seniority. After we arrive, you must not make any breaches of etiquette.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy didn\u2019t seem to understand what she meant, but he nodded his head obediently. Her eyes filled with a doting expression, and she was just about to lean over to pick him up when her expression flickered and she suddenly looked behind her.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the three Foundation Establishment Cultivators in the stern also looked back.</p><br/><p>What they saw was a pitch-black ship speeding toward them at top speed. The flag flying on the ship was clearly emblazoned with a huge character.</p><br/><p>Liu !</p><br/><p>This was a ship from the Outer Seas Liu Clan. They had been in full pursuit for days, and had finally caught up. On the prow of the ship stood four people, three of whom wore extremely respectful expressions. The other was clearly different than them.</p><br/><p>He was an old man with an aloof expression. His eyes flashed like lightning, and he held his hands clasped behind his back. His voluminous robe flapped in the wind, and his long, white hair made him look completely extraordinary.</p><br/><p>His Cultivation base emanated the ripples of the early Core Formation stage. It was for this reason that the Liu Clan ship had been able to pursue at top speed for so many days.</p><br/><p>As soon as the young woman caught sight of the old man, the blood drained from her face. She began to pant, and her hands clasped down tightly onto her son.</p><br/><p>The other three Foundation Establishment Cultivators of the Zhang Clan also felt their hearts beginning to pound. Their faces paled, and their eyes filled with despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Clan\u2026 Patriarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Liu Clan ship neared, the appearances of the old man and the other three who accompanied him grew clearer. Behind them appeared seven or eight Qi Condensation Clan members, all of whom wore expressions of disdain.</p><br/><p>Standing next to the Liu Clan Patriarch was a middle-aged man. He smiled and said, \u201cZhang Wenfang, what\u2019s your hurry? Now that you\u2019ve abandoned your Zhang Clan island, where exactly do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><br/><p>[1. Zhang Wenfang\u2019s name in Chinese is  zh\u0101ng w\u00e9n f\u0101ng - Zhang is a family name. Wen can mean \u201cculture, language, gentle.\u201d Fang means \u201cfragrant\u201d]</p><br/><p>Zhang Wenfang walked to the stern of the ship, took a deep breath and then said, \u201cJunior offers greetings, senior Liu. Senior, we\u2019ve abandoned our island, and would simply like to get as far away as possible. Our two Clans were friends in the past. Don\u2019t tell me you won\u2019t even give us a chance to survive?\u201d The other Zhang Clan Cultivators gathered around her, their faces filled with extreme grief and indignation.</p><br/><p>The young woman\u2019s words were directed, not toward the man who had spoken, but toward the Liu Clan Patriarch. Despite matters having reached their current state, she still addressed him respectfully.</p><br/><p>The Liu Clan Patriarch said nothing; he merely looked on with a proud expression. The Clan member standing next to him was the one to respond, his tone of voice filled with ridicule. \u201cWhat a joke! Do you really take us to be three-year-old children? Do you really think we don\u2019t know of your plan, Zhang Wenfang? You\u2019re obviously journeying to the Footloose Clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior can abandon everything, even deliver our island to you, senior. I can also swear that we have no intention to encroach on what is not ours. I just beg of you to be a bit lenient\u2026.\u201d Zhang Wenfang\u2019s face was pale, but before she could finish speaking, the Liu Clan Patriarch frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cPipe down!\u201d he said coolly, his voice echoing about like thunder in all directions. The seawater roiled, and the minds of the Zhang Wenfang and the other Clan members filled with a droning sound.</p><br/><p>One sentence, two words. All of the Qi Condensation Clan members coughed up blood. Only Zhang Wenfang and the other Foundation Establishment Cultivators got by with only pale faces. Their expressions were filled with increasing hopelessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you come up with so much nonsense?\u201d said the Liu Clan Patriarch, his voice cool. \u201cKill them all! Old people, children, don\u2019t leave a single one alive!\u201d With that, he waved his sleeve, and the surrounding Liu Clan members flew up into the air, vicious expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wenfang clenched her teeth and looked back at the ship\u2019s quarterdeck. \u201cSenior Liu!\u201d she suddenly cried. \u201cIf you have a quarrel with the Zhang Clan, you can kill us, but do you really dare to trifle with our honored guest?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill making things up?\u201d said the Liu Clan Patriarch with a cold snort. \u201cYou expect me to believe that the Zhang Clan has a Nascent Soul guest aboard? Or is it a Spirit Severing expert? Wouldn\u2019t that be a bit more threatening?\u201d He had already swept the ship with Spiritual Sense, and had detected only the Zhang Clan Cultivators and mortals on the ship, no one else.</p><br/><p>By this point, the Liu Clan Cultivators were closing in. A glowing shield sprang up from the Zhang Clan ship, blocking their progress. However, it couldn\u2019t do anything to stop the Liu Clan Patriarch. With a single palm strike, he caused a deafening boom to ring out. The ship sank down by more than half into the water, and the shield shattered into fragments.</p><br/><p>The Liu Clan Cultivators proceeded onward with vicious grins. As soon as they reached the boat, Zhang Wenfang and the other three Foundation Establishment Cultivators unleashed magical items and flashed incantations to summon magical techniques. Booms instantly rang out.</p><br/><p>The massacre had begun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Patriarch has issued the orders! Eliminate them completely, root and branch. They can only blame their own name of Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the Liu Clan Qi Condensation Cultivators, with hideous grins on their faces, headed toward the pale-faced and terrified youngsters. Zhang Wenfang\u2019s eyes turned red, and the Clan members next to her were on the verge of going crazy and risking everything.</p><br/><p>The Liu Clan Patriarch hovered in mid-air, staring superciliously out of the corner of his eyes. To him, all of these people were clearly insects.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this moment, a calm voice suddenly echoed out from within the Zhang Clan\u2019s ship.</p><br/><p>\u201cPipe down!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only two words, but as the sound expanded out, it instantly suppressed all other sounds. It was louder than thunder, and gave rise to three echoes. It was also filled with intense pressure that weighed down on everything.</p><br/><p>At the same time, within his cabin, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes opened. His gaze seemed to pass through the ship, making everything outside visible.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Ancient Godly Monarch, Hoang Nguyen, Dustin Sutphin, Dang Quang Tran, Annsofie Jacobsen, Brendan Halse, and QD BUI</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was also boundlessly ancient. However, it was so majestic that Xuan Fang couldn\u2019t help but gasp in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered in response to this change in the Paragon puppet. At the same time, the power of the exploding sun was weakening after destroying millions of nearby Outsiders.</p><br/><p>Because Meng Hao was in the middle of the spell formation, he wasn\u2019t hurt very much at all. Instead, his eyes glittered with killing intent as he looked in the direction of the 16th Heaven, and then back at Xuan Fang, whose face had completely fallen.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since Meng Hao had conned anyone, although in truth, this was not a case of him conning Xuan Fang, but more a case of Xuan Fang setting himself up for failure.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had always had his speculations regarding Choumen Tai\u2019s true level of power, and Xuan Fang\u2019s actions now were only giving him a deeper understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Mountain and Sea Realm... has so many mysterious entities.... Choumen Tai, that old man on the boat, and also Slaughter, who walked out of Dao-Heaven\u2019s scroll painting. Then there\u2019s Shui Dongliu....\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered. He had the intense premonition that, as the war reached its climax, as the 33 Heavens and the Mountain and Sea Realm headed closer and closer to the final battle, all of the secrets would be revealed, like a scroll being unfurled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn all of this... who exactly are the enemies, and who are the friends.... And who was it that saved me before? Was it Shui Dongliu? What exactly are his plans here in the Mountain and Sea Realm?\u201d Meng Hao sighed inwardly. After awakening from his coma, there had been no time to ask Paragon Sea Dream about such matters. However, he had long since developed the feeling that the truth about the Mountain and Sea Realm was covered by a mist-like gauze, which made it impossible to see everything clearly. However, it seemed to him that there was someone behind the scenes influencing everything that was happening in the war.</p><br/><p>He himself was only a pawn in this war. Perhaps everyone was, including the Outsiders. They were pawns, with no idea who the chessmaster was.... It was brutal, but that was war.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since that bashful smile appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face when he was conning someone. The war had broken out suddenly, forcing him to mature, to grow up. He didn\u2019t want to think about what it would be like to watch his family or friends dying in battle in front of him, or what that would turn him into.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to contemplate such pain!</p><br/><p>Therefore, the only thing he could do was make sure that any likelihood of such an outcome... was thoroughly wiped away!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, one of these two Paragons will definitely perish!\u201d As the murderous aura spread out from Meng Hao, his eyes suddenly went wide, and he looked down at the spell formation beneath his feet.</p><br/><p>The sun was gone, but... there was still something else that remained behind.</p><br/><p>It was in that exact same moment that the Paragon puppet\u2019s eyes locked onto Paragon Xuan Fang, and its enraged voice echoed out into the starry sky. \u201cWas it you who severed my thread?\u201d</p><br/><p>Paragon Xuan Fang\u2019s heart began to pound as he sensed something locking down on him, something locking onto, not just his body, but his mind and his soul.</p><br/><p>The voice which had just spoken was filled with killing intent and murderous intentions. There was a brutality to it, something that made the starry sky around it turn icy. At the same time that the voice rang out, the Paragon puppet vanished, then reappeared directly in front of Xuan Fang.</p><br/><p>Xuan Fang didn\u2019t hesitate at all to fall back at top speed, his heart filled with an intense sensation of imminent crisis. However, no matter how fast he tried to flee, he couldn\u2019t match the soul fragment of Choumen Tai which had been sleeping inside the Paragon puppet.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the Paragon puppet extended its right hand and made a grasping motion. In reality, it was manipulating the flow of time, reaching backward a few moments into the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet back here!\u201d said the icy voice which echoed out of the Paragon puppet\u2019s mouth. Then, the puppet\u2019s hand wrenched backward.</p><br/><p>Off in the distance, Paragon Xuan Fang had been fleeing, but then his face flickered as he sensed an enormous hand in front of him, grabbing at his soul, pulling him toward the Paragon puppet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Eegoo, and you\u2019re not Meng Hao! Who... who are you?!\u201d Paragon Xuan Fang\u2019s face flickered as he bit down on the tip of his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of life essence blood and simultaneously performing a double-handed incantation gesture. That mouthful of blood became an entire sea which spread out in all directions and transformed into a blood-colored magical symbol.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak!\u201d It was a critical moment in which there was no time for contemplation. Xuan Fang attacked without any consideration for the negative ramifications to himself. Everything around him twisted, and the blood-colored magical symbol exploded, sending out a huge shockwave that he used to shake free of the Paragon puppet\u2019s time-traveling hand. Then he shot back at top speed, mind reeling and heart pounding from the realization of how powerful the Paragon puppet was.</p><br/><p>In fact, he was now coming to the conclusion that severing Meng Hao's connection to this puppet might have been... a big mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, this is no puppet! There\u2019s a soul supporting it from the inside! This is a discarnate soul possession!!\u201d Having come to this conclusion, Xuan Fang\u2019s face looked more unsightly than ever, and the sensation of crisis within him grew even more intense.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how he tried to flee, the sensation only got worse. He didn't feel like he was breaking free from anything. On the contrary, he felt more locked down than ever, incapable of extricating himself.</p><br/><p>Then, the Paragon puppet\u2019s eyes flickered, and its hand clenched into a fist before punching out.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The fist strike causing rumbling sounds to fill the void as an explosive force suddenly appeared right in front of Paragon Xuan Fang. Despite how powerful he was, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he fell back, a look of shock on his face. Then he looked at the Paragon puppet, and suddenly seemed to have realized something, and his face fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re... you\u2019re not a cultivator from the Paragon Immortal Realm. Y-you\u2019re... from the Barbarian Devil Realm!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBarbarian....\u201d A gleam of reminiscence could be seen in the eyes of the Paragon puppet before it then took another step forward and launched another blow at Paragon Xuan Fang. Booms rang out as Xuan Fang fell back, blood spraying out of his mouth. [1. This \u201cBarbarian\u201d is a term that comes up a lot in Beseech the Devil, and is a bloodline/clan/people/something-like-that in that novel. Unfortunately, some translators have transliterated it oddly as \u201cMan,\u201d which I think is incredibly confusing]</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, back in Meng Hao\u2019s position, the detonation of the sun revealed something completely shocking. There, numerous strands of light formed the outline of a spell formation design.</p><br/><p>Within the heart of that spell formation was... a bow!!</p><br/><p>It was an azure bow, floating in the nucleus of the spell formation, emitting boundless light. This was... Paragon Nine Seals' precious treasure!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Meng Hao was currently located above that spell formation\u2026 directly facing that bow!</p><br/><p>The sun might have exploded, but the sun was only the outer shell.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao paid no heed to the battle ensuing between Xuan Fang and the Paragon puppet. Instead, he looked down at the bow, his eyes glittering. Then he reached out, as if to grab it!</p><br/><p>As soon as he reached out to touch the bow, it shuddered, as if in response. At the same time, the Paragon's blood inside of his Nirvana Fruit began to boil in an unprecedented fashion. Then the bow then began to slowly rise up toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, within the sealed Mountains and Seas, all of the Mountains began to shake, and the Xuanwu turtles in the celestial ponds began to howl as if because of some intense provocation. At the same time, the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm also seemed to erupt explosively.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance\u2019s eyes went wide, as if he too could sense what was happening, and unexpectedly, he threw his head back and roared. At the same time, wave-like ripples filled the area around Guyiding Tri-Rain, and as for Mount Daqing, although it seemed to be just an ordinary mountain, all of a sudden... a completely extraordinary aura began to stir within it.</p><br/><p>Also on Patriarch Reliance\u2019s back was Dong Hu. A pearl floated in front of him, which radiated dazzling light. Dong Hu looked at it thoughtfully, and then looked up into the vast sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy life has been devoted to preparing this treasure for someone I don\u2019t know. Is it possible... that the fated master of this object is him...?\u201d</p><br/><p>As these things occurred, the cultivators who wielded the magical devices of the three Doyens redoubled their efforts, joining the Mountain and Sea cultivators to relentlessly attack the quivering seal which covered the Realm.</p><br/><p>It was also in this moment that rumbling sounds could be heard as the bow emerged from the spell formation... and came to rest in Meng Hao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The bow was azure, the string was black, and there were no arrows!</p><br/><p>However, there was a boundless ancientness which erupted from within it.</p><br/><p>It was as if in the moment he grabbed ahold of the bow, all of the qi and blood inside of Meng Hao erupted. The starry sky vibrated, and wild colors flashed. Meng Hao\u2019s hair flew about, and his energy rocketed up.</p><br/><p>However... his body instantly began to wither as his qi and blood were rapidly absorbed by the bow.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes grew bright, and he took a deep breath. Then he looked up toward the 16th Heaven, his eyes flickering with killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Fang is pinned down by the Paragon puppet. If I join in, then it might be possible to kill him. However, it would be better to take down Paragon Mythdragon when he's injured. There won\u2019t be another chance to do that....</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll kill Mythdragon!\u201d He made his decision in a split second, then took a step forward and transformed into a beam of light that shot toward the rest of the land masses up above.</p><br/><p>As he flew up, the majestic spell formation which surrounded him followed. His feet remained on the spell formation, and his hand grasped the azure bow. He was like the sun itself, rising with majestic splendor toward the land masses in the starry sky.</p><br/><p>The ordinary Outsiders, and their Imperial Lords, were all shaken, and quickly flew forward to try to stop Meng Hao. Paragon Xuan Fang\u2019s eyes went wide, and although he instantly grew very anxious, there was nothing he could do but watch Meng Hao fly up.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the Outsiders were all astonished!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm were all staring at Meng Hao as he rose up into the sky like a sun!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s father, Xu Qing, his fellow clan members, his friends, and all of the other cultivators who were watching, no matter how far away they were, could see the sun-like figure transforming into something like an arrow of light that shot toward the land masses up above!</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not indispensable to this war,\u201d Meng Hao murmured. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t here, there would be someone else who could take my place, and follow a similar path as mine....</p><br/><p>\u201cI can be a game piece. I can lack my own will. I can be a sacrifice. I just hope... that my family lives, that my wife lives, and that my friends live....\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he drew the bowstring back!</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1370: Bow In Hand!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

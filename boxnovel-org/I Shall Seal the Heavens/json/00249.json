However, deep in his eyes flickered a bit of doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere seems to be a deep connection between Han Bei and the East Pill Division. I wonder what secret lies there\u2026.\u201d He thought about it for a bit, but then put the matter aside. Early morning light once again filled the sky outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Zhou Jie, why did he go crazy? When I reencountered him for the first time earlier, something didn\u2019t seem right\u2026 Discarnate souls possessing the body, returned from the afterlife\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao sat there lost in thought for a while, before raising his head to look outside.</p><br/><p>Moments later, he heard a respectful voice from outside. \u201cGrandmaster Fang, the World Pill Division\u2019s Grandmaster Chen will deliver an alchemy lecture today. Would you like to attend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao thought about it for a moment. He was curious as to how these alchemists from the World Pill Division understood the Dao of alchemy. He rose to his feet and joined the disciple from the Black Sieve Sect. Together, they descended Black Welcoming Peak.</p><br/><p>The location of the alchemy lecture was the fifty-seventh mountain of the Black Sieve Sect. This mountain had no peak; its top had been shorn off to create a massive public square which was filled with rings of seats that could fit tens of thousands of spectators.</p><br/><p>By the time Meng Hao arrived, there were already more than twenty thousand Black Sieve Sect Cultivators present. They represented a variety of stages, including Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment and Core Formation, all seated around a raised dais.</p><br/><p>Chen Jiaxi and Li Yiming from the World Pill Division sat cross-legged atop the dais, meditating.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, off in the distance were three tables, seated behind one of which was Patriarch Violet Sieve. Next to him was a beautiful middle-aged woman. Meng Hao recognized her as the same woman who had taken Elder Sister Xu from the Reliance Sect all those years ago.</p><br/><p>At the third table was a ruddy-faced old man who sat at his table, his eyes flashing like lightning. It was impossible to fathom the level of his Cultivation base, but it seemed to Meng Hao that he was slightly more powerful than Patriarch Violet Sieve.</p><br/><p>To have three Nascent Soul Cultivators present would make this alchemy lecture especially superb.</p><br/><p>Seated cross-legged some distance in front of the three tables was Zhou Dekun, who was currently staring grimly at Chen Jiaxi and Li Yiming.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao strode over and sat down next to him, his expression the same as ever.</p><br/><p>Seemingly ignoring his previous distaste for Meng Hao, Zhou Dekun said, \u201cThese two are far too arrogant. They came to visit me yesterday on the pretense of paying their respects. In actuality, their words were filled with haughtiness. Apparently they believe that the World Pill Division has already exceeded the East Pill Division!\u201d He really seemed to hate the two alchemists from the World Pill Division. Furthermore, Meng Hao was a fellow Sect member. There had been friction between them, but now they were in the outside world and had to stick together.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had barely seated himself before Zhou Dekun continued to rant: \u201cThe Black Sieve Sect invited alchemists from two other Sects to help train their own alchemists. Instead of having us lecture first, they ask the World Pill Division to speak! It\u2019s outrageous!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of us need to be careful. The World Pill Division clearly has ill intentions. They obviously want to humiliate us. If that happens, then we\u2019ll lose a lot of face when we go back to the Sect.\u201d Zhou Dekun clenched his jaw and stared fixedly at Chen and Li. \u201cI probably have it a bit better off than you,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou need to be careful in your pill concocting. Ai\u2026 Alright, listen. If you have any problems with your pill concocting in the coming days, come find me immediately. I can answer any questions you have. I\u2019ll do my best to help you get up to speed as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled. There had been friction between the two of them, but the recent days spent together caused him to realize there was no reason to be so irked by the man. He shook his head with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make any mistakes, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Ai\u2026 Fang Mu, we\u2019ve had our differences. Big or small, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Right now, the World Pill Division is trying to provoke us. We are here to represent the East Pill Division!\u201d He looked over at Meng Hao. With a sigh, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a jade slip which he handed over. \u201cI prepared this for you last night. It\u2019s a collection of information based on my hundred years of cultivation of the Dao of alchemy. All of my knowledge and experience is collected together here. Take a close look, and we can corroborate and test the information together. I\u2019m sure it will help you improve your skill in the Dao of alchemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stared in shock for a moment. He accepted the jade slip and then scanned it with Spiritual Sense. He studied it silently for a long moment. Finally, he looked back up at Zhou Dekun. The information inside was genuine. It contained all the experiences of one of the most senior Furnace Lords of the Violet Fate Sect. The information therein was incredibly valuable.</p><br/><p>After examining the jade slip, Meng Hao knew that he had been a bit rash before. Any Furnace Lord deserved respect, and could be learned from. Zhou Dekun\u2019s way of thinking was a bit rigid, but his detailed understanding of the Dao of alchemy had reached the pinnacle.</p><br/><p>Such attention to detail would affect the success rate of pill concoction. Meng Hao might be somewhat more talented than Zhou Dekun in the Dao of alchemy, and have a more profound understanding. However, his success rate in pill concoction was only around three or four batches out of ten.</p><br/><p>From the jade slip, though, Meng Hao could see that Zhou Dekun\u2019s success rate was around eight batches out of ten.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Grandmaster Zhou!\u201d said Meng Hao, his expression serious as he clasped hands and bowed deeply to Zhou Dekun. This jade slip would be of no small help to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d said Zhou Dekun. His expression, however, revealed how pleased he was. In his mind, he thought, \u201cThis kid might have finagled his way to being a Furnace Lord, but he doesn\u2019t seem that bad. When I get back to the Sect, I\u2019ll have to discuss things with the other Furnace Lords and see if I can improve his reputation.\u201d He cleared his throat, and then sighed and finally brought up something that had puzzled him endlessly, \u201cFor the past few days, I\u2019ve been thinking about what you said in the valley that day. Actually, some of it does make sense\u2026. Also, I wanted to ask you something. I really was sure that the plant I was holding was a Seven Leaf clove. I really didn\u2019t think I could have made a mistake. But, I know that the leaves should glow with seven colors at dusk. I just\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gave an embarrassed grin. With a slight cough, he changed the subject.</p><br/><p>If Meng Hao didn\u2019t seem willing to talk about it, then Zhou Dekun wouldn\u2019t press the subject. However, given his skill in the Dao of alchemy, he had some theories already. It seemed the relationship between the two of them was on the repair, and he didn\u2019t intend to cause any further problems. They began to discuss the Dao of alchemy, and both were benefiting. In fact, when the alchemy lecture started, they didn\u2019t pay hardly any attention to it. As the voices of Chen and Li rang out from the dais, they would frequently be filled with displeasure as the two men glared down at Meng Hao and Zhou Dekun.</p><br/><p>Inwardly, Chen and Li laughed coldly at the disregard shown by the East Pill Division. However, they weren\u2019t in a position to say anything openly. Meng Hao and Zhou Dekun continued their discussion, and appeared to be benefiting more and more as the time went on.</p><br/><p>Zhou Dekun\u2019s eyes gradually began to fill with admiration. Being able to calmly state their differences in opinion regarding the Dao of alchemy caused him to gradually reach new enlightenment.</p><br/><p>As for Meng Hao, he realized that his own grasp of some of the finer details was simply insufficient. After getting advice from Zhou Dekun on the matter, he could tell that he was making improvements.</p><br/><p>One old man, one youth, discussing matters passionately. Eventually, Zhou Dekun slapped his hand down onto the table and gasped in admiration. The action seemed a bit affected, causing Meng Hao to laugh. He decided that it was time for him to make a scene as well, so he also slammed his palm down onto the table and let out a gasp of admiration.</p><br/><p>This instantly caused Chen and Li to exchange a cold look. Then, cold smiles broke out on their faces. Actually, they had long since decided to use this visit to the Black Sieve Sect as an opportunity to intimidate and shame the East Pill Division.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t plan to do so by means of the alchemy lectures, but rather the pill concocting. In this way, word would spread throughout the Southern Domain, and the two of them would immediately rise to prominence and gain sterling reputations.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they held their tongues. Their alchemy lecture went on for two days, and not a single person left. However, throughout the course of the lecture, the spectators gradually divided into two groups. More and more people began to cluster around Meng Hao and Zhou Dekun to listen in on their discussion. They listened in entranced, understanding the majority, but not all, of the things which were being said.</p><br/><p>This had been Zhou Dekun\u2019s intention all along, so he was quite pleased.</p><br/><p>Chen Jiaxi\u2019s eyes grew darker. Finally, he finished his lecture, then turned to glare coldly at Zhou Dekun and Meng Hao. His voice grim, he said, \u201cYou two have been talking for two days. Well, now it\u2019s time for the East Pill Division\u2019s lecture. I\u2019m very interested in hearing your understanding of the Dao of alchemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to him, Li Yiming\u2019s face was filled with displeasure. With a cold laugh, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The East Pill Division occupies the pinnacle of the Dao of alchemy in the Southern Domain. I\u2019m very curious about your honored Sect\u2019s understanding of the Dao of alchemy. What exactly is so amazing about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao frowned slightly. At first, he and Zhou Dekun had really been exchanging important knowledge about the Dao of alchemy. The majority of the time, though, they had mostly been putting on a show. As such, he had been able to listen to some of the World Pill Division\u2019s understanding of the Dao of alchemy. They had some truly unique perspectives, many of which seemed reasonable.</p><br/><p>Zhou Dekun gave a cold snort as he stood and headed up to the dais. As for him, he had also noticed some of the special areas from the World Pill Division\u2019s lecture. How could he not have picked up on some of the uniqueness of their understanding? As the assigned lecturer during this trip to the Black Sieve Sect, he would not shrink back. He felt as if his knowledge had been honed by his chat with Meng Hao. Now he would do anything to avoid making any slip-ups.</p><br/><p>Chen and Li left the dais, and Zhou Dekun stood there, his heart filled with determination. His current plan was to use his command of all the various explicit details to finagle his way through the first part of the lecture.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the great path of the Dao of alchemy, special attention must be focused on the variations of plants and vegetation, which must be committed to the heart. These things form Ultimate Truth! As such, the Dao of alchemy is eternal! Fellow Daoists, today, I, Zhou Dekun, shall elaborate upon the third realm of the plant and vegetation variations.\u201d Zhou Dekun clearly wanted to drag things out as much as possible to give himself time to think.</p><br/><p>However before he could continue, a cold laugh rang out from Chen Jiaxi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard of such a thing,\u201d he said. \u201cGrandmaster Zhou, you claim that the Dao of alchemy means to commit plants and vegetation to heart, which leads to Ultimate Truth. Therefore, I would like to ask you, what is this Ultimate Truth to which you refer?\u201d He slapped his palm down onto the table. The sound echoed out, bolstered by his Cultivation base, to form an overbearing aura. He stared at Zhou Dekun.</p><br/><p>Strange looks appeared on the faces of the surrounding Cultivators. Everything was quiet. Patriarch Violet Sieve and the other Nascent Soul Patriarchs did nothing to interfere. The conflicting views of the East Pill Division and the World Pill division had come to a head.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Colin Ding and Anonymous</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

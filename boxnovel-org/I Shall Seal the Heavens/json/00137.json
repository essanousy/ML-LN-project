The State of Cloudy Skies.</p><br/><p>This nation existed in the centre of the Southern Domain. It encompassed a huge territory, vastly larger than the State of Zhao. Even in the Southern Domain, nations like this could be counted on one hand.</p><br/><p>Within the State of Cloudy Skies, there were no Sects whatsoever. It was one of those uncommon nations that didn\u2019t have Sects. Instead, in this nation, there was a Clan. This Clan was named Wang. And this nation\u2026 was also named Wang!</p><br/><p>Male members of the Wang Clan who were mortal and could not practice Cultivation became part of the royal family of the State of Cloudy Skies. Those who could practice Cultivation entered the Wang Ancestral Mansion.</p><br/><p>As for Cultivators without the surname Wang, they formed auxiliary branches of the Wang Clan. It had been this way for generation after generation.</p><br/><p>After Meng Hao consumed the Perfect Foundation Pill and emerged from the Blood Immortal Legacy zone, a sound could be heard. This sound came from the tenth mountain amongst the Three Thousand Forbidden Mountains within the State of Cloudy Skies. It was the sound of breathing.</p><br/><p>The Three Thousand Forbidden Mountains of the Wang Clan were not connected. They were dispersed throughout the State of Cloudy Skies. Underneath each mountain was a wooden coffin. Only the most powerful members of the Wang Clan could, upon death, be buried underneath one of the Forbidden Mountains.</p><br/><p>According to the legends, one of the Wang Clan Patriarchs from tens of thousands of years ago was buried in one of the Forbidden Mountains, although no one knew which one.</p><br/><p>There were many deep secrets within the Wang Clan, many of which the five great Sects only had general information about. Clues could be found in the ancient records, but the Wang Clan secrets were just endless, and their history too deep. According to the legends, they came from the stars\u2026.</p><br/><p>Right now, within the tenth mountain, was a world of crimson light, the glow of blood and of fire. Here was a boiling sea that it seemed could never be extinguished within ten thousand years. Deep within the recesses of this volcano was a red coffin.</p><br/><p>The coffin had no cover. Resting inside was an old man. His face was covered with wrinkles, and his body was skinny and shrivelled, as if he had been dead for a very, very long time. And yet, no death aura whatsoever emanated off of the corpse.</p><br/><p>In fact, his eyes eyes slowly opened, and when they did, the peaceful sea of fire\u2026 suddenly began to move. It was not burning higher; in fact, the broiling heat seemed to reduce a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel\u2026. A Perfect aura\u2026.\u201d murmured the old man. His voice was extremely hoarse, as if he hadn\u2019t spoken for a very long time. When he did speak, the entire tenth mountain began to rumble.</p><br/><p>This rumbling immediately drew the attention of the elder members of the Wang Clan. Multiple figures suddenly emerged from within the Wang Ancestral Mansion.</p><br/><p>These old Clan members\u2019 faces were filled with excitement; based on their understanding, within the tenth mountain was one of their Patriarchs!</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfection\u2026.\u201d said the person inside the coffin, his eyes flashing with a mysterious light.</p><br/><p>When his eyes flashed, the roaring of the tenth mountain grew more intense. The group that had come from the Wang Ancestral Mansion all saluted respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare three thousand Rebirth Stones!\u201d said the old man in the coffin, his voice echoing out of the tenth mountain. \u201cThe time has come for me to reincarnate!\u201d When they heard this, the group of old Clan members\u2019 faces grew even more excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the peak of the Dao Seeking stage, I sealed my Cultivation base. At first, I thought that like members of the elder generation, I could only struggle on death\u2019s door, gazing at Immortality and sighing, ignorant and unable to take those final steps. I couldn\u2019t step into the stars, and return to my Clan members\u2026.\u201d A slight smiled appeared on the shrivelled face of the old man. The smile seemed to be filled with an intense, ghastly strangeness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now\u2026 I have hope\u2026.\u201d His smile grew wider, and his eyes shone even more powerfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe legendary Founder of the Wang Clan passed down a truth of the Dao from generation to generation. He was born mediocre. But one year, he was able to wrest away someone\u2019s Foundation Establishment, and thus tread the path of a powerful expert\u2026. Then he became a legend.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, a Perfect Foundation has appeared. I too shall tread the path of the legendary Founder. I shall wrest away Perfection, and then take the next step, Immortal Ascension!</p><br/><p>\u201cExcept\u2026 this person\u2019s Cultivation base is too weak. It\u2019s not sufficient to sustain my Immortal Ascension. I must wait a bit longer, just wait a bit, wait\u2026.\u201d Within the coffin, the old man\u2019s smile grew more vigorous. Then, after a while, he closed his eyes. The sea of fire within the tenth mountain once again dared to rekindle its inextinguishable flames.</p><br/><p>Several days later, underneath a seemingly endless, cloudless sky.</p><br/><p>A bright, greenish beam of light shot through the air. This was Meng Hao, slicing through the sky. As for Zhou Daya, Meng Hao had known all along that the young man was following him, but let him go anyway. Of course, there were some things that he shouldn\u2019t have heard, which Meng Hao prevented him from hearing. In any case, he was connected to Fatty somehow, so he\u2019d let him go.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt took a lot of Spirit Stones to concoct the Perfect Foundation Pill. I still have some left, but not many\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao frowned, examining his bag of the Cosmos and letting out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I entered the Cultivation world, I was running low on silver. After I became a Qi Condensation Cultivator, I was always running low on Spirit Stones. Now I\u2019ve reached Foundation Establishment, but\u2026 I\u2019m still running low on Spirit Stones.\u201d His brow furrowed as his longing for Spirit Stones was once again kindled. Now that his Cultivation practice had reached this level, his need for Spirit Stones was even greater.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s the poison of the three-colored Resurrection Lily. If I can\u2019t dispel it, it\u2019s going to be a real problem.\u201d His frown deepened.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d he muttered to himself, \u201ceven though I\u2019m much more powerful now that I have a Perfect Foundation, I\u2019m cut off from heaven and earth. I have no way to absorb spiritual energy\u2026 the only way to get it is by consuming pills. I can\u2019t keep doing that forever\u2026.\u201d But, he had been prepared for that. Given a second chance, he would definitely chose to consume the Perfect Foundation Pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou win some, you lose some. It\u2019s fair.\u201d Meng Hao lifted his head. Smacking the bag of the Cosmos, he retrieved the blood-colored mask. A warm feeling filled his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespite my current situation, at least I acquired the Blood Immortal Legacy. Now I just have to wait for the mastiff to wake up. Then everything will be a bit better.\u201d His eyes shone with anticipation. He cast his Spiritual Sense deep into the blood-colored mask. He could sense the mastiff\u2019s slumbering form. Though he had no idea when it might awaken, he could sense a powerful pressure emanating from it, a pressure which was continuing to grow more powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s this flag.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flashed. His Spiritual Sense fell onto the dilapidated flag of three streamers. His Spiritual Sense entered it, only to find that it was like an ocean. Compared to it, Meng Hao\u2019s Spiritual Sense was incredibly small. He had no way whatsoever to do anything with it.</p><br/><p>However, he was able to sense an incredibly might within it like that of the Heavens; it seemed mighty enough to lay waste to heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Cultivation base isn\u2019t sufficient\u2026. Even though this treasure is somewhat broken down, it was still inside the Blood Immortal\u2019s Legacy zone. It must be extremely valuable. When my Cultivation base is strong enough, I\u2019ll be able to use it, and I\u2019m sure it will be powerful enough to shock the Heavens.\u201d Palpitating with anticipation, he withdrew his Spiritual Sense. It was then that he caught sight of the character written on the third streamer, Ji .</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it have the character Ji on it? Is it a family name?\u201d He thought about it for a bit, then focused his attention on the Scroll of the Blood Immortal Legacy. The instant he looked at it, he felt as if his head were about to be split in half.</p><br/><p>To the average person, this pain would be excruciating, and difficult to bear. But to Meng Hao, it was nothing compared to the anguish he suffered during his poison flare-ups. His expression flickered somewhat, but as he focused on the splitting pain in his head, he caught sight of a special technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit Devouring Scripture!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s heart trembled as the three blood-colored characters appeared in front of him and branded themselves indelibly onto his mind.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s head began to thrum as it was filled with an ancient voice. It was impossible to say whether the voice was male or female. \u201cIf you Cultivate according to my scripture, you can wrest control of Spirit and blood and fuse them into your body. Refine them into a body of blood, Spirit of blood, a Blood Immortal, a Blood Dao!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are countless Cultivation methods in heaven and earth. The bloodline of my Legacy stretches back to the powerful first Founder. The bloodline contains his will, and can be passed on to tens of thousands of generations. When the bloodline is awakened in the descendants, they shall possess latent talent!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy technique can be used to wrest away latent talent, and then sense the almighty will of the Founder. Refine the body, make the latent talent yours. Some have even tried to bring the ghost of the Founder into the world, to destroy Immortals and devils!</p><br/><p>\u201cPracticing Cultivation according to the technique of my Legacy is an insult to the Heavens. But fear not ghosts and divinities; overturn the vault of the Heavens with the flip of a hand, lower your head to cause heaven and earth to mourn!\u201d Slowly a scripture came to be branded onto Meng Hao\u2019s mind. Then a vast amount of miscellaneous information about the mask poured into his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Blood Immortal. My whole life was spent battling the Heavens. I met defeat only thrice! I wrested Spirits away from heaven and earth. Because I desired to wrest away the bloodline of Ji, the Heavens shunned me and longed for my destruction. My body could be destroyed, but not my will!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was not willing to give in because of three defeats. Therefore, I created three techniques: the Blood Finger, the Blood Palm, and the Blood Death World!</p><br/><p>\u201cDescendants of the Legacy of my Dao, do not forget that you must wrest away the bloodline of Ji! Make the Dao of Heaven weep, and the earth mourn! Remember the techniques of the Blood Immortal, the Nine Killing Magics!</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, the day your Dao is achieved, put on my mask and hoist the flag of three streamers. Defy the ancients, topple the Heavens!</p><br/><p>\"Without a face, a single word, the flames of war unify</p><br/><p>\"Sundered clouds, a bloody rain, seas that fill the sky</p><br/><p>\"Capture the gods, advance the troops, fire consumes the towers</p><br/><p>\"Forge all spirits and bloodlines into the 9 killing powers!\"</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s body trembled and he opened his eyes. He was still flying through the sky, above a vast empty space, and barren mountains. His eyes continued to swim, and his mind echoed with the archaic voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrest away bloodline, achieve success. The strength of the bloodline is up to the glory of the Founder\u2026. Wrested latent talent of the bloodline, can be refined into a body of blood\u2026 a body refined outside the body\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one person can hold the power of an entire bloodline. The blood of three generations is required to refine even a minor blood clone. If six generations of bloodlines are congealed, then a magnificent blood spirit can be achieved. If nine generations of blood, then the Great Circle of the blood spirit can be completed!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ancestors determine the strength of a bloodline. The stronger the past generations, the stronger the Blood Spirit!</p><br/><p>\u201cThus, it becomes death. Nine bloodlines, nine experts. They become the nine deaths, nine deaths fused into one. This is\u2026 the Blood Dao!\u201d Meng Hao panted, his mouth dry. At the moment, he was no longer flying. He had landed onto a barren mountain, where he now sat cross-legged, feeling the Spirit Devouring Scripture pulsing through his head.</p><br/><p>This was the complete scripture, the full Legacy. But within the Legacy was something that filled Meng Hao with the reek of blood. He sat in thought for a long time before his eyes began to shine.</p><br/><p>\"Without a face, a single word, the flames of war unify</p><br/><p>\"Sundered clouds, a bloody rain, seas that fill the sky</p><br/><p>\"Capture the gods, advance the troops, fire consumes the towers</p><br/><p>\"Forge all spirits and bloodlines into the 9 killing powers!\"</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are four magics within\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao was thoughtful for a while before looking down at the mask in his hand. The mask was completely featureless, with no eyes, nose, ears or mouth. As he looked at it, his hand began to grow warm, and his eyes shined. It seemed as if he were about to put the mask onto his face.</p><br/><p>As the mask neared his face, it grew warmer, and began to squirm. A bloody aura emanated from it. Just as Meng Hao was about to place it on his face, the copper mirror within his bag of holding suddenly let out a sharp sound that was like the call of a bird.</p><br/><p>The birdcall entered Meng Hao\u2019s mind, and his heart trembled. The light in his eyes suddenly became clear, and he suddenly put the mask down. His eyes filled with a hard look.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking to die, you discarnate soul?!\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Jonathan Murphy</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although her hair was white and her face covered with wrinkles, her smile was as beautiful as ever.</p><br/><p>She gazed softly at Meng Hao, and a glow filled her face that could almost be described as holy. She appeared to be seeing everything that had happened on Mount Daqing and in the Reliance Sect. Each scene ended with Meng Hao, and when that happened, her eyes seemed to fill with all of the love that existed in her life.</p><br/><p>She had a simple personality, and was not the type of person to allow the seeds of love to be planted easily. However, once those seeds were planted\u2026 they existed for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>She held Meng Hao in her arms as she walked forward step by step, directly into the ghastly cave mouth in the side of the mountain, the Rebirth Cave.</p><br/><p>Stepping into the cave was like passing through the barrier that existed between life and death. In that instant, everything turned black, and no more warmth existed. There was not even a scrap of the life that existed in Heaven and Earth. The only thing that remained was stifling death and infinite coldness.</p><br/><p>The outside of the Rebirth Cave, and the inside of the cave, were two different worlds.</p><br/><p>One was a world of life, the other was a world of death.</p><br/><p>When Xu Qing carried Meng Hao inside, all of the wills inside the cave retreated back into the recesses of the cave to watch from afar.</p><br/><p>To them, when Meng Hao and Xu Qing were on the outside, they were people from a different world. Not only were they envious and jealous of them, they also scorned and disdained them.</p><br/><p>But now that Xu Qing had carried Meng Hao into the Rebirth Cave, they were all the same, and all existed in the same world.</p><br/><p>Here, there was no power of Heaven and Earth. When living things entered the cave, their life force would fade away even more rapidly than before. When it disappeared, when they were inundated with death, then all they could do was wait for the supposed\u2026 awakening.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing walked onward with Meng Hao, her face pale, her body trembling. Her life force was rapidly fading away, and as for the single strand that existed within Meng Hao, it would soon be completely gone.</p><br/><p>In the moment when Meng Hao\u2019s strand of life disappeared, Xu Qing kissed his lips again, delivering more of her own life force\u2026 into him.</p><br/><p>By the time she had walked a few dozen meters into the cave, Xu Qing\u2019s face was completely ancient, and her body was extremely withered. She was thin and emaciated, with no trace of youth left in her at all. She had lost everything.</p><br/><p>She sat down cross-legged.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao,\u201d she murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t go any further\u2026.\u201d He now lay resting across her legs, his face devoid of blood, his features ancient. She looked down at him. \u201cWhen I joined the Reliance Sect, I had already promised myself that I would never marry anyone, not for my entire life. I would not become someone\u2019s beloved. Instead, I would focus solely on cultivation\u2026.\u201d She stroked his face with a hand that had once been as lustrous as jade, but was now dried up and old.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then you came along\u2026.\u201d she said. Her face flushed a bit as she looked at him for a long moment. Then she leaned down and kissed him again, delivering more of her life force.</p><br/><p>As the life force entered him, a bit of color returned to his face. On the other hand, Xu Qing\u2019s only became more withered. The amount of life force she had was only growing less and less.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had only been in the sect for a short time when you happened to get that medicinal pill,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhen you ended up giving the pill to me as a gift\u2026 my face was calm, but my heart was actually filled with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot because of you, but because of the pill.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI gave you the Immortal\u2019s cave because I figured it would make us even. But then, you crafty little fox, you managed to entangle me even further. You got your hands on a Cosmetic Cultivation Pill\u2026.\u201d When she thought back to everything that had happened back then, her smile grew sweeter, and she gently stroked Meng Hao\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know that when you killed Zhao Wugang, I secretly helped to make sure no one found out? Down to this day, I don\u2019t think you ever realized that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then you opened your shop in the sect\u2026. Ai. If I wasn\u2019t there\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say that by that time a lot of people had taken an interest in you.\u201d Xu Qing wanted to smile, but suddenly was overtaken by a fit of coughing. Fearful of disturbing Meng Hao, she covered her mouth. When she lowered her hand, it was covered with purplish blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Reliance Sect hadn\u2019t been destroyed, I wonder how things would have turned out\u2026. When I was taken to the Black Sieve Sect, I was met with coldness. Everything was strange, and I had to deal with that malicious Elder Brother\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, I really missed the Reliance Sect, and I missed the State of Zhao. I missed\u2026 you.\u201d She looked down, and delivered another strand of life force to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Her face was pale white, and her body frail and withered. She looked like a lamp that was on the verge of flickering out, and she was well aware that every bit of life force she gave to Meng Hao caused her own death to approach even more quickly.</p><br/><p>Right now, she could still abandon Meng Hao. If she left the Rebirth Cave, because of her special soul, she could easily return to the outside world and recover all of her life force.</p><br/><p>But she did not do that. Nor did she regret the decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know it,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut when I saw you in the crowds of people, at first, I thought I was dreaming\u2026. Then, in my moment of despair in the ancient Blessed Land, you appeared. From that moment on, you were in my heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot long after, you saved me again, from the discarnate soul of Matriarch Phoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, outside the Rebirth Cave, I could only weep as I watched you disappear into the distance. My heart hurt so bad\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I went to the Violet Sea, I couldn\u2019t find you, but I could sense that you were so close\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, I saw you again in the ancient Demon Immortal Sect. Meng Hao\u2026 I was so happy then. Thank you.\u201d She looked down at him for a long moment.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t speak very often about how she felt, but her actions showed how deeply her love went. Anyone in Heaven and Earth who could have a companion like this could die without any regrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, I can\u2019t hold on much longer\u2026.\u201d She was not a flickering lamp any more. She had reached the end of the road. If she closed her eyes now, then she would never open them again.</p><br/><p>Perhaps if she closed her eyes, then years later, someone would come into the Rebirth Cave to find their bodies. A woman, sitting cross-legged. A man, reclining across her legs.</p><br/><p>One sleeping. The other smiling. Through all eternity\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou live, I live. You die, I die\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you grow old, then I\u2019ll grow old with you.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you slumber here, then I will accompany you\u2026.\u201d Xu Qing lowered her head and began to deliver the last bits of life force she had to Meng Hao through a kiss.</p><br/><p>As the life force left her, she shivered, and her hair began to fall out. Everything started to go blurry. However, she gritted her teeth and once again prepared to give some more.</p><br/><p>By this point, even all of the observing streams of will were shaken by what they saw. It was then that the stream of will that belonged to the roc suddenly emerged, transforming into a woman.</p><br/><p>She stood there in front of Xu Qing, indescribably striking and matchlessly beautiful.</p><br/><p>She was the embodiment of the roc. She came from the bones that existed in the coffin in the Milky Way Sea. She was\u2026 the goodness of the Resurrection Lily that had reached Immortal Ascension at dawn.</p><br/><p>Back then, she had fallen in love with a man. From that moment on, she willingly sank into depravity. Because she faced pain and sorrow, she took her goodness and severed it away. Then she became the Dawn Immortal.</p><br/><p>That goodness now appeared in front of Xu Qing, in the form of this woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you keep that up, your soul will scatter,\u201d said the woman softly.</p><br/><p>Despite her muddled consciousness, Xu Qing heard the woman\u2019s words and looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you keep it up, you will lose your life for all eternity\u2026.\u201d The woman looked down at Xu Qing, and almost seemed to be looking down at herself. \u201cFrom time immemorial, the League of Demon Sealers have been heartless. Is it really worth it to do what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it or not,\u201d murmured Xu Qing. \u201cI only know that without him in my life, then I can only live a life of pain. In that case, why not die together? I don't fear death. What I fear is the pain of being alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman seemed to shiver, and she looked down thoughtfully at Xu Qing. Finally, she sighed softly. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Qing smiled but didn\u2019t say anything. She was confident in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe me, huh\u2026?\u201d said the woman. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe either. Well, in that case, I\u2019ll help you to see. We will find out who is right, you, or me.\u201d A strange light began to glow in the woman\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have the vestiges of a discarnate soul on you,\u201d continued the woman, \u201cas well as the Daoist magic of the Black Sieve Sect. Within the Black Sieve Sect is a precious medicinal pill. It\u2019s called the Soul Birth Pill. If you can get that pill, then he will have a chance to live.\u201d With that, the woman waved her sleeve, causing an cold wind to spring up around Xu Qing. It picked her up and carried her far off into the distance, out of the Rebirth Cave and into the world of the living, all the way to the vicinity of the Black Sieve Sect.</p><br/><p>When the wind faded away, Xu Qing stood there ashen-faced. Her consciousness was no longer muddled, and she looked like her old self. She turned her head to look back toward the Rebirth Cave, and began to breathe heavily. Then she turned and headed toward the Black Sieve Sect.</p><br/><p>Back in the Rebirth Cave, the woman stood next to Meng Hao, looking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really such a thing as rebirth\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been to every corner of this cave. I left no rock unturned. And I can tell you\u2026 there is no rebirth in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only thing here is a Ninth Mountain and Sea lodestone. It fell here countless years ago, and enables souls around it to exist forever and cultivate Ghost Immortality.</p><br/><p>\u201cRebirth, ah, rebirth\u2026. It\u2019s a beautiful dream, and nothing more. It\u2019s merely a fiction, invented by people who aren\u2019t willing to die.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rosy picture such stories paint gradually obscured the truth, from one generation to the next...\u2026.\u201d The woman's voice was strange and filled with bitterness, as well as exhaustion. As she lost herself in memories of the past, her body gradually faded away.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao lay there in the silence. He had no more consciousness, and everything around him was still. It was so quiet that it seemed as if no voices had existed in the area since ancient times.</p><br/><p>Without the support of Xu Qing\u2019s life force, Meng Hao\u2019s own life force was rapidly diminishing. After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn\u2026 it had completely vanished.</p><br/><p>Within him, Immortal Shows the Way also withered, and gradually lost any usefulness to him. When that happened, a tall man sitting cross-legged deep within the Rebirth Cave looked up and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really is no rebirth in this place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is only a Ninth Mountain and Sea lodestone\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, he is not the one who can help me\u2026. Who have I been waiting for, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the person I\u2019ve been waiting for\u2026?\u201d This man was none other than Choumen Tai.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><strong>Note from Deathblade:</strong> This chapter and the past few chapters have made many, many references to past chapters.

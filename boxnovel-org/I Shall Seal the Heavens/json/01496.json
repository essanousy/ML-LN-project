In fact, there was no need for him to do so. Considering the level of his cultivation base, acting wishy-washy could affect his mental state.</p><br/><p>To powerful experts like Meng Hao, hiding one\u2019s cultivation base and then suddenly exploding out unexpectedly was boring and meaningless. They wouldn\u2019t do things like that unless absolutely necessary. In the long run, it could destabilize one\u2019s Dao heart. Relying on such paltry tactics could be an obstacle to striving for a great Dao.</p><br/><p>After possessing a certain level of power, the best thing was to call upon such power openly.</p><br/><p>No matter what plots or plans were afoot, the best thing was to be open and aboveboard, to crush everything in one's path.</p><br/><p>The Flamephoenix found it hard to deal with Meng Hao\u2019s straightforward demeanor. She took a few steps back, panting, then said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that thing. But since you\u2019re already here, Fellow Daoist, I can help you look for some clues. However, I have to warn you, the Ice-Fire Realm is very large. You need to prepare yourself to waste a lot of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the Flamephoenix, then chuckled and shook his head. Looking very sincere, he said, \u201cThis object is very important to me. If it\u2019s truly impossible to find, then I\u2019ll leave. However, if I\u2019m prevented from leaving the Ice-Fire Realm before it's sealed up again, then... I\u2019ll have no choice but to destroy it. This is a very important matter. I hope you can understand, Fellow Daoist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the copper mirror shard moments ago, the Flamephoenix didn\u2019t have much of a reaction at all. Her face didn't even flicker. However, Meng Hao had experienced far too many things in life for her to be able to hide her shock from him.</p><br/><p>Everything became especially obvious when she hinted about taking a long time.</p><br/><p>He knew that this world wouldn\u2019t stay open forever. He had waited outside for hundreds of years before it had opened, and based on his calculations, he was quite sure that it would close again in about one sixty-year-cycle. If he didn\u2019t leave at that time, he would have to wait a very, very long time for another chance. It would only be when the flower bloomed again that he would be able to leave.</p><br/><p>There would be too many opportunities for mishaps during that time, and Meng Hao wasn\u2019t willing to risk that.</p><br/><p>Thus, the words he had spoken moment ago were no threat. They were merely a clear explanation of his intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour lands can be destroyed, as can the ice plains,\u201d he continued in a calm voice. \u201cIf that happens, then the temperature created by the two will vanish, and all the living beings that exist here will be destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for you and that Patriarch Icemountain, I might not be able to kill you two, but if I can seal one of you, then I can seal the other.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t find what I\u2019m looking for, I'm confident that, in my fury, I will seal you in a way that will ensure you can\u2019t free yourselves for a very, very long time. So long that... when the flower blooms again, I\u2019ll return and seal you again.</p><br/><p>\u201cA thousand years? Ten thousand years? I\u2019ll keep you sealed away indefinitely. One day, my cultivation base will be powerful enough to kill you, and then I\u2019ll do just that. However, before you die, I\u2019ll Soulsearch you, and get all the answers I\u2019m looking for. In the end, I\u2019ll get what I want.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, that will take a very, very long time. Many people will die. Too many. I really don\u2019t want to do that, and so I\u2019m hoping... that you won\u2019t force my hand, Fellow Daoist.\u201d With that, he clasped hands and bowed. Then he looked up, smiled, and said, \u201cAs for which decision you choose to make, it\u2019s all up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each sentence he spoke caused the Flamephoenix\u2019s heart to pound. By the time he finished, her heart surged with waves of rage. And yet, she had no choice but to suppress them, as she knew that everything Meng Hao had just said was true.</p><br/><p>He really would do just as he had said, and it was highly likely that things would happen just as he had described. Although things might not play out exactly as he intended, he would likely make up for any discrepancies in his plan, and ensure that the outcome was the same.</p><br/><p>Everything came down to the cultivation base. Neither she nor Patriarch Icemountain, despite being beyond the peak of the 9-Essences level, were a match for this young man.</p><br/><p>What was even more telling was that, despite the calmness of his gaze when he looked at her, she could tell that there was explosive violence hidden therein. His pupils were bright red, and when she looked into them, it was almost as if she could hear countless howling voices. There was a fury inside of him that left her mentally shaken. Even her cultivation base was thrown into chaos, and the sea of flames around her faltered.</p><br/><p>Time ticked by, but Meng Hao didn't seem anxious. He simply waited for her reply, a smile on his face the entire time.</p><br/><p>After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, the Flamephoenix sagged in place a bit, and let out a bitter sigh.</p><br/><p>Then she looked up at Meng Hao and said, \u201cThe Ice-Fire Realm didn't always look like this. According to the legends, a long time ago, a precious treasure fell out of the starry sky and split open the lands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a mirror shard, one side of which emitted intense light and heat. That side created the world of fire. The other side of the shard emanated intense coldness, which was what created the lands of ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe living beings here were also changed. They gradually transformed, until years later, the Icemountain Tribe appeared, as well as the Flamephoenix Tribe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you take the shard away, then you will have no need to attack the Ice-Fire Realm to destroy it. It will happen automatically. All life will perish.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not the first person to come here looking for the mirror shard. Throughout the years, it has not been uncommon for foreign entities to enter when the flower blooms, with the intent of snatching the shard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao frowned. He had already speculated that things would be this way. He had guessed as much as soon as he saw all of the ice sculptures, and also from the fact that the Icemountain Giant and the Flamephoenix had attacked him instantly.</p><br/><p>After a moment of thought, he said, \u201cWell, give me the mirror shard, and I\u2019ll separate your worlds and seal them to keep them safe. Then, I\u2019ll come back within a thousand years to strengthen the seals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou....\u201d The Flamephoenix simply didn\u2019t believe that he was telling the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to trust me,\u201d Meng Hao said, his eyes glittering coldly. He had long since run out of patience. He would make a promise, but if she refused to believe him, then there was nothing else he could do. The mirror shard was too important.</p><br/><p>The Flamephoenix began to breathe deeply, and various expressions flashed across her face. Her eyes flickered with killing intent, and yet, she couldn\u2019t take the risk of refusing Meng Hao\u2019s offer, which would then lead to him destroying the world. On the other hand, agreeing with him also came with the risk of the world being destroyed anyway.</p><br/><p>Deep in her heart, she still didn't want to give in to him.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, she looked over coldly and said, \u201cI can\u2019t make a decision like this on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cPatriarch Icemountain must also agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao chuckled. He waved his sleeve, and blast of wind shot out in all directions as he began to fly in the direction of the ice plains. The Flamephoenix gritted her teeth and flew along behind him.</p><br/><p>This time, Meng Hao went much faster than last time. It only took a few months to cross the entire Ice-Fire Realm. The Flamephoenix was shocked, and her heart was pounding. Normally speaking, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep up, but she happened to have some magical items that gave her just enough speed to follow.</p><br/><p>A few months later, deep within the ice plains, Meng Hao and the Flamephoenix heard a roar of fury. Patriarch Icemountain, the 300,000-meter mountain, was shaking as he struggled against the seals.</p><br/><p>The Flamephoenix looked at him, then took a deep breath as the fear inside her heart mounted. Meng Hao smiled as he looked back and forth from the Icemountain Giant to the Flamephoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the two of you don\u2019t agree,\u201d he said, \u201cthen it's going to take me a lot longer to get the shard.... Furthermore, after searching everywhere in vain, I'm getting the sensation that the mirror shard is underground....\u201d He looked down at the lands below. The strange thing was that he had actually tried to blast the ground open earlier, and yet, despite the level of his cultivation base, he had been unable to do so.</p><br/><p>After some thought, a flicker of determination appeared in his eyes, and he waved his finger toward Patriarch Icemountain.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the seals unraveled, and a roar of rage echoed out as he rose to his feet. Without even a moment\u2019s pause, he launched himself toward Meng Hao, punching out with his fist.</p><br/><p>The Flamephoenix seemed shocked, but then she gritted her teeth and similarly attacked Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled. His expression didn\u2019t change the all, but he did speak, his voice icy: \u201cLooking to die?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the words left his mouth, his cultivation base erupted with power that had been building up for several hundred years. Eight Essences were unleashed, along with the shocking power of his fleshly body. Combined with his Demonic qi, and the power in his blood, he could unleash incredible force.</p><br/><p>It left the Icemountain Giant trembling, and the Flamephoenix shaking. As Meng Hao hovered there, an enormous head appeared behind him, radiating infinite darkness.</p><br/><p>It had a vicious horn jutting out of its forehead, long black hair, and glowing red eyes that seemed to contain oceans of blood. The Demonic qi caused the world to distort, shaking everything violently.</p><br/><p>If that were all there were to it, it might not be a big deal. But then Meng Hao extended his right hand, and seven copper mirror shards appeared. They then melted, transforming into black threads that spread out to cover his right hand, and then his torso, left arm, and legs. His entire body, with the exception of his head, was now covered with black armor!</p><br/><p>As soon as the armor appeared, a savage and explosive aura erupted out, causing his power to rise.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE....</p><br/><p>The incredible power surging out made it seem as if Meng Hao could unleash the power of the starry sky itself, as if he were the ultimate monarch, the most powerful being in the Vast Expanse.</p><br/><p>Gradually, bits of Transcendent power began to radiate out from him. He looked down at the Icemountain Giant and the Flamephoenix, and then beckoned at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to fight? Let\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

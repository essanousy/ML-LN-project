They were in a dangerous situation, but considering the level of their cultivation base, it wasn\u2019t impossible to dodge aside. However, it was at this moment that Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered with a vicious gleam.</p><br/><p>He immediately sent out a message with divine will: \u201cSecond true self, detonate!!\u201d</p><br/><p>His second true self\u2019s eyes flickered, and his arms locked in place. In the blink of an eye, he self-detonated. This was the self-detonation of a true Immortal\u2019s soul and Meng Hao\u2019s fleshly body, as well as the Devilish will inside. A massive explosion shook the stars, and brilliant light spread out in all directions, almost like a sun.</p><br/><p>BOOOMMMM!</p><br/><p>The sudden detonation of Meng Hao\u2019s true self was a decisive move that few other people could pull off. However, Meng Hao had practiced cultivation for many years and had experienced many deadly situations. Because of his decisive personality, he didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to detonate his second true self.</p><br/><p>The two black-robed cultivators had been on the verge of fleeing, but the self-detonation was something that shook even them. Blood sprayed from their mouths as they lost their chance to retreat.</p><br/><p>At the same time, raging killing intent could be seen in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes. He held out the ancient bronze lamp and then blew. A tiny bit of his breath brushed against the lamp, causing the flame inside to suddenly expand. Instantly, a flame sea sprang into being in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The stars trembled as the flame sea raged.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t spread out very far, only a few dozen meters. However, within that space, the shocking flames caused everything to ripple and distort. From a distance, the sea of flames resembled an enormous fiery butterfly, spreading destruction as it fluttered its wings.</p><br/><p>The two black-robed men let out miserable screams. They tried to use magical items to defend themselves, but even the third black-robed man\u2019s treasures were instantly destroyed. Flames engulfed their bodies, and their skin cracked and burned.</p><br/><p>The potency of the flame went beyond even Meng Hao\u2019s expectations. In the end, it only took a few breaths of time for the fire to completely incinerate the two black-robed men, who had actually excelled in terms of speed. One of them, in the moment before his death, glared at Meng Hao viciously, then used some unique divine ability to rapidly wither his own body and send a burst of energy out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe die together!\u201d he howled. The energy surged toward Meng Hao, enveloping him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s entire body began to tremble; massive power began to shred his skin. In the exact same moment that his body exploded, his Eternal stratum surged into action. The only thing left behind was the bronze lamp. By that time, the second black-robed man finally transformed into ash, and his soul dispersed. In the last instant before he died, no regret could be seen in his eyes; he had accomplished his mission.</p><br/><p>The two men were incinerated, even their bags of holding and very bones transformed into nothing but ash.</p><br/><p>Any presence of their existence was completely blotted out.</p><br/><p>Off in the distance, the first black-robed man was still tangling with the crocodile. When he saw what had just happened, his jaw dropped in disbelief and terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat fire is that!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could never have imagined that the person he was going up against would be so terrifying. In order to kill him, two of his compatriots, both stage seven Immortals, had been killed, and had even been forced to attempt to end their own lives to accomplish the mission.</p><br/><p>Those flames left the black-robed man\u2019s face completely ashen, and his heart pounding. He was now even more frightened than before, and was actually rejoicing that he hadn\u2019t been so hasty in his attack earlier. If he had been, he would most likely be dead now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Meng Hao was vicious! He actually detonated his own clone to kill his opponents! Were it not for his decisiveness, the two of them would have been able to flee. With their cultivation bases, they shouldn\u2019t have been destroyed in body and spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this kid hadn\u2019t met such an early end, then he would definitely have become famous throughout the Ninth Mountain and Sea!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s too bad that he did die!\u201d A look of greed appeared in the man\u2019s eyes. Even as he fought with the crocodile, he looked over at the bronze lamp, which had a slice of bloody flesh laying across it. Next to it was Meng Hao\u2019s bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat precious treasure belongs to me now! Also that Lightning Cauldron with the transposition powers!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlus, now I will get all the credit for killing Meng Hao!\u201d However, it was in this moment of excitement that his face suddenly filled with disbelief. Voice hoarse, he said, \u201cImpossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>In that moment, the shredded, bloody pieces of Meng Hao\u2019s body formed back together. An ancient aura spread out that carried the feeling of Eternity. In only a moment, Meng Hao was completely formed anew!</p><br/><p>His face was pale, but his eyes flickered with the desire to kill. He looked up at the black-robed man, his expression icy, as if he were looking at a dead man. The black-robed man\u2019s face fell and, despite the level of his cultivation, he was filled with terror and wanted to flee. Unfortunately for him, the crocodile went crazy to block his way.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao coldly patted his bag of holding to produce a set of clothing, which he quickly donned. Then he put the bronze lamp back into his bag of holding. The spark inside was clearly much dimmer; it would probably only be usable once or twice more.</p><br/><p>After putting everything in order, Meng Hao looked at the spot where his second true self had detonated. He waved his hand, causing all of the bits of blood and flesh to fly toward him. The soul of the true Immortal had not completely dissipated, although it had been reduced to only ten percent of its former power. All that was left of his body was a lump of gore, within which was the fully coalesced Devilish will. The whole thing resembled a black heart.</p><br/><p>After sealing it and putting it away, Meng Hao headed toward the crocodile and the black-robed man.</p><br/><p>He had sustained heavy losses in this fight, but had survived thanks to his Eternal stratum. If he hadn't made the sacrifices he had, he would definitely be dead now.</p><br/><p>The black-robed man looked at him, his heart filled with fear. Meng Hao looked like some ancient fiend as he slowly approached.</p><br/><p>The black-robed man was filled with shock, and had already sustained injuries. His heart was in chaos as the crocodile suddenly bit down on his right leg, causing cracking sounds to emanate out as the leg was shattered. It was in that moment that Meng Hao arrived, a red vortex beneath his feet. The vortex grew larger and larger until it resembled a sea of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome no closer!\u201d howled the black-robed man. He tried to retreat, but the crocodile had him pinned down, and he was injured again. By this point, he couldn\u2019t even unleash the full power of his cultivation base; he was now at the level of a stage five Immortal.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao moved forward with incredible speed, the blood sea beneath his feet growing larger and larger. In the end, the sea of blood churned in a massive vortex that surrounded Meng Hao, until he wasn\u2019t even visible anymore.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The black-robed man performed an incantation, unleashing a divine ability that slammed into the sea of blood. It began to fall apart, but then reformed. The black-robed man\u2019s face was pale white, as he performed constant incantation gestures and constant attacks. He continued to try to retreat, and was continually harassed and injured by the crocodile.</p><br/><p>His will to fight had long since vanished. Seeing his two companions die had struck quite a blow, and then Meng Hao had returned to life, which was an even more intense shock.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, no matter how he attacked, Meng Hao\u2019s blood sea vortex couldn\u2019t be destroyed. Every time the vortex began to fall apart, it would quickly recover. In the space of a few breaths of time, the blood sea vortex reached the black-robed man and then began to envelop him.</p><br/><p>Booms rang out, accompanied by the black-robed man\u2019s muffled, bloodcurdling shrieks. The vortex collapsed, but then exploded back out. Every time it collapsed, it reformed, until gradually, the screams grew weaker. After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, the cries faded away.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the blood sea began to shrink back down, transforming into Meng Hao once again. In front of him was the desiccated corpse of the black-robed man, who stared up with wide, vacant eyes. His flesh and blood, cultivation base, and even soul had been sucked dry.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was a bit flushed as he hovered there among the stars, eyes closed. After a long moment, he opened his eyes, and he looked exhausted. Yet, within that exhaustion could be seen the desire to kill.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, they\u2019re actually from\u2026 the Fang Clan!!\u201d In the end, Meng Hao had used one of the abilities of the ultimate form of the Blood Demon Grand Magic, a terrifying divine ability with potentially fatal side-effects, that required only a bit of time to perform.</p><br/><p>It was an ability that left him completely vulnerable to outside attack, which was why he had never used it before, a divine ability that allowed him to completely absorb the victim\u2019s memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow cute,\u201d he thought, \u201cand what a lovely clan. I haven\u2019t even arrived yet, and they\u2019ve already sent people to kill me\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cClearly, someone doesn\u2019t want me to get back to the Fang Clan alive\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that someone used a memory-wiping technique on this black-robed cultivator, making it impossible to determine who gave the orders to kill me. Clearly that person truly fears me.\u201d Meng Hao smiled, although it was a somewhat sinister smile.</p><br/><p>As of now, he was no longer the Meng Hao who, after reuniting with his father and mother, could rely on their help. He was back to his old self, running wild, with only himself to depend on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more somebody wants to prevent me from getting back alive, the more I want to get to the Fang Clan,\u201d he thought, his eyes flickering with murderous intent. Gradually, the killing intent faded into the recesses of his mind. He opened the black-robed man\u2019s bag of holding, but there was nothing inside other than a flying shuttle.</p><br/><p>The flying shuttle operated on spirit stones, and would enable to him to make his way through the stars. As long as he had spirit stones, it would work. Unfortunately, because of the quality with which it was constructed, and the spell formations that it operated, its effectiveness was limited. However, higher quality spirit stones would enable it to move much faster</p><br/><p>After he saw the flying shuttle, Meng Hao examined it closely. After determining that there were no booby traps or similar dangers, he quickly branded it with divine sense, then waved his hand, causing the shuttle to grow larger. When it reached thirty meters in length, he sat down inside of it, then, suppressing the pain he felt, placed a high-grade spirit stone down onto its surface. Rumbling could be heard as the shuttle then began to move forward.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in another location in the starry sky, another black-robed man whose cultivation base exceeded the Immortal Realm suddenly stopped in his tracks. He lifted his right hand, and three shattered jade slips appeared within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDead? I sent those three to kill a Spirit Realm cultivator, and they ended up getting killed\u2026? Did someone else interfere?\u201d After a moment of silence, the black-robed man continued onward at top speed, intending to search for Meng Hao personally.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to have Meng Hao killed, his excellency even sent people to keep Prince 19 from interfering. All just for this chance. Failure is not an option. Meng Hao\u2026 must die! He must not get to Planet East Victory alive!\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 891: Divine Flame Incinerates Immortals!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

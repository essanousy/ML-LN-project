He was in front of Zhao Youlan, and the person the Bridge Slave girl was charging toward was none other than him.</p><br/><p>As the words came out of Zhao Youlan\u2019s mouth, the tiny person magically appeared once again on her shoulder. The little figure\u2019s expression was one of anxiety as it performed an incantation with both hands and then pointed forward.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a red flower materialized in front of Meng Hao. Shockingly, on each petal of the flower could be seen the face of the girl. As soon as it appeared, the flower began to disintegrate.</p><br/><p>At this point, Zhao Youlan coughed up a mouthful of blood. The body of the tiny person on her shoulder flickered and grew even more blurry; it seemed to be extremely exhausted.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the charging girl\u2019s body suddenly stopped in place. An expression of pain filled her face and she let out a soundless scream. Then, her face grew even more vicious, and a fearsome aura exploded out of her. Everything in the area suddenly flickered, and the surrounding mist seethed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly\u2026 use your Dancing Sword Qi to cut her down!! Don\u2019t let her get near us\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this critical moment, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes filled with resolve. He caused the Alcohol Qi to surge out, and then caused the congealed Sword Qi to emanate out as well. The two of them merged together into a shocking sword-shaped amalgamation of Alcohol Qi. It shot through the air toward the girl\u2019s head, then passed directly through it.</p><br/><p>Her body trembled, and the mist around her churned. Suddenly, she stopped. The vicious expression on her face disappeared to be replaced by a look of catharsis.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, mother\u2026.\u201d she said softly. \u201cAre you still here\u2026? Where are you\u2026? Why did you leave me alone here\u2026? It\u2019s been so long\u2026 so long\u2026.\u201d The girl no longer seemed evil, but rather, lonely and helpless. Murmuring the entire time, her body slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>In the spot where the girl had disappeared, a slender strand slowly took shape.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was touched by the girl\u2019s words, and suddenly thought back to Han Shan\u2019s story regarding the Bridge Slaves. Sighing, he reached out and grabbed the slender strand.</p><br/><p>The other Bridge Slaves off in the distance didn\u2019t seem to have noticed anything, and continued to move off into the distance.</p><br/><p>After they were gone, the grayness disappeared, as did the mist. Strangely, there was no tempest this time.</p><br/><p>After the colors returned to normal, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered. He clenched his fist and once again punched out. Simultaneously, Zhao Youlan\u2019s lips opened and a beam of white light shot out of her mouth toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The two magics slammed into each other and a huge boom rattled out. Both parties fell back. The tiny figure on Zhao Youlan\u2019s shoulder performed an incantation with both hands, preparing to once again materialize the power of her bizarre flower.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment, however, that the Alcohol Qi once again began to roil within Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the tiny figure stopped moving and stared at Meng Hao. As of now, Meng Hao could see that this figure was shaped like a woman. She was extremely beautiful; not even Zhao Youlan could compare.</p><br/><p>She sat on Zhao Youlan\u2019s shoulder, looking very much like a Nascent Soul. However, she was far more limber than a Nascent soul, plus, her body emanated a pleasant aura very much like Celestial soil.</p><br/><p>There was a thin, transparent line connecting her hand to Zhao Youlan\u2019s body. It appeared that Zhao Youlan currently had no mind of her own, but rather, was being controlled as a puppet.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Meng Hao felt rather confused. He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what was going on between Demoness Zhixiang and Zhao Youlan.</p><br/><p>Zhixiang suddenly smiled and then spoke in a charming, melodious voice: \u201cLittle bro, your Dancing Sword Qi could definitely hurt me. In fact, there\u2019s a seventy percent chance that it could slay my Immortal Divinity. However\u2026 in the end, your Cultivation base just isn't strong enough to evade my final counterattack before dying.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, what\u2019s the point of us fighting? This place is one of the locations where the Bridge Slaves live. Instead of one of us dying, why don\u2019t we explore the place together? What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked over at the tiny Demoness Zhixiang. For her to call him \u2018little bro,\u2019 didn\u2019t seem very appropriate. However, he had to admit that what she said made sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, her actions against the Bridge Slave weren\u2019t fake,\u201d he thought. \u201cI was closer, but she still took action to protect herself. She thought I simply had one strand of Sword Qi, but when she found out that wasn\u2019t the case, she changed her mind.\u201d He glanced over at the mist in the basin. When it came to the bizarreness of the mist, regardless of whether it was in terms of experience or technique, he simply wasn\u2019t powerful enough to handle it on his own. Joining forces with her wasn\u2019t necessarily out of the question.</p><br/><p>As he was considering the matter, Zhao Youlan looked at him and frowned. Inwardly, she said: \u201cBig sis Zhixiang, this guy is endlessly crafty. Plus, he\u2019s cruel and merciless, completely cold-blooded. Also his decisiveness is incredible. If you work with him, you have to be very cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhixiang\u2019s reply echoed out inside of Zhao Youlan\u2019s mind. \u201cWell, now I know that you really do love your big sis, my precious darling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Youlan blushed.</p><br/><p>Sensing that her face was growing red, Zhixiang laughed, causing Zhao Youlan\u2019s blush to deepen.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bro, what do you think? There are plenty of treasures here. Big sis isn\u2019t greedy. I just want half. You can have the rest. What do you say?\u201d With that, the tiny figure on Zhao Youlan\u2019s shoulder laughed lightly. She lifted a hand and pointed toward the mist. A strand of Qi shot toward the mist, causing it to seethe and then slowly grow thin. Zhao Youlan\u2019s body shot down into the mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you agree, then come on over. Big sis is waiting for you!\u201d Demoness Zhixiang\u2019s voice carried with it a touch of allure, causing Meng Hao to frown again. Then, his eyes glittered. Filled with caution, and keeping the Sword Qi prepared, he followed down into the mist.</p><br/><p>They flew down in single file, piercing through the mist. Eventually they were able to make out the basin, and the luxurious buildings. Each of these buildings was completely constructed from Celestial soil, filling the basin with a thick aura of Celestial soil.</p><br/><p>\u201cImmortals used to live in this place,\u201d said Zhixiang from her position on Zhao Youlan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the palaces used by the ninety-nine preeminent Immortals as a guard garrison for the Bridge of Immortality. After the bridge was destroyed, the ninety-nine Immortals died and merged into the Bridge of Immortality. They wished to restore the bridge and its position in the world. When they came back to life, they had no physical bodies. However, their palaces remained, filled with treasure.\u201d As they neared the palaces, a glimmering shield suddenly appeared, blocking their way. A powerful aura radiated out, emitting thick pressure along with magical shadows.</p><br/><p>Zhao Youlan spit out a mouthful of blood, and Demoness Zhixiang lifted her right hand and waved it toward the blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately the blood turned into a red mist which then formed into a gigantic red flower. The flower floated forward and touched the shield. As soon as it did, it sank into the shield, merging into it.</p><br/><p>The entire shield began to distort. In the blink of an eye, veins seemed to spread out through the shield. It began to flicker rapidly and then, dissipated. The power that blasted out upon its dissipation caused Meng Hao to narrow his eyes. He would not have been able to break this shield unless he used the Dancing Sword Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve suppressed the defences,\u201d said Zhixiang, \u201cbut it will only last for four hours. All of the palace structures here should have garrison treasures. Little bro, as you can see, there is a main hall in the center, with palace buildings stretched out on either side. You take one side, and we\u2019ll meet in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for how many treasures you can acquire, that will depend on your own skill.\u201d Zhixiang laughed, and Zhao Youlan gave Meng Hao a cold glance. Then, they headed directly for the palace buildings on the right side.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the suppressed shield and the giant red flower floating there in mid-air. It was this flower which was suppressing the power of the shield, allowing them to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour hours? I can\u2019t trust her on that point. At most, it will probably last for two hours.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered. After a moment of observation, decisiveness filled his eyes and, without hesitation, he shot forward toward the group of palace buildings on the left.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith my Cultivation base, I would normally never be able to get into a place like this. Whatever treasures are in the buildings, they are not things I could take. If I get too greedy, then I might end up paying a horrific price.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, I will stick to my original plan. I don\u2019t need treasures, I just need Celestial soil!\u201d Eyes shining brightly, his body flickered and he appeared in front of one of the palace buildings. After looking it over carefully, he saw that the main door was shut tight with the power of some type of sealing.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao did not spend time thinking about how to open the door. A flying sword appeared in his hand and he knelt down. Rotating his Cultivation base, he used the flying sword to try to pry up one of the floor tiles. Unfortunately, a cracking sound could be heard as the flying sword snapped in two.</p><br/><p>Frowning, Meng Hao\u2019s body flickered as he flew up to the roof and began to try to pull up one of the roof tiles. Unfortunately, the roof tile was extremely tough, and no matter what he did, he couldn\u2019t pull it up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stuff is really sturdy,\u201d he thought, his eyes flickering with sharpness. He rotated his Cultivation base with full power, causing the Time Sword Formation to appear and unleash its power on the tile. A moment later, he pulled up on the tile. Crack! The tile was pulled up successfully by Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>His heart pounded with excitement. The tile was only the size of a hand, but the entire thing was made from Celestial soil. He put it away and immediately began to use the same method to continue dismantling the building.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, all of the tiles on the palace building\u2019s roof had been collected up by Meng Hao. Next, he went to work on the floor tiles. It didn\u2019t take long before they were all placed into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cRich! I\u2019ve really struck it rich!\u201d Panting, eyes gleaming, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes next moved to the palace building\u2019s guardian lions. Having successfully collected them up, he next looked over at the building\u2019s eaves.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Anonymous</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

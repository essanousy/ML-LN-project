After a moment, he decided not to step into the spell formation. Instead, he stood off to the side, waiting.</p><br/><p>After about an hour passed, the disciples in charge of operating the spell formation were about to completely lose patience, when a beam of light appeared in the sky off in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Elder Sister Xu!\u201d Looks of awe and veneration appeared in the eyes of the nearby disciples, and they all clasped hands in greeting.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked up at the woman in the beam of light. She wore white garments, and although she wasn\u2019t spectacularly beautiful, was pretty and emanated an indescribable air. She seemed a bit cold, but wasn\u2019t the completely unapproachable type.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at her, trembling. Suddenly, she slowed to a stop and looked down at him. Their gazes met.</p><br/><p>Time seemed to stop. Xu Qing hovered there quietly, and instead of proceeding along on her way, she floated down toward the teleportation portal. The disciples from the Dao of Water Sect clasped hands respectfully as she landed in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>She looked coldly at Meng Hao, and from her expression, it seemed as if she had no connection to him whatsoever other than being a former acquaintance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you recovered?\u201d Meng Hao asked suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was confused for a few days,\u201d she replied coolly, \u201cbut I can already tell the difference between reality and illusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Meng Hao smiled and said, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he turned and stepped onto the spell formation.</p><br/><p>It was at that point that Xu Qing spoke again. \u201cHave you been well recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned and looked back at her. \u201cBy recently, do you mean in the Arcane Pocket Realm, or... in the Vast Expanse Cosmos?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were inside the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm for a long time. Everything there was nothing more than a dream. Meng Hao, stop living in the illusion. It\u2019s time to wake up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I came down to speak to you is that I have some news. The will of the exalted Allheaven will soon select the ninety-ninth generation Son of Allheaven. It will happen this year, and if you become the Son of Allheaven, then perhaps things can continue between us as they were meant to. However, considering the way you\u2019re acting now, I have the feeling that won't happen.\u201d She shook her head, gave him one last look, and then was gone.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stood in the spell formation as it activated, watching her leave. He could sense her coldness, and suddenly began to laugh. His laughter grew louder and louder as the spell formation rumbled, and then he vanished.</p><br/><p>When he reappeared in the starry sky, he was still laughing. He laughed and laughed until the laughter turned into coughing. A glint of madness could be seen in his yes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave I recovered? Chen Fan recovered. Xu Qing recovered. Everything that happened in the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm is just a dream? I don't believe it! Why do I have this pain in my heart? She's not Xu Qing!</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not...</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not...</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not!\u201d Meng Hao threw his head back and laughed uproariously, his eyes glowing red. At the same time, the void around him distorted as countless invisible threads formed. They began to creep toward Meng Hao, as if to take advantage of his current state to bore into his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.</p><br/><p>But then, all of a sudden, the copper mirror hanging on his chest sent a flowing current through him that was far hotter than before. It filled him, causing him to shudder and then calm down. The threads which had surrounded him then shrank back and vanished.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao's mood gradually stabilized, and his eyes shone with a bright light. Something definitely felt wrong. His mood had changed too suddenly after encountering Xu Qing, and now that he thought back, he realized that he had seemed out of control, as if something were attempting to influence him.</p><br/><p>He looked around, eyes narrowed, then flashed into motion, heading toward the Vast Expanse Society.</p><br/><p>A few days later, he was in front of a huge planet, a planet that vastly exceeded the planets of the Dao of Water Sect and the Blue Sea Sect in size.</p><br/><p>It was covered with swirling mists, making it impossible to see its surface. However, there was a satellite planet next to the main planet, which was where the teleportation portal was located.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the planet that was the Vast Expanse Society, and the stabbing pain in his mind caused him to shake his head. He headed to the satellite planet, then entered the teleportation portal, and was gone.</p><br/><p>A few days later, he finally arrived... at his final destination, the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm!</p><br/><p>It was an enormous vortex which spun endlessly, sending intense rumbling sounds echoing out in all directions. Countless asteroids floated about in the area, upon which numerous cultivators could be seen, all of whom were closely studying the vortex.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the vortex, and his mind spun. He flew onward, toward the vortex, and quite a few people noticed him and looked over.</p><br/><p>He ignored them, keeping his eyes fixed on the vortex itself. Panting, he flew directly toward it, not pausing for even a moment.</p><br/><p>Soon, he could hear people calling out, but he didn\u2019t pay them any heed. Then, even as he neared, he suddenly bounced off of an invisible barrier, a sealing power which prevented people from casually entering the vortex.</p><br/><p>A boom echoed out as Meng Hao was rebuffed. He coughed up a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying back. When he looked up at the barrier, the vague memories inside of him sent so much pain stabbing into his mind that his face paled.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Meng Hao heard someone speak his name. \u201cMeng Hao?\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner of the voice seemed uncertain. Meng Hao turned and saw a fat fellow, expression quizzical. When their eyes met, he smiled wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is you. I\u2019m Li Fugui! Oh, right, maybe you don\u2019t recognize me. We were good friends in the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm.\u201d The fat man sighed and looked sympathetically at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that you've come here shows that you still haven\u2019t recovered. It was only recently that I myself was finally able to think clearly. I hope you can recover soon. Don\u2019t try to get back inside, by the way. We've all tried, and it\u2019s useless. The exalted Allheaven has sealed it up tight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the man standing in front of him. Within his vague memories was another Fatty who looked almost exactly the same as this one.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve recovered too....\u201d Meng Hao said, smiling bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Not just me. Remember Chu Yuyan, Sun Hai, and Wang Youcai? They\u2019ve all recovered.\u201d Even as he spoke, he turned and waved his hand. A few beams of light appeared off in the distance, as familiar figures from his vague memories flew over.</p><br/><p>There were Wang Youcai, Sun Hai, and... Chu Yuyan.</p><br/><p>Sighing, the three of them looked at Meng Hao, as if they were also recalling everything which had occurred within the Vast Expanse Arcane Pocket Realm. That was especially true of Chu Yuyan, whose expression was hard to read as she looked at Meng Hao. It almost seemed as if she couldn't believe what had happened inside, as if it were impossible that she would become infatuated with Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Fatty said. \u201cWe\u2019re all Chosen from the Hundred Sects, and I think that since we all became friends in a dream, we might as well do the same thing in the real world!\u201d He laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you recovered already?\u201d Meng Hao asked.</p><br/><p>Sun Hai nodded his head, as did everyone else. The sympathy in their eyes was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all recovered,\u201d Sun Hai said. \u201cEveryone did.... You know, you should go spend some time with some of the others. After all, we all were connected by destiny within the dream. Oh right, in the illusion, Fang Yu was your sister.\u201d Sun Hai sighed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind was reeling. He looked around at all of the asteroids, at the dozens of people there, and every one of the faces was familiar. In fact, one of them belonged to his older sister Fang Yu.</p><br/><p>He saw his parents, his Master Pill Demon, Taiyang Zi, Li Ling\u2019er, Fan Dong\u2019er, and Zhixiang....</p><br/><p>Head pounding, he followed Fatty around to go meet everyone, all of these people who existed in his memories. When they laid eyes on him, they sighed, and spoke emotionally of the things which had happened in the dream world.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Meng Hao had gone to talk to everyone. Finally, he sat down on an asteroid and stared blankly at the sealed vortex. Everyone here had already recovered. Meng Hao was the only one who was still confused.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt very alone. The perplexity he was experiencing led him to question himself. If one person tried to convince him that what he had experienced was an illusory dream, he would never question himself. But it wasn\u2019t a single person. It was two, three, ten, a hundred. Countless people were all telling him the same thing, and as such, he couldn\u2019t help but question himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me... it really was all a dream\u2026?\u201d he murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it was,\u201d Fatty said. He sat down next to Meng Hao on the asteroid. Taking a deep breath, he handed a flagon of alcohol over to Meng Hao. He held a flagon of his own, from which he took a long swig.</p><br/><p>The vortex continued to spin. Although they were located somewhere far out in the starry sky, it didn't feel any different than if they were sitting on a planet.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao held the alcohol flagon in his hand. Instead of drinking, he sat there quietly for a while, and then began to chuckle bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh well, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter....\u201d He said, shaking his head. At the moment, the copper mirror hanging at his chest was sending out so much heat it was burning his skin. And yet, he didn't seem to notice. He raised the flagon up to take a drink. Because the flagon covered his eyes, he had no way to notice that everyone in the area, Fatty, Sun Hai, Wang Youcai, Chu Yuyan, Li Ling\u2019er, Fatty, and even his parents and Pill Demon... were all looking at him, watching, waiting for him to take a drink!</p><br/><p>And that was when something completely unexpected happened!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

An intense, glowing light rose up from the temple, as well as the music of a great Dao. It seemed as if there were countless Immortal Divinities sitting cross-legged inside the temple. The mountain itself, as well as everything surrounding it, seemed to be part of a Daoist rites temple. It was even possible to see that crowds of Chosen had practiced cultivation there throughout the years.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?!\u201d exclaimed Meng Hao\u2019s father. The sword qi came to a stop.</p><br/><p>The door of the ancient temple opened up, and a figure emerged. It was impossible to see the figure clearly, but it stood there facing Meng Hao\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that there was an Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple here\u2026. How rude of me! Well, since this location has been activated\u2026 hand over the Immortal Ancient Daoist Medallion!\u201d</p><br/><p>The figure was silent for a moment, then waved a hand. The ancient temple rumbled, and out flew a command medallion that pulsed with Immortal qi. The bright light emanating from the temple faded, and the figure vanished.</p><br/><p>Nine powerful experts had appeared; one after the other perished. The crocodile became a mount, and the figure from the Immortal temple offered up an Immortal Ancient Daoist Medallion to prevent any trouble. The other seven were all slain.</p><br/><p>It all happened incredibly quickly. By the time Meng Hao\u2019s father finished speaking a few words to Meng Hao, everything was over.</p><br/><p>The cultivators on the ground in South Domain were astonished. The peak Dao Seeking experts in midair were completely shaken.</p><br/><p>The Dawn Immortal laughed bitterly and staggered back a few paces. Blood oozed out of her mouth as she looked at Meng Hao and shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFate, how cruel you are\u2026.\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to become a Blue Lotus\u2026 not for the sake of true Immortality, but because he said\u2026 once upon a time\u2026 that he loved lotuses.\u201d The Dawn Immortal chuckled sadly and backed up further. Her body seemed to be starting to dissipate.</p><br/><p>She had lost her foundation, and since she couldn\u2019t assimilate Meng Hao and become a Blue Lotus, the only thing left for her to do now was fade away.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao\u2026.\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou are of the League of Demon Sealers. From ancient times, they have always been cruel and heartless. One day, if you ever encounter one of them who mentions Resurrection Lilies, I\u2019d like you to ask him something for me\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk him if he remembers a flower back in the lands of South Heaven\u2026. A Resurrection Lily whom he severed away.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked up into the sky, and tears glistened down her cheeks as she began to fade away. \u201cI am filled with hatred\u2026. But what I hate is not you. I hate myself\u2026 for not being a Blue Lotus.\u201d Her soft voice echoed out across the lands before fading away.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind trembled as he watched the Dawn Immortal vanish into nothing.</p><br/><p>The war between the Southern Domain and the Northern Reaches\u2026 was over.</p><br/><p>The Western Desert left, their towering South Cleaving Sentinels leading the way. The Southern Domain would never forget the kindness shown to them by the Western Desert; it would be engraved in their memories for generation after generation to come. As for the sinners from the Northern Reaches, they had lost their path back home, and become felon citizens\u2026.</p><br/><p>There were now only a hundred thousand cultivators in the Southern Domain. Many sects and clans had been completely wiped out. Numerous core Daoist teachings and doctrines had vanished. Even the spiritual energy in the land was sparse. Thankfully, the mountain that Meng Hao had created continued to infuse the land with spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps many years later, the Southern Domain would once again shine with its former glory.</p><br/><p>Pill Demon went back to the Violet Fate Sect, and Patriarch Song to the Song Clan.</p><br/><p>If you didn\u2019t count Meng Hao, they were the two remaining peak Dao Seeking experts in the Southern Domain. Furthermore, the Violet Fate Sect and the Song Clan were now like Holy Lands within the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>In the days to come, they would lead the Southern Domain cultivators to rebuild their sects and clans, and also select appropriate people from among the mortal populace to begin practicing cultivation. Slowly, the Southern Domain would be restored.</p><br/><p>What was needed was time; at the very least, hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of years.</p><br/><p>The mountain in which the five peak Dao Seeking Northern Reaches cultivators was sealed, the one named Sin of the North, stood tall above the lands. As time passed, it would become a famous landmark in the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>The war\u2026 was over.</p><br/><p>During that war, Meng Hao had risen to complete prominence. His name was famous in the Southern Domain and the Western Desert. It had even shaken the Eastern Lands. Meng Hao\u2026 had become the focus of attention of all the lands of South Heaven.</p><br/><p>As for all the Chosen of his own generation, some were dead and some had faded into obscurity. None of them were able to keep up with Meng Hao, let alone surpass him.</p><br/><p>To the cultivators of the Southern Domain, Meng Hao\u2019s stories were the stuff of legend.</p><br/><p>He had started out in the Reliance Sect, acquired the Blood Immortal Legacy, thrown the Southern Domain into chaos, and shocked everyone at the Song Clan. Then, in the Violet Fate Sect, he had rocked the entire Southern Domain again under the name of Pill Cauldron.</p><br/><p>At the Rebirth Cave, he had slain one of the sons of Ji, a Quasi-Array member!</p><br/><p>In the Black Lands, he had participated in the siege of Holy Snow City!</p><br/><p>In the Western Desert, he had led his tiny tribe through the Violet Rain Apocalypse. Because of him, they rose to glory one step at a time, until he finally brought them to the Black Lands.</p><br/><p>Then, he had vanished, only to reappear years later, fighting the Spirit Severing expert Patriarch Huyan in a shocking battle that had astonished the Western Desert and Black Lands alike. Then, he had left everyone reeling in shock as he went to the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>The Chosen of the Southern Domain had congregated in the Demon Immortal Sect, but couldn\u2019t do anything to Meng Hao even after joining forces. After wresting away virtually all of their good fortune, Meng Hao had next appeared in the Milky Way Sea!</p><br/><p>The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch had appeared in person, and Meng Hao narrowly avoided death. His Perfect Dao foundation was stolen, and just when he was about to truly die, Xu Qing saved him, proving that they were destined to be bound in marriage. After he awoke in the Rebirth Cave, he battled the Black Sieve Sect, then shockingly, descended into Bedevilment.</p><br/><p>At the Ancient Dao Lakes, he had snatched the soul of a true Immortal. Four powers of the Southern Domain had allied against the Blood Demon Sect in a shocking war. Then, on the day of his grand wedding, the Northern Reaches invaded. Xu Qing died, and Meng Hao went mad. Fight, fight, FIGHT!</p><br/><p>Kill, KILL, KILLLL!!!</p><br/><p>Finally, he severed the Devil and sought the Dao, stepping halfway into true Immortality.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s story swept through the Southern Domain like storm winds. The Western Desert heard the tales, as did the shocked Northern Reaches. Even the Eastern Lands caught wind. Meng Hao\u2019s name\u2026 had truly risen to prominence!</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>Currently, Meng Hao sat in Blood Prince Gorge in the Blood Demon Sect. His father and mother sat in front of him. Meng Hao was no longer shaken like he had been before. Instead, he sat there quietly, even taciturn.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of years had passed, and he had finally reunited with his parents. Although the memories from when he was seven years old had not been erased, they were somewhat foggy. However, the affection he felt because of the blood connection with his parents made things even more complicated.</p><br/><p>There were so many things he didn\u2019t understand, too many perplexing conundrums. Why did his father and mother leave that year? Why had they suddenly reappeared now? Where had they been this whole time\u2026?</p><br/><p>Where were they when he was experiencing grave crises?</p><br/><p>Where were they when the Resurrection Lily infected him?</p><br/><p>Where were they when the Wang Clan Patriarch stole his Perfect Dao foundation?</p><br/><p>Where were they when he nearly died in the Rebirth Cave?</p><br/><p>Where were they\u2026 when Xu Qing died?</p><br/><p>If they were merely mortals, it wouldn\u2019t matter. But they had just casually slain nine incredibly powerful experts in a single short battle. Meng Hao now knew that his father and mother were powerful. So powerful, in fact\u2026 that the Ji Clan hadn\u2019t appeared during the entire affair.</p><br/><p>He needed an answer. He needed an explanation. His heart\u2026 felt twisted into a knot.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er\u2026.\u201d began his mother, tears streaming down her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about Xu Qing. Your father placed a stream of divine sense on her. It will keep her safe during reincarnation, and will guide her back to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what is gnawing at your mind,\u201d his father said. \u201cYou must have many questions.\u201d There was love in his eyes, and it was clearly strong. He stretched out his hand, and a brilliant glow appeared at the tip of his finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me to take you into the past, to awaken your memories. Then\u2026 you will see the explanation with your own eyes.\u201d The brilliant glow rose up and approached Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at his father, and then looked at the brilliant glow. Finally, he closed his eyes. The bright glow fused into his forehead, then pulled him down into the deepest recesses of his memories.</p><br/><p>When he was born, there were two moons in the sky, and countless stars. It was picturesque.</p><br/><p>He heard laughter ringing about in a magnificent temple. The temple was so enormous that it spread out across half of the entire planet it occupied. That entire area belonged to\u2026</p><br/><p>The Fang Clan!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boy will be a qilin of the Fang Clan! [1. This expression is used to describe a child that will bring good fortune and prosperity to the family] Throw a banquet that will last for 300 years! Invite all of the Fellow Daoists from Planet East Victory!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Planet East Victory isn\u2019t enough. My grandson\u2019s name will definitely shake the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea! Invite the Fellow Daoists from all the other three planets! Invite the ancient sects as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child is my daughter\u2019s son, which means that his future path of might will encompass the Eighth Mountain too! Invite everyone from the Eighth Mountain to come offer their congratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice rang out amongst endless cheerful laughter. When Meng Hao opened his eyes, these were the things he heard and saw.</p><br/><p>A woman was holding him in her arms. When he looked up at her, he saw his mother, although she looked much younger. Standing next to her was a young girl of five or six years of age, looking at him with a curious, mischievous smile. Occasionally, she would take advantage of her mother\u2019s distraction to make faces at him. That was his older sister.</p><br/><p>Further off in the distance was his father, who looked very excited. He was surrounded by old men who were constantly toasting him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s birth caused a huge sensation throughout Planet East Victory. The reason was that\u2026 his father was a direct descendant of the Fang bloodline, and also the eldest son. As for Meng Hao\u2026 he was also a direct descendant, and the eldest grandson!</p><br/><p>Another reason was that Meng Hao\u2019s maternal grandfather was not from the Ninth Mountain. He was from the illustrious Meng Clan of the Eighth Mountain. In fact, the Lord of the Eighth Mountain was surnamed Meng!</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao was born, even the Ji Clan sent congratulatory gifts, and Lord Ji sent a Dharma Clone to visit.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s birth rocked all four great planets, the entire Ninth Mountain, and all the ancient sects.</p><br/><p>There were many people who understood that as long as this baby didn\u2019t turn out to be completely useless, then considering the power of the Fang and Meng clans, he would one day shine with blazing brilliance among the stars and seas.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case because the child had been born with a special mark on the back of his hand. It was a Nirvana Brand!</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Lord, you can\u2019t go in there! That\u2019s a restricted area! You can\u2019t just barge in!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Lord, I beg of you, please don\u2019t bite that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Lord, stop it, stop it! You can\u2019t dig holes there! The Patriarch planted that tree there personally! Y-y-you\u2026 that tree never did anything to you, don\u2019t dig it up\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a five-year-old boy who caused headaches for everyone in the Fang Clan. He was simply far too naughty.</p><br/><p>Virtually every day he ran around followed by a trail of fellow clan members. If there wasn\u2019t someone keeping an eye on him at all times\u2026 havoc would be wrought.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, you\u2019ve been naughty again!\u201d said his older sister, cracking her knuckles and looking at him with narrowed eyes and a mischievous smile. She was a head taller than him, and the sight of her stomping toward him caused Meng Hao\u2019s scalp to go numb. He backed up, stammering, and was just about to try to make an explanation when the smackdown began.</p><br/><p>As his sister grew up, she continued to be very strict on him, to the point where Meng Hao\u2019s heart filled with fear at the thought of her and her violent personality.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

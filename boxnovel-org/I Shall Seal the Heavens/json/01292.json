Tears for the battle, tears for the crumbled ruins, tears for the slaughter, tears because of the mutual destruction unleashed by the cultivators of the Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>The tears began to fall in the instant that Meng Hao said the final words of the incantation. They fell from the starry sky down onto the battlefield, splashing onto all the cultivators there.</p><br/><p>It was a gentle rain that seemed to contain no force whatsoever. The cultivators first stared in shock, but then began to relax. The pressure from moments ago had been shocking to the extreme, but in contrast, this rain seemed completely powerless. The Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, who had been so nervous moments ago, now had strange expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>The two who had been fighting with the Noble Ran even chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal the Heavens Incantation? This is the Seal the Heavens Incantation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow droll. What an amusing magical technique.\u201d Their nervousness instantly began to fade away. After breathing sighs of relief, they then began to laugh loudly.</p><br/><p>However, they backed up nonetheless. Although they did not fear the Seal the Heavens Incantation, the sudden addition of Meng Hao onto the battlefield was definitely fear-inspiring.</p><br/><p>The Chief Dharma Protector of the Heavengod Society sighed inwardly, and the other almighty Dao Realm experts of the Eighth Mountain and Sea looked on with grim expressions. There were only three people on the battlefield who had different reactions. One was Meng Hao, and another was the Noble Ran.</p><br/><p>The Noble Ran was laughing, a laughter filled with happiness and excitement.</p><br/><p>The third person who was acting completely differently was the boy Xiao Yihan, who was fleeing at top speed, and in a flash had exited the battlefield. Of everyone present, he understood Meng Hao the best, and was completely terrified of him.</p><br/><p>As for Meng Hao, he was completely calm as he closed his eyes. The Noble Ran\u2019s laughter continued to echo out as he too closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>The moment that Master and apprentice closed their eyes, the entire starry sky began to shake. The falling rain then erupted with a power that could shake Heaven and Earth. As it surged out, the gentleness from before became a burning madness.</p><br/><p>It was as if the Mountain and Sea Realm had suddenly gone from being incredibly sad to being exceedingly furious!</p><br/><p>It was furious that the living beings in the Mountain and Sea Realm would slaughter each other, furious that the 33 Heavens had completely sealed the Mountain and Sea Realm. It was furious at anything and everything!</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>A raindrop exploded, bypassing the cultivators of the Eighth Mountain and Sea to slam into the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea. Their faces fell as the power of that raindrop\u2019s explosion hit them like a mountain.</p><br/><p>RUMMMMBLLLE!</p><br/><p>One raindrop after another began to explode, filling the battlefield with intense explosions. In the blink of an eye, the whole battlefield was collapsing as the boundless power of the Mountains and Seas erupted out violently!</p><br/><p>Bloodcurdling screams rose up from the cultivators of the Seventh Mountain and Sea, as nearly a million cultivators coughed up huge mouthfuls of blood. That blood merged together into an entire sea of blood which swept out like floodwaters!</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!</p><br/><p>Things weren\u2019t over yet. The explosions continued as all of the rain detonated. The power of the Mountains and Seas... was thoroughly unleashed; it was like a giant, roaring across the battlefield. Each time it waved its arms, blood sprayed from mouths and cultivators were sent spinning through the air.</p><br/><p>The Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea wore expressions of shock; they could clearly sense the power of the Mountains and Seas, and could tell that it was incensed!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat... what power is this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can feel the rage of Heaven and Earth, this... this is shocking!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven and Earth is furious, the Mountain and Sea Realm is rejecting us! I can even sense my Essence trembling!!\u201d Cries of alarm rose up, filled with disbelief and astonishment. The Dao Realm cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were being suppressed by the will of the Mountain and Sea Realm itself. Rumbling echoed out as blood sprayed out of their mouths, and they were sent tumbling through the air.</p><br/><p>This shocking scene played out all over the battlefield. Blood sprayed out of the mouths of all of the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, and they began to fall back, albeit not voluntarily; they were being shoved backward by a massive force.</p><br/><p>All across the battlefield, the cultivators of the Eighth Mountain and Sea looked on with gaping jaws. The Chief Dharma Protector of the Heavengod Society was astonished, and the first Patriarch of the Righteous Noble Sect was shocked. All of the Dao Realm experts of the Eighth Mountain and Sea were aghast.</p><br/><p>That was not even to mention the other cultivators who were not in the Dao Realm. Everyone was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis power... it's the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm, the will of the Mountains and Seas!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seal the Heavens Incantation... the Noble Ran\u2019s Seal the Heavens Incantation can actually control the entire Mountain and Sea Realm!!\u201d Looks of disbelief began to appear on the faces of the Dao Realm cultivators of the Eighth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>A huge gap now existed between the two sides on the battlefield. However, no one was killed. The cultivators of the Seventh Mountain and Sea were injured and shocked, and their cultivation bases were suppressed, but no one was killed.</p><br/><p>Even still, what was happening was completely astonishing.</p><br/><p>The two Dao Realm experts who had been fighting the Noble Ran were included in that. Their faces were masses of shock and fear, and when they felt the power of expulsion pushing against them, a deep sense of unease rose up in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Both of them felt as if they were under attack by some monstrous power, and were sent flying backward accompanied by intense rumbling sounds.</p><br/><p>Even as they tumbled back, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes snapped open, and they blazed with killing intent. Voice cool, he said, \u201cAs for you two. You shall die!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not a request. It was a command, uttered with extreme calm.</p><br/><p>The instant the words left his mouth, the two Dao Realm experts screamed miserably as the power of the Mountains and Seas shredded them to bits. Blood and gore spattered out, and although their Nascent Divinities appeared and tried to flee, they were quickly destroyed by the power of the Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>Those two deaths caused the cultivators on both sides of the battlefield to gasp. Now that the two sides had been forcibly separated, everything went silent. The Noble Ran opened his eyes, and a wide smile broke out on his face.</p><br/><p>That smile was one of happiness and contentment, and when he looked at Meng Hao, his eyes glowed with deep gratitude.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked around the battlefield, then slowly said, \u201cWho said the Seal the Heavens Incantation was a worthless incantation?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one responded. Not a single cultivator dared to say a word. Everyone from both the Seventh Mountain and Sea and the Eighth was completely shaken, and when they looked at Meng Hao, it was with deep awe and dread.</p><br/><p>Anyone who could draw upon the power of the Mountains and Seas was someone completely terrifying. Someone like that... was similar to the Mountain and Sea Lords. They wielded power that ordinary people did not possess. Not even Dao Sovereigns were awe-inspiring enough to command the power of the Mountains and Seas, not unless they became Mountain and Sea Lords.</p><br/><p>Were it not for the fact that the Dao Realm experts from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were sure that the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea was slumbering and had not awoken, they would have believed Meng Hao to be the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s gaze swept across the crowds, then came to rest on the Noble Ran. Clasping hands, he bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWonderful. Wonderful!\u201d the Noble Ran said excitedly, laughing, but also staggering a bit from weakness and his internal injuries. Meng Hao hurried forward and held out an arm to help support him. As soon as he touched him, a gentle power sprang out from within Meng Hao and began to course through the Noble Ran, healing his injuries.</p><br/><p>As of that moment, all eyes were on the Noble Ran, and as for the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, their expressions were those of dread.</p><br/><p>When the Noble Ran felt his injuries healing rapidly, he looked at Meng Hao and mused that he really had made the right decision in taking him as an apprentice. In fact, for Meng Hao\u2019s sake, he had offended everyone in the entire Heavengod Alliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I can\u2019t stay,\u201d Meng Hao said quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s an important matter I have to attend to. Master, please take this jade slip. If... this Mountain and Sea is ever overrun by the enemy, please use it to borrow some of the power of the Seal the Heavens Incantation. Go to... the Ninth Mountain and Sea. That is my home.\u201d He handed the Noble Ran a jade slip that could be used to pierce through the barriers between Mountains and Seas, one of several that he had made at the same time that he had set up the spell formation in the Meng Clan.</p><br/><p>The Noble Ran smiled kindly and nodded, accepting the jade slip. He looked very content, as well as deeply proud. From this moment on, no one would ever dare to say that the Seal the Heavens Incantation was a worthless incantation!</p><br/><p>To say that it was worthless was to say that the entire Mountain and Sea Realm was worthless!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao once again clasped hands and bowed deeply to the Noble Ran. Then he looked around at the surrounding cultivators and said, \u201cAnyone who dares to harm my Master, regardless of their status or the level of their cultivation base, will have their entire sect or clan exterminated by me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, both those from the Seventh Mountain and Sea as well as those from the Eighth, all heard him, and their hearts trembled.</p><br/><p>A threat from someone who was similar to a Mountain and Sea Lord was a threat that even a Dao Sovereign had to take seriously.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao once again clasped hands to the Noble Ran, then made his way off the battlefield. The only reason he had come here was because of the Noble Ran. He resolved the situation, healed his Master\u2019s injuries, then said his parting words, certain that his Master would now be safe regardless of what happened in the war.</p><br/><p>After Meng Hao left, neither side on the battlefield felt like fighting any more, and gradually dispersed, faces filled with awe and other mixed emotions.</p><br/><p>This was the first time since the Mountain and Sea War began that... a battle ended in such a way.</p><br/><p>News quickly spread among both sides, and soon, everyone in the Eighth and Seventh Mountains and Seas were aware of how terrifying the Seal the Heavens Incantation was. They learned of Meng Hao, and also... that there was someone else in the war who was not to be provoked... the Noble Ran.</p><br/><p>No cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea dared to venture into the interior of the Heavengod Alliance. As for Meng Hao, he proceeded along through the starry sky, getting closer and closer to the Eighth Mountain.</p><br/><p>As he neared, it became more and more clear that the shocking fluctuations coming from the top of the Eighth Mountain... were filled with a familiar aura.</p><br/><p>A few more hours passed, and Meng Hao arrived at the foot of the Eighth Mountain. Looking up toward the peak of the mountain, he murmured, \u201cSir... are you my Grandpa Meng...?\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1292: Are you... My Grandpa Meng?</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

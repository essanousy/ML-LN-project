I truly admire you, sir, truly! With you here, Grandmaster, Holy Snow City will never fall!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Dekun laughed. Inwardly, he felt a bit emotional. Back in the Southern Domain, he could never have been so openly arrogant. But this was the backwater Black Lands, a place where continued existence was predicated by respect. Modesty was completely out of the question. Zhou Dekun had learned this lesson the hard way. So right now, he nodded proudly, indicating that the praise of him just now was absolutely correct.</p><br/><p>In his heart, he sighed as he thought back to the despair he had felt after having been taken to the Black Lands. He thought of his bitterness at realizing he would never be able to return to his Sect. There had been no one to serve him, and no Cultivator Clans to give him gifts and take care of him. At that time, his life had seemed as gray as ash.</p><br/><p>How could he ever have imagined that after the suffering would come happiness? He had managed to turn things around; he had been taken here because the people here viewed him almost like a treasure. After randomly concocting some medicinal pills, the locals had been shocked. He was provided with food and drink, and anything else he desired. He was even given two young female companions. His life was suddenly very comfortable, perhaps even more than back in the East Pill Division.</p><br/><p>As he thought back on everything, Zhou Dekun sighed. He might never again be able to see his Sect, and yet, that wasn\u2019t such a horrible thing....</p><br/><p>Thinking up to this point, he cleared his throat and then continued on with his lofty boasting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crappy little poison is nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wait until I concoct some of my own poison. I guarantee that those Western Desert Cultivators will have no choice other than to give in.\u201d He spoke with an air of self-assured authority.</p><br/><p>First Elder thought for a moment and then slowly said, \u201cIf Grandmaster Zhou is able to both dispel and concoct this same poison, then perhaps we should ask that other Cultivator to just leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Second and Fourth Elders nodded their heads at this, and were just about to voice their agreement when the old woman spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI disagree. Sir Zhou is clearly a Grandmaster of the Dao of alchemy. However, it took several days of research for him to determine the nature of the poison. Besides, I\u2019ve seen the results of that poison myself! If we make the other Cultivator leave, then we should really determine exactly how effective the poison is. Why not have a little competition between Sir Zhou and this other Cultivator? That way the man\u2019s true self can be clearly seen.\u201d She looked at First Elder.</p><br/><p>First Elder hesitated for a moment, then made a gesture to Second and Fourth Elders indicating that they should hold their tongues. He gazed at Zhou Dekun. \u201cGrandmaster Zhou, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Dekun laughed proudly. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m curious to lay eyes on this young mischief-maker and teach him a lesson. I\u2019ll help him to understand that the Dao of alchemy of the Southern Domain is boundless, and that alchemists of the Southern Domain are unsurpassable.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he listened, First Elder nodded and smiled. He happened to very much admire this Grandmaster Zhou. He had sampled the man\u2019s medicinal pills, and was confident that he was definitely number one in all of the Black Lands.</p><br/><p>Laughing, he rose to his feet with clasped hands, as did the old woman and the other Elders. Amidst all the smiles, the old woman sighed lightly. She had done everything she could and had put up a good fight. At least she had done her best to pay back Meng Hao\u2019s kindness in saving Hanxue Shan.</p><br/><p>Naturally, people were sent to notify Meng Hao. The date for the \u201cDao of alchemy consultation\u201d was set for three days later.</p><br/><p>News of the matter spread through Holy Snow City like a whirlwind. Everyone heard about it, both Frigid Snow Clan members and outside Cultivators. Excitement grew. Everyone knew the name of Zhou Dekun. After all, during recent years in Holy Snow City, the reputation of Grandmaster Zhou was like the sun in the noon sky.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was because of Grandmaster Zhou that so many Rogue Cultivators had been gathering in Holy Snow City. Regardless of the price they had to pay, they wanted to sample his medicinal pills.</p><br/><p>Whether openly or in the heart, all of them took Zhou Dekun to be the number one alchemist in the Black Lands. Actually, many Cultivators who consumed his medicinal pills were so shocked that they claimed Zhou Dekun to be the ultimate Grandmaster even in the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Zhou Dekun\u2019s name only continued to grow more illustrious in Holy Snow City. Unfortunately, this place was so far from the former Dongluo City that Meng Hao had never received any information about it.</p><br/><p>The news that Zhou Dekun planned to give a consultation regarding the Dao of alchemy caused quite a stir among the local Cultivators. All of them planned to personally go watch the event, not only to cheer on Grandmaster Zhou, but also to see how pill concocting worked.</p><br/><p>This news was shocking enough. However, shortly thereafter word was issued from the temple in which Zhou Dekun resided. Based on recent battle achievements, he would choose ten individuals for whom he would personally concoct medicinal pills! This new bit of information immediately caused a huge sensation.</p><br/><p>As the entire city simmered, Meng Hao sat cross-legged in his courtyard, surrounded by lotuses, looking at the invitation card in his hand. A strange expression covered his face, like a smile, and yet not. Standing across from him was Hanxue Shan, who was completely unable to discern his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what kind of expression is that?\u201d she said, trying to suppress her nervousness. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but ever since the day Meng Hao had looked down at her from his position atop the giant\u2019s head, smiled, and spoken those words, after which she had walked up in a trance to join him, well\u2026 for some reason she kept thinking about him.</p><br/><p>Actually, as soon as she had heard of the matter of Grandmaster Zhou, she had immediately run over to tell Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said with a slight smile. \u201cI just think this Zhou Dekun is kind of funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d she cried, stamping her foot and glaring angrily at Meng Hao. \u201cZhou Dekun is at the pinnacle of the Dao of alchemy, the number one alchemist in the Black Lands! He\u2019s even famous in the Southern Domain, the personal disciple of Grandmaster Pill Demon! He\u2019s also the Elder Brother of Grandmaster Pill Cauldron. Do you know who Grandmaster Pill Demon is? Have you even heard of him!?</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople such as them are like Chosen of Heaven, and you don\u2019t even pay them any attention? All you can do is concoct poison! Aren\u2019t you nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was a pretty girl to begin with, but when she acted like this, it revealed another side of her beauty, as if she were vying with the surrounding lotuses. Meng Hao shook his head and smiled, a virtually imperceptible glitter in his eyes as he considered her words.</p><br/><p>A perplexed look on his face, he asked, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of Grandmaster Pill Demon, ma\u2019am, and I very much respect him. But who is this Grandmaster Pill Cauldron of whom you speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who Grandmaster Pill Cauldron is?\u201d she replied, her eyes wide and filled with disbelief. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. You\u2019re just a Rogue Cultivator, so you don\u2019t know much about the Southern Domain. I bet you don\u2019t even know anyone who\u2019s been to the Southern Domain! Your ignorance of Grandmaster Pill Cauldron is understandable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, let me tell you, Grandmaster Pill Cauldron is the number one Chosen in the Violet Fate Sect of the Southern Domain.\u201d A look of adoration filled her eyes as she spoke. \u201cHis name is Fang Mu, and he\u2019s Grandmaster Pill Demon\u2019s Legacy Apprentice. His Dao of alchemy rocks everything under Heaven. He\u2019s an amazing person who will be the stuff of legends in the future. He\u2019s an expert in poisons, and has a unique understanding of the Dao of alchemy. There isn\u2019t anyone in the United Nine of the Black Lands who doesn\u2019t know about him. I have a dream that one day in the future, I\u2019ll be able to go to the Southern Domain and pay him a visit. I\u2019ll plead with him to concoct a medicinal pill for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gave a dry cough. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating,\u201d he said without thinking. As soon as the words left his mouth, Hanxue Shan\u2019s gaze turned dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? You\u2019re not convinced?\u201d She glared at him with wide eyes. After he had saved her twice, she suddenly found that she was less reserved in front of him, and more open. \u201cYou can disbelieve others, or remain unconvinced by their words. But, you are not allowed to disrespect Grandmaster Pill Cauldron! Fang Mu joined the Violet Fate Sect when he was seventeen years old. When he was just an apprentice alchemist, he utilized the Violet Fate Sect\u2019s East Pill Division techniques to cause a shocking scene! He displayed unprecedented talent, and caused everyone to be shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, one of the East Pill Division Elders personally endorsed him to participate in the trial by fire to become a master alchemist. He was the first person to ever do so after having joined the Sect for less than a year! The way he became number one in the Sect was something exceedingly rare from ancient times until now!</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to his absolute superiority, he was promoted to master alchemist, after which he created a Bedevilment Pill, which sent the entire Southern Domain into an uproar. Later, he competed with Grandmaster Eternal Mountain and produced a Myriad Strength Pill, which was impossible to crush. That\u2019s when he became a Furnace Lord!\u201d By this point in her tirade, she really seemed to be upset. Her words came out in a rush.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that he took place in an alchemy duel in the Black Sieve Sect. His Dao was shocking. Later, he received enlightenment at the Ancient Dao Geyser. He cowed the Dao Child of the Black Lands Palace and slaughtered an azure-masked Core Formation Cultivator, causing his name to ring out under all the Heavens! Later, in the Violet Fate Sect trial by fire for Violet Furnace Lords, he took first place in unprecedented fashion, suppressing Chosen to become a Violet Furnace Lord and the Legacy Apprentice of the East Pill Division!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did all that in only a few years. Do you really think you\u2019re better than someone like that? You really think you can measure up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stared at her in shock, his face a bit red. He felt somewhat embarrassed.</p><br/><p>To be praised and commended in such a way was something he wasn\u2019t used to. He almost couldn\u2019t believe that Hanxue Shan knew so much about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that she specifically investigated me?\u201d he thought. He cleared his throat again, feeling a bit complacent. He couldn\u2019t help but give a faint smile as he looked at Hanxue Shan. The look on her face said that she would fight to the death if he didn\u2019t show respect to Grandmaster Pill Cauldron.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this Grandmaster Pill Cauldron knew he had a devotee like you here in the Black Lands, I think he would be very happy.\u201d He laughed jokingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Don\u2019t mock my love for Grandmaster Pill Cauldron. So what if I love him? He\u2019s my dream beloved!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao laughed. Now he knew for sure that for some reason, the incident at the Rebirth Cave was not known among the Cultivators in the Black Lands. Perhaps the news hadn\u2019t spread, or\u2026 perhaps the fact that he had left the Violet Fate Sect and fled for his life\u2026 had been suppressed!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

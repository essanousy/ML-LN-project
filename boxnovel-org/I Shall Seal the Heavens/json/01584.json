I am the Immortal!\u201d The ten stars on the forehead of the Heavenly God giant exploded, seriously injuring Meng Hao. However, the result was that the giant\u2019s body was completely withered up. As Allheaven gave up on that body, he shrank down rapidly, and at the same time, an intense Immortal qi exploded out from his chest!</p><br/><p>As the Immortal qi erupted out, two hands suddenly burst out from inside the giant\u2019s chest, sending chunks of flesh and blood flying in all directions.</p><br/><p>A ripping sound could be heard as the giant's chest was torn open, allowing even more Immortal qi to pour out.</p><br/><p>The incredible nature of the Immortal qi spread out, creating something from nothing as numerous amounts of Immortal jade suddenly appeared in the destroyed starry sky.</p><br/><p>The Immortal jade glittered with radiant light, and despite the intense level of the fighting, the sight of it provoked a look of shock from Meng Hao. Then he subconsciously licked his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a brazen strategy!\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd effective.\u201d It took supreme effort, but he managed to restore his composure after seeing the mounds of Immortal jade.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a figure emerged from within the giant\u2019s chest. Surrounded by vast quantities of Immortal qi, it was a middle-aged man. He had no hair on his head or anywhere else on his body, and his expression was completely placid. After appearing, he waved his hand behind him, causing the Heavenly God giant to tremble and then collapse. However, instead of turning into ash, it transformed into a leather cloak!</p><br/><p>It was leather formed from the skin of the Heavenly God, and as it settled down onto the middle-aged man with the Immortal qi, it made him seem completely cold and ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Immortal!\u201d the man said softly, his eyes shining with brilliant light as he looked at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019ve forced Allheaven to summon me means that you are an incredible foe....\u201d Even as his voice echoed out, the man vanished and then reappeared behind Meng Hao. Before Meng Hao could even turn around, the man had placed his hand onto Meng Hao\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out, and blood sprayed out of Meng Hao\u2019s mouth. And yet, his eyes flickered with a vicious light, and his left hand shot up to grab the man\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the Immortal!\u201d Meng Hao growled. A surprised frown appeared on the man\u2019s face as Meng Hao jerked his hand out, sending the man tumbling through the air. At the same time, Meng Hao began to fly toward him. His right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and without any hesitation or pause, he pushed his hand down onto the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cSixth Hex, Life-Death Hexing. This Hex doesn't affect your freedom, it merely decides whether you live or die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as the Immortal qi surrounding the man suddenly vanished. When he reappeared, he was off in another direction. At the same time, Meng Hao\u2019s Sixth Hex appeared to have done nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne Hexing magic isn\u2019t enough,\u201d said the man. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use your Seventh Hex....?\u201d His eyes shone with a strange light; he was clearly using augury to analyze the situation. The truth was that Allheaven really did want to fully analyze all of Meng Hao\u2019s Hexing magic. Although he had witnessed them in the past, he had never personally experienced them.</p><br/><p>Only by doing so could his true form fully prepare to crush Meng Hao in battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to see what my Hexing magics look like now that I\u2019ve Transcended, you\u2019ll have to show me some more of your transformations.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered. Actually, his plans for this battle were similar to Allheaven\u2019s. Allheaven wanted to observe his Hexing magic, but he wanted to test out all of the various Allheaven Transformations.</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse to believe that your Allheaven Transformations can be augmented limitlessly,\u201d Meng Hao said coldly. \u201cAfter all, this is your clone, not your true form. There are probably some high level transformations that you can\u2019t even use here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the Immortal qi gave a cold harrumph. The Immortal qi swirling around him began to grow more powerful, and his eyes grew sharper than ever. \u201cFine. You want to see? I\u2019ll show you. I\u2019ll show you... exactly what the Immortal really is!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Immortal is a man and a mountain!\u201d [1. It\u2019s been awhile since this explanation of the character Immortal came up. As a quick refresher, Immortal is . The character for man or person is  and mountain is . If you squeeze the  off to side, it looks like this: \uff0c which you can combine with mountain  to make Immortal ] This Immortal version of Allheaven raised both hands up over his head so that they formed the shape of a mountain peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain!\u201d he roared. Instantly, the starry sky of the Vast Expanse began to tremble as a power began to descend from outside of the Vast Expanse. Everything trembled; planets, land masses, and worlds all creaked under the pressure.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could sense the power pushing him down, as though countless worlds were crushing down onto him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the outline of a mountain appeared noiselessly above the head of Allheaven\u2019s clone. It was merely an outline, but it was filled with boundless pressure that seemed to lend an air of perfection to Allheaven.</p><br/><p>The Immortal was a man and a mountain!</p><br/><p>\u201cImmortal magic is actually not a divine ability or a magical technique. Instead, it comes from Essence. It is... crushing pressure!</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom ancient times until now, the appearance of the Immortal signifies pressure that can crush anything not Immortal!</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, you said you want to see my transformations. Well, I\u2019ll demonstrate by crushing you!\u201d This Immortal form of Allheaven looked at Meng Hao with flickering eyes. Then, he pushed his hands out, causing the mountain to fly toward Meng Hao at top speed, emanating intense pressure.</p><br/><p>It was a dazzling energy that could crush anything and everything!</p><br/><p>The Immortal version of Allheaven flickered, suddenly appearing on top of the peak of the mountain as it rumbled down toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked up at the descending mountain, and could sense the terrifying pressure coming from it, something that vastly exceeded the power of the Heavenly God. The Heavenly God could injure Meng Hao, and even crush his bones. However, it couldn\u2019t harm his deepest foundation. On the other hand, the power crushing down on him from this Immortal mountain caused even his Dao Essence to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man, and a mountain. That\u2019s the Immortal...</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Since you\u2019re revealing the Immortal, then the time has come for me to show you my Hexing magic combination!\u201d Eyes filled with ultimate determination, Meng Hao waved his sleeve, performing an incantation gesture which caused his cultivation base to erupt with power. Then, Hexing magic towered up.</p><br/><p>First Hex!</p><br/><p>Second Hex!</p><br/><p>Third Hex!</p><br/><p>Fourth Hex!</p><br/><p>Fifth Hex!</p><br/><p>Sixth Hex!</p><br/><p>Six Hexes all combined!</p><br/><p>The combined power of the Hexing magics unleashed a paramount power, the power of the League of Demon Sealers, the power to seal Heaven and Earth, the power to seal everything which existed. Six Hexing magics combined into one, transforming into a gigantic hand.</p><br/><p>That hand only had four fingers, but burst with unheard-of, shocking power. Without the slightest pause, the hand rose up to meet the man and the mountain, to kill the Immortal!</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1584: Six Hexes Combined!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

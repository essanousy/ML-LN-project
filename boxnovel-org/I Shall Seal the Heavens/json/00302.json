He didn\u2019t seem to think Meng Hao was even worth looking at, and spoke to him as he might a servant.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao frowned. However, he thought of the fearsomeness of the Clan, as well as the fear An Zaihai had shown. He thought about everything he had experienced, and all the stories regarding Ji. Then, he immediately suppressed any feelings of displeasure he felt.</p><br/><p>Now was not the appropriate time to attack; his Cultivation base had reached a critical juncture, the time when the important transformation would occur. Meng Hao knew that to attack now would affect the growth of his Cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the Ji youth\u2019s Cultivation base was at the peak of the early Core Formation stage, even higher than the azure-masked Cultivator from the Black Lands he had fought.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour excellency, I\u2019m not quite sure what you mean,\u201d said Meng Hao, looking surprised. \u201cI just arrived here myself, and haven\u2019t been able to find anything. Don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s some sort of treasure here?\u201d The glow of greed shone in his eyes as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The Ji youth\u2019s eyes glittered as he glanced at Meng Hao, and an expression of utter disdain covering his face. He looked around, heart still filled with suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy\u2019s Cultivation base is at the Foundation Establishment level,\u201d he thought. \u201cNo matter how weak the Immortal is, there\u2019s no way this guy could penetrate his Immortal Sense. Plus, he\u2019s slumbering. Even I couldn't forcibly break into the Immortal Sense, not even with the device given to me by the Patriarch. So, could it have been taken earlier by someone else?\u201d Within the Ji youth\u2019s mind appeared the image of the girl surnamed Fang. He glanced over at Meng Hao. \u201cDid you encounter anyone on your way here? Whatever it is you saw, tell me immediately,\u201d he demanded. \u201cIf you leave out anything, I will wipe you and your Sect and Clan!\u201d He made no attempt to cover over his disdain and superciliousness.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hesitated, then lowered his voice. \u201cSomeone else? Yes, I did see someone, actually, wearing a green robe. I couldn\u2019t really see clearly which Fellow Daoist\u2026 it was\u2026 This place\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, the Ji youth seemed to have made his mind up. He flicked his sleeve impatiently. \u201cScrew off!\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered with an imperceptible coldness. However, a cowardly look appeared on his face, and he immediately backed up, then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>It was at this exact moment that suddenly, the wall next to him exploded outward, and a person in green emerged.</p><br/><p>Along with this person came an incredibly potent aura, which immediately enveloped the entire area. Not only did it contain power, but also feeling of extreme conceit.</p><br/><p>As the aura roiled out, the figure emerged slowly, a young woman. This was none other than the girl surnamed Fang, who was also from the Eastern Lands. As soon as she appeared, her eyes fell onto the Ji youth.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was standing right next to her, but she completely ignored him. The arrogance which emanated from her was virtually palpable.</p><br/><p>\u201cJi Hongdong, give the Immortal\u2019s scripture to me!\u201d said the young woman coolly. She was beautiful, and emanated icy arrogance. [1]</p><br/><p>When he saw the girl appear, Meng Hao\u2019s heart began to thump, and he backed up a few paces. Before he could get very far, the Ji youth\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Yu, it turns out you took the Immortal\u2019s scripture, and still\u2026.\u201d He only finished half of his thought when his heart suddenly trembled. He abruptly looked at Meng Hao, and as he did, he blinked his right eye seven times in rapid succession. Suddenly, two pupils could be seen within his eye. They seemed to possess some power of psychic sight! As he looked at Meng Hao, he immediately was able to see the white diamond in Meng Hao\u2019s dantian. [2. Fang Yu\u2019s name in Chinese is  f\u0101ng y\u00fa - Fang is a family name. Yu means \u201cbeauty\u201d or \u201cjade\u201d]</p><br/><p>In addition to the diamond, there was a blurriness. Even the diamond by itself was enough to cause killing intent to spring out from the Ji youth\u2019s eyes. However, just as soon as it appeared, it then vanished.</p><br/><p>The speed with which all of this happened was such that if you blinked, you wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up even the slightest clue that something was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreposterous!\u201d said the Ji youth with a cold laugh. Ignoring Meng Hao, he immediately shot toward Fang Yu. As he neared, he waved his right hand, causing a field of stars to appeared behind him. Fang Yu gave a cold snort and also advanced. She lifted her hand, forming a fist and punching out into the air. A huge boom resonated out in all directions.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao immediately tumbled backward, then picked a random direction and sped off.</p><br/><p>His face was grim. He could see that Ji Hongdong had seen through him; he didn\u2019t point it out and immediately pursue Meng Hao because of the Fang girl. Instead of saying something, he planned to come after Meng Hao later, alone.</p><br/><p>The walls continued to fill with cracks, although Meng wasn\u2019t sure how long it would take until they completely crumbled. He slapped his bag of holding to retrieve the good luck charm. He pressed down on it, after which a frustrated look appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>For the first time ever, the good luck charm was powerless to teleport him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t place all of my hope on the collapse of this place\u2026.\u201d thought Meng Hao. He knew full well that before the place fell to pieces, he had somewhat of a chance to flee. However, once the collapse was complete, if Ji Hongdong came after him, he would be in a very bad position.</p><br/><p>Ji Hongdong\u2019s status, his place in the fearsome Ji Clan, made it such that if he were killed, it would be equivalent to deliberately invoking monolithic disaster. Meng Hao wasn\u2019t sure if the Violet Fate Sect would even be able to fight back. The two powers weren\u2019t even on the same level.</p><br/><p>His face grim, Meng Hao continued on for a bit less time than it takes half an incense stick to burn. Finally, he gritted his teeth and stopped, sitting down cross-legged on the ground. Ignoring the crumbling of the walls around him, he began to meditate, rotating his Cultivation base and pushing as fast as possible toward Core Formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of anything, I will only be able to seize the initiative\u2026 after I reach Core Formation!\u201d A bright glow appeared in his eyes. This was a moment of crisis, leaving him little time to think things through. He closed his eyes and spit out a mouthful of mist, which immediately crackled with lightning as it surrounded him. At the same time, a halo the color of blood emerged from Meng Hao, and a Blood Clone materialised and began to guard over him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s ten Dao Pillars emitted a roaring sound that only he could hear. Massive amounts of Violet Qi poured forth, causing the Dao Pillars to begin to melt and then merge together.</p><br/><p>After the Dao Pillars fully melted he would be able to form his Core. Thanks to the Immortal Qi, this process would happen much more quickly. Once Meng Hao reached Core Formation, he would set the record as the fastest person to do so since ancient times.</p><br/><p>Time passed by. Meng Hao wasn\u2019t sure when Ji Hongdong would come for him. However, it would happen quickly, he was sure of that. Ji Hongdong had picked up on the clues. Once he shook off the young Fang woman, he would be coming for Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMust go faster!!\u201d thought Meng Hao, circulating all the power within his Cultivation base. Suddenly, a shocking roar filled his mind. His tenth Dao Pillar was now melting.</p><br/><p>As the Dao Pillar melted, vast quantities of Violet Qi poured out, wrapping around and around the collection of violet mist which already existed around the Immortal Qi. The globule of violet mist rotated rapidly, emitting countless strands of Violet Qi throughout Meng Hao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A brutally powerful aura appeared within Meng Hao; his physical body grew more powerful, his Spiritual Sense expanded, and most obviously, the Blood Clone and the Blood Death World he was within slowly began to grow stronger.</p><br/><p>As the true self grew stronger, so did they!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wasn\u2019t satisfied, though. The speed was too slow. Veins bulged on his face as he pushed everything into rotating his Cultivation base. Amidst the roaring, his ninth Dao Pillar began to melt. More Violet Qi poured out. The violet mist globule rotated even more rapidly; it was now showing signs of condensing into a Core.</p><br/><p>Next, his eighth Dao Pillar, then his seventh. They melted one after another, filling him with rumbling booms. Boundless spiritual energy exploded out, causing the violet mist to roil at even greater speed. It sucked in Violet Qi. As of this moment, Meng Hao\u2019s body was emitting a bright violet glow.</p><br/><p>The globule of violet mist spun at high speed. All signs pointed to it forming into a Violet Core at any moment. Seeing this, Meng Hao quickly consumed a large amount of Three Mortalities Pills. It still wasn\u2019t enough. Meng Hao could clearly sense that he was\u2026 immeasurably close to Core Formation!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven faster!\u201d thought Meng Hao with an inward growl. A thunderous noise could be heard as his sixth Dao Pillar, fifth Dao Pillar and fourth Dao Pill all melted. It was at this time that off in the distance, Meng Hao could hear a loud noise; someone was using a magical technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Ji Hongdong\u2026.\u201d thought Meng Hao. He was focused on rotating his Dao Pillars, but he had long since sent his Spiritual Sense out into the area. He immediately caught sight of a figure making its way toward him at high speed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sighed inwardly and opened his eyes. Off in the distance was Li Daoyi, wearing a thoughtful smile.</p><br/><p>Catching sight of Meng Hao, he gave a slight smile and said, \u201cI was wondering who it was that Fellow Daoist Ji wanted me to pursue and delay. So, it turns out it\u2019s Grandmaster Fang Mu.\u201d He slowly approached. As he neared, he suddenly stopped and gaped at Meng Hao. \u201cCore Formation aura? You picked this moment to form your Core?\u201d He laughed, his expression filled with a sneer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really live up to your reputation, Grandmaster Fang Mu,\u201d he said. \u201cVery audacious! However, you took something that belongs to Fellow Daoist Ji. That\u2019s a no-no. The mere sight of you fills me with the desire to kill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMake a move against me and you\u2019ll cause a war between the Li Clan and the Violet Fate Sect,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly, his expression the same as ever. He was in a race against time; his Cultivation base was rotating rapidly, causing his remaining three Dao Pillars to begin to melt away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would of course never attack you,\u201d said Li Daoyi with a hypocritical smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just block your way, make sure you stay behind and don\u2019t leave. Your life does not belong to me, but rather, Fellow Daoist Ji. The Clan Patriarchs will be more than happy to allow something like this to happen.\u201d He lifted his hand, extending it toward Meng Hao\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sighed. It seemed he would not be able to make his breakthrough at the moment. Killing intent glittered in his eyes, and he was just about to make a move, when suddenly, his face flickered.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Li Daoyi\u2019s face also changed. He spun, and then dodged to the side.</p><br/><p>Just as he did, a clear, melodious snort rang out, filling the air. A band of white light flashed through the spot where Li Daoyi had just stood, then shot after him.</p><br/><p>Next, a prismatic beam shot toward them, coming to a stop next to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>There, wearing a white robe, facial expression icy cold, was Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>She glared at Li Daoyi.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake your breakthrough,\u201d she said calmly to Meng Hao. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d Her voice was cold, but as her words made their way into Meng Hao\u2019s heart, they transformed into gentle warmth.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Fang Yu</p><br/><p>[audio mp3=\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fang_yu.mp3\"][/audio]</p><br/><p>Ji Hongdong</p><br/><p>[audio mp3=\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ji_hong_dong.mp3\"][/audio]</p><br/><p></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><ol><li><span id=\"footnote-1\">Ji Hongdong\u2019s name in Chinese is  j\u00ec h\u00f3ng d\u014dng - Ji is a family name.

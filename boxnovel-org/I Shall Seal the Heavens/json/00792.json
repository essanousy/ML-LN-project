How could that dinky ancestral statuary possibly suppress his excellency Meng Hao!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t his excellency Meng Hao at Dao Seeking\u2026? How could there be a great Dao of Spirit Severing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Southern Domain cultivators were in an uproar, and many of them were completely flabbergasted. From the feeling most people got, Meng Hao couldn\u2019t possibly be in the Spirit Severing stage. Essentially, most people had long forgotten that his cultivation base was actually at the Second Severing level!</p><br/><p>In the history of the lands of South Heaven, there had never been a Spirit Severing expert who possessed a peak Dao Seeking clone. Nor had there ever been a battle in which a Spirit Severing cultivator actually fought and killed someone at the peak of Dao Seeking.</p><br/><p>The things which these cultivators were witnessing were completely unheard-of. Therefore, there were quite a few people who actually believed that Meng Hao\u2026 was at the peak of Dao Seeking!</p><br/><p>Of course, the Northern Reaches cultivators\u2019 shock and astonishment was even more intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ancestral statuary can\u2019t keep him suppressed! Just\u2026 where is this guy from!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually at the Spirit Severing stage? That\u2019s impossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! How\u2026 how could he possibly be a mere Spirit Severing cultivator!? If he can fight the peak of Dao Seeking now, then when he steps into Dao Seeking, doesn\u2019t that mean he could fight false Immortals!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Northern Reaches cultivators were thoroughly astonished. One by one, they all looked over toward Meng Hao with expressions of shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>These people were not very familiar with Meng Hao. Now that they realized the truth about him, it was almost impossible for them to accept.</p><br/><p>As for the Western Desert cultivators, they immediately began to make loud exclamations, the noise of which turned into a sound wave that shook everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number one non-Immortal in all the lands of South Heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exalted Meng Hao is about to free himself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit Severing into Dao Seeking!\u201d</p><br/><p>As for Pill Demon and Patriarch Song, they were unfazed. Although they knew Meng Hao\u2019s true cultivation base, and had gotten used to his incredible power, they had stopped paying attention to the fact that he was actually still in the Spirit Severing stage.</p><br/><p>However, the Northern Reaches cultivators did not know this, and they stared with gaping mouths. The obese woman was especially astonished, and she suddenly glanced over at the expressionless face of Meng Hao\u2019s second true self.</p><br/><p>Then she started to tremble, and her scalp went numb. She suddenly had the feeling that the Northern Reaches had made a colossal mistake in invading the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>There was someone who was even more shaken than her, a person whose heart filled with massive waves of astonishment. That was the number one most powerful expert from the Northern Reaches, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief!</p><br/><p>He was in a daze, and could hardly believe what was happening. In fact, he wasn\u2019t willing to believe. The incredible battle he had just experienced with Meng Hao had left him wounded, and had forced him to use the ancestral statuary. And that\u2026 was a battle with a Spirit Severing expert!?</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d he gasped. His eyes were filled with not just shock, but also terror. He could never have possibly imagined that there really was an unequaled Chosen who could accomplish the things Meng Hao had while merely in the Spirit Severing stage.</p><br/><p>In his disbelief, he felt his scalp grow completely numb.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how you put it, you have to say that the Third Severing is the most critical of all,\u201d he thought. \u201cThe slightest mistake, and you immediately perish. Even if you aren\u2019t completely right or wrong, your cultivation base will be forever restrained.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao obviously hasn\u2019t prepared well for the Third Severing, that much can be determined. Therefore, this Spirit Severing right now is being done because he\u2019s been forced into a corner. It\u2019s a forced Severing!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case\u2026 if he fails, then he will perish this very day!</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao\u2026 there\u2019s no way that you can succeed!\u201d The Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief was truly frightened, and simply couldn\u2019t believe how unimaginably powerful Meng Hao would be if he succeeded in entering into Dao Seeking\u2026.</p><br/><p>The great Dao was growing even more powerful. The entire sky above South Heaven was now completely obscured.</p><br/><p>In the lands of South Heaven, in that tower of Tang, the man and woman stood together, trembling. The woman was excited, and the man was apparently trying to keep his cool, but failing.</p><br/><p>They had been waiting for this day for a very, very long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still can\u2019t go,\u201d murmured the man. \u201cJust wait a bit longer. Only a little bit\u2026. This is the final stretch!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he succeeds, then we will finally be able to reunite. If he doesn\u2019t succeed\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>His wife clasped his hand tightly. Both of their palms were slick with sweat.</p><br/><p>In their entire lives, this man and woman had never been so nervous, nor was there any event they had ever experienced that was so important. Even if some shockingly powerful individual attempted to interfere with what was happening, they would pay any price to stop that person from causing even the slightest bit of trouble!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve waited for three lives. For hundreds of years\u2026. Just for this moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, you\u2026 must\u2026 succeed and reach Dao Seeking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Back in the cage, Meng Hao sat cross-legged, trembling slightly, his hair floating around him. The world around him had shrunk down to only about three thousand meters. There was virtually nothing around him except for air. All of the mountains and everything else had been crushed into dust by the shocking pressure.</p><br/><p>Cracking sounds could be heard emanating out from his body, as if his skeleton were being ground away.</p><br/><p>However, Meng Hao didn\u2019t notice. All of his concentration was focused on summoning the blade of the Third Severing. The more intense his summons grew, the more obscure Heaven and Earth became in the outside world.</p><br/><p>The great Dao grew stronger, to the point where a mist appeared\u2026. The mist was first seen on the battlefield and then spread out to cover all of the lands of South Heaven.</p><br/><p>The peak Dao Seeking experts from the three territories immediately recognized what was happening. They began to speak in hushed tones, which were overheard by the other cultivators, causing their hearts to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Dao turned into mist!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only time a Dao will take form as a mist is when an incredibly powerful expert gains enlightenment of a great Dao! Only then will such transformations of Heaven and Earth take place!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something you only hear about in legends! It\u2019s virtually unheard of in the lands of South Heaven!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A gleam of excitement appeared in Pill Demon\u2019s eyes, and he almost couldn\u2019t hold back the laughter that burst out in his heart.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Song looked equally excited.</p><br/><p>In contrast, Meng Hao\u2019s second true self suddenly closed his eyes and sat down cross-legged in midair!</p><br/><p>The descent of the great Dao caused all hostilities to cease. Even the peak Dao Seeking experts were incapable of making attacks during the great Dao\u2019s descent. The Northern Reaches experts could do nothing but stare in wide-eyed disbelief at Meng Hao\u2019s second true self sitting there cross-legged.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! You\u2019d better not pull it off, Meng Hao!\u201d thought the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. His heart was pounding.</p><br/><p>Currently, all of the powerful experts of the Northern Reaches, Western Desert and Southern Domain were closely observing the scene. Back in the Eastern Lands, the Ji Clan was completely quiet. As for the young Patriarch with the missing arms, he was staring fixedly at what was happening.</p><br/><p>By this time, there were other powerful experts from various sects and clans in the Eastern Lands who had also sensed what was happening. Shocked, they sent out their divine sense to observe. However, no one dared to do anything. After all, if the Ji Clan wasn\u2019t interfering, how could they dare to interfere?</p><br/><p>It was at this point that, back in the cage, Meng Hao abruptly lifted his head. His eyes opened, and he cried out: \u201cThird Severing!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice echoed back and forth within the world, which had now shrunk to 1,500 meters. At first it didn\u2019t seem that the sound could be heard in the outside world, but in actuality, it was as if there were innumerable Meng Haos issuing an echoing cry that could be heard faintly by those outside.</p><br/><p>It almost seemed as if the sound was coming from the mist itself, as if the echoing response came from within the descending great Dao itself.</p><br/><p>Countless ears heard the voice, and everyone who did was completely and thoroughly shaken.</p><br/><p>As the voice echoed out, the mist that covered all of South Heaven suddenly surged back, roiling as it condensed above the battlefield in the Southern Domain. There, in midair, it formed into the shape\u2026</p><br/><p>Of a Mist Blade!!</p><br/><p>Mist Blade!</p><br/><p>Dao enlightenment! [1. There is an important play on words here. In Chinese, \u201cMist Blade\u201d is pronounced \u201cw\u00f9 d\u0101o,\u201d almost exactly as the pronunciation of Dao enlightenment, which is \u201cw\u00f9 d\u00e0o\u201d]</p><br/><p>As soon as the Mist Blade appeared, the eyes of all of the peak Dao Seeking experts on the battlefield went wide. Their minds filled with a roaring sound. Even Pill Demon wore an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>The fact that there was a Dao that became so strong it turned into a mist was shocking enough. Something legendary like that was possible to accept. However\u2026 to see the mist turn into a blade was something that filled them with uncontrollable shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cMist\u2026 Blade!!\u201d thought the shocked Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 something that should be experienced on the Immortal Mountain, just before pushing open the Door of Immortality, when reaching Immortal Ascension!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who achieve true Immortal Ascension must face Immortal Tribulation. After they transcend the tribulation, they will stand on an Immortal Mountain of their own. As they take that step forward, a Mist Blade will fall. Then, they will be severed from the Spirit Realm and have the power to push open the Door of Immortality, and become a true Immortal!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he\u2026 is using a Mist Blade to perform his Third Severing!! When that Mist Blade slashes through him, it will sever his Spirit Nucleus and stabilize the path to true Immortality!!\u201d</p><br/><p>His mind was reeling, and his body trembling. Suddenly, he realized that sending troops into the Southern Domain had been a monumental error!!</p><br/><p>All of the peak Dao Seeking experts up in midair were shocked. Of course, it wasn\u2019t just them. In the Eastern Lands, the Patriarchs of the various sects were equally astonished. They could hardly believe what they were seeing, and were filled with shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that young man!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s using a Mist Blade for his Third Severing! If he fails then it doesn\u2019t matter, but if he succeeds, wouldn\u2019t it be a defiance of the Heavens?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he succeeds, then will he step into Dao Seeking, or Immortality?\u201d</p><br/><p>The armless young man in the Ji Clan suddenly rose to his feet, his eyes wide and filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cRumor has it that Fang Xiufeng, the number one Chosen in the Fang Clan, used a blade composed of twenty percent mist in his Third Severing. That caused a huge commotion among the ancient clans of the Ninth Mountain. Even the Patriarch watched the whole thing with rapt attention. [1. Fang Xiufeng\u2019s name in Chinese is  f\u0101ng xi\u00f9 f\u0113ng. Fang is a surname which also means \u201csquare\u201d or \u201cdirection.\u201d Xiu means \u201celegant\u201d or \u201chandsome.\u201d Feng means \u201cpeak\u201d or \u201csummit\u201d]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Meng Hao\u2026 he\u2026 he\u2019s actually even more Heaven-defying in his Spirit Severing than Fang Xiufeng. He\u2019s actually\u2026 using a complete Mist Blade!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Tower of Tang, the woman gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dao became a mist, and the mist became a blade!\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes shone with excitement, and she was trembling violently. \u201cHusband\u2026 can you believe Hao\u2019er is doing this!?!? He even\u2026 he\u2026 he didn\u2019t just bring SOME of the mist together, he actually used all of it to make a Mist Blade! He\u2019s vastly more shocking than you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh Year Tribulation,\u201d murmured the man. \u201cFour lifetimes. Three incarnations predestined\u2026. Only by preventing his Karma from being contaminated by ours, could we give him a slight chance at life!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dao became a mist, the mist became a blade. That blade will complete the gap between Immortal and Devil!\u201d The man\u2019s eyes shone with a bright light, and he couldn\u2019t help but lift his head up and laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that a son of Fang is even more astonishing than his father!\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Fang Xiufeng</p><br/><p>[audio mp3=\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fang_xiufeng.mp3\"][/audio]</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Alessio Bastardi, Camilo Rey, and Valera McDaniel</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

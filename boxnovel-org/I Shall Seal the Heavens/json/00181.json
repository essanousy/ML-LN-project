He landed in front of Meng Hao, glaring up coldly at the man named Li.</p><br/><p>The Li man\u2019s expression became somewhat unsightly. He stared at Chen Fan, and his gaze especially seemed to take note of the black flying dagger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think you can protect him forever?\u201d he said with a cold snort. His face filled with disdain as he looked at Meng Hao. \u201cHe won\u2019t amount to anything if all he can do is hide behind others. It seems mid Foundation Establishment is the end of the line for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019m here, I won\u2019t let you touch a hair on my little Junior Brother\u2019s head!\u201d said Chen Fan, his voice cool, but hard enough to chop nails and slice iron.</p><br/><p>Li glared hatefully at Meng Hao, his disdain growing thicker. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for your Elder Brother, I would kill you with the wave of a hand. Let\u2019s see how long you can keep hiding!\u201d He turned, flicking his sleeve and disappearing into the distance.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sighed as he watched the man leave. He had read the man\u2019s expression, of course, but could do nothing about it. Exterminating him would be simple, but twice now, Chen Fan had stood in front of him, making it impossible to proceed with battle.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan looked back at Meng Hao, who gave a wry smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan, of course, misinterpreted Meng Hao\u2019s expression. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, little Junior Brother,\u201d he said comfortingly. \u201cThat Li fellow is nothing. With me here, he won\u2019t dare to bully you.\u201d His expression was one of concern, leaving Meng Hao without a word to say. \u201cUnfortunately, Master went into secluded meditation last month, and it seems he won\u2019t emerge for a few more months. I left him a message, though. He\u2019ll get it as soon as he comes out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you and I get back from the Song Clan, you can officially join the Solitary Sword Sect. Then that Li guy won\u2019t dare to mess with you. Although, in the meantime, you need to be a bit more careful. Well, I\u2019ll be here by your side anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan\u2019s concern made Meng Hao feel warm in his heart. \u201cMany thanks, Elder Brother,\u201d he said, clasping hands and bowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to thank? Don\u2019t be so polite! Come come. Let\u2019s light some candles and chat all night.\u201d He laughed heartily as he pulled Meng Hao into the house. Once inside, he slapped his bag of holding to produce two jars of alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Elder Brother doesn\u2019t have much to offer here. But when I went to Master\u2019s I grabbed these two jars of Sword Wine. This stuff is pretty good. I\u2019ve really come to like it over the past few years.\u201d He handed one of the jars to Meng Hao, then opened his own and took a swig.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao accepted the jar and took a drink. His face immediately grew a bit red, and his entire body suddenly felt hot and dry. Sweat broke out all over. He took a deep breath, and then slowly let it out.</p><br/><p>He felt as if his entire body had just been washed out. Sweating, he continued to breathe in and out. His eyes seemed to glisten a bit more brightly. He looked at Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat alcohol is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster brews it himself. Heh heh. Come on, drink up. This alcohol is really good for Cultivators, especially for the Foundation Establishment stage. It\u2019s comparable to medicinal pills!\u201d He smiled and took another drink. \u201cI drink this stuff all the time. Oh, by the way, little Junior Brother, I see your Cultivation base is at the mid Foundation Establishment level. Don\u2019t forget, we Cultivators are building mountains; you must establish a firm foundation.\u201d His words were earnest, causing Meng Hao to put down his jar of alcohol and listen thoughtfully. Occasionally he nodded in agreement. \u201cDon\u2019t greedily speed through the various stages and ignore your fundamentals.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake me, for example. I could have created my fourth Dao Pillar and entered mid Foundation Establishment last year. But Master wouldn\u2019t permit it. He always says that creating Dao Pillars is like turning trees into boats. It can\u2019t be undone. The best thing to do is go with the flow, and exercise caution. Creating a fourth Dao Pillar isn\u2019t as important as refining the third pillar. Once it is full and complete, then the fourth Dao Pillar can be created properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother thing,\u201d said Chen Fan, sounding extremely serious. \u201cDuring the course of our Cultivating, we are bound to encounter friction with other Cultivators. But you cannot solve all problems by killing! You need to understand that regardless of whether you\u2019re talking about magical techniques or magical items, they are all just ways to protect the Dao! They are protection, not the Dao itself!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the Dao? My Cultivation base isn\u2019t high enough, so I probably shouldn\u2019t even bring it up. But Master told me that even though he doesn\u2019t quite understand it himself, there\u2019s something that should never be forgotten; killing and magical techniques are all just for protection!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your Dao be overwhelmed by killing. You need to listen to your heart, and follow your principles.\u201d Chen Fan looked Meng Hao over. \u201cYou know, you seem to have a fairly strong killing aura.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as the words came out of his mouth, a voice could be heard from within Meng Hao\u2019s bag of the Cosmos.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! That\u2019s right! I said this child\u2019s killing aura was too strong. You\u2019re right. You make a lot of sense. Your words are extremely accurate!\u201d The suddenness of the voice\u2019s appearance left Chen Fan dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face darkened. Before he could say anything, a flash of colorful light emerged from the bag of the Cosmos which turned into a parrot. It flapped its wings as it flew around the room.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly parrot had previously been in the blood-colored mask, preaching to the Li Clan Patriarch. Now, it flew a few circles around the room and then landed on Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that\u2026?\u201d said Chen Fan, still in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cI picked this thing up and found that it can\u2019t be thrown away\u2026\u201d replied Meng Hao. Before he could finish, the meat jelly parrot interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, you couldn\u2019t be more correct,\u201d it said, eying Chen Fan energetically. \u201cMeng Hao\u2019s killing aura is too strong. It\u2019s wrong! Immoral! Come come, let\u2019s discuss a few things. I think I\u2019m going to like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath and looked at Chen Fan sympathetically. He could only imagine the torture Chen Fan would be dealing with momentarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re my littler Junior Brother\u2019s Spirit creature,\u201d said Chen Fan, looking curiously at the parrot on Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder. \u201cPleased to meet you, sir. I\u2019m happy to discuss anything with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the gleam in Chen Fan\u2019s eye, Meng Hao sighed to himself. There was really nothing he could do to save him\u2026. But Meng Hao couldn\u2019t bear to just do nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, this bird\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother, you misspoke,\u201d said Chen Fan in a serious tone. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bird, it\u2019s a parrot. And it can speak! You can see from the look in its eye that it\u2019s intelligent. It\u2019s a Spirit! You really need to take good care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meat jelly seemed to be on the verge of tears after hearing Chen Fan\u2019s words. It seemed to have finally met a kindred spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so correct. You make so much sense. Why couldn\u2019t I have met you first? Aiiii. There\u2019s no need to bring that up. Now, why don\u2019t we discuss the meaning of life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe meaning of life? Okay!\u201d said Chen Fan excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to have a discussion about the meaning of life. But for some reason, my Master is always in secluded meditation. In fact, so are my Junior and Elder brothers. I originally planned to chat with my little Junior Brother tonight, but if you want to join, the please, by all means do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA discussion about the meaning of life needs to be built up to, though. For example\u2026 why don\u2019t we talk about this morning\u2019s weather? Only a truly educated person can discuss the weather\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? The weather? Well\u2026 okay. I think the weather was excellent this morning. But you know, I think it might be more beneficial to discuss the killing aura coming off of my little Junior Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? I completely agree with you there. You are so correct. You make so much sense. I always say that if the weather is bad, it can have a negative influence on your mood. I mean, I mean, don\u2019t you agree about that\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of such a thing,\u201d said Chen Fan. \u201cBut it actually makes a lot of sense. I remember one day a few years ago, it was really overcast outside, and my Cultivation didn\u2019t go very well. I was fidgety all day. Yeah, I think what you said just now makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of sense? You think I make a lot of sense?! Heavens! Dear heavens! In this life, and the life before that, and the life before that, I\u2019ve never met anyone who said such a thing. You think I make sense\u2026.\u201d The meat jelly parrot was shaking in excitement. It flew off of Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder to stand in front of Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>Their talking turned into a buzzing that filled Meng Hao\u2019s ears as he watched on in a daze. The eyes of both Chen Fan and the parrot began to shine brightly. They had both met their kindred spirits, and as they talked, it gradually became apparent that a contest of sorts had begun.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao suddenly shivered and edged backward.</p><br/><p>He moved as far away as possible, to a distant corner of the building, where he sat cross-legged to meditate. He feared that if he continued to listen, he would become far too annoyed. The clamor of the bird by itself was bad enough, but now\u2026.</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao looked at Chen Fan and the meat jelly parrot, a single thought ran through his mind; \u201cMeeting one\u2019s match, the General meets the Genius\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Time passed by, and Meng Hao did his best to ignore the sound of their conversation. Two hours passed, and he finally opened his eyes. He had assumed their discussion would be nearing an end, but when he peeked over, he discovered that they were engaged in a lively conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight? Tell me, am I right, or not\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely correct. Actually, that makes me think about one day last year when I\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! That\u2019s what I said earlier! Oh right, weren\u2019t we going to talk about the meaning of life? How about this: after we finish talking about this morning\u2019s weather, then we can talk about the noon sunshine\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat idea. Let\u2019s save the meaning of life for the end of the conversation. The best would be to wait until dusk. The best time to talk about life is under the setting sun\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound droned on in Meng Hao\u2019s ears. He stared blankly at Chen Fan\u2019s excited face and the equally enthusiastic meat jelly parrot. One man, one bird, their eyes shining with anticipation\u2026. It caused Meng Hao to shiver and close his eyes again to meditate, fearful of getting dragged into the discussion.</p><br/><p>Time, slowly passed\u2026.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Tjandra Johannes, Joshua Jacobs, Aldwin Laylo, Khilmu Arif and Josef Apor</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

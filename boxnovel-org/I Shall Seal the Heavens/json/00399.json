Although they were constructed from wood, the wood came from Spirit Trees in the surrounding forests that had grown for hundreds of years. Eventually, they built up a certain amount of spiritual energy, and when they were used to build houses, could provide quite a few benefits when it came to practicing cultivation.</p><br/><p>The only people who could live here were descendants of the three great bloodlines of the Tribe.</p><br/><p>This, of course, was where Wu Chen resided. At the moment, he was lividly throwing a ceramic jar onto the ground, where it shattered into pieces. Wu Chen\u2019s infuriated voice roared out throughout the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Ali, you\u2019ve gone too far!!\u201d Wu Chen\u2019s hair was in disarray, and his eyes radiated venomous madness. His body was shaking and he oozed killing intent. He slammed his fist into the wooden wall next to him, causing the entire house to shake. Ripples of spiritual energy appeared, resisting the power of his Cultivation base and even rebounding back into him. Wu Chen\u2019s hand was now injured and dripped blood.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the blood, he clenched his fists and continued to vent: \u201cThat totem medallion was awarded to my father years ago because of his service to the Tribe. Why the hell are they giving it to you now!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite his venting, his heart filled with helplessness. A bitter smile appeared on his face as he looked at the sky outside. As far as he was concerned the entire world was filled with darkness.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that the front door opened. Sunlight spilled in, piercing into his eyes. A woman entered, someone very familiar to Wu Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis\u2026.\u201d he said, his voice filled with pain.</p><br/><p>The woman was tall and had long black hair. The clothing she wore was utilitarian, but it was impossible to conceal her natural beauty. However, the constant furrow in her brow made it seem like she was in a state of perpetual thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already arranged everything for you,\u201d she said, her voice gentle. \u201cYou and Wu Ali will have a fair neo-demon duel. Whoever wins will receive the totem medallion.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked down at the fragments of pottery on the ground and then back up at Wu Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAT?!?!\u201d cried Wu Chen, his eyes bloodshot. \u201cThat medallion was given to father for his meritorious service!\u201d His expression filled with savagery. His dissatisfaction with the Crow Scout Tribe couldn\u2019t be greater. For the past few years, he had done everything his sister asked him to do. He had endured it all. But now, even his father\u2019s totem medallion was being taken away. He truly valued the totem medallion, which made it much easier to congeal totems. It was actually a precious treasure that even had the ability to pass on some legacy power from the Tribal Ancestor.</p><br/><p>Seeing Wu Chen in virtual hysterics, his sister soothingly said, \u201cThe whole matter was set by the Tribe Greatfather, so you have to comply. Listen, I\u2019m going to go find Grandmaster Shui Mu, the rank 3 Dragoneer. I\u2019ll buy a level 2 neo-demon for you, that way the duel will be fair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Ali\u2019s neo-demon is a level 2 Flying Bat. It was personally raised by a rank 5 Dragoneer. An ordinary level 2 neo-demon couldn\u2019t possibly beat it! Neo-demon duel\u2026. Some \u2018fair\u2019 duel this is going to be!\u201d Wu Chen felt like he just couldn\u2019t accept it. It was at this point that an idea flashed like lightning in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNeo-demon duel\u2026. Neo-demon\u2026. Greenwood Wolves!\u201d His eyes suddenly filled with an intense glow, as if suddenly he had risen from the depths of despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I beg that senior, maybe he\u2019ll help me,\u201d he thought. \u201cTrifling Wu Ali will be defeated for sure! Then I can get the totem medallion that is rightfully mine, and begin my rise to prominence.\u201d Wu Chen began to pant, and the glow in his eyes grew brighter. Filled with intense hope, he stood up and left, intent on seeking out that mysterious figure whom he found completely unfathomable. Of course, it was none other than the person he viewed as a master of the senior generation, Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Wu Chen\u2019s sister frowned as she watched him walk off. She did nothing to stop him, but instead followed along behind him.</p><br/><p>Wu Chen didn\u2019t hesitate at all. Ignoring the fact that his sister was following him, he sped down the mountain toward the Neo-Demon Kennelist district. As he looked at the rows of courtyards, and smelled the strange odor in the air, his mind filled with worries regarding the potential losses and gains.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for him to reach Meng Hao\u2019s courtyard. He stood outside, his beautiful sister behind him, frowning. His sister didn\u2019t understand why Wu Chen had suddenly rushed here as soon as she mentioned neo-demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Chen\u2026.\u201d she said softly.</p><br/><p>He completely ignored her as he looked at the closed door leading into the courtyard. Gritting his teeth, he stepped forward and, putting his most respectful expression on, clasped hands and bowed, making no move to open the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Chen is here to pay respects, senior,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>His voice was loud, and echoed about. His sister\u2019s eyes narrowed immediately. She knew her younger brother well, and was used to how aggressive he usually acted because of the grievances he felt. There were few people he would actually treat courteously.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t seen him act as respectfully as this in a long time. Actually\u2026 she could clearly see that the respect he was showing was not an act, but existed deep in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place\u2026.\u201d She looked closely at the courtyard and the shut door.</p><br/><p>A long moment passed. Wu Chen gritted his teeth and continued loudly, \u201cWu Chen of the junior generation pays respects to the senior generation. Senior, I would like to request an audience.\u201d His voice echoed out, immediately attracting the attention of other nearby Neo-Demon Kennelists. Quite a few opened the doors of their courtyards to look over.</p><br/><p>When they saw Wu Chen and his beautiful sister, it only took a moment\u2019s thought to recognize who they were.</p><br/><p>Wu Chen\u2019s sister was starting to feel a little irritated. From her perspective, Wu Chen was a descendant of the three great bloodlines. Vassals weren\u2019t even members of the Tribe, so there was no need to show them such veneration. And yet, Wu Chen had bowed twice in greeting to the owner of this courtyard. She frowned and let out a cold harumph. She was just about to push the door open to see how skilled this Cultivator was, who her brother showed such politeness to.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as she stepped forward, her brother moved to block her, an imploring look on his face.</p><br/><p>When she saw his expression, her heart softened. With an inward sigh, she stepped back. Deep in her heart, her irritation at whoever was in the courtyard continued to grow.</p><br/><p>More Cultivators were looking at them now, and some of them were discussing the proceedings in low tones.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are descendants of the three great bloodlines. I\u2019ve heard of the two of them. Why would they possibly come here to pay respects to a mere Neo-Demon Kennelist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they were going to pay respects to anyone, it should be Grandmaster Shui Mu. The Cultivator in that courtyard is surnamed Meng, and there\u2019s nothing special at all about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe Grandmaster Shui Mu isn\u2019t as polite as he seems, and refused to part with a neo-demon. Then, they had no choice but to lower their standards. Even still, why would they pick a Neo-Demon Kennelist with absolutely no reputation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Chen and his sister could hear what people were saying. As for Wu Chen, it didn\u2019t change his mind at all. His sister, however, was looking grimmer and grimmer.</p><br/><p>She had already endured about as much as she could when the courtyard door slowly opened without a sound. From within, a pleasant voice could be heard: \u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Chen immediately got excited. He took a deep breath and then organized his garments. Bowing once more, he cautiously entered the courtyard. His sister followed, her face dark.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was sitting there cross-legged, surrounded by his five, napping Greenwood Wolves.</p><br/><p>When she saw the wolves, Wu Chen\u2019s sister\u2019s eyes went wide. With the exception of one, the entire group seemed to be high quality level 2 neo-demons. Now, she understood why her brother was being so polite.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there are a lot of Cultivators in the Western Desert who are skilled in raising neo-demons,\u201d she thought. \u201cWu Chen isn\u2019t very experienced, so he mistakenly assumes that this guy is special. I wonder what this guy did to fool Wu Chen so well.\u201d Her eyes glittered coldly, and in her heart she snorted coldly.</p><br/><p>As soon as he entered the courtyard, Wu Chen dropped to his knees. \u201cSenior, I beg of you to save me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>This caused his sister to frown even more deeply.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao opened his eyes. He looked over Wu Chen and his sister, taking note of her antagonistic bearing. Ignoring her, he focused on Wu Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really aren\u2019t capable of controlling these Greenwood Wolves,\u201d he said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I\u2019m not here to request control of the Greenwood Wolves,\u201d he said, his voice filled with cordiality and entreaty. \u201cI need your help. Wu Ali is being an intolerable bully. I have to engage in a neo-demon duel with him. Senior, I have no neo-demons that are capable of standing up to him. Senior, please save me! I beg of you to stand at my side as a Dragoneer. I\u2019ll do anything you want, even pledge my life to you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Chen, get up!\u201d said his sister, her voice harsh.</p><br/><p>Wu Chen ignored her and continued to stare fixedly at Meng Hao, his eyes pleading.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at him silently for a moment, his eyes glittering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want the totem branding technique of the Crow Scout Tribe,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, Wu Chen\u2019s sister immediately replied, \u201cImpossible! You\u2019re just a vassal! Such a request is preposterous!\u201d Two totem tattoos glittered on her, indicating that her Cultivation base was at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao ignored her, continuing to look at Wu Chen as he waited for him to respond.</p><br/><p>Wu Chen hesitated for a moment. A totem branding technique was a Conclave magic of a Tribe. It would normally be very difficult for a vassal to acquire such a technique. According to custom, Wu Chen shouldn\u2019t reveal such a technique to an outsider. Unless he was willing, the technique could not be extracted from him even by Soulsearch. Every Conclave Tribe member was blessed with a totem, which was branded onto their very soul.</p><br/><p>However, when he considered all the injustice he had experienced in the past years, Wu Chen gritted his teeth. A look of madness filled his face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Wherever it passed, the fleeing cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were filled with intense coldness, causing their souls to tremble.</p><br/><p>Now that he didn\u2019t have to worry about the Meng Clan, Meng Hao turned to look at the cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, and his killing intent exploded out. He actually didn't have any personal vendetta with these people, and in fact, as the future Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm, it would probably be appropriate to let them off a bit lightly, and not kill them all.</p><br/><p>After all, there was a greater war coming, and the stronger the Mountain and Sea Realm was in general, the better. However, despite being aware of that, Meng Hao didn\u2019t choose that course of action.</p><br/><p>He was not a hero or a leader, he was just an ordinary cultivator, a former scholar who had always dreamed of being rich.</p><br/><p>Had they not provoked him, he could have let things drop. But they had attempted to exterminate the Meng Clan, which was something he couldn\u2019t tolerate. In fact, he didn\u2019t even want to tolerate it.</p><br/><p>He snorted coldly and took a step forward. When his foot fell, an incredible pressure began to weigh down, covering the entire area in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard, as if there were invisible collisions up in the starry sky. The thousands of cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea all coughed up huge mouthfuls of blood, and expressions of complete astonishment and terror covered their faces.</p><br/><p>None of them dared to fight back. They remained in place, trembling and looking with terror at Meng Hao, not even daring to make the slightest of movements, let alone flee.</p><br/><p>Marquis Lu\u2019s face fell, but then he gritted his teeth, causing violet light to radiate out from him. It quickly enveloped him, whereupon he burst into movement, apparently intending to break out from the pressure crushing down from Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say you could leave?!\u201d Meng Hao said coolly. He took another step forward, vanishing, then reappearing directly in front of Marquis Lu. He waved his hand.</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>An incredible force exploded out from Meng Hao, which transformed into a tempest. When it slammed into Marquis Lu, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he tumbled backward like a kite with its string cut. A fierce expression could be seen on his face as he managed to stop in place, then glared at Meng Hao, flames of madness dancing in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm one of the three Marquis of the Seventh Mountain, Lu Yunli!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cIf you dare to harm me, the Seventh Mountain will hunt you down and kill you, no matter where you run to!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao's only response was to take a third step forward, and then unleash the Life-Extermination Fist, shooting forward and slamming his fist into Marquis Lu\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>A boom echoed out as Marquis Lu\u2019s chest caved in, causing blood to spray out as he fell back. Cracking sounds could even be heard as a layer of magical cloth armor, which had previously been invisible, shattered.</p><br/><p>That was one of his life-saving magical items, something which had enabled him to sweep unrivalled across the battlefield when fighting the Heavengod Alliance. He had even relied on it to kill some of the Dao Realm experts of the Eighth Mountain and Sea. And yet, Meng Hao shattered it with a single blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, attack immediately! Kill him!\u201d Marquis Lu cried urgently, face ashen. The other cultivators of the Seventh Mountain and Sea around him hesitated, but about a thousand of them gritted their teeth and charged forward. They quickly formed into groups of nine, arranging themselves in special formation. Those spell formations then grouped into nines to create a grand spell formation!</p><br/><p>Rumbling could be heard as dozens of spell formations appeared in the starry sky, which then shot toward Meng Hao. Brilliant lights flashed, and the ripples of divine abilities spread out. However, Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever as he made a grasping motion, which tore a rift open. The Blood Demon roared out, instantly charging toward the spell formations. Surrounded by the sounds of explosions, Meng Hao pierced through the spell formations and began to chase down Marquis Lu.</p><br/><p>Madness could be seen in Marquis Lu\u2019s eyes. The fact that Meng Hao could simply disregard the spell formations caused that madness to grow more intense. Throwing caution to the wind, he threw his head back and roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made me do this!\u201d he roared, extending his hand and causing the totem tattoo there to radiate violet light. It grew more and more intense, and in the blink of an eye, violet qi suddenly began to swirl around. Astonishingly, it transformed into... an enormous head.</p><br/><p>It had eight horns on its head, its skin was greenish-black, and its face resembled that of a human. As soon as it appeared, a shocking energy burst out, causing the starry sky to tremble. Furthermore... the face emanated an aura that was not of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><br/><p>It was... an Outsider!</p><br/><p>An Outsider from the 33 Heavens!</p><br/><p>As soon as Meng Hao saw it, he could tell where it came from. At the same time, he could sense the Mountain and Sea Realm stirring with hatred, with the desire to destroy Outsiders, to destroy anything with that blood running through their veins.</p><br/><p>The Outsider threw its head back and roared, causing the starry sky to shatter, and a massive tempest to spring up and spin toward Meng Hao. Simultaneously, the head shot away from Marquis Lu\u2019s hand and headed toward Meng Hao as if to consume him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!\u201d screamed Marquis Lu, his face twisted with madness. This was his trump card, something that sucked away at his longevity every time he used it, forcing him to be very cautious about how he utilized it. It was also the entire reason he had charged into the Meng Clan\u2019s territory with complete disregard for Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>In his mind, the totem tattoo essentially made him invincible to 4-Essences enemies, and enabled him to fight it out with 5-Essences cultivators. In fact, during the fighting against the Heavengod Alliance, he had even fought to a draw with the Heavengod Alliance\u2019s Chief Dharma Protector.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he was incredibly confident, and his killing intent was currently surging. Now that he had sent the enormous head against Meng Hao, he was sure that Meng Hao was as good as dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis totem tattoo is a precious treasure that my Mountain and Sea Lord bestowed upon me. It draws upon the soul of a Heavenly Devil from the Outside world and gives me the power to fight against five Essences! It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, you\u2019re DEAD!!</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019re dead, the rest of the Eighth Mountain and Sea will accompany you to the Yellow Springs, and the Meng Clan that escaped to the Ninth Mountain and Sea will still be exterminated. Even the Ninth Mountain and Sea will be destroyed!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the coming war, nobody will be safe. You\u2019re dead no matter what!!\u201d Marquis Lu threw his head back and roared madly, drawing upon his longevity to power the totem. Stabbing pain filled his mind, making him go even crazier, to the point where he began to lose his grip on consciousness.</p><br/><p>And yet he still maintained control. Performing an incantation gesture, he made the gigantic Outsider\u2019s mouth open wide. Its eyes shone with a red light as it made to devour Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered, and he snorted coldly. As the Outsider\u2019s head closed in on him, he extended his hand and pointed at it.</p><br/><p>It was none other than the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had known that his Demon Sealing Hexing magic was especially effective on Outsiders. As soon as he finished waving his finger, he waved it again to unleash the Seventh Demon Sealing Hex. Then came the Sixth Hex and the Fifth Hex.</p><br/><p>Four waves of a finger caused the Outsider to scream miserably. Black mist began to roil out from inside of it, as it twisted and distorted, howling, \u201cNine... Seals... Hexing... Magic.... DAMMIT!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It began to corrode, sending black mist out in all directions. Marquis Lu was shaking, and began to wither as his longevity was rapidly sucked away. However, instead of fleeing, he charged Meng Hao, face twisted with madness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, aren't you interesting,\u201d Meng Hao said, eyes flickering. He then reached out and made a grasping motion, but instead of utilizing the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm he unleashed the Star Plucking Magic.</p><br/><p>His Ancient Mana flowed, and his 33 Soul Lamps burned brightly. Combining the power of his fleshly body with that of his cultivation base caused Meng Hao to explode with battle prowess equivalent to five Essences, and that was without the power of the Mountains and Seas!</p><br/><p>It was... a terrifying power that was second only to that of a Mountain and Sea Lord. Rumbling could be heard as the Outsider screamed, its face twisting as it sped uncontrollably toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>If Meng Hao managed to grab it, then he would have the soul\u2019s life or death within his control. However the face suddenly screamed and began to turn blurry; apparently, it had chosen to self-detonate.</p><br/><p>As the face exploded, it used that power to break free, blocking the hand of the Star Plucking Magic and simultaneously transforming into a stream of black mist that began to shoot back toward Marquis Lu.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao swished his sleeve, causing a tempest to spring up. The power of the self-detonation instantly faded away, and Meng Hao took a step forward toward the black mist.</p><br/><p>The black mist moved so fast that Marquis Lu didn\u2019t have any time to react. It streamed into his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, causing him to tremble and then let out a bloodcurdling scream, as if he were being possessed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered coldly as he closed in. He was just about to perform an incantation gesture when Marquis Lu, face covered in black mist, let out an insane howl.</p><br/><p>His energy then spiked, and his skin began to turn green and sprout scales. His head split open as eight horns grew out. Furthermore, his lips split in half so that his mouth was in the shape of a cross. In the blink of an eye, he grew to a height of thirty meters.</p><br/><p>Vicious-looking spikes even pierced out through his clothing. Shockingly, what was standing in front of Meng Hao now was no longer a cultivator, but a humanoid beast!</p><br/><p>It was... an Outsider!</p><br/><p>The faces of the other cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea fell, and they began to back up. Clearly, even they had not known the true origin of Marquis Lu\u2019s totem tattoo.</p><br/><p>There were only a few dozen whose faces flickered with what seemed to be panic, but which Meng Hao saw through to the zeal and devotion toward this version of Marquis Lu that was hidden beneath.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead! DEAD, I tell you!!\u201d The beast-form of Marquis Lu threw his head back and howled, causing his energy to rise higher and higher. Then, his eyes turned red, and he seemingly lost all control of himself, descending fully into madness as he charged Meng Hao.</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1287: Outsider!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

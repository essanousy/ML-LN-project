He looked back down at Yuwen Jian and smiled enigmatically.</p><br/><p>How could he not have realized that Yuwen Jian could have reached enlightenment much earlier, and had intentionally dragged things out? Clearly, he had been planning something. Although Meng Hao\u2019s use of the ax had seemed completely spontaneous, it was actually designed as a warning for Yuwen Jian.</p><br/><p>Seeing Meng Hao\u2019s smile, Yuwen Jian felt even guiltier. Clearing his throat, he smacked his chest heroically and said, \u201cBrother Meng Hao, you are truly courageous and extraordinary. Hahaha. Dao-Heaven's three hired thugs were all incredibly powerful. But in front of you, they were like hired clowns. You crushed them like weeds! You\u2019re definitely destined to be number one in the Mountain and Sea Realm Echelon!\u201d Although Yuwen Jian\u2019s words were blatantly ingratiating, his expression was very sincere, as if every word were spoken from the depths of his heart. [1. There is some word play in this passage that doesn't quite translate well. Literally he says, \"those three dog-legs (hired thugs/henchmen) of Dao-Heaven were all powerful, but to you they were like dirt-dogs (stray dogs/mole crickets)\"]</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said, well said,\u201d replied Meng Hao, chuckling. Then he stared evenly at Yuwen Jian. \u201cHowever, Fellow Daoist Yuwen Jian, you still need to return the World Seal I loaned to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian\u2019s smile stiffened, and his mind spun with hundreds of ideas. However, when he saw the look in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes, his heart began to pound, and he once again thought about the implications of Meng Hao being rewarded for killing an Echelon cultivator.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d he thought. \u201cThe rewards of the Windswept Realm this time are encouraging us to slaughter each other.... I can\u2019t provoke this jinx, otherwise I\u2019ll find myself in a deadly crisis!\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thought, Yuwen Jian unhesitatingly produced the World Seal and sent it back to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao grabbed it and put it away. Smiling just as broadly as ever, he didn't say a single word about the Seventh Nation\u2019s World Seal. Yuwen Jian had intentionally sat out of the fight, and had been plotting the whole time. Had he instead joined in to fight Hai Qingdong and the others, then Meng Hao would naturally have refrained from greedily keeping the World Seal.</p><br/><p>However, since Yuwen Jian had clearly been up to something, then Meng Hao didn\u2019t feel guilty at all about turning the tables on him.</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian smiled wryly. Although he was a body cultivator, the fact that he was not only a member of the Echelon, but had also managed to keep his place in it for so long, and at the same time managed to reach such a high level of body cultivation, showed that he was no fool. He might not be considered a genius, he was quite adept at scheming.</p><br/><p>It was obvious to even him that Meng Hao had seen through his plan, and had used the ax as a warning. Not returning the Seventh Nation\u2019s World Seal was an additional punishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he thought. \u201cSince the Windswept Realm seems to be encouraging us Echelon cultivators to wipe each other out, then those World Seals are like signal flares. The more you have, the more likely you\u2019ll be to get killed and have them stolen away. Since I have no World Seal, as long as I\u2019m careful, I\u2019ll actually be much safer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian was now feeling a lot more confident, so he clasped hands and bowed to Meng Hao. Backing up a few steps at the same time, he smiled and said, \u201cBrother Meng Hao, it\u2019s getting late. My place is kind of a mess right now, so I won\u2019t keep you any longer. Take care of yourself on your way back, brother, and when you get a chance come visit again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at him, and Yuwen Jian instantly braced himself for something bad to happen. After a moment, though, Meng Hao merely smiled, swished his sleeve, and turned to depart.</p><br/><p>It was in this moment, however, that a beam of light suddenly rose up from the central temple. It was rapidly expanding, spreading out to fill the entire Windswept Realm.</p><br/><p>Shockingly, this light was just like the light from moments before... it was 30,000 meters wide!!</p><br/><p>The massive pillar of light shot up into the Heavens, causing non-stop rumbling sounds to echo out. The sky shook, and countless ripples expanded out, filling the entire sky. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes went wide, and Yuwen Jian\u2019s face fell.</p><br/><p>As the beam of light burst up into the world of mountains and statues, the tallest of the mountains, the one which was now a statue of Meng Hao, suddenly blurred as a ghost image appeared next to it. The image then solidified into a second statue!</p><br/><p>That second statue depicted a young man with swirling killing intent. He emanated incredible pressure that caused Meng Hao to pant. Shockingly, that statue was holding a head in its hand!</p><br/><p>That head radiated icy coldness, despite being dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cDao-Heaven!!\u201d Yuwen Jian exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s the Echelon cultivator from the First Mountain!! The head in his hand... is the head of the Echelon cultivator from the Second Mountain!!\u201d His face drained of blood. He well knew that Dao-Heaven had long since taken the Second Nation\u2019s World Seal from that cultivator, who had then managed to flee.</p><br/><p>He had previously reached the conclusion that lacking a World Seal would place him in much less danger. He had never imagined that after only a few breaths of time passed, his entire line of reasoning would be overturned. The Echelon cultivator from the Second Mountain was now dead, heralding the beginning of what would no doubt be a series of bloody and chaotic battles!</p><br/><p>It didn't matter whether or not he had a World Seal, he was still in incredible danger!</p><br/><p>Next, that cold and ruthless voice echoed out through the Windswept Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reward... is an Ancient treasure! Lofty Mountain Immortal Flail!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the Echelon cultivators were instantly shaken. Events were unfolding too quickly. First Hai Qingdong was killed, and then moments later, Dao-Heaven hunted down and killed someone else!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the reward was another Ancient treasure!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stared at the world up above, and Dao-Heaven\u2019s statue. His eyes then began to gleam with an intimidating light. Even though he wasn\u2019t sure how strong this Dao-Heaven was compared to Hai Qingdong, from what he could sense, he was incredibly powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cDao-Heaven....\u201d he thought, eyes glittering.</p><br/><p>Just when he was about to leave, Yuwen Jian suddenly flew up into the air and cried out, \u201cBrother Meng Hao! Hahaha! Look, it\u2019s getting pretty late, there\u2019s no need to hurry off. Why don't you stick around for a few days!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian was scared, so how could he possibly allow Meng Hao to leave so easily? If Meng Hao stayed behind, then there would be two of them to fight against Dao-Heaven if he came looking for them.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao ignored him and was just about to speed off into the distance when Yuwen Jian, thoughts racing, clenched his teeth and then blurted, \u201cMeng Hao, I know of a way for you to get the Sixth Nation\u2019s World Seal without even lifting your pinky finger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stopped and looked back at Yuwen Jian.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Meng Hao had stopped, Yuwen Jian quickly explained, \u201cListen, Meng Hao. Of the nine World Seals, Dao-Heaven now has three, and you have four. The remaining two are those belonging to the Third Nation and the Sixth Nation respectively. The Echelon cultivator in the Sixth Nation is that kid Hong Bin. We went through some dangerous situations together and became friends. How about I take you to the Sixth Nation and persuade him to give you the World Seal! [2. Hong Bin\u2019s name in Chinese is  h\u00f3ng b\u012bn. Hong is a surname which also means \"great\u201d or \"big.\u201d Bin means \u201crefined\u201d]\u201dhe declared, slapping his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat way, you\u2019ll have five World Seals, and will definitely have the upper hand!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you're not scared of Dao-Heaven, then the Sixth Nation\u2019s World Seal is yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stared at him coldly. He didn\u2019t trust Yuwen Jian very much; although they hadn\u2019t known each other for long, he got the feeling that Yuwen Jian was about as unreliable as Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you,\u201d Meng Hao said slowly.</p><br/><p>Looking insulted and a bit angry, Yuwen Jian said, \u201cBrother Meng Hao, it really hurts me to hear you say that. You know what type of person I am? I\u2019m just like the \u2018jian \u2019 character in my name. I'm steadfast in conduct, steadfast in word, steadfast in action, steadfast in everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unmoved, Meng Hao coolly responded, \u201cYou told me that you killed Hai Qingdong once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian didn\u2019t seem the least bit embarrassed about that fact. Laughing heartily, he said, \u201cBrother Meng Hao, I've been wanting to reform some of my bad habits for a while now. I really managed to make myself look like a fool in front of you, brother. I'm definitely going to make some changes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour enlightenment earlier went way too slowly,\u201d Meng Hao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Brother Meng Hao, there\u2019s no need to go out of your way to give me face. I wasn\u2019t slow, I was just distracted. For that, I must apologize. From now on, I definitely won\u2019t daydream anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. He looked closely at Yuwen Jian for a moment, and realized that not only were his words unreliable, but he was also extremely shameless. In terms of doing about-faces, nobody else could possibly match up to him.</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian\u2019s expression was extremely sincere. Smacking his chest, he declared, \u201cBrother Meng Hao, this time, you just have to trust me. I really am friends with Hong Bin. I saved his life once!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Meng Hao looked at Yuwen Jian and calmly said, \u201cIf you don't get me that World Seal, then you\u2019ll see what happens when I really flip out.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was no threat. His calm words instantly caused Yuwen Jian to become nervous, and he nodded.</p><br/><p>No more words were exchanged. Yuwen Jian led the way, and the two of them became bright beams of light that shot through the Seventh Nation toward the Sixth Nation. They moved with incredible speed, so it wasn\u2019t long before they arrived.</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered the Sixth Nation, intense pressure weighed down on them, a warning of sorts. The boy Hong Bin, currently sat cross-legged on the Sixth Nation\u2019s National Aura Mountain, and as soon as he sensed them, his face flickered. The National Aura Mountain\u2019s shield sprang up, and Hong Bin was immediately surrounded by several followers, who formed a defensive spell formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d he said out loud. \u201cIs it Dao-Heaven? Or is it just someone passing through? Either way, keep the spell formation ready. If it's Dao-Heaven, we can teleport out of here!\u201d Hong Bin was extremely nervous. Currently, the two people he feared most were Dao-Heaven and Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Both of them had killed other Echelon cultivators, and had been rewarded with Ancient treasures. How could he not be afraid? He didn't want his own life to be the price paid to get either one of them another Ancient treasure.</p><br/><p>As he sat there vigilantly, two streaks of light pierced through the air outside of the National Aura Mountain. Yuwen Jian was in the lead position, and as soon as he got close enough, he urgently shouted, \u201cHong Bin, old pal, it\u2019s Yuwen Jian, come to pay respects!\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, Hong Bin caught sight of Yuwen Jian. Instantly, his eyes blazed with anger, and he shot to his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, Yuwen Jian, you duplicitous bastard! You conned me back then and I never hunted you down about it, but now you have the gall to come looking for me!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, who\u2019s that behind you? That\u2019s... dammit! I can't believe you brought him here! I won\u2019t rest until you\u2019re dead, Yuwen Jian!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Hong Bin\u2019s shrill voice echoed out, Yuwen Jian glanced embarrassedly over at Meng Hao. What he saw was Meng Hao looking back at him with an icy smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Meng Hao,\u201d he gushed, \u201cjust give me the time it takes half an incense stick to burn. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely succeed!\u201d In a flash, he sped toward the National Aura Mountain!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s a good thing! I just wish\u2026 that you had started acting like this a bit sooner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go. The Demon Immortal Pagoda opens in three days. If you can get some of what you want, then it won\u2019t have been in vain that I got them to open it for you.\u201d He gave Meng Hao a deep look.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao bowed his head, then clasped his hands. Clutching the beastskin bag in his hand, he left, taking his melancholy and other complex emotions with him.</p><br/><p>As he watched Meng Hao leave, Ke Yunhai\u2019s face was no longer ruddy, but pale white. More wrinkles appeared, and the death aura surrounding him grew stronger. It seemed as if his flame of life could be snuffed out at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiusi, your father can\u2019t be with you forever. Soon\u2026 you\u2019ll have only yourself to rely on\u2026. I hope that you can learn to be a bit more sensible\u2026.\u201d Ke Yunhai only continued to grow older. Originally, his Cultivation base had nearly limitless longevity. However, Lord Li had returned the Heavenly life to the masses. In the end, all life would wither and die. As for Ke Yunhai, he had existed for a very, very long time. Currently, he was running out of energy to continue existing.</p><br/><p>Actually, he should have withered up and died many years ago. However, because of his concern for Ke Jiusi, he continued to endure. Eventually, though he found that, no matter how much he wanted to continue on, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do so for much longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Li, I will respect your decision. However\u2026 are you sure it is the correct one? If we powerful experts do not have limitless life, then what we are cultivating is not longevity. In that case, what is the end purpose of it all?\u201d Ke Yunhai sighed and closed his eyes. However, only a moment passed before they opened again. Exhaustion could be seen within, but also, a bright glow, like the last flickering of a bright fire before it went out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow is not the time for me to close my eyes. Before returning to the dust, I need to finish refining that true lifesaving treasure for Jiusi. I\u2019ve been working on it for years, and only have a bit more work left\u2026. Once it\u2019s complete, then even if he hasn\u2019t successfully refined the Soul Divergence Incantation, even nine Tribulations couldn\u2019t kill him. In fact, it might even help him to finish cultivating the Soul Divergence Incantation!\u201d</p><br/><p>After returning to his own Immortal\u2019s cave, Meng Hao saw that Xu Qing was still sitting there meditating, silently focusing on cultivating enlightenment. Meng Hao sat down and glanced around at the extravagant decorations on the walls of the Immortal\u2019s cave.</p><br/><p>After a long time passed, he looked down at the beastskin bag. It actually wasn\u2019t very heavy, but for some reason, in Meng Hao\u2019s hands, it felt very heavy indeed. What truly filled the bag wasn\u2019t actually magical items, but rather, a father\u2019s love for his son.</p><br/><p>It contained his very life, and the truest of his feelings.</p><br/><p>Finally, Meng Hao sighed. He closed his eyes and thought once again about his own father and mother, and the vague images of them that still existed within his memories.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Three days were gone in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The echoing of bell tolls could be heard throughout the entire Demon Immortal Sect. Countless disciples, awoken from their sleep, flew out of their residences. All of them were astonished, and wanted to know what was going on. What they found was that in mid-air above the Demon Immortal Sect, pulsating, multicolored lights had suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>Rays of light spread out in all directions, covering the sky. The light made the three inverted mountains which hung up above to be even clearer.</p><br/><p>As the light grew more intense, innumerable Cultivators appeared on the seven peaks of the Demon Immortal Sect. All of them were shaken inwardly. Some were old veterans of the Sect, whose expressions slowly began to change, as if they had suddenly recalled something. Their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>The bright glow lasted for a full quarter of an hour. Then, in the very center of the glow appeared an enormous fissure. It looked like a huge mouth with no beginning or end. The instant it appeared, a shocking rumbling sound echoed out as a glowing, bronze pagoda slowly emerged from within the fissure.</p><br/><p>Each level of the pagoda had four iron chains stretching out into the air. There were a total of 99 levels, and therefore, nearly four hundred iron chains. Anyone who laid eyes on such a shocking scene would definitely be left astonished.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the enormous pagoda had emerged. Rumbling echoed out in all directions and the ground quaked. The bronze pagoda slowly lowered down from the sky, growing larger and larger, until it seemed to blot out the sky above. Even though it was early morning, it almost seemed like the dead of night.</p><br/><p>Finally, the enormous pagoda descended toward a spot between the Fourth and Third Peaks, directly above\u2026 the deep pit, which according to legend, housed the great Demon Divinity that protected the entire Sect.</p><br/><p>It did not touch down onto the land, but rather, hovered up above. A huge shadow filled the sky above the Demon Immortal Sect. The pagoda appeared to be above the deep pit, but that was actually only the center location. In reality\u2026 if you looked at it from a distance, the pagoda seemed to cover the entire Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>Beneath the darkness of the pagoda was not just the deep pit, but all seven peaks and the lands around them!</p><br/><p>All of the Demon Immortal Sect disciples were panting and staring numbly.</p><br/><p>Shockingly, on the 1st level of the pagoda was a huge bronze door covered with carvings of countless auspicious beasts, which emanated an archaic and primordial will.</p><br/><p>The gigantic pagoda was shocking to the extreme. Compared to its huge size, the Cultivators below were nothing more than ants. Even the seven peaks looked like children in comparison.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that seven suns, each one a different color, flew out from the seven peaks. As they slowly flew up into the air, the disciples in the Demon Immortal Sect all dropped to their knees to kowtow.</p><br/><p>Within these seven suns sat seven cross-legged figures. They\u2026 were the seven Paragons of the seven peaks!</p><br/><p>Within the fourth sun was none other than Ke Yunhai.</p><br/><p>As the seven Paragons flew up into the sky, each one raised a hand and pointed toward the bronze pagoda. Instantly, a roaring sound could be heard as the huge bronze door on the 1st level suddenly\u2026 opened slightly!</p><br/><p>Although the door only opened a crack, this pagoda was enormous. What appeared to be only a tiny sliver was actually three hundred meters wide!</p><br/><p>The deep voice of the Seventh Peak Paragon suddenly rang out, \u201cThe Demon Immortal Pagoda has opened. In total, there are 99 levels. There is a chance on every level to acquire one of the 3,000 Daoist magics. Every ten levels, there is a chance to get one of the top 100. In the higher levels, there is even a chance to acquire Daoist magics from the top 10! The 70th, 80th, and 90th levels all provide that chance!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you pass the 99th level\u2026 you may select any of the top 10 Daoist magics, with the exception of the Mountain and Sea Scripture!</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery time the pagoda is opened, it requires a vast consumption of Sect resources. Today, all of you will have a chance. Whichever of you has good luck, will be able to acquire good fortune.\u201d The voice echoed throughout the entire Demon Immortal Sect. As it faded away, a deathly silence spread out among the million disciples of the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>It only took a moment, though, before an incredible commotion exploded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Immortal Pagoda\u2026. Is that the Demon Immortal Pagoda? Heavens! It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s huge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most important pagoda in the First Heaven of the Demon Immortal Sect. It\u2019s a precious treasure of the same level as the Mountain and Sea Scripture!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst the rise and fall of conversation, there was a female Cultivator who stood on the Fifth Peak, her fists clenched tightly. It was none other than Fang Yu, her eyes shining with determination and wild joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that there would be such good fortune this time!\u201d she thought. \u201cThe Demon Immortal Pagoda has actually appeared in this period of time!\u201d Her eyes glowed with stubborness.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a middle-aged man stood at the foot of the Seventh Peak. He was an Inner Sect disciple honor guard in charge of Outer Sect disciples. He stood, looking up at the enormous Demon Immortal Pagoda up in the sky, his hands clasped behind his back and a strange light gleaming in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought my good fortune would be restricted to the gains in the Seventh Peak, and that it would be difficult to acquire at that. But now that the Demon Immortal Pagoda has appeared, my chances have improved quite a bit!\u201d This middle-aged man was the same person Meng Hao had been looking for: Patriarch Huyan.</p><br/><p>Throughout the Demon Immortal Sect, Wang Lihai, Han Bei, and the other South Heaven Cultivators were all shaken. It didn\u2019t matter if they were from the Eastern Lands, the Northern Reaches, the Southern Domain, or the Black Lands. All of them were astonished.</p><br/><p>Amongst their number was an Inner Sect disciple from the Third Peak. He was a young man who up until this moment had spent his time bowing obsequiously to everyone around him. However, in the blink of an eye, he suddenly stood ramrod straight. Within his eyes flickered a bright glow, and an aura that almost seemed to contain the will of a monarch flickered out from his body.</p><br/><p>This young man was from the Northern Reaches, and was of the Imperial Bloodline Clan!</p><br/><p>He was not the only such blazing sun within the Demon Immortal Sect. There were others, all of whom suddenly rose up with lofty wills.</p><br/><p>One of them was on the Sixth Peak. It was a young woman who shockingly wore the robes of a Conclave disciple. Other than Meng Hao, she had a higher position than anyone else from the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>She blinked a few times as she looked over toward the Fourth Peak and the Demon Immortal Pagoda. Then she smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao really does have some pretty good luck. He found the corpse of one of the Elite Disciples, and in the few months before Ke Yunhai passed away in meditation at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the Demon Immortal Pagoda to appear in this Second Plane of limitless possibilities is nothing strange. It\u2019s just like the real world. After all, with the Night Demon in existence, Heaven and Earth can create something from nothing. Even the traitorous Lord Ji was rather frightened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, this woman was Zhixiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Immortal Pagoda has been opened!\u201d As the archaic voice of the Seventh Peak Paragon sounded out, thousands of figures instantly flew up into the air toward the pagoda.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao and Xu Qing walked out of the Immortal Cave and looked up at the towering pagoda. Xu Qing\u2019s eyes filled with a glow of determination. She looked down at the jade slip in her hand and chuckled silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be going,\u201d she said. \u201cThese three hundred Daoist magics are good enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded. He knew Xu Qing\u2019s disposition, so he did nothing to try to persuade her to change her mind. He took a deep breath and looked up toward Ke Yunhai\u2019s sun up in the sky. He could see the silhouette of the ancient man he had spoken with only three days before. After a moment of silent contemplation, his eyes flickered with decisiveness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether it\u2019s for me or for Ke Yunhai, I\u2019m going to go absolutely all out!\u201d His body flickered as he flew up into the air toward the Demon Immortal Pagoda that had been opened especially for him. Up above, the figures in the seven suns, the seven Paragons, all looked at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Within Ke Yunhai\u2019s eyes could be seen hope as he watched Meng Hao disappear into the pagoda.</p><br/><p>At the same time, more and more figures flew up and entered. In a very short period of time, more than 100,000 people had entered the 1st level of the Demon Immortal Pagoda.</p><br/><p>Down below were even more people who chose just to watch. Since they only had this one chance, they decided to first observe for a while to see if they could derive any benefits.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack in the Sect, there\u2019s a detailed description of the Demon Immortal Pagoda,\u201d thought Zhixiang. \u201cThe pagoda doesn\u2019t test the level of one\u2019s Cultivation base, nor the quality of one\u2019s latent talent. What it tests is a person\u2019s overall battle prowess.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe level of difficulty is the same for every person, regardless of the level of their Cultivation base. A Cultivator in the Qi Condensation stage and an Immortal would both have the same chance. Each participant will face different opponents, based on their own strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious how far that brat Meng Hao will get. What level will he reach?\u201d Zhixiang didn\u2019t immediately enter the pagoda. As far as she was concerned, while it was shocking enough to shake Heaven and Earth, at the same time, it wasn\u2019t something very important to her.</p><br/><p>Her main purpose here was not to seek out Daoist magic. No, she was here\u2026 for the number one battle body of the Demon Immortal Sect, that which could shake the Ninth Mountain and Sea\u2026 the Demon Immortal Body!</p><br/><p>Regardless of past times or present, the Demon Immortal Body was incredible and illustrious. In fact, Lord Li possessed such a body in the past. According to hearsay, if one wished to acquire the Mountain and Sea Scripture, one had to possess the Demon Immortal Body!</p><br/><p>Zhixiang made her decision. \u201cWhen the matter with the pagoda is over, I\u2019ll go find that brat!\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Noah Lee</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

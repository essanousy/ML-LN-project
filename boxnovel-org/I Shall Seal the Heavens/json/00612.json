As it passed by, everyone\u2019s hearts grew as cold as if they were stuck in the middle of winter. Even more shocking was that the frigid wind made the Cultivators almost like mortals. Everyone began to tremble as they clung to their vines.</p><br/><p>Their breath turned into ice, which then cracked and shattered, causing everyone to feel extremely astonished.</p><br/><p>Were it not for the vines, and the warmth which pulsed out from within them into the bodies of everyone present, then they wouldn\u2019t be able to proceed downward for very long, not even if they had higher Cultivation bases.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered as he clutched the vine. He had long since come to the conclusion that these vines were a critical element in being able to reach the Fourth Plane. Many others had come to the same conclusion.</p><br/><p>Although not everyone had chosen to attempt to enter the Fourth Plane, everyone who had come to the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane were outstanding figures from the lands of South Heaven. As for those who did chose to enter the Fourth Plane, they definitely wouldn\u2019t just give up halfway.</p><br/><p>As they produced more and more treasures to sacrifice to the vines, the vines twisted and writhed, extending downward at high speed.</p><br/><p>Time passed by slowly. Meng Hao was the last in line. As he descended he glanced around to inspect the area. As far as he could tell, the pit seemed bottomless. It was impossible to tell how far they had gone down, and yet they still couldn\u2019t see any end in sight. The frigid wind grew more intense, seemingly increasing the number of treasures required by the vines.</p><br/><p>Not too far off from Meng Hao was Li Tiandao. His face was gradually filling with apprehension. Although he had come prepared with a good supply of magical items, he was finding it difficult to keep up with how much needed to be sacrificed. By this point, it didn\u2019t seem to matter the quality of the magical items being sacrificed. Almost anything would do.</p><br/><p>Even still, the miscellaneous collection of magical items in Li Tiandao\u2019s bag of holding were not very plentiful. If things kept going with no bottom in sight, then he would soon have to begin sacrificing important magical items.</p><br/><p>To him, it was something impossible to accept. He frowned and gritted his teeth, a look of determination gleaming in his eyes. He suddenly stopped, apparently preparing himself to start climbing back up. It seemed he planned to give up on his attempt to enter the Fourth Plane.</p><br/><p>However, almost as soon as he began to climb up, before he had even gone more than a meter or so, his face flickered. The frigid wind around him suddenly grew ten times as powerful. His hair and his eyebrows became snow-white in the blink of an eye. Ice crystals even formed on his skin; clearly he was on the verge of being transformed into an ice statue.</p><br/><p>The intense sense of grave crisis he felt caused Li Tiandao to immediately pull out one of his important magical treasures. It was a glowing blue sword that somewhat resembled a saber. A single glance was enough to tell that this was anything but an ordinary treasure.</p><br/><p>Forcing down the pain he felt, Li Tiandao placed the sword onto the vine, whereupon it sank down inside. The coldness around Li Tiandao vanished and his body slowly returned to normal. However, his expression was one of astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only allowed to go down, not up?\u201d he grumbled inwardly. \u201cOr is it that going back up requires an even higher price?\u201d Everyone around was aware of the strange event which had just occurred, and were shocked. They all began to think various thoughts.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Li Tiandao saw that his own vine was no longer moving down but retracting back upward.</p><br/><p>This provoked a reaction from the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be right. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t go up. Once you enter this place, even if you want to quit, you still have to sacrifice treasures!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat must be the situation. It seems getting into the Fourth Plane isn\u2019t so easy after all\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had the best view of the situation. His eyes flickered thoughtfully, and he rubbed his bag of holding. Suddenly, a bashful smile appeared on his face. He said nothing, but simply allowed his vine to slowly continue on downward.</p><br/><p>Li Tiandao hesitated thoughtfully for a moment. Right now, he had two options to pick from. Go up, or go down. Either way, he would have to spend all of his magical items.</p><br/><p>After a moment of hesitation, Li Tiandao clenched his jaw.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I have to waste the magical items, I might as well risk it all,\u201d he thought. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, then everything I already spent will have been a complete waste. However, if I succeed, I can make up for everything with gains in the Fourth Plane!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of the other Cultivators were thinking the same thing as Li Tiandao. They clenched their jaws, eyes shining with determination. To them it was a gamble; however, if they gave up now, then they would definitely end up with nothing. By holding on for a bit longer, they would at least have a chance\u2026 to make up for what they had already spent.</p><br/><p>Since that was the case, there was no reason not to gamble!</p><br/><p>Time passed. A day later, the group was deep into the pit. However, they still couldn\u2019t see the bottom. It really seemed as if there was no end at all. By this point, quite a few of their number had already used up their supply of random magical items. If they wanted to continue, then they would either have to use up the magical items they had discovered in the Demon Immortal Sect, or draw on their own store of important personal magical items.</p><br/><p>The dilemma they faced caused the faces of quite a few of the Cultivators to look extremely unsightly. Before stepping foot into this place, all of them had believed themselves to be extremely well equipped with magical items. Now, though, they realized that they simply didn\u2019t have enough.</p><br/><p>Compared to them, Meng Hao really did have it very easy. He had vast amounts of magical items in his bag of holding. He casually produced treasures to sacrifice to the vines. Not only did they continue to move downward, Meng Hao actually caused his vine to change course occasionally to hand over magical items to Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>This caused the eyes of everyone else present to burn with anger and extreme jealousy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, I just have too many treasures,\u201d said Meng Hao with a sigh. The sound of his voice echoed around, causing everyone\u2019s gums to itch with hatred.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoists,\u201d he then announced, \u201cif any of you are running low on treasures, all you have to do is speak up. We\u2019re all in this together, through thick and thin. No matter what happens, I won\u2019t ignore your plight while I am in a good position.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you need to borrow some magical items, I\u2019ll lend them to you without hesitation!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my prices are reasonable, and I\u2019m honest with all customers. Buy one, pay back three!\u201d His voice echoed about loudly within in the pit. Everyone could hear, even the old man in the lead position. Their faces immediately twisted.</p><br/><p>Fang Yu looked back with glaring eyes, and yet a smile could be seen on her face.</p><br/><p>As for the Ji Clan members, their faces were unsightly. If they had such reactions, then there was no need to mention everyone else. When the crowds heard Meng Hao, their hearts filled with both hatred and helplessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou crafty, shameless villain!\u201d someone said. \u201cEven if our magical items run even lower than now, there\u2019s no way we\u2019ll ask for your help!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d said someone else. \u201cOutside, it was buy one pay back two, now it\u2019s buy one pay back three?! Raising prices like that is despicable to the extreme!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll die before asking for your help!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao heard the furious reactions, and simply sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re all wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cEach and every one of these magical items represents an important memory to me. I\u2019m offering to lend you, not my magical items, but rather, the true love of my life.\u201d He let out another emotional sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn all honesty,\u201d he continued, \u201cmy intentions truly are good. Look at these magical items of mine! Their glow is so resplendent and entrancing! These are high quality products!</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it, all of you. With some of my magical items, you can get into the Fourth Plane without a hitch! Once you\u2019re there, you can acquire things so valuable that you can pay back what you owe me in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely worth it!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers and Sisters, you have to look at things objectively. The price you will be paying now is nothing. The most important thing is to look at what you have to gain! Without paying a price, how can you gain anything, am I right?\u201d Meng Hao was using all his skills to try to persuade everyone. These, of course, were the same skills he had used in his shop back in the Reliance Sect. However, those who heard only continued to get more angry.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing was off to the side, covering her smile with a hand. The gaze with which she looked at Meng Hao continued to grow warmer and warmer.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoists, how can this tiny price possibly compare to the chance to step into the Fourth Plane?\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s final sentence was full of meaning. His words echoed about, filled with an air of good faith. Many of the various Cultivators were actually moved inwardly, and they suddenly felt conflicted.</p><br/><p>Li Tiandao gritted his teeth. He currently only had four magical items left, and to sacrifice any of them would cause him incredible pain. His expression filled with determination and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take three!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Meng Hao\u2019s expression shook visibly. He immediately pulled out a magical item and placed onto the surface of his own vine, causing it to change directions and head toward Li Tiandao.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Li, you are truly experienced and knowledgeable, talented and bold. Alright, listen. This is my first transaction of the day, so I\u2019ll give you a bit of a discount. I\u2019ll give you these three magical items, and you only need to pay me back with eight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese three magical items have a value of 30,000 Spirit Stones. In that case, you need to pay me back 80,000 Spirit Stones.\u201d With that, he produced three ordinary-looking random magical items, as well as a promissory note. Then he used the same method he had used in the Second Plane, the Dao oath.</p><br/><p>Li Tiandao gritted his teeth. After completing the formalities, he took the three treasures and then pressed one onto the surface of the vine. Instantly, it descended downward at rapid speed, alleviating his anxiety for the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that, everyone?\u201d said Meng Hao, setting his head nobly. \u201cMeng Hao is a gentleman. The gentleman loves money, and earns it righteously. I\u2019m not forcing anybody, and am even willing to sell things on credit! That\u2019s right! You don\u2019t need to pay me back now. A simple promissory note can solve all your problems.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can simply pay me back after we leave this place. What a great deal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone around couldn\u2019t help but think that Meng Hao truly had reached the pinnacle of shamelessness. More time passed, over half a day. There was still no bottom in sight. By this time, Li Tiandao owed Meng Hao more than 400,000. It was at that point that\u2026 Wang Lihai couldn\u2019t hold back from calling out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me ten!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take ten too!\u201d said Li Shiqi, gritting her beautiful teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cTen for me too!\u201d said Han Bei with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao immediately looked quite enlivened. He adroitly produced the magical items and promissory note, watched as the three swore their Dao oath, then smilingly handed over the magical items.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you purchase from me, you can rest your heart at ease. The quality of all products is guaranteed, and I deliver everything directly to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three collected up the magical items they had purchased and then completely ignored Meng Hao. They began to feed the items into the vines and descend down further.</p><br/><p>Another day passed. Soon more people began to run out of treasures. Either that, or they weren\u2019t willing to sacrifice the treasures they still possessed. No matter how much they hated Meng Hao, they had no choice but to call out to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy one, pay back five! Fellow Daoists, I\u2019m starting to run low on magical items, so I have no choice but to raise the price\u2026. Furthermore, I have to announce that when I am down to only ten magical items, then I will have no other choice than to begin an unprecedented, never before seen in history, never again to be repeated\u2026 auction!\u201d Although Meng Hao sighed, his eyes actually shone with a brilliant light.</p><br/><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, it gave rise to furious complaints. Despite the anger, people gritted their teeth and spent the price of one to five to acquire large amounts of magical items.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a profit!\u201d thought Meng Hao. \u201cHahaha! I never thought that the ancient Demon Immortal Sect would turn out to be my Blessed Land!\u201d He hung onto his vine, clutching a thick stack of promissory notes. When he looked at the numbers written on them, his eyes glowed brightly. His addiction to making money existed deep in his bones, and had not been reduced in the slightest, regardless of his advances in Cultivation base.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m rich!\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Chirag Patel, ExtremeGTP, Jerrell Tisnado, and Hikaritenjou</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

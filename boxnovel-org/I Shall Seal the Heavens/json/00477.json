Immediately, the Crow Soldier Greatfather began to tremble, and a look of excitement shone in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The other powerful experts next to him were the same. To them, Meng Hao\u2019s appearance finally gave them some bit of hope.</p><br/><p>If these men acted in such a way, there is no need to even describe how the despair in the hearts of the other Tribe members was suddenly swept away by excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cSacred Ancient!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exalted Sacred Ancient has returned!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExalted Sacred Ancient, we offer you respect upon your safe return!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of more than a thousand people called out, seemingly unburdening themselves of the great pressure that had been weighing down on them. It turned into a huge roar like that which you might hear coming from a crowd of ten thousand. They were joined by Big Hairy and all the other neo-demons, who after seeing Meng Hao lifted their heads up to the sky and howled with excitement. The sound of it all shook Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Yi Chenzi\u2019s face was instantly devoid of color. He stared blankly at Meng Hao, his mind buzzing. Then he screamed as he backed up. He didn\u2019t even notice the parrot approaching with a look of disdain.</p><br/><p>When the parrot slammed into his rear end, a blood-curdling shriek filled the air. He felt pain\u2026 intense pain that he had never experienced before in his life, unspeakable, unforgettable\u2026. In addition to the pain was a feeling of humiliation that caused Yi Chenzi to lift his head up and shriek.</p><br/><p>Even as his voice echoed out, the parrot excitedly shot back for another round. Scared out of his mind, Yi Chenzi immediately transformed into a green smoke as he prepared to flee at top speed.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to describe how much he regretted having come to this place. It was a deep, utter regret. How could he have ever imagined that a tiny Tribe like this, would actually\u2026 be full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons!?</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, dammit\u2026. this place has a wicked vine, tons of neo-demons, a perverted parrot, that shocking Outlander Beast, and most ridiculous of all, that Patriarch Bloodface!\u201d His heart was filled with sorrow to the point that he was about to cry. He had already decided that he would flee this place and never again in his life ever step even half a pace into the Western Desert North region.</p><br/><p>However, even as his body turned into the green smoke, just when he was about to flee, Meng Hao lifted his right hand. Instantly, a freezing wind blew out which contained the power of Frigid soil. In that instant, Yi Chenzi in his green smoke was instantly frozen in place in mid-air.</p><br/><p>His body was then forced out of the smoke. The astonishment and disbelief on his face was apparent as he wondered how his opponent could have become so much more powerful in such a short time. He could even nullify the effects of his escape art.</p><br/><p>As his body was forced out of the smoke, Meng Hao\u2019s cold face radiated icy killing intent. He shot forward, clenched his hand into a fist and punched Yi Chenzi directly in the chest.</p><br/><p>Yi Chenzi had no way to avoid the blow. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and the sound of cracking bones could be heard coming from his chest. With a miserable shriek, he was sent tumbling backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he be so powerful?!?!\u201d Yi Chenzi was scared out of his mind. A droning sound filled his body as Meng Hao\u2019s cold voice suddenly rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore, you dared to steal things that belong to me. I let you get away once, how could I possibly let you do so again today?\u201d He immediately charged Yi Chenzi again and punched him a second time.</p><br/><p>A boom could be heard. Yi Chenzi coughed up more blood, and his face went pale. Before he could even say anything, Meng Hao\u2019s fist once again slammed into him, injuring not just his physical body, but also his Nascent Soul. Even his totem tattoos seemed on the verge of collapse.</p><br/><p>At this critical moment, Yi Chenzi let out a piercing howl. His Spiritual Sense suddenly emanated out, and the evil magic in his body began to circulate. Suddenly, a black moon appeared on his forehead. As soon as this happened, all of his Spiritual Sense converged onto the black moon, causing it to begin to rotate. Shockingly, a reflection of the black moon appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s forehead as well.</p><br/><p>Yi Chenzi coughed some blood out of his mouth then shouted, \u201cSense Slaying!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the words left his mouth, the inverted image of the moon on Meng Hao\u2019s forehead shattered, and an intense power surged into Meng Hao\u2019s mind. In response, Meng Hao let out a cold snort. The power was fierce, and was obviously Yi Chenzi\u2019s trump card. If Meng Hao hadn\u2019t already formed his Earth-type totem tattoo, then his mind would be reeling right now.</p><br/><p>Instead, he quickly recovered. His own Spiritual Sense was far more powerful than Yi Chenzi\u2019s. Backed by the power of four of the five elements, the effect of Yi Chenzi\u2019s attack was easy to dispel.</p><br/><p>Another fist descended, and Yi Chenzi\u2019s body exploded with blood and gore. His shocked Nascent Soul flew out, surrounded by the protection of the black moon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he be so powerful! Why? Why?! Dammit, he must have seized some blessing in the Realm of the Bridge Ruins.\u201d Even as his terrified Nascent soul tried to retreat at top speed, Meng Hao snatched Yi Chenzi\u2019s corpse and put it into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>As Yi Chenzi\u2019s Nascent Soul tried to flee, suddenly, the Outlander Beast arrived. A boom filled the air as it struck out. Yi Chenzi\u2019s Nascent Soul screamed and then spit out a mouthful of Nascent Soul life Qi. The Nascent Soul itself grew fuzzy and extremely weak. The black moon shield collapsed, and the other protective treasures that he had pulled out moments ago also were destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable!\u201d shrieked Yi Chenzi. \u201cYou people are despicable! I demand a one-on-one duel!!\u201d His face twisted with fear as he was surrounded on three sides by the Outlander Beast, the parrot and Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne-on-one duel? Yeah right, b*tch! Lord Fifth always wins by outnumbering the enemy. Who\u2019s gonna duel you, b*tch! How could you be so naive?\u201d The parrot squawked as it charged once again in attack. The Outlander Beast roared and struck out. As for Meng Hao, he did nothing except for seal off Yi Chenzi\u2019s escape route with freezing wind every time he tried to flee.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that the meat jelly suddenly let out an excited shout. \u201cDon\u2019t kill him! I have to convert him! I\u2019ve been looking for someone as evil as this for years! I\u2019ve always wanted a challenge like this!\u201d The meat jelly\u2019s eyes glowed and filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Fear not! Come come. Tell Lord Third your name.\u201d</p><br/><p>A boom filled the air as the Outlander Beast struck out again. Yi Chenzi\u2019s Nascent Soul was injured again. More life Qi sprayed from his mouth. The Nascent Soul was incredibly weak at this point, and his eyes were filled with desperation. With an angry cry, he tried to perform a minor teleportation, but even as he did, the air around him froze like ice, blocking the minor teleportation. Next, the parrot charged toward him.</p><br/><p>A miserable scream rose up into the sky. The scene was tragic beyond compare. Even the members of the Crow Divinity Tribes were shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go, I was in the wrong! Let me go\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom! The Outlander slapped out playfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a chance, I will\u2026 aaiiiii\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The parrot, manly and vigorous, pierced him through.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? Eee? You\u2019re not answering me! So, you look down on me, eh? Despise me? You, you, you, you are simply too evil! You are too immoral! I must convert you! I will convert you. Why won\u2019t you say anything\u2026?\u201d The meat jelly continued to blabber on continuously.</p><br/><p>Within the space of about ten breaths, Yi Chenzi\u2019s Nascent Soul continuously let out miserable shrieks of despair. The parrot and its concubine, and the meat jelly, were tormenting him until he was about to collapse.</p><br/><p>In the end, Yi Chenzi let out a furious roar and chose to self-detonate. However, in the moment before he did, the Outlander Beast opened its mouth and swallowed him down. A faint explosion could be heard, after which the Outlander Beast opened its mouth and burped out some mist.</p><br/><p>This was the way in which Yi Chenzi was ultimately killed. He was not cut down by Meng Hao, but rather toyed to death by the parrot, Outlander Beast, and meat jelly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh? He died?\u201d The parrot seemed to think that it was a pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi. I can\u2019t believe he died before I was able to convert him.\u201d The meat jelly had a pained expression on its face as it sighed.</p><br/><p>The Outlander Beast wore a strange expression as it looked back and forth between the meat jelly and the parrot. It said nothing.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao turned and headed back toward the mountain, surrounded by his neo-demon horde. He waved his hand and instantly, totemic life force flowed out in all directions, fusing into the neo-beasts as well as the vine trunk.</p><br/><p>They immediately began to recover. As they did, Meng Hao produced a large collection of medicinal pills to treat not only the wounds of the neo-demons, but also strengthen the weakened Crow Divinity Tribe members, who instantly looked much more energetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings exalted Sacred Ancient!\u201d The more than one thousand Tribe members all began to kneel and kowtow to Meng Hao. Even the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather got to his knees to kowtow. When they lifted their heads back up, their faces were filled with anticipation. They were aware of Meng Hao\u2019s goal in going to the Realm of the Bridge Ruins, and now, they all looked at him with anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought back hope,\u201d he said, looking around at them. \u201cWe will migrate\u2026 to the Black Lands!\u201d The surrounding Tribe members gasped and began to tremble. Tears streamed down their faces and they cried out in joy from the bottoms of their hearts.</p><br/><p>A few days later, the Crow Divinity Tribe\u2019s life-saving migration began.</p><br/><p>With the fall of the violet rain, life force was exterminated and teleportation portals stopped working. Spiritual energy was scant, which made it so that the Crow Divinity Tribes had to travel on foot. There was no way for them to fly through the air.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, there were still ordinary Tribe members with no Cultivation bases. That made it impossible to travel at any high rate of speed.</p><br/><p>For a Cultivator to fly from the Western Desert North region to the Black Lands in the South region would take many years. To walk\u2026 would take a thousand. There was no time for that. The only way migrate successfully\u2026. would be to acquire a flying machine that could carry one thousand people.</p><br/><p>They needed a flying machine that could be powered by Spirit Stones, not the spiritual power of Heaven and Earth. Only a large flying machine like that could facilitate their migration and make it a reality.</p><br/><p>Before departing, Meng Hao looked back at the mountains. After having returned, he hadn\u2019t seen the Black Bat. From what Gu La had told him, it had disappeared only a few days after he left for the Realm of the Bridge Ruins. As to where it went, nobody knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fled without my permission. Well, I can find you if I wish.\u201d Meng Hao look at the mountains, his eyes glittering. Then he turned and walked off into the distance with the Crow Divinity Tribes.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Note: Based on Er Gen\u2019s note at the end of the chapter, it seems that it was around this time that ISSTH hit #1 on qidian.com\u2019s monthly charts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

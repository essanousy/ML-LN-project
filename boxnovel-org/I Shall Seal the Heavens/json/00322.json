They were filled with an expression of blankness, as well as a somewhat embarrassing feeling of fear.</p><br/><p>His breathing was a bit heavy. Everything the old man had said, every word, every sentence, continued to echo in Meng Hao\u2019s mind like thunder.</p><br/><p>Various memories began to flicker through his mind, and his eyes began to glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boundless Ninth Mountain\u2026. Choumen Tai is from the Seventh Mountain's Planet Tiger Cage, and participated in what he called the great war of the Ninth Mountain\u2026. That must be the great war among the Stars that the old man talked about! [1. Choumen Tai was the \u201cImmortal\u2019s corpse\u201d who Meng Hao met in chapter 301]</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I remember that the Eighth Generation Demon Sealer said that he came across the legacy of the Seventh Generation Demon Sealer in the Sixth Mountain, which was how he joined the League of Demon Sealers. He said he refined half of the Sea of the Sixth Mountain to form his Demon Sealing Jade!\u201d [2. The Eighth Demon Sealer\u2019s recollections were mused upon in chapter 102]</p><br/><p>Various clues that used to be scattered about in his mind were now being drawn together by the old man\u2019s words. Now, he was getting a much clearer image of everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe vastness beyond this world includes Nine Mountains and Seas of indescribable size. Each Mountain has its own respective sun and moon\u2026. Each Mountain even has four planets! According to what Choumen Tai said, I\u2019m on one of the four planets of the Ninth Mountain, Planet South Heaven!\u201d In this instant, the world that Meng Hao used to know was torn to pieces. Everything was vastly larger than he had ever imagined. Currently, his mind was filled with knowledge of the Heavens that\u2026 only Immortals understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ji Clan is powerful not just here on Planet South Heaven, but the other three planets as well. This is because Ancestor Ji seized the Essence of the Ninth Mountain and Sea and became the most powerful of all, eventually changing the Heavens of the Ninth Mountain! Ancestor Ji () covered the name Li () with the Heavens ()! How audacious of him!\u201d Meng Hao took a deep breath; he suddenly felt a great pressure upon him. Could he ever have truly imagined how powerful the Ji Clan was? It was unimaginably terrifying.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, what he was up against was merely a minor branch of the Ji Clan here on Planet South Heaven.</p><br/><p>\u201cKarma thread\u2026.\u201d he thought. \u201cThat must be the invisible thread that attached to me after I killed Ji Hongdong. With that thread stuck to me, I won\u2019t be able to flee anywhere in the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Hmm\u2026 I wonder what position the Fang Clan occupies?\u201d He frowned, having no way to answer the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Essence of the Ninth Mountain and Sea\u2026. Could that be the Demonic Qi I\u2019m able to sense using the art of Righteous Bestowal? Is the Essence of the Ninth Mountain a Demon?\u201d Meng Hao frowned. Considering his Cultivation base and experience, these were things that he had difficulty comprehending.</p><br/><p>\u201cChoumen Tai is from the Seventh Mountain. The Eighth Demon Sealer was from the Sixth Mountain. The Seventh Demon Sealer\u2019s legacy was in the Sixth Mountain\u2026. I'm the Ninth Demon Sealer from\u2026 the Reliance Sect.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s mind was in complete disorder. It was as if some vast, mysterious scroll was slowly spreading out in front of him. The more he wished to see, the more of the scroll he needed to spread out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s that woman from the Solitary Sword Sect, Shan Ling. The Demon Sealing Jade said that she was a stone from the Ninth Mountain who fell to here and became a spirit\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao rubbed the bridge of his nose. He felt like his entire mind was in a shambles. [3. Shan Ling was introduced in chapter 180]</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of people were the previous eight generations of Demon Sealers? By cultivating their magic, I can sense the Essence of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. How powerful were they, exactly? And why didn\u2019t Ancestor Ji approve of the League of Demon Sealers\u2026.\u201d He frowned again. He liked thinking, but no matter how he thought about everything he knew, he couldn\u2019t put all the pieces together. He was just missing too much information.</p><br/><p>Using a tiny bit of information to try to understand a huge picture will of course lead to frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Sealers, Demon Sealers\u2026. If the Qi Essence of the Ninth Mountain and Sea is Demonic Qi, then wouldn\u2019t the League of Demon Sealers be in a position above the Ninth Mountain and Sea? If that is the case, then I\u2026.\u201d His heart began to pound at the enormity of the question. However, he quickly decided to dispel the notion.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible. If that were true, then how could the previous eight generations of Demon Sealers have perished? And why would I, the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, be in such dire straits? My only Dao Protector is an old turtle who has long since fled.\u201d Meng Hao laughed bitterly. No matter how he tried to get rid of the idea, it seemed impossible; and yet, it had taken root in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Eighth Demon Sealer had to experience Dao Tribulation in the Nine Mountains and Seas\u2026. He didn\u2019t say Ninth Mountain, he said Nine Mountains. He meant all of the Nine Mountains and Seas\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao thought for a while, and then decided to stop analyzing everything. He let out a soft sigh. He knew that speculating would do him no good; he was nothing more than a Core Formation Cultivator.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows, I might never leave Planet South Heaven. The only way to do so is to reach Immortal Ascension .\u201d He shook his head to clear his mind.</p><br/><p>Immortal Ascension was just a vague concept to him; what was of more immediate concern was the path of the Perfect Gold Core.</p><br/><p>In the following months of practice with the art of Righteous Bestowal, Meng Hao never again sensed the old man in the rubble field. However, he consistently had the feeling that he was being watched.</p><br/><p>Through the months, the number of outside Cultivators who joined the force surrounding his Immortal\u2019s cave surpassed one hundred. It was now the most powerful force in the entire region.</p><br/><p>More than one hundred people surrounded the small mountain. The medicinal cistern was the second of the holy locations, the first being Meng Hao\u2019s Immortal\u2019s cave.</p><br/><p>Every day, they were all required to recite the words regarding faith in the Lord Fifth bringing eternal life. Because of the sheer force of numbers, when they shouted their rallying cry, it sounded like thunder.</p><br/><p>The increase in numbers did benefit Meng Hao. Whenever he needed something, a large group of Cultivators would appear at a single word to handle whatever matter it was. The parrot and the meat jelly seemed extremely interested in commanding all of the Cultivators. Therefore, Meng Hao didn\u2019t need to pay them much attention, and instead left them to their devices.</p><br/><p>On one particular day, Meng Hao sat cross-legged meditating, when suddenly his eyes snapped open. He could sense that the magical symbol on Ji Hongdong\u2019s bag of holding had finally completely dissipated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what will be inside the bag of holding of a member of the Ji Clan\u2026. It\u2019s hard to say, considering that Ji Hongdong was just a member of the junior generation.\u201d Now that he understood more of the fearsome power of the Ji Clan, his anticipation was even greater. He took out the bag of holding and scanned it with Spiritual Sense.</p><br/><p>His face immediately changed, and he gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was definitely worthy of being a Ji Clansman\u2026.\u201d he murmured. \u201cI made out big this time!\u201d He had long anticipated that the contents of the bag of holding would by no means disappoint. However, regardless of the vast power and resources of the Clan, Ji Hongdong was a tiny member of the junior generation. As such, Meng Hao had assumed he wouldn\u2019t be disappointed, but also didn\u2019t expect too much.</p><br/><p>However, it seemed he had underestimated the resources of a member of the Ji Clan Quasi-Array\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cUltra high-grade quality Spirit Stones\u2026.\u201d A glow shone over Meng Hao\u2019s right hand as a Spirit Stone appeared. The interior of the Spirit Stone was turbid, not translucent. It looked ordinary, and was something most people had never even seen. However, Meng Hao was familiar with it.</p><br/><p>This was the exact same type of ultra high-grade Spirit Stone he had used to duplicate the wooden sword all those years ago!</p><br/><p>Such Spirit Stones were incredibly useful. Meng Hao had long since run out of them. When he thought back to how he had squandered them that time, his heart hurt. In fact, considering that he felt that particular wooden sword to be only moderately powerful, it really felt like a waste.</p><br/><p>He really regretted his ignorance at that time. Having practiced cultivation down to now, he truly understood the value of ultra high-grade Spirit Stones. In all of the Southern Domain, high-grade Spirit Stones could be found, but the ultra high-grade variety were exceedingly rare.</p><br/><p>As he looked at the Spirit Stone in his hand, power suddenly surged from his Cultivation base. The Spirit Stone began to glow with a resplendent light. At the same time, an immense amount of spiritual energy emanated out, filling the entire Immortal\u2019s cave.</p><br/><p>It permeated the cave, spilling outside as well. The more than hundred Cultivators outside all opened their eyes wide with shock as they sensed the spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty ultra high-grade Spirit Stones!\u201d thought Meng Hao. He suppressed his excitement; to him, such a collection of Spirit Stones would be incredibly useful. They could serve as the nucleus of certain magical treasures or spell formations.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he could also try to duplicate the Primordial Heavenly Replenishing Pill, which he needed to help recover his longevity. Then, he would be able to use the Blood Immortal mask again, and wield its shocking power.</p><br/><p>He began to put the Spirit Stone back. \u201cAlright, so there\u2019s Spirit Stones. What else is\u2026 oh!?\u201d Suddenly, his body began to tremble, and he rose to his feet, a look of disbelief on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026.\u201d He began to pant, astonishment written on his face. Just now, something had happened which he hadn\u2019t sensed in a long time\u2026 spiritual energy had flowed into his body!</p><br/><p>This place was neither the Blood Immortal Legacy zone, nor the Song Clan. But suddenly, he was able to absorb the spiritual energy in the area. It poured directly into his body, seeping in through his pores, filling him.</p><br/><p>The sensation of being able to once again absorb the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth caused Meng Hao to close his eyes. Ever since he had formed the Perfect Foundation, he had been unable to absorb spiritual energy in any place other than the Blood Immortal Legacy zone and the Song Clan.</p><br/><p>A moment later, he opened his eyes, and they glowed with an intense light. He had already absorbed all of the spiritual energy in the entire area, including that outside the Immortal\u2019s cave.</p><br/><p>This in itself completely changed his impression of this bag of holding. His mind was spinning even more intensely than it had when he heard the words of the old man in the field of rubble.</p><br/><p>\u201cUltra high-grade Spirit Stones\u2026.\u201d He once again looked at the Spirit Stone he held in his hand. He rotated his Cultivation base, and felt boundless spiritual energy surging into him. This proved his assumption; it was not an illusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must have something to do with my Cultivation base. In any case, it seems that once I form the Perfect Gold Core, I can still use ultra high-grade Spirit Stones to absorb spiritual energy. I couldn\u2019t do that during Foundation Establishment. With these Spirit Stones, I won\u2019t have to only rely on medicinal pills and the Violet Pupil Transformation to heal myself.\u201d He looked back down at the fifty ultra high-grade Spirit Stones in the bag of holding. As of this moment, they were even more valuable to Meng Hao than they had been before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even as he teleported backward in retreat, the space he had just occupied was crushed and destroyed.</p><br/><p>The ground quaked and crumbled as a huge crater opened up. As Meng Hao shot forward like lightning, the vicious Demon face which surrounded him picked up speed. In the blink of an eye, it was bearing down on the Sixth Paragon, radiating Demonic qi which caused everything to shake, and bright colors to flash in the area.</p><br/><p>The Sixth Paragon\u2019s pupils constricted, and he waved his hand out in a grasping motion. A long banner appeared in his hand, upon which were depicted the images of numerous roaring, wild beasts. Among the countless types of creatures, there were even dragons!</p><br/><p>\u201cAll-Consuming Beast Swarm!\u201d he screamed, waving the banner through the air. Instantly, the countless creatures inside the banner surged out, roaring. It was a sea of beasts which swept out toward the fierce Demon face.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the two forces slammed into each other, resulting in a massive explosion which shattered the surrounding ruins and crushed the air. It was almost like two enormous mountains had collided, causing the ground to quake and a huge cloud of dust to rise up!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was shaking visibly, but at the same time, the Sixth Paragon coughed up a huge mouthful of blood, and his banner was shredded to pieces.</p><br/><p>It was a critical moment in the fight. The Sixth Paragon took advantage of it to speed off, coughing up blood the entire time. Then, popping sounds could be heard as numerous ghost images appeared. Tens of thousands of shadows resembling the Sixth Paragon all began to scatter in different directions, making it almost impossible to determine which was his true self.</p><br/><p>The Sixth Paragon had tangled with Meng Hao in the past, and had long since come to fear him. Therefore, he had no intention of fighting a protracted battle, and immediately attempted to flee.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao let out a cold harrumph, and opened his third eye. The world changed into that of the Ghost City, wherein countless figures could be seen. At the same time, Meng Hao was instantly able to determine which among the tens of thousands of shadows was the Sixth Paragon\u2019s true self.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get away,\u201d he said coldly. As his voice echoed out, he flickered into motion, reappearing directly in front of one of the shadows. Then, he unleashed a fist strike.</p><br/><p>It was the God-Slaying Fist!</p><br/><p>A boom rang out as the shadow shattered, and the Sixth Paragon emerged from within, face ashen. He immediately fell back at top speed, a vicious expression gleaming in his eyes. However, before he could escape, Meng Hao waved his finger, unleashing the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex.</p><br/><p>Because of Meng Hao\u2019s current battle prowess, the Eighth Hex was now strong enough to affect even 9-Essences Paragons. The Sixth Paragon\u2019s face fell as he suddenly lurched to a halt. Although he recovered almost immediately, a brief moment of immobility like that could be an eternity in a fight like this.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out as Meng Hao launched another punch toward the Sixth Paragon. However, in that instant, the Sixth Paragon\u2019s skin turned bright red, and a glow like that of blood emanated out, transforming into a shield which blocked the punch.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s fist slammed into the blood-colored shield, causing the shield to distort, and the Sixth Paragon to stagger backward.</p><br/><p>However, even as he did, Meng Hao launched another fist strike, then another. Booms echoed out as the blood-colored shield struggled to hold. When the third successive fist strike hit it, the shield shattered, and the fist landed onto the Sixth Paragon\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and a sensation of numbness swept over him like flood waters. Even his cultivation base teetered unstably, and his soul trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, Jin Yunshan is obviously aware that I need help, but isn't responding. Old Eighth is the only one on the way. He\u2019s not too far away, but still needs time to get here!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Meng character is not only a lunatic, he also excels at seizing the initiative in battle. I can\u2019t even use a full eighty percent of my power because he never gives me a chance to do anything!\u201d As Meng Hao closed in again, the Sixth Paragon let out an enraged roar. By this point, he knew that it wasn't very likely he would be able to extricate himself from the fighting. Clearly, Meng Hao was completely focused on exterminating him.</p><br/><p>In that case, it would be better to die fighting than to run away. In fact, his only hope lay in drawing out the fighting long enough for the Eighth Patriarch to arrive. Then the two of them could either fight or flee together. Either way, they could change the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, you push things too far!\u201d he howled. His body was still bright red as he performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, billowing clouds appeared behind him as he unleashed all of his Essence power. It transformed into a huge black head which lunged toward Meng Hao as if to swallow him whole.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was icy cold as he flickered into motion, a streak of azure light that transformed into an azure roc. The roc slammed into the black head, piercing through it and destroying it. The Sixth Paragon let out a miserable shriek as blood spurted from various wounds. Even as he prepared to fall back, the azure roc teleported, appearing directly in front of him and then shooting forward to blast through his body.</p><br/><p>It was an intense, deadly situation. The Sixth Paragon let out a roar of rage, hands flashing in a double-handed incantation gesture that caused all of the light around him to vanish. Everything turned black as he called upon his ninth Essence, that of the darkness of night.</p><br/><p>The darkness of night was capable of crushing all light, of superimposing the color black onto everything and anything. All existence could be wiped out. This Essence magic was the Sixth Paragon\u2019s trump card, and having been forced into the corner he was in, he unleashed it without any warning.</p><br/><p>However, even as the Essence exploded out, causing Heaven and Earth to turn dark, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered. He could sense the boundless killing intent that surrounded him. His body felt as if something else were controlling it, as if a boundless coldness was surrounding him and trying to bore inside of him to wipe away his soul.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao suddenly laughed and said, \u201cSomeone once tried to corrupt my body, to defile my soul. I let her, so that she could be happy and at ease. And now you\u2019re trying use a similar Essence magic against me....</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Essence of the darkness of night can cover over Heaven and Earth. However, the Demonic qi within me can cover over the Vast Expanse....\u201d With that, Meng Hao ceased struggling, and allowed the darkness of night to enter his body. However, the process went too slowly for his taste, so he opened his mouth and intentionally sucked it in.</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, the darkness of night began to tremble. In the blink of an eye, Meng Hao had turned into a black hole. Everything trembled as boundless darkness... poured into his mouth!!</p><br/><p>The sight was completely shocking, leaving the Sixth Paragon feeling as if he had been struck by lightning. His eyes shone with disbelief and shock as he watched Meng Hao sucking the darkness of night into his mouth. Meng Hao's hair whipped about as he began to emanate an aura that the Sixth Paragon had never encountered before in his entire life.</p><br/><p>It was an evil aura, a multifarious aura. It was like an Immortal, and yet also like a God, and at the same time, like a Devil. It changed back and forth rapidly, causing Heaven and Earth to tremble. As of this moment, Meng Hao was like the Dao of a world, and when he flicked his sleeve, everything began to collapse.</p><br/><p>Even more shocking to the Sixth Paragon was that he suddenly realized that his ninth Essence... was vanishing from inside of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cC-consuming... consuming Essence? Y-y-you...\u201d The Sixth Paragon was scared out of his mind. Eyes gleaming with rage, he howled as he fell back. As of this moment, he abandoned all thoughts of tangling with Meng Hao. Instead, he tried to escape with all the speed he could muster, leaving a series of afterimages behind him as he fled.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mouth twisted into a grim smile. Even as the Sixth Paragon began to flee, Meng Hao took three steps forward, each one of which caused everything to shake violently.</p><br/><p>After three steps, his energy had risen to a level that seemed to supercede the entire world. Suddenly, a sensation of indescribable deadly crisis filled the Sixth Paragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me!!\u201d he thought. He slapped his hand down onto his head. A droning sound filled his mind as he unleashed an unknown secret magic. Green smoke rose up from his red skin, increasing his speed dramatically. In the briefest of instants, he was 500 kilometers away.</p><br/><p>Killing intent flickered in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes as he took four more steps. With each step, Heaven and Earth trembled. The fourth step took him 500 kilometers forward. Then he took the fifth and sixth steps, which were as equally grand and dramatic.</p><br/><p>The Sixth Paragon\u2019s face was ashen, and the sensation of deadly crisis grew more intense. He had completely lost any fighting spirit, and could sense the trump card that was his ninth Essence fading away, which caused his scalp to tingle. Then he sensed Meng Hao\u2019s energy rising, and his mind began to reel as he realized that it almost felt as if he were fighting a peak 9-Essences cultivator like the Sect Leader or Jin Yunshan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cThat\u2019s... that\u2019s the Seven God Steps of the Devil Realm!!\u201d He knew that the most powerful explosion of energy from the Seven God Steps came from the seventh step. That raised one\u2019s mind, life force, cultivation base and everything else to a higher level. In the blink of an eye, it would lead to an explosive, exponential increase in battle prowess.</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao took that seventh step, the Sixth Paragon\u2019s vision turned red. However, in that moment of deadly crisis, a beam of light appeared off in the distance, shooting toward them at high speed.</p><br/><p>The Eighth Paragon had arrived!</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ninth, what are you doing? How dare you attempt to harm fellow sect members. Stand down immediately!!\u201d The Eighth Paragon\u2019s voice echoed like thunder, and rumbling sounds caused even the clouds to vibrate as he shot forward.</p><br/><p>The Sixth Paragon\u2019s eyes went wild with joy, and he immediately sped in the direction of the Eighth Paragon. It was in that moment that Meng Hao completed his seventh step!</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth shook. The sky took the shape of Meng Hao\u2019s face, and the lands turned black. A profoundly murderous aura filled the area, converging upon Meng Hao\u2019s right hand in the form of the Eighth Hex Essence!</p><br/><p>It was... Spatial Hexing!</p><br/><p>Shockingly, he was preparing to completely and thoroughly seal the Sixth Paragon, to seal the space around him, to seal his cultivation base, and to seal... his life!</p><br/><p>As soon as the sealing mark appeared, the incoming Eighth Paragon\u2019s face fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, are you looking to die?!?!\u201d By this point, he didn't even call Meng Hao by the title of Ninth Paragon, but rather, by his true name!</p><br/><p>The Sixth Paragon's mind was spinning, and he was completely overwhelmed by the sensation of crisis. It was as if Meng Hao had superseded the entire world, and as his right hand descended, the Sixth Paragon screamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never seal me, Meng Hao!!\u201d Apparently throwing caution to the wind, he chose to do the only thing he was capable of doing at this juncture... detonating one of his Essences!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

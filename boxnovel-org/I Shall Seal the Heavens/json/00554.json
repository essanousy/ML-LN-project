It seemed as if all the power of their Cultivation bases was emanating out. Their bodies were withered, to the point where they seemed fused with the houses. Apparently, these people were sparing no cost, giving up even their life force, to maintain the operation of the restrictive spell.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wasn\u2019t able to make out any more concrete details.</p><br/><p>Almost the same moment in which Meng Hao arrived at the mouth of the gourd, he was shocked to discover that in the air around him were multiple streams of Divine Sense.</p><br/><p>There were even streams of Divine Sense that didn\u2019t belong to Spirit Severing, but were valiant nonetheless. Apparently these were the result of magical items that could allow Cultivators from various Tribes to lock onto this position from a distance, and thus observe the proceedings.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao ignored them. The fact that no one had interfered during the battle against the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe revealed the attitudes of the others.</p><br/><p>Right now, the appearance of these streams of Divine Sense made that attitude even more obvious. These people were here to see\u2026 exactly what would happen in the end between him and Patriarch Huyan!</p><br/><p>Some people clearly had a vested interest in what was going on, although Meng Hao didn\u2019t want to know why.</p><br/><p>The mastiff, having just endured the aggravation of the parrot the entire way here, needed no orders from Meng Hao. A bright red glow emanated from its body as its Spirit Severing aura exploded out. It swiped out with its paw, slamming at the magical symbol restrictive spell.</p><br/><p>A boom echoed out. Cracking sounds could be heard as the magical symbol collapsed into fragments. However, even as it disintegrated, another restrictive spell became visible. The mastiff\u2019s fiendish will expanded out. It roared and swiped out its paw again. And then again. The entire gourd mountain shook for the space of ten breaths as the mastiff destroyed hundreds of layers of restrictive spells. However\u2026 by this point, they had only proceeded about a hundred and fifty meters down into the mouth of the gourd.</p><br/><p>Shockingly, the entire gourd\u2026 was completely filled with restrictive spell formations!</p><br/><p>The mastiff was about to continue destroying them, but Meng Hao calmly prevented it. He hovered outside of the mouth of the gourd and looked down inside. Then, his eyes filled with a cold light. He waved his right hand, and instantly, one of the seven Violet Sea Giants moved forward. In the blink of an eye it entered the mouth of the gourd and then transformed into a majestic Violet Sea that began to drain down into the gourd.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the people die,\u201d Meng Hao said calmly, \u201cthe restrictive spells will shatter on their own.\u201d In the Southern Domain, Meng Hao had not mastered the art of cruelty. However, his experiences in the Black Lands and the Western Desert, and especially the migration with the Crow Divinity Tribes, had forced him to shed his former naivety. Because of his surroundings and his experiences, he had slowly, almost imperceptibly, changed. He now truly acted like a Cultivator.</p><br/><p>When dealing with enemies, any tactic is acceptable! When dealing with benefactors, debts of gratitude must be repaid, regardless of the cost!</p><br/><p>Even as the word left his mouth, the Violet Sea poured down into the gourd. The power of extermination exploded out, transforming into what sounded like rumbling voices. The entire gourd mountain began to tremble violently.</p><br/><p>Life and death collided, and the power of extermination roared out. Even if the restrictive spells of the gourd bottle were powerful, they would still contain life force. It might not be something that the restrictive spell innately possessed, however, as the Violet Sea sank down into the gourd, the life forces of the 10,000 Heavenly Pursuit Tribe members became explosive linchpins.</p><br/><p>Roaring could be heard from within the world of the gourd. The Cultivators sitting cross-legged on top of the houses trembled and began to visibly break into pieces.</p><br/><p>Massive explosions echoed about as the successive layers of restrictive spells were destroyed. At the same time, the second of the Violet Sea Giants neared, transformed into seawater and then poured into the gourd\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>After that, it was a third, then a fourth. In the end, five of the Violet Sea Giants became seawater and poured down into the mouth of the gourd. Rumbling sounds completely filled the world inside the gourd.</p><br/><p>The restrictive spells were now completely defeated and dispersed. Seawater completely filled the first level of the world of the gourd. Everything, all life, all Cultivators, were submerged within the Violet Sea and wiped out by the power of extermination.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of thousands of specters now charged into the Violet Sea to sweep about the world of the gourd.</p><br/><p>Gradually, an enormous spell formation began to emerge.</p><br/><p>It could be called a spell formation, or perhaps, a door.</p><br/><p>It was a door that led to the second level of this world.</p><br/><p>It was a simple, unsophisticated door, and it was closed tightly. Outside the mouth of the gourd, Meng Hao waved his hand toward the seawater within. Instantly, it swirled into a whirlpool, which rotated faster and faster. The water, along with the hundreds of thousands of specters, roared as they transformed into a massive cyclonic power that shot toward the door leading to the second level.</p><br/><p>The cyclonic power erupted with massive power as it slammed against the door. A boom could be heard as the door was smashed into countless pieces. All the seals and all the restrictive spells were completely destroyed.</p><br/><p>When the door collapsed, fierce howls could be heard coming from within the second level of the world. Shockingly, two thousand Heavenly Pursuit Tribe members could be seen within. There were even several Nascent Soul Cultivators and totemic Sacred Ancients. However, as they charged out in attack, the Violet Sea poured in. The power of extermination exploded out, whereupon bloodcurdling screams could be heard.</p><br/><p>The cries echoed out for a moment within the gourd, and then faded away. Soon the entire mountain was completely quiet.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Pursuit Tribe had been completely eradicated.</p><br/><p>Even still, Patriarch Huyan was nowhere to be seen within the world of the gourd.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao frowned, then gave a cold snort. He waved his hand toward the gourd mountain, causing the Violet Sea within to seethe. It rapidly transformed back into the Violet Sea Giants, which then began to strike at the mountain with their fists.</p><br/><p>The ground quaked as more restrictive spells were destroyed. After the amount of time it takes half an incense stick to burn, the entire mountain began to fall apart and collapse. A huge roaring sound could be heard as it crumbled into ruin.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe\u2019s temple had been completely destroyed!</p><br/><p>The collapse of the mountain caused dust to fly out in all directions. As Meng Hao hovered up above in mid-air, he slapped his bag of holding, causing massive amounts of corpses to appear. Shockingly, they all fell down onto the destroyed temple, collecting together into something like a small mountain.</p><br/><p>A mountain of corpses!</p><br/><p>The corpses of the members of the Heavenly Pursuit Sect all piled together to form a mountain that rose up over the land.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaves return to the ground to become nourishment for roots. Rest in peace. Although you said you would not rest until the Golden Crow Tribe was dead, as of this moment, your Tribe has been exterminated. All enmity is vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place was your temple, now, your corpses will be buried here.\u201d Meng Hao waved his sleeve, causing several huge chunks of the gourd mountain to fly up into air. He stacked them up around the corpses, transforming the area into\u2026 a tomb!</p><br/><p>Heavenly Pursuit Tomb!</p><br/><p>This tomb would stand here to time indefinite, a witness to all the Black Lands. For years and years, this place and this tomb would strike terror into the hearts all the inhabitants of the Black Lands.</p><br/><p>It also bore witness to the rise of the Golden Crow Tribe.</p><br/><p>The instant the tomb came into being, the surrounding streams of Divine Sense became even more serious than before. Meng Hao was fairly certain that the scene playing out here was probably being observed by more than half the Tribes in the Black Lands.</p><br/><p>Actually, it was exactly as Meng Hao imagined. In almost all of the Tribes in the Black Lands, all Cultivators of the Core Formation stage or higher were using various precious treasures to watch Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Meng Hao\u2019s return to the Black Lands caused him to become thoroughly famous in the hearts of all Cultivators of the Western Desert and the Black Lands. He had long since risen to prominence; to them, he was no longer a mere Nascent Soul Cultivator in terms of seniority. No, he was a Patriarch.</p><br/><p>How could the Black Lands not pay extra attention to him?!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the tomb for a long moment before turning to stare off into the sky. There, off in the distance, was a black cloud, approaching with indescribable speed.</p><br/><p>As the cloud neared, the previously bright sky instantly began to turn as black as night. Clouds covered the sky, as if the night was consuming the daylight!</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng\u2026 Hao\u2026.\u201d As the night consumed the day, a deep voice rang, filled with a rancor that seemed to be etched upon the very bones of the speaker. It rang out like thunder from within the black night.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked up calmly at the rapidly approaching darkness. A fierce glow appeared in his eyes, and the desire to battle raged up within him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch Huyan,\u201d he said calmly, directly entering the Seventh Anima.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>As the seven Nascent Souls combined, he grew taller by several heads. His body became stronger, his shoulders wider. His frame was slender, his long hair bizarre and Demonic. He radiated the air of an Immortal Devil, shocking and audacious.</p><br/><p>The strength of his fleshly body caused the surrounding air to ripple and distort. It was as if the area around him was not compatible with the rest of the world</p><br/><p>This intrepid fleshly body contained the battle prowess of sixty-four great circle Nascent Souls. Since ancient times, there had never been someone like this, and in the future, there likely never would. It was a path Meng Hao had forged, something unique and one of a kind in all the lands of South Heaven.</p><br/><p>This was not a Perfect Nascent Soul, but was virtually exactly the same!</p><br/><p>By now the sky was completely black. A cloud shot directly toward Meng Hao, who did not flinch back in the slightest. In fact, he stepped forward, performing an incantation with his right hand, and then pointing forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind!\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>As he spoke, an unspeakable gale-force wind sprung up around him. It raged into spinning winds that seemed to stretch from the ground all the way up to the Heavens. From a distance, it looked like an enormous tornado raging around Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The spinning winds shook everything and caused a huge roaring to rise up. It picked up countless huge boulders and endless amounts of dust which instantly shot toward the incoming cloud.</p><br/><p>During his battle with Patriarch Huyan\u2019s clone, he had used magical items as well as the Blood Immortal divine abilities. However, he had not used his own creation, the magic of his seven Nascent Soul totems.</p><br/><p>In some respects, the power unleashed as Meng Hao used them right now was much more appropriate for him than the Blood Immortal divine abilities.</p><br/><p>That was especially so now that he was in the Seventh Anima. His power was thoroughly shocking in all respects.</p><br/><p>Massive roaring spread throughout half of the Black Lands, shaking fully seventy percent of the Tribes, filling the hearts of the Cultivators with astonishment.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Sebastian Wei\u00df</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

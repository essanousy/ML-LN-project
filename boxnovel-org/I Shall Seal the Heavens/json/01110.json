He looked like a giant, hovering there in midair, exuding shocking pressure. [1. Yuwen Jian\u2019s \u201cGod Body\u201d increases his height by multiples of \u201czhang\u201d with each transformation. It starts with 6 \u201czhang\u201d or 18 meters, and then increases by multiples of 9 after that]</p><br/><p>He lifted his right hand up and clenched it into a fist, which he held out toward Meng Hao. It was a simple motion, but the cracking sounds which rang out as a result caused the air to shatter. He let out another roar, and he looked like a mountain as he then charged toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>He was enormous, but he moved with unbelievable speed. In the blink of an eye he was in front of Meng Hao, his enormous fist punching out with terrifying, exterminating power.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao's eyes glowed with a strange light. His blood surged through his veins, and his desire to fight was strong as Yuwen Jian\u2019s fist closed in. He took a deep breath, and although his energy didn\u2019t surge in the same way Yuwen Jian\u2019s had, but his aura still shot up madly with that single breath.</p><br/><p>A madness rose up, a madness like that of Bedevilment. It was a determination like nothing else, something that disregarded everything, even the shattering of all bones, in the pursuit of cutting out a swath of blood.</p><br/><p>That entire will was focused into a single punch that rumbled through the air. This was Meng Hao\u2019s second body cultivator fist strike.</p><br/><p>The Self-Immolation Fist! Also known as... the Bedevilment Fist!</p><br/><p>A huge boom filled the air as Meng Hao and Yuwen Jian slammed into each other. The lands trembled, mountains collapsed, and the sky flashed. Meng Hao let out a muffled grunt and staggered backward about twenty paces. When he looked up, he saw Yuwen Jian flying through the air like a kite with its string cut, blood spraying from his mouth. Meng Hao's single punch had sent him spinning, and it looked like his body was on the verge of being shredded to pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond transformation!</p><br/><p>\u201cThird transformation!</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth transformation!\u201d Yuwen Jian\u2019s voice boomed out as he fell back, and his body continued to grow larger until he was 108 meters tall. Now he really was a giant, with explosive energy. Roaring, he finally came to a stop, and then braced himself and prepared to fight back against Meng Hao\u2019s Bedevilment Fist. As he strode forward, he said, \u201cFifth transformation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another roar could be heard as he grew even taller. By the time Meng Hao reached him, he was 135 meters tall. From a distance, Meng Hao looked completely insignificant.</p><br/><p>However, that seemingly insignificant frame contained a power that caused even Yuwen Jian's fleshly body to tremble.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes were as cold as ice. Yuwen Jian had said his punch from moments ago would be his last one, but here he was attacking again. Meng Hao was losing patience. Suddenly, his fist opened up into a palm. Such a motion should have caused a drop in his momentum, but instead, shocking ripples spread out.</p><br/><p>It was as if his palm had fused with world to become the will of Heaven!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, outside of the sealed cage area, a massive pressure seemed to be weighing down, an awakening aura that pierced through the seal and settled onto Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>His open palm then slowly clenched back into a fist, causing the aura to explode out like the will of Heaven, unleashing an intense, indescribable killing intent!</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Slaying!\u201d Meng Hao said coolly.</p><br/><p>However, in the moment that he spoke, the attacking Yuwen Jian suddenly shivered as he felt a sensation of unprecedented deadly crisis well up inside of him. It was indescribably intense, and he had the premonition that if he went through with his attack, he would end up dead!!</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! How can he be so strong!? He must have been holding back his strength when he was fighting with Lin Cong!\u201d Yuwen Jian's face fell, and his surging energy suddenly faded away. He instantly backed up, shrinking down to his normal size. Then, his face extremely serious, he angrily said, \u201cBrother Meng Hao, what are you doing! Well? What do you think you\u2019re doing!?!? Didn't we have an agreement? We were just comparing fighting tips, right? I can't believe you're using lethal attacks!?!?</p><br/><p>\u201cAs brothers, this really pains me! We might have just met each other, but we became friends at first sight! There\u2019s no need try to kill each other! You qualify to exchange World Seals with me! Hahaha! Brother, I already said that last fist strike was my last one, and I always keep my word.\u201d Yuwen Jian didn't seem to feel the least bit uncomfortable or embarrassed to switch from being arrogant and condescending to calling Meng Hao brother. His expression was one of complete sincerity, just as a body cultivator should be; he exuded an air of complete honesty and forthrightness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout trading for the World Seal, Brother Meng Hao, why don\u2019t we go to the Seventh Nation\u2019s National Aura Mountain together? Trading for the World Seal means that we won\u2019t have to damage our relationship. Plus, you can gain enlightenment of further essences. What possible downside could there be?\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange expression appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face, and he cleared his throat as he relaxed his fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be for the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, follow me!\u201d Yuwen Jian gave an inward sigh of relief, then laughed heartily as he led the way. He and Meng Hao transformed into two beams of bright light that shot toward the Seventh Nation\u2019s National Aura Mountain. Before long, they arrived, and since Meng Hao had been invited by Yuwen Jian, the National Aura Mountain\u2019s defenses did not target him.</p><br/><p>Once they arrived at the statue, Yuwen Jian made a grasping motion, causing the flame of the World Seal to float over and hover atop his palm.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever as he extended his hand in a similar fashion, causing a World Seal flame to appear.</p><br/><p>The two of them stared at each other warily for a moment before waving hands and exchanging the two flames.</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian smiled, then nodded and sat down cross-legged. He didn't immediately begin to contemplate enlightenment, but rather, looked at Meng Hao and waited for him to begin. After all, once the process started, there was no way to suddenly stop it. If one person started without the other, neither would feel comfortable about the situation.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Yuwen Jian wasn\u2019t willing to just hand over the Seventh Nation's World Seal permanently.</p><br/><p>After a moment of thought, Meng Hao waved his left hand, causing blackpod imps to spread out around the area and act as Dharma Protectors. Then he sat down and looked at the flame in his hand.</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian took a deep breath, causing bright lights to begin to swirl around him, which transformed into a protective shield. They exchanged a final glance, and without saying anything else, simultaneously sank into contemplation.</p><br/><p>Immediately, tremors ran through their bodies. Remaining ever vigilant against each other, both began to focus on Essences and natural law.</p><br/><p>Time passed by. Three days later, they had both reached a critical juncture in their contemplation. Although Yuwen Jian had not previously received a blessing of qi flow from the Windswept Realm like Meng Hao had, this was his home turf, and therefore, his process of enlightenment went quickly.</p><br/><p>Conversely, Meng Hao was not on his native Mount Whiteseal, but instead on the Seventh Nation\u2019s National Aura Mountain. That should have made his speed of enlightenment much slower, but he had the benefit of the qi flow of the Windswept Realm. Therefore, although his speed was slightly slower, it was a speed that he could accept, putting him just slightly ahead of Yuwen Jian.</p><br/><p>However, on the fourth day, just when Meng Hao was on the verge of completion, the pressure in the Seventh Nation increased dramatically, and rumbling sounds filled the air.</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian\u2019s eyes snapped open, and a grim look appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone's coming!\u201d he growled. Being in the midst of contemplating enlightenment, however, there was very little he could do. He looked over at Meng Hao, who had also opened his eyes, and was frowning as he looked off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Not too much time passed before three beams of light appeared, speeding through the air. In the lead position was a young man with half-black, half-white hair. He wasn\u2019t just handsome, he was beautiful, and had a glittering Echelon mark on his forehead.</p><br/><p>He was followed by two other cultivators, a man and a woman. Both appeared to be young, but they emanated terrifying cultivation base auras. They were in the Ancient Realm, with five extinguished Soul Lamps each. Furthermore, the feeling they gave off was not that of ordinary Ancient Realm cultivation bases. They seemed more powerful, indicating that these were Chosen.</p><br/><p>\u201cDao-Heaven\u2019s number one follower, the eleventh Echelon cultivator, Hai Dongqing!!\u201d [1. Hai Dongqing\u2019s name in Chinese is  h\u01cei d\u014dng q\u012bng . Hai means \u201csea\u201d but can also be a surname. Dong means \"east.\u201d Qing is a color, usually green, blue, cyan, or azure, but sometimes black] Yuwen Jian\u2019s face flickered, and his eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollower? Hai Dongqing?\u201d Meng Hao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHai Dongqing used to be like me, an Echelon cultivator from the Seventh Mountain. However, after he was defeated by Dao-Heaven, he inexplicably joined his entourage. As an Echelon cultivator, it's a complete disgrace to become the follower of some other person!\u201d Yuwen Jian gritted his teeth and stared at the three incoming cultivators. \u201cDammit, shouldn\u2019t Dao-Heaven\u2019s goal be the Third and Sixth Nations? I can't believe he\u2019s ignoring them and focusing here!\u201d Yuwen Jian\u2019s face flickered, and he cursed inwardly. His contemplation of enlightenment was still incomplete, making it impossible for him to fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a grudge with Hai Dongqing?\u201d Meng Hao asked suddenly.</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian's face darkened further, and he nodded. \u201cI killed him once, years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Considering that they were both Echelon cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, there was little wonder that they had a hard time maintaining a good relationship, and had ended up fighting to the death.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sat there quietly for a moment while Yuwen Jian ground his teeth. Although Yuwen Jian couldn\u2019t attack personally, he could summon help. He smacked his hand down onto the ground, and rumbling sounds echoed out through the Seventh Nation. Shockingly, numerous holes suddenly appeared all over his body, which then exploded, revealing a group of figures.</p><br/><p>They were puppets, dozens of them, with powerful cultivation bases. Meng Hao's eyes widened slightly, but given that Yuwen Jian was also in the Echelon, it was only natural that he would have some tricks that he wouldn't reveal without good cause.</p><br/><p>Almost as soon as the puppets appeared, Hai Dongqing began to descend from above, his hair floating around him, his body radiating shocking energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, we meet again, Yuwen Jian!\u201d Hatred gleamed in Hai Dongqing\u2019s eyes. His voice was soft and effeminate as he floated over. His gaze then shifted to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao? I never imagined I would find you here! Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I guess today I\u2019ll get to take four World Seals for Elder Brother Dao-Heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian\u2019s eyes went wide, and he started cursing loudly: \u201c<em>Elder Brother</em> Dao-Heaven!? What bullshit! You're nothing more than Dao-Heaven\u2019s lackey, you fool! How shameless do you have to be to join someone else's entourage, huh Hai Dongqing?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

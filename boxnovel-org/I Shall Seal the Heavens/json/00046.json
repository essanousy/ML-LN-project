Usually it was when he needed to buy pens, ink, paper and inkstones. Perhaps because the excess of wealth in the village prompted a demand for scholarly embellishments, the price of writing supplies was cheaper than average.</p><br/><p>Even though three years had passed, the place looked just like before. As Meng Hao walked down the streets, he couldn\u2019t help but notice that outside of many of the shops hung lanterns, upon which the character \u201cLi\u201d was written in sweeping calligraphy.</p><br/><p>From what Fatty had said, his father was the richest person in Yunkai, and actually owned about half of the county. And it wasn\u2019t just land they owned, but business, all of which were marked with the character \u201cLi.\u201d</p><br/><p>After asking around, he determined the location of Fatty\u2019s house and headed in that direction. The sun was beginning to sink over the horizon, turning the sky dark and covering the land with a soft glow.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for him to reach the east end of Yunkai County, where he saw a massive estate, filled with a veritable forest of grand buildings. Above the main door, which was guarded by retainers, was a board inscribed with the words \u201cLi Mansion.\u201d The lively sound of singing and dancing could be heard from within.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s body flashed, and he was inside.</p><br/><p>The mansion was a large, surrounding an inner courtyard where singers and dancers were currently putting on a show. Meng Hao caught sight of an extremely fat, middle-aged man wearing a luxurious robe. He closely resembled Fatty; this was obviously his father. Sitting next to him was a young man whose face was covered with a prudent expression.</p><br/><p>He seemed wildly arrogant, and wore expensive garments, yet his body looked a bit frail, as if he had worn himself out with too much wine and women. He held a wine cup in his hand, and a somewhat indecent expression shone in his eyes as he looked over the singers and dancers.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill not here yet?\u201d said the young man, frowning. His tone of voice was both cold and bored.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny moment, any moment,\u201d said Fatty\u2019s father, looking extremely embarrassed, but forcing an obsequious smile onto his face. \u201cYoung Lord Zhao, please just wait a bit longer. My daughter-in-law tends to take things slowly.\u201d Even as the words came out of his mouth, several maidservants appeared in the distance. Walking behind them was a young woman. She wore a long, gauzy garment, and her hair was put up with phoenix hairpins. Her appearance was pure and beautiful, and yet there was a look of fear on her face; as she approached she seemed to shiver as if she were cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather\u2026\u201d she said as she approached. She bowed in greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiang\u2019er, this is the young Lord from the house of Zhao in Yunhai County,\u201d said Fatty\u2019s father softly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you toast him?\u201d He looked at his daughter-in-law apologetically. Even though his son had been missing for years, she continued to wait for him to return, never complaining. She treated her father-in-law with utmost filial piety.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, young Lord Zhao,\u201d said the girl softly, lowering her head. She was afraid, but she knew that the family was not in a good position at the moment. She lifted up the wine pot and poured some wine into a cup, which she extended to him with both hands.</p><br/><p>He looked at her, his eyes shining brightly. He swallowed hard. The girl was shockingly beautiful, and in his heart, he was already prepared to make some trouble. A lecherous smile appeared on his face. He accepted the wine up and then tried to grab her hand. The girl stepped back, frightened, causing the cup to tumble to the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d shouted young Lord Zhao, his eyes blazing. He kicked over the table, sending wine and food scattering about. He pointed at Fatty\u2019s father. \u201cYou listen to me, Li Dafu. My younger brother is back, and he\u2019s an Immortal now. He wants your property, not your lives! I felt pity for you and spoke kindly of you to him, but then you humiliate me like this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Lord Zhao, this\u2026\u201d Fatty\u2019s father hastily tried to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut the hell up! Let me tell you, this matter isn\u2019t finished! If you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll have your daughter-in-law spend the night with me. If she pleases me, then I\u2019ll say some more nice things about you to my younger brother\u2026.\u201d He laughed coldly, his eyes fixed on the girl, whose face had grown pale white. A dirty look once again appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s father\u2019s face grew ashen. At first, the young man had only mentioned toasting, which he had agreed to. But this was excessive. He gritted his teeth. His son was missing, and he couldn\u2019t even protect his own daughter-in-law. What was the point of living?</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat it!\u201d he roared. \u201cGet the hell out of here! Men, kick this man out! Even if the Li family goes bankrupt, I won\u2019t tolerate insults from the house of Zhao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow impressive,\u201d laughed young Lord Zhao. He spun and left, his eyes filled with murder.</p><br/><p>Watching the feast being cleared away, the young girl bit her lip, tears streaming down her face. She lowered her head and looked as if she were about to say something.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this matter,\u201d said Fatty\u2019s father calmly. \u201cLaw still exists in this world. Please, take the young miss back.\u201d Servants appeared to escort the young woman away. Everything was quiet. Fatty\u2019s father began to tremble. He staggered, suddenly seeming to grow older.</p><br/><p>Then he shook his head and began to walk. Before long, he reached a building. He pushed the door open and walked in. It was a luxurious room, but seemed as if it would look better if everything weren\u2019t covered with bite marks.</p><br/><p>\u201cFugui, where are you?\u201d murmured Fatty\u2019s father as he sat down into a chair. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you returned\u2026?\u201d He looked even older than before. He gently rubbed at a bite mark on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing well,\u201d said a voice, breaking the silence. Fatty\u2019s father lifted his head, and his eyes filled with fear as he realized that somehow another person was standing in the room, next to the window. He had no idea when or how he had come to be standing there.</p><br/><p>He wore a long blue robe, and looked like a scholar. It was none other than Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Li Dafu stood up, looking alarmed. He took a few steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Li Fugui\u2019s friend from the Sect, Meng Hao, from Yunjie County.\u201d Meng Hao turned. His eyes moved from some bite marks on the windowsill to rest on Li Dafu.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao!\u201d said Li Dafu, shocked. He recognized the name. When he had checked into the disappearance of his son all those years ago, he\u2019d learned that three other boys had gone missing at the same time. One of them was named Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cFugui, he\u2026\u201d Li Dafu\u2019s body began to tremble. Inside, he felt hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in the State of Zhao at the moment, but I think he\u2019ll be able to return before too long.\u201d Meng Hao walked forward and sat down in a chair. \u201cI saw what happened in the courtyard just now,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here for a few days to take care of the matter.\u201d He took a piece of paper out and placed it down onto the table. \u201cPlease forge me three spears according to these specifications. One iron, one silver, and one gold spear.\u201d With that, he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Li Dafu hesitated, but then nodded his head. Regardless of how unbelievable the situation might seem, he would rather believe what Meng Hao had just said. Without a word, he picked up the paper and hurried off.</p><br/><p>As for young Lord Zhao, he left the Li household, and Yunkai County, his face grim. Accompanied by his retainers, he made his way back to Yunhai County in the darkness of night, gnashing his teeth. As he walked, he slapped himself hard in the face, leaving behind a clear palm print. Soon, he arrived at a large courtyard, and the expression on his face suddenly turned to one of respect, even awe. His voice low, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, are you awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter!?\u201d said a cold voice. The voice was a bit shrill, as if its owner was a boy just beginning to go through puberty.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only does the house of Li refuse to listen to your suggestions, they also humiliated me. They even slapped me.\u201d Young Lord Zhao tried to put on his most humiliated expression.</p><br/><p>The door slowly opened, and a young man walked out. He appeared to be about twelve or thirteen, and wore a richly embroidered gown. He had finely chiseled features and looked almost beautiful. Were Meng Hao here, this young man would instantly begin to act like a toady. He was one of the disciples saved by Grand Elder Ouyang the day the Reliance Sect was disbanded. He was Meng Hao\u2019s servant, Zhao Hai.</p><br/><p>He had the same idea as Fatty, to become a great landowner. With Fatty gone, he had returned to this area and began plundering the properties of the local rich families. He had actually begun to plan how to deal with Li Dafu back when he was still in the Reliance Sect. Unfortunately, after returning, he\u2019d learned that the Li family forbade its members from revealing information about family assets.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou good-for-nothing fool,\u201d said Zhao Hai with a cold snort. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m as stupid as you? The angle of that palm print is all wrong. You obviously hit yourself.\u201d An expression of disgust appeared on his face. But, this person was his older brother. He frowned. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m about to make a breakthrough in my Cultivation base. In seven days, I\u2019ll go with you to the house of Li.\u201d He turned and went back into the room, slamming the door behind him. Young Lord Zhao looked pleased. His heart burned as he imagined the young girl\u2019s plaintive cries coming from underneath him, seven days from now.</p><br/><p>Seven days passed. Zhao Hai walked out of the house of Li in Yunhai County, his hands clasped behind his back, followed by young Lord Zhao. They brought a group of family retainers with them. Their eyes filled with killing intent as they headed straight for Yunkai County.</p><br/><p>In Yunkai County, Meng Hao sat cross-legged in Fatty\u2019s room, meditating in silence. Around noon-time, a light knock could be heard on the door. Meng Hao slowly opened his eyes to see Li Dafu entering the room. Behind him were ten family retainers. Three groups of three men each carried a spear, one iron, one silver, and one gold.</p><br/><p>Networks of fine lines were carved onto their surfaces, making them appear both primitive and luxurious at the same time. Meng Hao raised his hand, and the iron spear flew through the air toward him. Li Dafu and his servants gaped in astonishment and shock.</p><br/><p>The iron spear was extremely heavy; to see Meng Hao snatch it from such a distance frightened them.</p><br/><p>Li Dafu\u2019s body shook, and his eyes shone. Before, he had surmised that Meng Hao was not an ordinary person. Despite only half trusting him, he had still complied with the request to craft the three spears. But now, he thoroughly believed his previous words. This person was clearly not ordinary.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded, retrieving the silver and gold spears. He tested them out, then deposited them into his bag of holding with the flick of a sleeve. When this happened, flopping sounds sounded out as the servants dropped to their knees and bowed to him, their expressions filled with shock.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This is a series of 5 special chapters sponsored by Jon Alle, Jingping Lai, Erik Gordon, Christian Dela Cruz, Sai Pakalapat, Marco Pacheco Dera, Chris Sherman, Sheela Mugan, Tjandra Johannes, Deep Bhattacharya, Allen Porter, Daniel Delaney, Steven Melendez, Abdul azim Nasyirah Diyana, and Austin Minett</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

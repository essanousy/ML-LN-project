Hearts filled with happiness, he and Meng Hao transformed into beams of prismatic light that shot off toward the other Solitary Sword Sect disciples.</p><br/><p>When the man named Li saw Meng Hao approaching with Chen Fan, he frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Junior Brother is acquainted with my Master and wishes to visit him,\u201d said Chen Fan coolly in explanation. \u201cHe will accompany us back to the Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man named Li said nothing. He simply turned and transformed into a colorful beam that shot up into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother, after we get to the Sect, I\u2019ll go implore Master to take you as a disciple. Then we can be fellow Brothers of the Solitary Sword Sect. It shouldn\u2019t be a very big deal. I\u2019ve never asked anything of Master, so there\u2019s an eighty to ninety percent chance he\u2019ll agree. Of course, I expect he\u2019ll only accept you as a novitiate. However, his Cultivation Base is at the Nascent Soul stage, so being one of his novitiates is still a high position within the Solitary Sword Sect.\u201d It seemed Chen Fan already had Meng Hao\u2019s future planned out meticulously.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hesitated for a moment, and then said, \u201cElder Brother, for the moment, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary. I actually have some matters I need to take care of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother!\u201d said Chen Fan, his expression suddenly very solemn. \u201cI understand that you don\u2019t want to join another Sect. I felt the same way back then. I only wanted to be a member of a single Sect for my entire life. However\u2026 we are Cultivators. Our Sect is the foundation of everything, especially in the Southern Domain. Anyone who is not a member of a Sect is a rogue Cultivator. Regardless of Cultivation base level, rogue Cultivators make progress only with great difficulty. Years can be wasted, and the results can be in vain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to listen to me in this matter. The Solitary Sword Sect is the number one Sect in the Southern Domain. It\u2019s Dao Reserves are incredibly profound. It\u2019s a place where both of us can grow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>As they traveled, Chen Fan continued to give him advice, all the way until afternoon of the next day. Eventually, the Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s main gate appeared up ahead. Finally, Meng Hao nodded.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan\u2019s smile grew wider as he gazed at Meng Hao with the kind warmth of a member of the elder generation looking at a junior. Although he wasn\u2019t very much older than Meng Hao, in his eyes, Meng Hao was still that young scholar who had just joined the Sect.</p><br/><p>The Solitary Sword Sect was comprised of an enormous mountain, visible from far off in the distance. This mountain was the number one mountain in the entire Southern Domain, a hundred times larger than any other mountain.</p><br/><p>The name of this mountain was\u2026 Solitary Dao Mountain!</p><br/><p>Floating above it in the sky was another mountain that seemed to be a mirror image of it. From a distance, they made an outline like that of an hourglass. Anyone who caught sight of it for the first time would surely be shocked.</p><br/><p>The name of the second mountain was\u2026 Solitary Sword Mountain!</p><br/><p>The mountains were so large that it was almost impossible to look from one end to the other in a single glance. Meng Hao had never seen mountains as large as this in his entire life. He couldn\u2019t help but tremble inwardly at the sight of them.</p><br/><p>If it were only these two mountains, then it wouldn\u2019t be a very big deal. But\u2026 in the center the two mountains was a massive sword, piercing through them into the ground!</p><br/><p>The hilt of the sword protruded above the mountains and stretched up into the sky.</p><br/><p>Boundless rays of morning sunlight filled the area, giving it a truly celestial feeling.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath. Having laid eyes on the Black Sieve Sect and the Solitary Sword Sect, he had now seen two of the great Sects of the Southern Domain. The Black Sieve Sect was undeniably influential. The dread caused by their power would cause anyone to bow before them.</p><br/><p>However, the Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s sheer, raw might didn\u2019t cause others to bow before them, but to fear them!</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what the other great Sects look like\u2026\u201d thought Meng Hao to himself as he gazed at the Solitary Sword Sect.</p><br/><p>The group of people flew along quickly. As they approached Solitary Dao Mountain, they reached an area that was protected by a beautiful field of colorful light. Up ahead, the man named Li looked back coldly at Meng Hao and then gave a cold snort. With that, his disappeared into the light.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao watched coolly as he left. In his estimation, the man was someone who couldn\u2019t really see to the heart of things. If Chen Fan hadn\u2019t stopped him earlier, the man would either have been injured or killed. It all would have depended on Meng Hao\u2019s mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Chen Fan, clearly worried for Meng Hao. \u201cOnce Master accepts you as a novitiate, then Elder Brother Li won\u2019t dare to bother you.\u201d He gave a comforting smile, and then pulled Meng Hao in through the colorful field of light. He pulled out a glowing jade slip. The light swirled up around the two of them. It flickered, and then they disappeared.</p><br/><p>When they reappeared, they were at the foot of Solitary Dao Mountain. The air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers and the sounds of birds singing. Gurgling streams could be seen. There were quite a few Solitary Sword Sect disciples going to and fro. When they saw Chen Fan, each and every one gave him respectful salutes.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan led Meng Hao to the courtyard of a house. \u201cLittle Junior Brother,\u201d he said, \u201cyou wait for me here. I\u2019m going to go pay my respects to the Elders. After that, I\u2019ll go look for Master. I probably won\u2019t return until after nightfall. You rest a bit here, or go walk around if you\u2019d like. Don\u2019t go too far, though. When I get back, we can stay up all night chatting.\u201d He clasped Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder, and then turned and flew off in a beam of colorful light.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao watched him depart, then looked around at his surroundings. He opened the gate of the courtyard and entered the house. It was decorated tastefully, although not extravagantly. Everything emanated refinement. This was especially true of the vast collection of scrolls. Meng Hao selected one of the ancient texts and sat down cross-legged to examine it.</p><br/><p>After some time passed, he put the ancient scroll down, and a thoughtful look gleamed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe I should join the Solitary Sword Sect\u2026\u201d he thought, his brow furrowed. It wasn\u2019t his first choice. However, the Black Sieve Sect surely wouldn\u2019t just let go the matter of the meat jelly. Entering the Solitary Sword Sect might not be a bad choice.</p><br/><p>His eyes glittered stubbornly at the thought of the Violet Fate Sect. Dispelling his poison wasn\u2019t the only reason he wished to do so. \u201cI\u2019m still inclined toward the Violet Fate Sect,\u201d he thought. \u201cI really want to learn Violet Qi from the East\u2026\u201d With that technique, he could form a Violet Core, which was the pinnacle of Core Formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, I need to study alchemy. I can\u2019t rely on others to do it for me every time I need a pill concocted. That\u2019s especially true of the Perfect Core Pill\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao sat there for some time lost in thought. Soon, evening began to fall. Sunlight streamed in from outside. Meng Hao took a deep breath and, seeing that Chen Fan hadn\u2019t returned, decided to step outside of the house for a bit to look at Solitary Dao Mountain.</p><br/><p>The setting sun shone onto the mountain, giving it a somewhat hazy appearance. Mist began to rise up around the mountain, and as Meng Hao looked closer, his eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>He suddenly caught sight of a woman wearing a blue-green garment, floating down a path on Solitary Dao Mountain.</p><br/><p>The appearance of this woman made the haziness of the surroundings suddenly seem clear. The sound of people dropping to their knees and prostrating themselves to her could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Elder Sister Shan Ling.\u201d [1. Shan Ling\u2019s name in Chinese is  sh\u0101n l\u00edng. Shan means \u201cmountain.\u201d Ling means \u201cspirit\u201d]</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really Elder Sister Shan Ling. I\u2019ve heard that on the ninth day of every month, at dusk, she descends the mountain to collect dewdrops\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Elder Sister Shan Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of voices drifted down to Meng Hao. He watched as the woman slowly floated down the mountain, and his heart trembled as suddenly, the voice of the Demon Sealing Jade sounded out in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cA stone of the Ninth Mountain descended and became a new mountain (.) The mountain () has a spirit (,) and the spirit () is demonic. Its will is not of this world. If you encounter it\u2026 allow it to transform magically if it is good. Seal and exterminate it if it is violent. Make your choice after careful consideration.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound echoed out in Meng Hao\u2019s mind. He stood there silently for a moment recovering his composure. He was used to the bizarreness of the Demon Sealing Jade. He looked at the woman, and his eyes shone with a strange light.</p><br/><p>Quite a large group of Cultivators had flown over and were bowing to the woman and offering respectful words. One of them was none other than the middle-aged man named Li, who bowed toward her politely.</p><br/><p>The moment that Meng Hao\u2019s gaze fell upon the woman, she looked down at him and seemed to pause in mid-air. A sharp look filled her eyes as she looked at him.</p><br/><p>Their gazes locked for the space of a few breaths. The woman\u2019s brow furrowed slightly, and then she looked away and continued off into the distance. She left, but the man named Li seemed to have taken notice of the look that had passed between the two of them.</p><br/><p>He had also noticed Shan Ling\u2019s furrowed brow. He gave a cold harrumph, and then his body flashed, and he shot down toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>This aroused the attention of the surrounding Solitary Sword Sect disciples. In the blink of an eye, the man named Li arrived to float above the courtyard where Meng Hao stood. He looked down, a cold gleam in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou again!\u201d he said coldly. \u201cFirst you overestimate your strength, and then you dare to be disrespectful to the Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s Elder Sister Shan Ling! Just what is your purpose in coming here?!\u201d This caused many of the surrounding disciples to look at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks a bit familiar, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen him before\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember him. That\u2019s the guest who Elder Brother Chen brought with him earlier this afternoon. I wonder what Elder Brother Li wants with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever as he looked up at the haughty Li character.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you mean, your excellency?\u201d said Meng Hao coolly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever your purpose here, you\u2019re in the Solitary Sword Sect. Considering your actions here, I think I need to take your Elder Brother\u2019s place in teaching you a lesson.\u201d He obviously wasn\u2019t interested in providing any sort of education to Meng Hao. Meng Hao had left him with a bad impression originally, and when combined with the Shan Ling\u2019s frown, caused him to be filled with ill feelings. He lifted his right hand, whereupon the power of the great circle of Foundation Establishment exploded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. The Li man\u2019s hand descended, and the illusory image of a large sword appeared. It descended toward Meng Hao, bursting with the power of the great circle of Foundation Establishment.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flashed coldly, and he lifted his own hand. He didn\u2019t have any good feelings toward this person, after all. However, before he could actually do anything, a small black dagger shot toward them and slammed into the Li man\u2019s phantom sword.</p><br/><p>A boom rattled out, and the phantom sword disintegrated. The Li man\u2019s face flashed as Chen Fan shot toward them in a beam of colorful light.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Li, you continue to harass my Junior Brother. With a Cultivation base at the Pseudo Core stage, must you really cause me to lose so much face? I\u2019m one of the Seven Solitary Sword Sons. Just who the hell do you think you are?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At the same time, the sky darkened, and snapping sounds could be heard.</p><br/><p>The shield surrounding Meng Hao began to collapse, and nearly exploded. Then, a screech of pain could be heard, and the area up ahead of Meng Hao became light once again, revealing\u2026 a huge, fierce turtle, retreating at top speed.</p><br/><p>The turtle was fully several thousand meters wide, with an anxious expression on its huge face. It then glared fiercely at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Shocked, Meng Hao fell back a few paces as his cracked shield quickly repaired itself. As of this moment, he realized that without the shield, he would currently be crushed inside of that damnable Patriarch Reliance\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>The Patriarch Reliance in his memory was far larger than this turtle in front of him. However, the unreliable appearance, his sneak attack method, and his tone of voice were all exactly the same as the Patriarch Reliance that Meng Hao knew.</p><br/><p>A strange expression appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face as he looked at this Patriarch Reliance. New hatred piled up in his heart. He thought back to the untold trials and tribulations he had gone through to help Patriarch Reliance, only to be ripped off in the end by the stingy old turtle.</p><br/><p>In the end, Patriarch Reliance even tried to eat him! It was only because of the reminder from Guyiding Tri-Rain, and his recitation of the Demon Sealing Scripture, that unreliable Patriarch Reliance was sent running.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strange,\u201d said Patriarch Reliance, glaring at him. \u201cSomething about your expression seems a bit off. Don\u2019t tell me you recognize this old Patriarch?\u201d His expression was strange as he looked at Meng Hao and the shield surrounding him. He gritted his jaw, looking inexplicably hateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Patriarch hates cheating children more than anything else, and you\u2019re obviously a cheater! You, you, you\u2026 you dare to try to pass through here with a shield! Bamboozler!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao backed up a few steps. Looking Patriarch Reliance over carefully, he suddenly said, \u201cAncient Dao; tenacious desire to seal the heavens\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking a few words, there was no reaction whatsoever from Patriarch Reliance. In fact, he seemed even more astonished, confused, and curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fudge! What are you doing, cursing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao backed up a few more steps, abandoning the Demon Sealing Scripture. After another look at Patriarch Reliance, he suddenly laughed.</p><br/><p>The laugh contained a bit of bashfulness; at the same time, a strange light could be seen shining in his eyes. The entire expression caused Patriarch Reliance to tremble with astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the fudge! What gives? What the hell! What kind of fishy thing is going here? Kid, there\u2019s something wrong with your expression\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen, bitch!\u201d cried Meng Hao, \u201cI\u2019m not just gonna curse you, I\u2019m gonna beat the crap out of you!\u201d Roaring, he leaped up into the air and slapped his bag of holding, causing a vast quantity of talismans to appear.</p><br/><p>Every single talisman emanated shocking power, blinding light, and incredible pressure. Patriarch Reliance\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo vicious!!!\u201d cried Patriarch Reliance, retreating backward at top speed. The feeling he got from the talismans caused his heart to race with fear. Before he could retreat too far, Meng Hao waved his hand, causing the talismans to ignite. An immense, red glow could be seen, from within which exploded countless Thunder Dragons. Their roars filled the air as they shot toward Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>Amidst the echoing booms, Patriarch Reliance shrieked and hollered, dodging back and forth. His rage billowed up, and he was about to say something when Meng Hao waved his hand again, causing seventy or eighty more talismans to fly out. As they exploded chaotically, the air shook and the ground was torn to pieces. Patriarch Reliance howled and charged toward Meng Hao\u2019s shield.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao clearly had no intention of evading or dodging. He allowed the old turtle to slam into his shield, after which a huge explosion could be heard along with a miserable shriek. Patriarch Reliance immediately tumbled backward, during which time Meng Hao waved his arm, causing more than a thousand talismans to be hurled out.</p><br/><p>These were all talismans personally created by Ke Yunhai. They needed no direction from Meng Hao. All he had to do was throw them out, and they would voluntarily transform into divine abilities and Daoist magic. Up above in the air, more than a thousand statues suddenly appeared, all of which instantly dove down toward Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>This barrage of attacks had Patriarch Reliance knocked into a daze. He shot backward relentlessly, his shell on the verge of being shattered, his heart filled with astonishment, as howls of rage emitted from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI surrender! The Patriarch surrenders! \u2026 Fudge, you\u2019re such a cheat! I never cheat like this!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept surrender!\u201d growled Meng Hao. No matter what was said, he would have his revenge. He waved his hand again, causing another thousand talismans to appear. Bloodcurdling shrieks continued to echo out. Patriarch Reliance trembled as he attempted to flee this way and that. The feeling of frustration in his heart had reached a pinnacle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, DAMMIT!\u201d howled Patriarch Reliance, \u201cIs there a grudge between us?!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao produced several hundred more talismans.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do to piss you off? Huh? Come on, tell me!!\u201d Patriarch Reliance was on the verge of tears. He was incapable of evasion, and could do nothing more than retract his trembling limbs and head into his shell. \u201cI was just born recently, I haven\u2019t even grown up yet. How could I have pissed you off?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t pissed me off,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t piss me off in the future!\u201d He waved his hand again, causing more miserable shrieks to come from Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cStick your head out of your shell,\u201d commanded Meng Hao, producing another large amassment of talismans and staring at Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stick my head out even if you beat me to death! You\u2019re just a big bully! You\u2019re incomparable! You\u2026 you\u2019re impossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t bully you now, then you\u2019ll bully me in the future!\u201d said Meng Hao coldly. He produced even more talismans, which he continuously tossed out. Booming filled the air, along with Patriarch Reliance\u2019s miserable shrieks. He retreated more, weeping.</p><br/><p>His shell was now almost half destroyed, and his body quivered as if from coldness. His head was pulled back tight inside, as if he really refused to stick it out even if he died.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at him, then leaped up onto his shell. He slapped his bag of holding to produce another magical item that Ke Yunhai had made for him. It was a small blade, seemingly dull, but in fact equipped with a fiercely sharp coldness. Meng Hao hefted the blade then squatted down and began to carve some words into Patriarch Reliance\u2019s shell.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao\u2019s turtle!\u201d</p><br/><p>After carving the three words, Meng Hao patted the turtle shell, then smiled complacently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call it quits today. It might be difficult for you, but I hope that in the future you'll remember that you\u2019re MY turtle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance glared at him, clenching his jaw. He knew that Meng Hao had carved something onto his back, and had long since made an inward determination to pay back this insult.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stamped his foot and flew up into the air, preparing to move on to the 71st level. However, as soon as he flew into the air, he suddenly seemed to think of something. He looked down just in the moment in which Patriarch Reliance stuck his head out of his shell.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao suddenly smiled, then subconsciously pulled out a talisman. Frightened, Patriarch Reliance retracted his head as fast as lightning, then howled, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that we would call it quits today?! You, you, you\u2026 you tricked me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s body flashed and he suddenly appeared directly in front of Patriarch Reliance, who was retracted in his shell. His powerful shield made it so that he wasn\u2019t afraid at all of any sort of sneak attack by the turtle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you off this time,\u201d said Meng Hao earnestly, \u201cbut I\u2019m still trying to decide whether or not to destroy you to get the reward for this level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance trembled within his turtle shell. He then opened his mouth to spit out golden beam of light that shot toward Meng Hao. It pierced through the shield, transforming into a magical symbol.</p><br/><p>The magical symbol was something that looked like a seed, which emanated colorful light as well as an indescribable pressure. It gave off a feeling of splendor, which instantly caused the rest of the world to grow dark, as if the sky itself had dimmed.</p><br/><p>Because it contained a Dao of Heaven and Earth, existing in a place above the natural laws of the world, anyone who cultivated it would have a great Dao!</p><br/><p>This was one of the top 10 Daoist magics of the 3,000!</p><br/><p>Even in the Demon Immortal Sect, this was truly an incredible and shocking magical technique. Its origin was unclear, and even in ancient times few people understood it clearly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath as he examined the magic. His heart began to beat out of control. Other than the Soul Divergence Incantation, this was the most powerful Daoist Magic that he had seen in the entire time he had been in this ancient world of the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what Daoist magic this is?!\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath and raised his hand to push his finger down into the magical symbol. Instantly, his brain filled with a roaring sound.</p><br/><p>The mark required no enlightenment. As soon as his finger touched it, it rushed into his body to his heart, where it transformed into a seed.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 was the seed of a great Dao, one of the top 10 Daoist magics. It required no enlightenment. In fact, enlightenment was useless. This seed would only sprout in the mind of someone destined to receive it!</p><br/><p>If destiny existed between him and this seed, it would always be there. Were there no destiny, then forcing it would be useless!</p><br/><p>The illusory seed rapidly transformed into nine parts, seven of which rushed toward his seven nascent souls.</p><br/><p>The other two remained in his heart.</p><br/><p>The instant the seven seeds made contact with his Nascent Souls, they began to tremble. Shockingly, they rapidly began to solidify from something illusory into something real. It seemed\u2026 that Meng Hao had acquired their approval, and that they had chosen to sprout within him!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the outside world, the eyes of all the Demon Immortal Sect disciples were fixed on the glow of magical light on the 70th level of the pagoda. This was especially true of the Cultivators from South Heaven.</p><br/><p>Even Ke Yunhai\u2019s expression was one of increased anticipation. As for the other Paragons, they were watching closely as well. All of them knew that this was a chance to get one of the top 10 Daoist magics.</p><br/><p>In this moment, the sky above the Demon Immortal Sect suddenly filled with roiling clouds. A red glow filled the lands, and a beam of bright light shot down. As soon as the beam of light appeared, the Seventh Peak Paragon suddenly opened his eyes, which glowed brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The light fell, turning blurry, and then splitting into three parts.</p><br/><p>The meaning of such a sign was something that most people wouldn\u2019t understand. However, the Paragons present all watched on with serious looks.</p><br/><p>Ke Yunhai began to pant slightly. Any other matter that occurred would not have left him so visibly shaken. However, since it affected Ke Jiusi, he couldn\u2019t help but be moved. His eyes shone with a strange light, and he almost couldn\u2019t bring himself to believe that what was happening was true.</p><br/><p>The three beams of light split again, turning into nine beams of light. In the blink of an eye, those nine beams of light\u2026 shockingly merged together into the form of an enormous figure.</p><br/><p>It was a somewhat indistinct figure, but it was still possible to see that it was Meng Hao\u2019s face!</p><br/><p>It was like a gigantic, magical image, shocking enough to cause Heaven and Earth to tremble.</p><br/><p>Next, the magical image opened its mouth and began to speak with an archaic voice that filled the entire Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne bloodline, transformed into three souls. Three souls tempered into nine divinities. Nine divinities refined into my true self. I am\u2026 Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao!\u201d</p><br/><p>In this same instant, for some apparently unfathomable reason, one of the three inverted Demon Mountains hanging up above the Demon Immortal Sect, the mountain which seemed to formed of molten stone\u2026 suddenly trembled!</p><br/><p>Everyone, including the Seven Paragons and all the disciples, were completely shaken.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Anon</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

You might even say that it was not a magical technique, but a divine ability!</p><br/><p>Every generation of Demon Sealers must create a new hex, and this one was created by the Eighth Generation Demon Sealer. As the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, Meng Hao should have been prepared to face everything. However, Patriarch Reliance had ruined everything. Had it not been for a host of coincidences, as well as good fortune, Meng Hao would never have been able to learn the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath and lowered his right hand. Ghost images appeared of everything in sight. Meng Hao\u2019s body trembled, and the world shook. Everything folded in onto Zhou Jie, causing countless ghost images to appear around him.</p><br/><p>All of this takes some time to describe, but in fact happened in an instant. The ghost images began to vanish. Miserable screams echoed out from Zhou Jie; the voices did not belong to him, but rather the spirits which had entered his body.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jie\u2019s body trembled, and his eyes were filled with confusion. A pulsating black aura drifted out from his body. The aura was extremely dense, and within it could be seen nine phantoms, images of old men with faces twisted in insanity and horror. They glared at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>No observer would be able to see these images\u2026 neither could they hear\u2026 the blood-curdling shrieks!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was the only one who could see or hear any of it. He was the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer, and despite having not yet fully realized his potential, his drop of blood had already confirmed his identity as the Ninth Generation. That was irrefutable.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he could see these things.</p><br/><p>The phantom spirits screamed miserably and then began to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe League of Demon Sealers, you\u2019re the Ninth Generation\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day our Dao was realized, you Demon Sealers blocked us, refined us, preventing us from becoming Demons!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares about the League of Demon Sealers? They\u2019ll become like us eventually, discarnate souls of Heaven and Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>As their words echoed out, their bodies began to tremble, and their screams grew more intense. The black aura around them began to dissipate, and they began to be absorbed into the ground. Their figures grew indistinct and then began to disappear.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao watched on thoughtfully. He didn\u2019t know much about the League of Demon Sealers; he was gradually learning along the way. Looking at the discarnate souls had caused a coldness to flash through his eyes. He waved his right hand.</p><br/><p>As he did, the discarnate souls vanished. Their dying cries echoed into Meng Hao\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cShatter the League of Demon Sealers! Lord Ji has replaced the Heavens and forged the Immortality Bestowal Dais. We struggled to become Immortal, and then died. What of it? Your League prevented us from achieving our Dao. Just wait until things change, then see which of the countless discarnate souls in Heaven and Earth will devour you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the sound of the voices continued to echo out, Zhou Jie\u2019s pale face began to recover its complexion. His eyes were still filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao glanced at him thoughtfully for a moment, then turned with the flick of a sleeve and began to walk off into the rain.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jie watched Meng Hao\u2019s figure disappearing. He took a deep breath, and then clasped hands and bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time we fight,\u201d he said under his breath, \u201cI won\u2019t kill you, even if I win. I will repay your kindness, and prove the determination of my Cultivation.\u201d Then he turned weakly, disappearing into a beam of light.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, deep in a limestone cave in the Hundred Thousand Mountains of the Black Sieve Sect\u2026. The moment the discarnate souls died, furious howls could be heard. Although they echoed up into the sky, not a single Black Sieve Sect disciple could hear them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe League of Demon Sealers! He\u2019s of the League of Demon Sealers!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn those Demon Sealers, each and every generation! Lord Ji fears them, and cursed the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer to die! This is the Ninth Generation\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath, death, death\u2026. The League of Demon Sealers must die! Every generation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImmortality Bestowal Dais lacks only the spirit of a Demon Sealer. Find him! Snatch his spirit and drink his blood to gain an Immortal body!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the howls rang out, the entirety of the Hundred Thousand Mountains suddenly shook. The mountains shook, the ground shook, as if the spirit of the mountains was aroused. Pulses of black aura drifted up, causing the sky to grow dark.</p><br/><p>However, at the very moment in which the pulses of black aura were about to shoot out, the corpse which had fallen from the sky to land near the Southern Domain\u2019s Rebirth Cave, suddenly shook. As it shook, and aura emerged from it, an aura not visible to any living person. It instantly spread out throughout the Southern Domain, filling it with terrifying force.</p><br/><p>This terrifying force caused the discarnate souls beneath the Hundred Thousand Mountains to tremble. Everything grew silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you!?\u201d Amidst the deathly silence, a powerful aura exploded out from deep beneath the Hundred Thousand Mountains. It seemed powerful enough to cause the corpse to tremble. When the other discarnate souls saw it, they prostrated themselves as if this aura were their sovereign.</p><br/><p>The billowing aura filled the sky above the Black Sieve Sect, covering the land for millions of kilometers in every direction. Everything became pitch black. The strangest thing was\u2026 no one could actually see this! To any onlooker, the sky was as blue as the deep blue sea!</p><br/><p>The voice which responded was deep and archaic. \u201cI came seeking destiny,\u201d it said. The sound echoed throughout the Hundred Thousand Mountains of the Black Sieve Sect, filled with the ancientness of countless years. It seemed\u2026 somewhat tired.</p><br/><p>Within the exhaustion was a barely detectable\u2026 killing aura.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if this person had lived a life of battle, had killed so many times that it was impossible to describe. The voice seemed to contain a shocking will.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?!\u201d said the sovereign-like aura above the Black Sieve Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cDestiny comes and destiny goes. The Dao will always exist. This kid has destiny. If you interfere, I will abandon rebirth, change my plans, and instead slaughter all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sovereign-like aura said nothing. After some time passed, it faded away. As it did, a haughty voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to change your plans. We will come for you! Select thirty Chosen from the Black Sieve Sect and send them to our Black Underworld Cave! We will return to the mortal world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile\u2026 deep in the recesses of the Rebirth Cave, was a corpse. It was not the corpse of a human, but rather, a fish. It was a small fish, about the size of a hand.</p><br/><p>The place where the fish\u2019s eyes once had been suddenly began to burn with a underworldly fire.</p><br/><p>Next, deep beneath the Milky Way Sea, the long rope stretched along the seafloor toward the wooden coffin that rested amidst the massive formation of stones [2. For more details on the rope and the fisth, see the entry \u201cRoc\u201d in the glossary]. A scratching sound could be heard, as if someone was inside the coffin, scratching the lid with their fingernails.</p><br/><p>A raspy voice sounded out: \u201cLeague of Demon Sealers\u2026.\u201d The voice was filled with melancholy, and reminiscence. The words drifted slowly up, causing a violent storm to break out on the surface of the Milky Way Sea.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em><strong>End of Book 2: Cutting Into the Southern Domain</strong></em></p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Note from Er Gen: This chapter is about 1000 characters short. However, all the details have been spelled out. You could say that this chapter is sort of a wrap-up. More exciting chapters are coming up! I really need to take some time to plan for Book 3. Book 3 will be the best I\u2019ve written so far!</p><br/><p>Note from Deathblade: He's right. Book 3 is amazing</p><br/>\n</div>"}

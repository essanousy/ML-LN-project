He was a master alchemist; regardless of whether he walked about in the East Pill Division or the Violet Qi Division, his position was much the same as an Inner Sect disciple. He was extremely important.</p><br/><p>According to some of the long-standing rules of the Violet Fate Sect, master alchemists were equal to Inner Sect disciples of the Violet Qi Division. In reality, however, their position was a bit higher.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d said Meng Hao with a slight smile. He descended the mountain with Bai Yunlai, then headed toward the Violet Qi Division. On the way, Bai Yunlai explained the situation. The person who had requested a pill to be concocted occupied a high position in the Inner Sect. However, despite being Chosen, he wasn\u2019t able to ask for help from a Furnace Lord. Furthermore, his reputation was not very good, so most master alchemists weren\u2019t willing to help him.</p><br/><p>The East Pill Division occupied a relatively aloof position; any master alchemist had the right to refuse a request. If they did, the Inner Sect disciples of the Violet Qi Division would be helpless to do anything about it. This particular Chosen had very few other options. Of the master alchemists who were willing to concoct pills for him, none met up to his standards.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunlai was aware of this, and figured that it was a good opportunity for Fang Mu. Even if it ended in failure, this Chosen couldn\u2019t do anything whatsoever against the East Pill Division. Therefore, Bai Yunlai had hurried over to find Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>After hearing the explanation, Meng Hao thought for a moment and then asked, \u201cWhat pill does he want concocted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say. You can ask when we get there. My status doesn\u2019t afford me the right to ask. In any case, Ding Yong [1] is a Chosen of the Violet Qi Division. He wouldn\u2019t answer me even if I did ask.\u201d Bai Yunlai sighed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded. As they passed through the various valleys, the scene from moments ago played out in his head. The incredible noise had been caused by the meat jelly breaking out. As soon as it appeared in its reborn state, it surprisingly didn\u2019t seem interested in talking. It quickly changed Meng Hao\u2019s appearance back to that of Fang Mu\u2019s, and then flew back into the blood-colored mask to sleep.</p><br/><p>Now, it slumbered just as the Blood Mastiff did. After a quick inspection, Meng Hao came to the conclusion that it would wake up in a few months. With that, he paid it no more attention. Then, it was with great excitement that he quickly gathered up the shed skin which had exploded moments before.</p><br/><p>The shed skin was extremely tough. Even with Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base, he had no way of breaking even a single piece. Since it had come from the meat jelly, Meng Hao considered it to be a magical item. Not having time to examine it in detail, he had put it away and then walked out of the Immortal\u2019s Cave.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Meng Hao and Bai Yunlai to reach the valley which connected the East Pill Division and the Violet Qi Division. Waiting for them there was an arrogant looking young man, who currently had his hands clasped behind his back and was looking up into the sky.</p><br/><p>This was Ding Yong. He wore a red-colored robe, which flashed in the sunlight, and actually emitted a violet aura. The year Meng Hao had joined the Violet Fate Sect, he had learned that regardless of East Pill Division or Violet Qi Division, violet-colored Qi was to be treated with respect. Therefore, even though this young man didn\u2019t wear the violet robes of a Conclave disciple, the fact that his clothes emitted a violet aura indicated that he had a very high position within the sect. He was Chosen of the Violet Fate Sect.</p><br/><p>His Cultivation base was at the peak of mid Foundation Establishment, just a hair from the next level.</p><br/><p>When Ding Yong saw Meng Hao, he frowned and said, \u201cSo you\u2019re Fang Mu?\u201d In his opinion, the older a master alchemist, the better. To him, Meng Hao was obviously much too young.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao frowned coldly, stopping in place. During his time with Li Tao, he had grown accustomed to how the man handled himself in front of the Inner Sect disciples. The position of master alchemist was one that inherently demanded respect. However, it also required a bit of personal effort to earn that respect. If you set the bar too low, then others would assume your skill was lacking.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he stood in place, then flicked his sleeve and let out a cold snort.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yunlai,\u201d he said coolly, \u201cfrom now on, there\u2019s no need to seek me out for such pill concocting matters as this.\u201d Without another look at Ding Yong, he turned and began to walk off.</p><br/><p>Bai Yunlai often worked with master alchemists, and he was also very familiar with Meng Hao. How could he not understand what was happening? Feeling secretly pleased, he allowed horror to cover his face. Then he stared accusatorially at the target of Meng Hao\u2019s little tactic, Ding Yong, who stood there gaping.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a master alchemist of the East Pill Division, it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s young. He placed number one in the last promotion examination! Think about it! Out of one hundred thousand apprentice alchemists, only one was selected. You\u2026 Ai, you don\u2019t know how long I begged Alchemist Fang to come before he agreed. And here you\u2026.\u201d Shaking his head, he turned to chase after Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Ding Yong laughed bitterly, then sighed. He was not like Qian Shuihen and Lu Song, who had been able to leave the Sect to gain experience. But how could he not see the way Meng Hao carried himself? When he thought about Bai Yunlai\u2019s words, he realized that this Fang Mu\u2019s skill in alchemy must be significant. After a moment\u2019s thought, a smile appeared on his face, and he walked forward a few steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe grand name of Alchemist Fang has long since reverberated like thunder within my ears,\u201d he said. \u201cJust now when I saw how young Alchemist Fang is, I was so shocked that I made a slip of the tongue. Alchemist Fang, please don\u2019t take offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stopped again, then turned to looked Ding Yong in the eye coldly. \u201cWhat pill do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Yong\u2019s eyes glittered. Seeing Meng Hao speak in such a manner led him to believe that he must be a person with a relatively short temper. He quickly said, \u201cBarrier Breaking Pill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever, without the slightest bit of change. Seeing this, Ding Yong came the conclusion that he was obviously very worldly wise and eccentric. Actually, Meng Hao was currently frantically searching through his memory. Unfortunately, he had no information regarding Barrier Breaking Pills.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are at least seventeen pill formulas for that type of pill,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cFurthermore, there are hundreds of types of medicinal herbs that can be used, along with many complicated variations, three hundred ninety seven to be precise. The refinement process requires delicate adjustments, which further adds seventy percent to the total possible variations. Which particular version do you want concocted?\u201d In truth, his words were a complete fabrication. Next to him Bai Yunlai gasped; actually, he too had been wondering what a Barrier Breaking Pill was. Hearing Meng Hao\u2019s words caused a look of admiration to appear in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The way it looked to him, the words seemed to come from a perspective of extreme comprehension. At least, that was the feeling he got.</p><br/><p>It seemed even Bai Yunlai had been duped. Naturally, Ding Yong stared in shock for a moment before a bright glow appeared in his eyes. Meng Hao\u2019s words struck him as being profoundly enigmatic. He took a deep breath, then clasped hands and bowed. Avoiding any careless words, he said, \u201cAlchemist Fang, to be honest, I\u2019m not really sure which type. I just have one pill formula, perhaps\u2026 you could take a look, sir?\u201d He quickly retrieved a jade slip from his bag of holding which he offered to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Were Ding Yong not within the Sect, he might not be so easily bluffed. However, they were inside the Violet Fate Sect, and Meng Hao was a fellow Sect member. Furthermore, he knew that Meng Hao was a master alchemist who had the upper hand. Therefore, Meng Hao\u2019s words truly had the desired effect.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao accepted the jade slip expressionlessly, and then scanned it with Spiritual Sense. His face was the same as always, but inwardly, he was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, there really is such a medicinal pill. The Barrier Breaking Pill can actually only be consumed twice in a lifetime. If consumed a third time, instant death will result!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe interactions of various medicinal plants, as well as the addition of various toxic vegetation, will create an explosive mixture that will stimulate the Qi passageways and give the Cultivation base the ability to break through a bottleneck!\u201d Meng Hao was silent for a moment as he thought.</p><br/><p>Next to him, Ding Yong watched on nervously. He had previously consumed one Barrier Breaking Pill. Unfortunately, at the very last critical moment, he had failed to break through. Now he only had one chance left. The worst of it all was that over the past years he had somehow managed to offend all the Furnace Lords and master alchemists. Even if one of them agreed, he wouldn\u2019t feel at ease with the results. He was still hesitant. To Fang Mu, this was a simple pill concoction. But to him, it represented his very, very last chance.</p><br/><p>If he succeeded, he would be able to enter late Foundation Establishment. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t help but be cautious.</p><br/><p>In reality, even after choosing to seek out Fang Mu, he still hadn\u2019t completely made up his mind about the matter. He still wanted to feel the situation out, then make a decision based on his feeling at the time. He desired a reliable master alchemist to concoct this crucially important pill. Ding Yong was no Outer Sect disciple. He knew very clearly that the medicinal strength of any given pill would be different depending on who concocted it. Some people produced pills with high strength, others low. As far as Ding Yong was concerned, the medicinal strength of this Barrier Breaking Pill was crucially important.</p><br/><p>The pill he had consumed previously had been of ordinary medicinal strength. Had it not, he wouldn\u2019t be here today, sighing as he was.</p><br/><p>A long moment passed, before Meng Hao returned the jade slip. He muttered to himself for a moment before walking up to Ding Yong.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaise your hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding Yong gaped for a moment, and his eyes narrowed. However, he didn\u2019t refuse. He lifted his hand up, whereupon Meng Hao clasped his wrist and began to send a bit of spiritual power into him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t resist,\u201d he said coolly. He poured the spiritual power of Qi Condensation into Ding Yong, who looked hesitant as he stared at Meng Hao. However, he allowed the spiritual power to circulate fully through his body.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao quickly became certain which level of medicinal strength was required of the pill that Ding Yong needed to break through his bottleneck. Meng Hao had also detected some other complex medicinal powers within Ding Yong\u2019s body. Those medicinal powers seemed to contain remnants of the Qi of the medicinal plants from the first Barrier Breaking Pill he had consumed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already consumed one Barrier Breaking Pill,\u201d said Meng Hao, retracting his spiritual power.</p><br/><p>Hearing Meng Hao\u2019s words caused Ding Yong to take a deep breath. His eyes shined brightly as he looked at Meng Hao, shocked. He had never told anybody that he had previously consumed a Barrier Breaking Pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will help you concoct this pill,\u201d said Meng Hao calmly. \u201cPrepare six sets of the medicinal plants required to make the Barrier Breaking Pill. In addition, I require thirty thousand Spirit Stones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already found a few master alchemists who can make this pill\u2026\u201d said Ding Yong slowly. \u201cThe most they asked for was three sets of ingredients and ten thousand Spirit Stones.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guarantee that my pill will enable you to break through,\u201d Meng Hao replied coolly. His tone was calm, but there also existed potent air within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious?!\u201d gasped Ding Yong, his eyes flashing brightly. He had long since come to the conclusion that this Alchemist Fang Mu was very different from the other master alchemists.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then never mind,\u201d said Meng Hao, turning to leave.</p><br/><p>Ding Yong\u2019s heart twisted. It only took a moment for a determined look to break out on his face. Seeing how different Fang Mu was from the others, and how he had been able to detect his previous consumption of the Barrier Breaking Pill, caused him to make up his mind. Without any further hesitation, he produced a bag of holding and quickly put the required medicinal plants and Spirit Stones inside. He handed it to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn two weeks, at twilight, you may come collect your pill,\u201d said Meng Hao. With the flick of a sleeve, he left with Bai Yunlai, his black gown fluttering in the breeze. A scholarly aura swirled around him, as did the faint scent of medicinal pills. He seemed otherworldly.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Joseph Gange</em></p><br/><p></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><ol><li><span id=\"footnote-1\">Ding Yong\u2019s name in Chinese is  D\u012bng y\u01d2ng - Ding is a common surname that has many meanings.

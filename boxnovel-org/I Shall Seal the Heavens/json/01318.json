Immediately, the golden-armored Outsider Dao Sovereign lurched to a halt in midair, face flickering!</p><br/><p>Then, Meng Hao\u2019s energy ignited, and the copper mirror flickered out, transforming into the Battle Weapon, which Meng Hao slashed down viciously!</p><br/><p>As the rumbling sounds echoed out, the Outsider Dao Sovereign felt a sensation of intense crisis explode up inside of him. He could sense that even though he was a Dao Sovereign, he was still only an inch away from death.</p><br/><p>He had been prepared for Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense, and had quickly suppressed it. However, he had never imagined that Meng Hao\u2019s proficiencies would include things other than divine sense!</p><br/><p>The current attack which was being leveled against him seemed as shocking as a lightning bolt from the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!!\u201d howled the golden-armored Outsider Dao Sovereign. Ignoring whatever injuries might result, ignoring the pain of the organs inside his body being crushed and his qi passageways shattering, he burst out with power to lunge backward by three meters!</p><br/><p>The glittering glow of a blade then passed right by him!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on top of the Eighth Mountain, another shocking battle was beginning. An illusory figure shot past the celestial pond, and as it did, it glanced down at the Xuanwu turtle, grinned coldly, and waved a hand. Instantly, the Xuanwu turtle\u2019s howls shook the entire Eighth Mountain.</p><br/><p>The figure\u2019s pupils constricted slightly, but it shot past the celestial pond nonetheless, heading directly toward the temple beyond. As it neared, it approached the door and prepared to barge in. And yet, almost immediately, it fell back.</p><br/><p>In that moment, the door exploded into pieces that spiralled out like countless sharp blades, transforming into an explosive rain that surged toward the illusory figure.</p><br/><p>Then, a tall man emerged from within the shattered remnants of the temple door. He wore a breathtaking suit of armor, and as soon as he emerged, he unleashed a fist strike that could shake Heaven and Earth. The void in the area suddenly solidified, forcing that illusory figure to actually appear in person. It was none other than the Outsider Dao Sovereign who had split himself into five incarnations.</p><br/><p>The person who had forced him to appear was, of course, none other than Meng Hao\u2019s grandfather, the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it turns out you really were telling the truth, Senior Outsider,\u201d murmured Grandpa Meng, clearly speaking only to himself. \u201cI awoke from slumber on the very day my grandson rose to prominence, the same day... that the starry sky shattered and the 1st Heaven descended.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like he planned this entire situation all along.... Or perhaps the Fang and Meng Clans are just one piece of the bigger picture...\u201d When he looked up at the Outsider, his eyes flickered with killing intent, and he began to run forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat armor is that?!\u201d the Outsider said, face falling. \u201cDammit... that armor... what is it with that armor?!?!\u201d He once again backed up in retreat, but he wasn\u2019t as fast as Grandpa Meng. The Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea shot forward and unleashed a punch!</p><br/><p>A boom rang out as the Outsider tumbled away like a kite with its string cut, blood spraying out of his mouth. He flew back for 5,000 kilometers before finally grinding to a halt, his face flickering with shock as Grandpa Meng once again appeared directly in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, you think I'm afraid of you or something?!\u201d the Outsider Dao Sovereign growled through clenched teeth. Suddenly, he began to grow. In the blink of an eye, he was 300 meters tall, with a long tail that shattered the starry sky as it whipped toward the Lord of the Eighth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>Similar battles began to play out on the First, Second, Third, and Ninth Mountains. Compared to the battles being fought on the first three of those mountains, the one on the Ninth Mountain was especially strange.</p><br/><p>The Outsider\u2019s clone was simply hovering above the mountain, not moving. In front of him floated a huge eye, and the two of them were staring at each other as they fought a battle of divine will!</p><br/><p>Furthermore... it appeared as if the Lord of the Ninth Mountain and Sea, Ji Tian was actually... attempting to possess the Outsider Dao Sovereign\u2019s clone!</p><br/><p>At the same time, countless battles had broken out within the Nine Mountains and Seas. The cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm were fighting back savagely against the Outsiders. Virtually all of the Dao Realm fighters had appeared, and massive booms filled the entire Mountain and Sea Realm. Almost the entire Realm was a battlefield now!</p><br/><p>The will of the Mountain and Sea Realm continued to bolster the people with power, simultaneously maintaining the barrier that separated the other 32 Heavens from the 1st Heaven. The 1st Heaven was now trapped, unable to receive any aid from the other Outsiders.</p><br/><p>It was also continuing to maintain the pressure that pervaded the Mountain and Sea Realm, ensuring that any Outsider below a six Essences Dao Sovereign was significantly weakened!</p><br/><p>The battle raged, causing both roars and screams to echo out into the vast expanse.</p><br/><p>Back in the Eighth Mountain and Sea, Meng Hao\u2019s Battle Weapon glittered like the sun and moon as it slashed toward the golden-armored Outsider Dao Sovereign.</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed out of the Outsider\u2019s mouth as the armor covering his chest shattered, and a huge wound appeared. A will of extermination poured into him, provoking an enraged roar. However, fear welled up in his heart; if he hadn\u2019t paid an extreme price to avoid the attack just now, thus losing the initiative, he would definitely have been killed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao frowned, then waved his hand, causing numerous mountains to appear. A rift was torn open in the void, and the Blood Demon emerged, roaring, and the Essence of Divine Flame converged and shot toward the Outsider.</p><br/><p>However, all of those things were distractions. The true killing blow was coming from Meng Hao\u2019s left hand, from which exploded the power of the Mountains and Seas!</p><br/><p>He was the future Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm, and at this moment a sliver of the power of the Mountains and Seas descended towards him, then transformed into a huge hand which grabbed out toward the Outsider Dao Sovereign.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao then transformed into a beam of light, hefting the Battle Weapon and then unleashing another attack. All of this conformed with Meng Hao\u2019s style of fighting... always attack!</p><br/><p>As the hand formed from the power of the Mountains and Seas descended upon the Outsider Dao Sovereign, his eyes widened. Suddenly, all of the scales on his body rose up, and he let out a howl. The scales then shattered, transforming into a windstorm of 6-Essences energy which exploded toward the power of the Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>Booming sounds rang out as the Mountain Consuming Incantation, the Blood Demon, and the Essence of Divine Flame all shot forward. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered with killing intent as he then waved his left finger.</p><br/><p>The Seventh Demon Sealing Hex!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Karma Threads appeared atop the golden-armored Outsider\u2019s head. They rapidly formed together into a sealing mark, which then crushed down onto him. At this point, Meng Hao performed another incantation gesture, unleashing the Sixth Demon Sealing Hex.</p><br/><p>The Sixth Hex was the Life-Death Hexing, which caused a gray magical symbol to appear on the Outsider\u2019s forehead. Then the magical symbol exploded, sending blood spraying out of his forehead. At the same time, however, a gleam of ridicule appeared in the Outsider\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>That look caused Meng Hao\u2019s heart to flicker with fear. Simultaneously, the Outsider Dao Sovereign spoke two words in a sinister voice!</p><br/><p>\u201cSelf Essence!\u201d Almost immediately, the six streams of Essence power within the tempest merged together into one. A black sea of flames then rumbled out in all directions.</p><br/><p>The tiny bit of power from the Mountain and Sea Realm faded away within the black sea of flames. The mountains melted, and the image of the Blood Demon dissipated. Then, the black flames took shape into an enormous creature, something like a lizard, which howled as it charged toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>It was a moment of critical danger. Roaring, Meng Hao viciously attacked the flame lizard with his Battle Weapon. Meng Hao was like a bug compared to his gigantic opponent. However, his powerful Battle Weapon instantly slashed down onto its head, slicing it open!</p><br/><p>A shriek rang out. However, this black flame lizard was formed from the Essence of Self, and was so powerful that it was only seriously injured and not killed.</p><br/><p>The black flame lizard roared, ignoring the intense pain it was feeling as it attempted to consume Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao's eyes flickered, and the Battle Weapon vanished. In its place appeared Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, which he violently hurled out. Demon Weapon Lonelytomb transformed into a beam of Demonic light which pierced directly into the black flame lizard.</p><br/><p>The lizard shuddered, staring at Meng Hao for a moment before it suddenly exploded. However, that explosion caused a mountain of black flames to charge toward Meng Hao like 10,000 horses, instantly inundating him.</p><br/><p>Even as the flames enveloped him, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flashed from the sensation of intense deadly crisis. In that moment, the Lightning Cauldron suddenly flickered into being above his head. Electricity danced, and he suddenly switched places with a 5-Essences Outsider not too far off in the distance.</p><br/><p>That 5-Essences Outsider appeared exactly where Meng Hao had been, and didn't have time to react before the black sea of flames consumed it. A bloodcurdling scream lingered in the air as it was completely destroyed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Outsider Dao Sovereign coughed up a mouthful of blood as Meng Hao\u2019s Seventh and Sixth Hexes inflicted more damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!!\u201d he roared in extreme frustration. He was clearly far more powerful than Meng Hao, and yet after losing the initiative, he had suffered setback after setback.</p><br/><p>Even as he roared, he flickered into motion. The black sea of flames recoiled into itself, once again turning into a lizard, although it was much weaker than last time.</p><br/><p>The black flame lizard threw its head back and roared, then eyed Meng Hao with a deadly gaze as it charged forward in attack.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sighed inwardly, knowing that he had lost the initiative.</p><br/><p>Without the slightest hesitation, he shot backward, unwilling to tangle any further with this Outsider Dao Sovereign. Based on the current level of his cultivation base, turning an extended battle into a victory would be very difficult.</p><br/><p>Even though his Hexing magic could suppress his opponent temporarily, now that he would be expecting it, the Hexing magic wouldn\u2019t be of much use. The best way to use the Hexing magic was in a surprise attack; furthermore, the backlash for using it against someone so powerful was something he could only endure one or two times. More than that would leave him seriously injured.</p><br/><p>As he retreated, the Outsider Dao Sovereign threw his head back and let out an enraged roar as he gave chase. He wanted to kill Meng Hao more than he ever had before. Furthermore, the humiliation he felt from having nearly died just now ensured that he would not underestimate Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Quite the opposite, in fact. He was now more vigilant than before. By now, magical items were swirling around him which would prevent Meng Hao from using the Eighth Hex on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink you can just leave?\u201d the Outsider Dao Sovereign roared, eyes gleaming with killing intent. As one of the two Dao Sovereigns of the 1st Heaven, he had an incredibly high position. If he couldn\u2019t kill Meng Hao, it would be a complete and utter embarrassment!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

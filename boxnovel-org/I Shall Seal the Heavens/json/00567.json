From a distance, this part of the mountain looked sharp and pointed, but in actuality, it was flat.</p><br/><p>It was like a large square, surrounded by nine huge cauldrons, all covered with fissures. In the direct center of it all was a wooden coffin. The coffin was lidless, and was carved, not with magical symbols, but with ancient depictions of auspicious clouds and beasts. There were also mountains and rivers, even a vast starry sky.</p><br/><p>At first glance, the carvings seemed very complicated, but after closer inspection one could find simplicity within the complexity.</p><br/><p>It gave one an indescribable feeling of both contradiction and harmony.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao approached the coffin and, nearing the side of, looked down inside. It was empty. There was no corpse. No remains. Nothing.</p><br/><p>There was no host body here.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, only eighty breaths of time remained until the opening of the Second Plane. Meng Hao stood next to the coffin and looked down silently at the emptiness. Then he sighed.</p><br/><p>It would be impossible for him to say that he wasn\u2019t disappointed. He had abandoned the Inner Sect disciple host body provided by Fang Yu. He had stuck with his own ideas, and the brutal reality made it so that he could only sigh and stand there with complex emotions filling his heart.</p><br/><p>Silently, he turned his gaze to the scene below the mountain. There were now only seventy breaths of time left. There was no way he would be able to find another suitable corpse now. On his way here, he found that about halfway up the mountain, there were absolutely no corpses to be seen.</p><br/><p>From his vantage point atop the mountain, he could now see that the entire mountain was covered with dense restrictive spells. They were so tightly packed that it almost seemed as if the entire mountain were covered with one gigantic restrictive spell that would prevent anyone from reaching the top.</p><br/><p>Any one of the various restrictive spells would have completely destroyed Meng Hao had he even touched them. The sight of the densely packed spells caused Meng Hao to feel somewhat confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did I actually make it up here?\u201d It was the first time he had considered the question. During the journey up the mountain he hadn\u2019t really paid attention. The four hour trip up from the foot of the mountain had seemed relatively easy.</p><br/><p>Now that he looked back down, though, the entire mountain seemed like a forbidden zone that no one could even enter.</p><br/><p>He could see that it would take astonishing luck to be able to traverse a path successfully and not trigger even a single restrictive spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless there was someone that allowed me to come here\u2026.\u201d he thought, his eyes glittering. As of this moment, only thirty breaths of time remained. Meng Hao looked away from the fourth peak toward the temple on top of the distant first peak.</p><br/><p>According to what he remembered after waking up, he was now standing in the same position as the man he had seen. He looked off in the distance, his hair and robes fluttering gently in the wind.</p><br/><p>When only ten breaths of time remained, determination appeared in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou let me see you,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2026 allowed me to successfully reach the top of this mountain. Perhaps your identity isn\u2019t even important at this point.\u201d Five breaths of time remained. He turned and strode over to the coffin. After taking a deep breath, he crawled in calmly, laid down, and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Three breaths. Two breaths. One breath\u2026.</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!!!</p><br/><p>A massive rumbling sound suddenly filled the air of the ancient Demon Immortal Sect. It far exceeded the sound of thunder as it rolled about the entire world. Ripples suddenly spread out from the sky, covering everything as far as the eye could see.</p><br/><p>With the exception of Meng Hao, everyone else who had come to this world sat closed-eyed and cross-legged next to the various host bodies they had selected. When the ripples reached them, the corpses began to glow. Ghost images of both the host bodies and the Cultivators sprang up and then began to superimpose and merge together.</p><br/><p>As for Meng Hao, he lay there with his eyes closed. As the rumbling filled the sky, he lost consciousness. The ripples that spread out throughout the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane did not seem to affect him at all.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this moment that a white-robed man appeared, standing in exactly the same spot Meng Hao had just been standing, which was also the same spot Meng Hao had noticed when he awoke in the river of stars.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s hair was disheveled, and his long white robe was spattered with bloodstains. His hair covered his face, making it was impossible to see his facial features. The only thing that was possible to distinguish was that he was not a woman.</p><br/><p>As the wind blew, his hair lifted up a bit, revealing two ancient eyes filled with both perplexity and regret.</p><br/><p>The aura of decay that rose up from him seemed to fuse with that of the entire Primordial Demon Immortal Plane, making it impossible to distinguish between the two.</p><br/><p>The man looked over in the direction of the fifth peak. His eyes awash with memories of the past, he softly said, \u201cNight\u2026 let him in, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the words left his mouth, the entire ancient Demon Immortal Sect trembled.</p><br/><p>A droning voice suddenly echoed out. It sounded almost as if it weren\u2019t awake, like the words were spoken by someone who was dreaming. \u201cThat does not conform with the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is the only person to see me after all these years. Perhaps it is some destined Karma. Allow him\u2026 to represent me in the past. Allow him to speak those words to the old man\u2026 the words that I didn\u2019t understand how to say back then.\u201d The white-robed man\u2019s voice was hoarse, and his eyes were warm. However, within that warmth was an ancient thoughtfulness, a yearning and deep regret that he clearly could not free himself from.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping those words buried in my heart for ninety thousand years already,\u201d the old man said softly.</p><br/><p>The entire world was quiet for a very long moment. Finally, the droning voice could be heard once again. The sound of the voice rose and fell like the waves of the ocean. \u201cHe has no identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive him my identity,\u201d replied the white-robed man.</p><br/><p>The world once again went silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake time pass back into that year\u2026.\u201d The white-robed man closed his eyes, covering over the pain that lay inside. Unfortunately, he was not able to cover the sorrow and longing within in his heart.</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!!!</p><br/><p>Each bit of light in the world suddenly came from all directions to pour into Meng Hao. He gradually grew transparent, and then disappeared. In that instant, a huge sound, like endless thunder, echoed about.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a warm glow spread out to fill the entire ancient Demon Immortal Sect. Suddenly, a new world became visible within the glow, a world that was a memory of ancient times!</p><br/><p>The manner in which Meng Hao vanished was entirely different from that of the other Cultivators from the lands of South Heaven. All of them fused with host bodies whereas Meng Hao\u2026 actually entered the Second Plane with his own body!</p><br/><p>The others were merely borrowing the identity of someone else. As for Meng Hao\u2026 he was not borrowing another identity. He was acquiring it!</p><br/><p>Borrowing and acquiring are two very different things.</p><br/><p>As the light spread out to fill the ancient Demon Immortal Sect, the white-haired man stood in place, back toward the first peak, just like before. What he saw in his mind\u2019s eye was an old man, looking at him with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p><em>I can see in your eyes that you will forgive me of anything, forgive for any mistakes I make. It\u2019s as if you are always watching over me, waiting to silently correct all of my blunders.</em></p><br/><p><em>Back then, if I made a mistake, one word of criticism from you would send me into a rage.</em></p><br/><p><em>Back then, I ran amok with the silkpants and acted tyrannically. I never saw the wrinkles in the corners of your eyes, nor the look of disappointment in your gaze. [1. \u201cSilkpants\u201d is a term in Chinese similar to \u201csilver spoon\u201d in English. It refers to spoiled rich kids]</em></p><br/><p><em>Back then, I unhesitatingly gave a precious Sect treasure to a woman, but didn't notice that your once proud head was now bowed in shame toward the rest of the Sect.</em></p><br/><p><em>Back then, I would polish my sword to flaunt my identity. I never noticed that you had suddenly grown old.</em></p><br/><p><em>Finally one day, you passed away in meditation. Your body turned into ash. I cried. My heart broke. My world was gone. Heaven and Earth were no more. Father\u2026 you were gone.</em></p><br/><p><em>I can see your aged face, and I can see how you doted upon me. I can see that throughout all the years, it didn\u2019t matter what mistakes I made, you always forgave me. I realize now that\u2026 I have always owed you a certain commitment. I have always owed you\u2026 some special words.</em></p><br/><p><em>Those words, have been waiting with me for ninety thousand years.</em></p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>The sky in ancient times was blue.</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was that blue sky. Then he saw white cranes flying about. Auspicious beasts circled about in the air. A din of conversation and activity could be heard everywhere, echoing about.</p><br/><p>He saw countless enormous pillars of light rising up into the sky. Everything was bright and colorful.</p><br/><p>Beams of light shot through the air in all directions.</p><br/><p>Off in the distance was a mountain. It was green and full of life and vigor. It was at this point that Meng Hao suddenly heard an ancient voice ringing out to fill the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI give a sermon regarding the Dao every ten thousand years. This time, I will speak to you of a legend. The legend tells of a true spirit whose name is Night. When he closes his eyes to sleep, the world is his dream. When he opens his eyes, he awakens from the dream. Heaven and Earth are boundless\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ancient voice slowly grew softer. It seemed as if it was only a murmuring in the ear, but at the same time, echoing throughout the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime is like a dream. It\u2019s impossible to tell what is true and what is false. When you dream, you see others. Perhaps in the world of others, the dream version of you appears.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr perhaps our lives are like an invisible bubble that could pop at any time, and cause us to awaken. Who dreams of you, and who you dream of\u2026 this is truly a difficult riddle to explain\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of a young woman could suddenly be heard in Meng Hao\u2019s ears. \u201cEldest Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice sounded both astonished and anxious. \u201cEldest Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through Meng Hao\u2019s body, as if his soul were suddenly returning from outside. When it slammed into him, he felt as if he were being torn apart. Pain pulsed through him, and ghost images sprang up everywhere.</p><br/><p>He panted as the sensation went on for the space of several breaths. When it vanished, the sky was blue again, and the world\u2026 once again appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother, what are you doing?!\u201d In front of Meng Hao stood a young woman wearing a long, pink garment. Her eyes were wide and filled with confusion. She appeared to be both puzzled and also furious as she looked at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>He looked down at himself. He was wearing a white robe and had long hair, and was seated cross-legged on top of an altar that was located at the peak of a mountain. He was surrounded by nine cauldrons, from which green smoke slowly ascended.</p><br/><p>This was the very top of the Fourth Peak!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind trembled. Although his head was filled with splitting pain, his eyes shone brightly. As of this moment he knew that he\u2026 had entered the Second Plane. What caused him the most shock, however, was that he actually\u2026 had not lost his memories the way Fang Yu said would happen.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, a voice suddenly rang out in his mind, announcing his identity as clear as day.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe Jiusi\u2026 of the Fourth Peak\u2026 one of the seven Elite Apprentices of the Demon Immortal Sect!\u201d [2.

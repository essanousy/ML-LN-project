I only request... that you get me inside. Once there, we can part ways, and I\u2019ll go off on my own to search for my good fortune!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my choice, so whether I live or die has nothing to do with you, Brother Meng. I won\u2019t infect your Karma. I, Yuwen Jian... just want a chance to search for my path of good fortune!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I live, fine. If I die, fine.... I was born in the Mountain and Sea Realm, and I grew up in it. I\u2019ll give my blood, my cultivation, everything about me... to repay that debt!\u201d Yuwen Jian\u2019s bitter smile was tinged with madness. The things he had seen and experienced recently in the Seventh Mountain and Sea were hundreds of times more tragic than what Meng Hao had seen so far.</p><br/><p>He had witnessed three planets destroyed, and had watched as innumerable lives were ended. He saw one sect after another exterminated, wiped out by the Outsiders.</p><br/><p>He had even seen people being eaten alive.</p><br/><p>Out of all his family, his clan, and his sect... he was the only survivor. Therefore, he now lived for revenge!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked silently at Yuwen Jian for a moment, then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust keep up,\u201d he said. Then he transformed into a beam of light that shot off into the distance. Clearly, he was choosing, not to sneak in, but to fight his way through in broad daylight.</p><br/><p>After all, this was the Mountain and Sea Realm, not the Outsiders\u2019 1st Heaven!</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>The instant Meng Hao charged forth and began to fight, Yuwen Jian rapidly began to grow larger in size. Apparently there was a bit of God blood inside of him, pumping through his veins, leading to a shocking growth in fleshly body power. Astonishingly, it took only an instant for Yuwen Jian to turn into a huge giant that took a step forward, following Meng Hao into the fray.</p><br/><p>Two men, two Echelon cultivators, two beams of light, shot forth like unsheathed swords. Rumbling sounds echoed out as the two of them stabbed into the Outsiders\u2019 spell formation.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s cultivation base was so powerful that only Dao Sovereigns could hope to stand up to him. In the moment that he began to fight, vast numbers of Outsiders began to pour out from the black cubes and charge toward him in attack.</p><br/><p>At the same time, shocking fluctuations began to emanate from the cubes as streams of divine sense sped forth to attack him.</p><br/><p>Further off in the distance were three Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering 5-Essences auras that instantly veered toward Meng Hao to block his path.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gave a cold harrumph. Killing intent flickered in his eyes as he looked at the hosts of the incoming Outsiders, with their vicious expressions and murderous auras. Waving his sleeve, he summoned the Paragon Bridge, which crushed down onto them.</p><br/><p>Instantly, bloodcurdling screams rang out, and the starry sky around Meng Hao shattered. This one single attack crushed everything in its path.</p><br/><p>No less than a thousand Outsiders were instantly smashed, their fleshly bodies shattered, their Nascent Divinities destroyed.</p><br/><p>All of the other Outsiders who witnessed this gasped, and their faces fell. Instantly, they began to back up in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cDao... Dao Sovereign!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! In the Mountain and Sea Realm, Dao Sovereigns are supposed to be as rare as phoenix feathers or qilin horns. How could there be one here!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy haven't the two exalted Dao Sovereigns from our 1st Heaven come to stop this person!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shocked Outsiders were so terrified that they didn\u2019t dare to get any closer. In fact, they backed up to let him pass. As for Yuwen Jian, even though he had an incredibly high opinion of Meng Hao, and had even seen what he did earlier to the Outsiders attacking Planet Tiger Cage, witnessing this left him shocked.</p><br/><p>Looking at Meng Hao\u2019s back as he led the way, Yuwen Jian realized that although he wasn't necessarily physically imposing... there was something spectacular about him.</p><br/><p>It was as if... the war for the Mountain and Sea Realm... might not necessarily end with them being wiped out!</p><br/><p>However, even as the Outsider cultivators backed up, the streams of divine will emanating from the hundreds of black cubes came together into a shocking convergence that blasted toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>This amalgamation of divine will was so powerful that even Dao Sovereigns who encountered it would likely shy away in fear. It transformed into an enormous face which filled the starry sky and lunged toward Meng Hao as if to consume him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if you\u2019re a Dao Sovereign, screw off!!\u201d The voice which shouted out was not the voice of a single Outsider, but rather the conjoined voices of hundreds of them!</p><br/><p>The sound of it echoed out, rocking the starry sky, causing the void to tremble, and crushing down with a will of complete defiance.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d screamed the conjoined voices of the Outsiders. As for all of the other Outsiders who were observing from off to the side, their eyes began to glow brightly as they waited for Meng Hao\u2019s momentum to be broken, and for him to be forced backward.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was calm, but his eyes flickered coldly. It was at this point that his own divine sense exploded out toward the face converged from divine will.</p><br/><p>His divine sense transformed into a huge fist which punched out viciously!</p><br/><p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p><br/><p>The fist slammed into the face, shattering it into pieces, and causing a boom to ring out that shook Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Cracking sounds rang out as fissures snaked out through the starry sky. They were like dragons shooting out in all directions, and when they hit the Outsiders, screams rose up. There was no chance for the Outsiders to flee, and many of them were instantly ripped apart.</p><br/><p>At the same time, miserable shrieks echoed out from the hundreds of black cubes. Rumbling sounds could be heard as each and every one of the black cubes shattered, and the Outsider cultivators inside were eradicated.</p><br/><p>From a distance, the scene which was playing out was completely and utterly shocking!</p><br/><p>More gasps could be heard as the surviving Outsiders fell back even further, so terrified of Meng Hao that they were shaking. Before they had come to the Mountain and Sea Realm, they had viewed themselves as above everyone, and looked down derisively at the Mountain and Sea Realm. They couldn\u2019t wait for the chance to start slaughtering the Immortals for fun.</p><br/><p>But after seeing Meng Hao\u2019s terrifying performance, memories from their ancestors were slowly being unlocked inside of them, memories that had been sealed within their bones, hidden within their souls.</p><br/><p>Memories of how their ancestors had been conquered by the Paragon Immortal Realm.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was cold as he looked around. Due to the sheer number of Outsiders present, it would be difficult to kill them all, even with the current level of his cultivation base. However, as he glanced about, all of the Outsiders upon whom his gaze fell backed up, trembling.</p><br/><p>He snorted coldly, advancing again, and no one dared to get in his way this time. They all fell back to make way for him. However, as he passed by, they would form ranks once again behind him. It was almost like Meng Hao was surrounded by a huge circle of empty space.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that he was clearly surrounded, the ones who were terrified were the Outsiders, not him.</p><br/><p>Yuwen Jian followed directly behind Meng Hao. The scene which he was watching unfold in front of his eyes had his blood pumping.</p><br/><p>Glancing around coldly as he proceeded along, Meng Hao eventually caught sight of a dilapidated altar up ahead. It looked ancient, as if it had survived through countless years of time, leaving it corroded and falling apart.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t complete; only about seventy percent of its original structure remained. And yet, the starry sky around it rippled and distorted, emanating fluctuations that contained incredible pressure.</p><br/><p>Gradually, it became obvious that this altar... was an entrance, leading to some other dimension beyond.</p><br/><p>It was clear that previously, the altar had not been out in the open like this. Various restrictive spells and other obstacles had obviously been in place. However, after the Outsiders arrived, they had cleared the area, leaving the altar hovering out in the open in the starry sky.</p><br/><p>In front of the altar were three Outsider cultivators with grim faces. They hovered there, staring at Meng Hao, emanating fluctuations of the 5-Essences level.</p><br/><p>Although they were a far cry from a Mountain and Sea Lord, they were close to the level of the boy Xiao Yihan.</p><br/><p>They looked on with flickering eyes as Meng Hao approached. The one in the middle had a horn jutting out of his head, and if you looked closely you could see that it wasn\u2019t black, but violet.</p><br/><p>He took a step forward, and then it became clear that he did not have the same murderous aura that the other Outsiders did. He clasped hands and bowed to Meng Hao, saying, \u201cI am Long Daozi, of the Dao Tribe of the 1st Heaven. Greetings, Dao Sovereign Meng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked back coldly. The fact that this person knew who he was came as no surprise. In the initial moments of the invasion, he had clashed with the Outsider Paragon Eegoo of the 1st Heaven. Although most people in the Mountain and Sea Realm had not been able to see what happened, the Outsider experts certainly were watching, and had seen the events unfold.</p><br/><p>The violet-horned Outsider\u2019s eyes shone with a strange light as he slowly began to speak. \u201cDao Sovereign Meng, based on your cultivation base and powers of perception, you are certainly aware that the Mountain and Sea Realm... cannot possibly win this war. Even if the 1st Heaven isn\u2019t a match for the Mountain and Sea Realm, there is a 2nd Heaven, and a 3rd Heaven, and in the end, 33 Heavens. There is no hope for the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we 33 Heavens wish to destroy all life in the Mountain and Sea Realm, we also respect the powerful experts here. Fellow Daoist Meng, if you would agree to follow the orders of the 1st Heaven, to join us in our campaign, then I can guarantee the safety of you and your clan, and can promise that you won\u2019t be harmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cA wise man submits to the circumstances. Fellow Daoist Meng, surely you understand the truth of that old saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only can your clan be saved, but anyone else you wish can join us as well. The 1st Heaven won\u2019t kill them. All you need to do is become a Dao slave of the 1st Heaven.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompared to freedom... what meaning is there in death?\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to his words, Yuwen Jian remained silent. Although he trusted Meng Hao, the offer made by this Outsider was something that would stir even his heart, albeit only a bit.</p><br/><p>After all, he had no clan left. He had nothing. However, back when his clan and sect had still existed, if he had been given this choice, he couldn't be sure what he would have chosen. That line of thinking caused a spark of fear to rise up within him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

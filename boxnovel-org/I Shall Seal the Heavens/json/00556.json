He could tell that some undetectable transformation had occurred to his seven Nascent Souls and seven totems.</p><br/><p>As to whether the transformation was good or bad, it was impossible for him to tell. However, he had the faint sensation that it had caused him to take a first step down the true path of seven Nascent Souls.</p><br/><p>Actually, up to now, whenever he entered the Seventh Anima, the seven Nascent Souls in his body appeared to be unhampered by anything. Obviously, he could enter the Seventh Anima and explode out with the power of sixty-four great circle Nascen Souls.</p><br/><p>In truth, though, he had to force them to fuse together, which he could accomplish only because of his profound foundation. The instability of the combination of the seven totems caused Meng Hao to become aware of his oversight. However, a strange, unfamiliar aura had emerged from his seven Nascent Soul totems, causing them to bind together. Now the solitary totem was stable.</p><br/><p>Somehow, Meng Hao was able to solve this problem that, in the future, would surely have led to great danger.</p><br/><p>Right now, though, he was in the middle of fighting Patriarch Huyan, and had little time to think about the matter. He put the matter to rest in his heart and then performed a double-handed incantation. Instantly, the solitary totem in front of him began to pulsate with a shocking aura.</p><br/><p>The totem had no shape, and was constantly changing. Sometimes it was big, sometimes small. The primordial chaos inside of it looked almost like droplets of water, but also like a sea of flames. It was blurry, and impossible to see clearly.</p><br/><p>However, the aura spreading out from within the blurriness only continued to grow more powerful.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Huyan was astonished, as were the streams of Divine Sense from the Patriarchs of the other Tribes.</p><br/><p>The instant the seven Nascent Soul totems combined, Patriarch Huyan\u2019s eyes flickered with shock. He once again drew circles in front of him, and then gestured forward sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe seven emotions are needed by the heart. But within the soul, there are only three types of emotion. Family love, friendship and romantic love. I severed family love, extinguished friendship, and cut off romantic love. From then on I was\u2026 emotionless!\u201d With that, the seven circles of emotion shattered, transforming into a blade.</p><br/><p>The blade was illusory, but was capable of extinguishing all types of life. Suddenly, the blade lifted high up into the air, and then descended down onto the solitary combination totem.</p><br/><p>The chopping blow was imbued with an aura that could conquer mountains and rivers. This blade... was a blade of emotionlessness! All of the cultivation that Patriarch Huyan had practiced in his entire life transformed into a Spirit Severing blade that could shake Heaven and Earth. The entire world seemed to disappear in the face of the resplendently glowing blade that shot toward Meng Hao\u2019s combination totem.</p><br/><p>The blade hit the totem. In the instant that they struck each other, an indistinct, unclear aura erupted out from the solitary totem. The aura caused all the wind and clouds in the area to stop moving. Everything up above and down below grew still.</p><br/><p>A strange, otherworldly feeling spread out with incredible intensity.</p><br/><p>When Patriarch Huyan sensed it, his heart filled with shock. This aura made him feel as if an incredible pressure was weighing down on him. His heart began to pound.</p><br/><p>The feeling came so quickly that he had no time to do anything. Nor was he prepared for it; his mind filled with roaring, and blood oozed out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>At the same time, cracks began to spread out across the blade that had chopped down onto the solitary totem. The cracks eventually joined together, and then a popping sound could be heard as the blade shattered into seven pieces that shot out in all directions.</p><br/><p>The seven pieces represented the seven emotions, and their shattering caused a tremor to run through Patriarch Huyan\u2019s body. He coughed up a huge mouthful of blood, and his face went pale. He staggered backward more than thirty meters, whereupon he looked up with a face full of shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>He had long since ceased to look down upon Meng Hao. However, it was only at this moment that he suddenly realized that he himself\u2026 still didn\u2019t fully understand Meng Hao. The sight of Meng Hao combining seven totems into one, and the resulting aura that erupted out, left Patriarch Huyan profoundly shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat totem is that?! What is that aura?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Patriarch Huyan who felt his heart trembling. Equally shaken were the other Spirit Severing Patriarchs who had gathered to watch the battle.</p><br/><p>One of those patriarchs was the red-robed boy from the great Cloud Sky Sect. His eyes shone with a strange light, and his stream of Divine Sense quivered. \u201cWhere did this guy come from?\u201d he thought. \u201cEven I would be shaken by that aura.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Spirit Severing Patriarchs from the great Wild Flame Tribe and the great Demon Butterfly Tribe made an undetectable mutual communication. As of now, they dispelled any notion of joining forces to make a sneak attack.</p><br/><p>The aura of Meng Hao\u2019s solitary totem was shocking, and they were unable to see through it.</p><br/><p>At the moment, Patriarch Huyan was in full retreat. Meng Hao\u2019s solitary totem gradually faded away. It wasn\u2019t destroyed by Patriarch Huyan; in fact, his blade hadn\u2019t hurt it even in the least.</p><br/><p>The reason it was fading was because, even in the Seventh Anima, Meng Hao was incapable of sustaining it for very long. At the most, it could last for the space of a handful of breaths. That was, in fact, a bit different from what he had estimated before actually combining the totems during this battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly three breaths of time!\u201d he sighed, his eyes shining.</p><br/><p>\u201cInternally, seven Nascent Souls combine, allowing me to enter the Seventh Anima. Externally, seven totems combine to form primordial chaos, my solitary totem!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlone, either the internal or the external change can be sustained for a long period of time. However\u2026 when both the internal and the external reach a peak simultaneously, it can only last for three breaths of time!</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring those three breaths, my battle prowess\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao was panting as he thought back to what he had experienced moments ago. However, just as quickly, he looked back at Patriarch Huyan.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Huyan was breathing deeply. As he shot backward, he tapped his right foot down into the air. A boom rattled out as he stopped in place, finally diffusing some of the recoil power in his body. He looked at Meng Hao and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Nascent Soul Cultivation base that can shake the Spirit Severing stage. If you had enough time, who knows, you might actually be able to achieve Immortal Ascension in South Heaven.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I will use all the power I possess to smash you to death. Regardless of whether or not I succeed, the process will give birth to Dao Fruit. I can enjoy that flavor even in the yellow springs.\u201d Patriarch Huyan laughed and slapped his chest.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The slap caused Patriarch Huyan\u2019s aura to explode out, growing more and more intense. His hair was no longer white, but black. His skin were no longer old, but rather sleek and smooth.</p><br/><p>He was now not an old man any more, but middle-aged, his countenance dignified. Then, his aura continued to become even more shocking. Now, he looked like a young man.</p><br/><p>His robe was black, his eyebrows sharp and slanted, and his eyes shone as brightly as the stars. As of this moment, Patriarch Huyan seemed to have recovered his youth. His aura was intense, capable of shaking the Heavens, causing everything to dim and a huge wind to kick up.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes narrowed as this indescribable, formless aura exploded out from Patriarch Huyan.</p><br/><p>The handful streams of Spirit Severing Divine Sense were now all looking at Patriarch Huyan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great circle of the First Severing!\u201d said the Spirit Severing Patriarch from the Wild Flame Tribe. He was a tall, stalwart old man, within whose eyes could be seen an expression of intense concentration.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch Huyan never reached the great circle before\u2026.\u201d said the red-robed boy from the great Cloud Sky Tribe. \u201cOh, I understand. He used the eradication of his Tribe to complete the great circle. How cold-blooded, this Huyan Yunming!\u201d Shocked, the boy looked at Patriarch Huyan with a frown.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the other Tribes in the Black Lands who were observing the goings-on, most of the Cultivators weren\u2019t able to tell the exact extent to which Patriarch Huyan\u2019s aura had grown. However, it was shocking to them nonetheless.</p><br/><p>In the great Cloud Sky Tribe, Zhou Dekun\u2019s eyes went wide and his heart began to beat nervously. After learning that Meng Hao had returned, he had felt happiness, but even more so, worry.</p><br/><p>In the great Demon Butterfly Tribe, Duo Lan sat quietly off to the side, gazing at Meng Hao. A stubborn gleam could be seen in her eyes. During the past more than one hundred years, she had learned a lot about Meng Hao. She was a Chosen, and although she hated to admit it, the distance between the two of them was vast.</p><br/><p>The moment in which Patriarch Huyan\u2019s Cultivation base exploded up to the great circle of the First Severing, everyone who was watching, be they Spirit Severing Patriarchs or Cultivators from other Tribes in the Black Lands, were thoroughly shaken.</p><br/><p>Within Meng Hao\u2019s eyes, a strong desire to battle was suddenly ignited.</p><br/><p>A moment later, though, he frowned.</p><br/><p>Deep within his bag of holding, he could sense the Demon Spirit emanating an intense teleportation power. It seemed that it could teleport him away at any moment.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao couldn\u2019t do anything about, but neither could he ignore it. He slapped his bag of holding, producing the blood-colored mask, which he slipped on his face. At the same time, the mastiff lifted its head up and howled. It transformed into a red beam of light which shot toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The red light fused into the mask, causing Meng Hao\u2019s robes to whip about and his hair to float up. His aura instantly burst out violently.</p><br/><p>Such eruption instantly caught the attention of the Spirit Severing Patriarchs, as well as all the observers from the other Tribes in the Black Lands.</p><br/><p>Amidst the roaring sound, Meng Hao\u2019s robes became blood red, as did his hair. A glow of blood surrounded him, and behind him, a red throne appeared. Seated there was a woman wearing a mask identical to Meng Hao\u2019s. As she became visible, she sat down coldly onto the throne.</p><br/><p>The Blood Immortal!</p><br/><p>In this moment the entire world was crimson. Even people who were merely watching the scene on a screen suddenly felt as if all the blood in their bodies wished to burst out.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked up, and an oppressive glow could be seen in his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

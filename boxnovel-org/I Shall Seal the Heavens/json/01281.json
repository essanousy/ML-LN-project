However, the first wave of invading cultivators immediately began to reinforce the rift between the two Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>That gap was how they could enter the Eighth Mountain and Sea, and as soon as they appeared, they began to set up numerous spell formations, almost like garrisons. They also attacked the rift itself in an attempt to open it wider.</p><br/><p>Even more impressively, a large group of Seventh Mountain and Sea cultivators joined forces to summon an enormous nine-headed dragon. It was pitch black, and when it roared into the gap, it began to grow in size, causing the rift to rip open wider and wider.</p><br/><p>Winds screamed, echoing out through the entire Eighth Mountain and Sea, carrying with them the voice of the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the great Sima Dao, Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea! Today... I declare war on the Eighth Mountain and Sea! All ye, shall either surrender, or die!\u201d His voice was as cold as ice as it rang out through the entirety of the Eighth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Lord of the Seventh Mountain and Sea would not leave his home Mountain and Sea at this time. He would wait until the majority of the warrior cultivators from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were deployed before making his appearance.</p><br/><p>However, he would most certainly call out... and declare war!</p><br/><p>His shocking words caused the Eighth Mountain and Sea to tremble. All cultivators and all sects heard him, and they were left in a state of shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis.... This....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seventh Mountain and Sea is invading!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Mountain and Sea War. A legendary Mountain and Sea War! I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s actually going to happen right now!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too sudden. How could this be happening? The Seventh Mountain and Sea is actually inciting a Mountain and Sea War. But we\u2019ve hardly had any dealings with them at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the Eighth Mountain and Sea was shocked, especially the Heavengod Alliance. Orders were immediately dispatched calling for everyone to assemble as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>The auxiliary branches of the Heavengod Alliance were included in that, as was the other of the Eighth Mountain and Sea\u2019s great clans, the Han Clan. Grand protective spell formations were activated, and all stations were manned.</p><br/><p>A great storm was coming!</p><br/><p>These preparations began in the very instant that the Seventh Mountain and Sea began to come through the rift. At the same time, back in the Meng Clan, the invading cultivators were cowering in front of Meng Hao. But then they sensed what was happening, and their expressions flickered with excitement and even joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cReinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea are coming!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! The Mountain and Sea War is about to begin. We\u2019re on the side of the Seventh Mountain and Sea, and they\u2019re definitely going to win the war!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou in the Meng Clan, war will soon be upon you! Why haven\u2019t you surrendered yet?!\u201d The shouts of the invading cultivators turned into sound waves that rolled out across the cultivators of the Meng Clan, including Grandma Meng and the five seriously injured Dao Realm Patriarchs. The Patriarchs\u2019 faces fell, completely draining of blood.</p><br/><p>As for the traitorous members of the Meng Clan, they threw their heads back and laughed uproariously. They sounded arrogant, and in very high spirits. They had just been quite cowed by Meng Hao, and now that the reinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea were on the way they had gained their confidence back. In their minds, the threat of Meng Hao was not so deadly now.</p><br/><p>They firmly believed that both the Meng Clan and Meng Hao would now be struck with indecision, an indecision which... would ensure their own safety.</p><br/><p>The invading cultivators weren\u2019t stupid. The first to fall back were the black-robed men from the Seventh Mountain and Sea. They knew that since reinforcements had come, they were already in the superior position. Since they could not wipe out the Meng Clan immediately, they needed to consider their own safety first.</p><br/><p>In their minds, since the Meng Clan was hesitating, it was the perfect chance to retreat. Certainly, the Meng Clan wouldn't dare to pursue them now.</p><br/><p>That was what the other invading sects were also thinking, as were the traitorous Meng Clan cultivators. Soon, everyone was falling back, preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>Actually, their predictions were completely correct. The Meng Clan cultivators, including the five Dao Realm Patriarchs, stood there silently, not daring to continue the fight or attempt to prevent their enemies from leaving. When they thought about the imminent Mountain and Sea War, and the arrival of reinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea, the entire Meng Clan was struck with stifling pressure.</p><br/><p>However, the invaders had miscalculated regarding one person in particular, and that was... Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say you people could leave?\u201d he said coolly, hovering there in the starry sky. The Meng Clan was worried about the Seventh Mountain and Sea, as was the Heavengod Alliance. Meng Hao, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t care less.</p><br/><p>The only people he cared about in the Eighth Mountain and Sea were his Grandmother and her people. Whether or not everyone else lived or died didn't have anything to do with him. Nor could he really do anything to stop what was happening. He knew that soon, a massive and shocking war would strike the Mountain and Sea Realm. The two ancient forces outside of the 33 Heavens were coming, and that war... was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>The words he had just spoken were like an icy wind that filled the invaders\u2019 hearts with shock. They looked back at him.</p><br/><p>A cold voice rang out from within the crowds, \u201cThe reinforcements from the Seventh Mountain and Sea are already here. You're going to have your hands full defending your Meng Clan, do you really think you can spare the effort to stop us from leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was calm as his eyes scanned the crowd.</p><br/><p>It only took a moment to find the cultivator who had just spoken, and the power in Meng Hao\u2019s gaze suddenly rocketed up. A moment later, the man exploded. Meng Hao then leaped forward, waving his hand to summon the howling Blood Demon, which instantly slashed into the enemy forces.</p><br/><p>The blackpod imps screeched as they began to unleash slaughter. The Blood Spirit and the mastiff also joined in, murderous auras raging.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had the gall to invade this place, so you won't be leaving. I don\u2019t really care about some war between the Eighth and Seventh Mountain and Sea, but I can tell you that I hate traitors.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether you are a traitor to your clan or a traitor to the Mountain and Sea in which you live, it's all the same.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s voice was cold as he once again waved his hand, unleashing his Ancient mana to summon numerous mountains, which began to descend from all directions.</p><br/><p>These mountains no longer surged with Immortal qi, but rather, had an ancient and archaic feel to them, as if they had existed for many, many years. These were ancient mountains, and as they appeared, they sent powerful ripples out into the starry sky.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked coldly out at the Meng Clan cultivators, including the five Patriarchs. When his gaze fell on those Patriarchs, they immediately began to tremble. \u201cMeng Clan,\u201d he roared, \u201cwhat are you doing standing there!? ATTACK!\u201d</p><br/><p>They had seen Meng Hao\u2019s terrifying Ancient Tribulation, had watched as Xiao Yihan fled on his heels, and had personally witnessed Meng Hao\u2019s horrifying power. Gritting their teeth, they decided to comply with his orders.</p><br/><p>Roaring, the five Patriarchs charged forward. \u201cCultivators of the Meng Clan. ATTACK! Slaughter all of the rebels and invaders!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other clan members hesitated for a moment, then joined voices in a powerful battle cry as they shot forward in attack.</p><br/><p>The battle resumed. However, this time, the Meng Clan was not in the weak position. Instead, the blood of the rebels and invaders flowed. Miserable screams rang out as endless lives were cut short.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a step forward and vanished. When he reappeared, he was in front of a black-robed man, one of the old Dao Realm cultivators who had come along with Xiao Yihan. As soon as Meng Hao materialized, the old man bit his tongue, spraying out a mouthful of blood as he fell back at top speed. However, even as he did so, Meng Hao waved his finger.</p><br/><p>It was simple motion, but the result was that the starry sky shook as an invisible force coalesced around the man, instantly weighing down on him with incredible pressure.</p><br/><p>It was like the power of the Mountains and Seas themselves smashing down onto the old man, invoking a bloodcurdling scream. Even as the sound left his mouth, he was crushed to a bloody pulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain and Sea power,\u201d Meng Hao murmured. He could now more clearly sense the power of the Mountain and Sea Realm inside of him, and also knew how to control some of it.</p><br/><p>When the other Dao Realm experts saw what he had just done, they were shocked. Just as they began to flee, Meng Hao turned to look at them and stepped forward, appearing in front of another Dao Realm expert. He waved his hand, causing an explosive wind to shoot out. Wherever it passed, screams rang out and powerful experts were wiped out of existence regardless of how they tried to defend themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun! Run away!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA jinx! This guy is an evil jinx!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, the Seventh Mountain and Sea is going to wipe out the Meng Clan eventually!!\u201d As the screams rang out, the beleaguered invaders and the Meng Clan traitors were overwhelmed by the fear of being killed, and could think of only one thing: how to escape.</p><br/><p>Soon, only half of the original force of tens of thousands remained behind. Everyone was scattering, fleeing as quickly as they had ever moved, even using secret magics. The Meng Clan cultivators were hard-pressed to catch them, and soon, the invaders had completely scattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I wage war, I don't leave survivors,\u201d Meng Hao said coolly. He stamped down with his right foot, causing a sea of flames to roar out. It was none other than Essence of Divine Flame, and it rapidly spread out with complete mercilessness.</p><br/><p>It only took the blink of an eye for the Divine Flame to sweep out, surrounding the fleeing cultivators. It moved far, far faster than they could, and soon formed a ring around them.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao waved his hand, and the ring of fire transformed into a flaming wall, completely trapping the enemies and locking them down. Now, all avenues of escape were sealed off.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake no prisoners,\u201d Meng Hao said, his voice cool. He waved his sleeve, causing a fierce wind to kick up. At the same time, the Meng Clan cultivators\u2019 eyes turned bright red, and they charge forward in attack.</p><br/><p>Miserable screams rang out without end, and the sounds of slaughter rose up. Meng Hao focused on the Dao Realm experts, and let the members of the Meng Clan handle the general slaughter, which also served the purpose of getting them used to fierce fighting and warfare.</p><br/><p>One side fought brilliantly, the other screamed in terror. This was not a large-scale battle, and considering how mismatched the forces were, it only took a few hours for the traitors and invaders to be... completely put to death!</p><br/><p>The Meng Clan had paid a heavy price, and suffered many casualties. However, the survivors had experienced the baptism of battle, and had been transformed. Although they still felt fear, the fire of slaughter burned in their eyes. Soon, quietness spread out across the battlefield, and slowly, all of the members of the Meng Clan turned to look at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>It was hard to say who said it first, but soon, everyone was kowtowing toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>They joined their voices together and called out from the bottoms of their lungs, causing everything to shake. Surrounded by the mangled corpses and skeletons of their enemies, they shouted out in the starry sky: \u201cGreetings, Patriarch!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

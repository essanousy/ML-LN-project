Before leaving the Ninth Mountain and Sea, he wanted to see... Ke Jiusi!</p><br/><p>However, although he could find the location of the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect, he was unable to enter. There was an invisible barrier in place that he could not pass without trying to break it open.</p><br/><p>He hovered quietly outside of the ruins for a while before finally clasping hands and bowing deeply. Then he turned and left.</p><br/><p>On a mountain peak inside the rubble of the sect, Ke Jiusi stood there looking at Meng Hao leave.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Night\u2019s voice spoke out next to him: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let him in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has Ji Tian\u2019s Karma on him... and I have even more than he does. If the two of us met now... it would be harmful for him.\u201d Ke Jiusi sighed, then turned his head to look out at the ruins stretching out beneath him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJi Tian....\u201d he murmured, cold killing intent gleaming in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn't get a chance to meet Ke Jiusi again. He left and headed toward the Ruins of Immortality. He needed to get the incomplete Paragon Bridge that he had copied to make his Paragon magic. Back then, he had been unable to take away the bridge itself.</p><br/><p>But now, his own Paragon Bridge had already transformed. Thanks to the Bridge of Immortal Treading, it was no longer illusory, but corporeal. With his current cultivation base... he would be able to use his Paragon magic and merge it with the true broken Paragon Bridge.</p><br/><p>A prismatic streak shot into the Ruins of Immortality as Meng Hao followed the same course as last time. He saw many of the same things he had seen before. He saw broken down temples and huge disembodied heads. He saw numerous corpses, shattered lands, destroyed magical items, and the ruins of palaces, all floating out in the void....</p><br/><p>After a long time, he reached the area where he had created his Daoist magic, and then found the location where he had gained enlightenment of his Paragon magic... the shattered bridge!</p><br/><p>It was only a section of that bridge, but even from a distance and despite the fact that it had fallen into ruins, Meng Hao could sense the might of a Paragon emanating off of it, the incredible power of Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>This bridge had once spanned the highest Heavens, and had been the object of worship by countless life forms, all of whom deeply desired to walk upon it!</p><br/><p>But now, it was broken. Perhaps most of the bridge had faded away into the sands of time, and only this small section was what remained.</p><br/><p>After all the years that had passed, it remained in this one spot. No one had ever been able to take it away. Not even Ji Tian could take it, much less other Dao Realm cultivators.</p><br/><p>However, years ago, Meng Hao had forged his own Paragon magic by means of this bridge and thus had allowed it to become whole once again. It was that very Daoist magic that had earned him a spot in the Echelon.</p><br/><p>Today, he had returned to take the bridge away!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really the Paramita Bridge?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cWell, I'm not completely certain what your previous name was, but I do know... that a lot of people know you.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but think of the black-robed man who had emerged from the Paragon Painting in the Windswept Realm, and the expression on his face when he saw the Paragon Bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps in the so-called Paramita, even Paragons need to walk across you... to truly become Paragons.... [1. The characters for Paramita can also be read \u201cthe other shore,\u201d which might be relevant since we\u2019re talking about a bridge here. Also, the \u201cother shore\u201d aspect plays into the meaning of the Buddhist concept of Paramita]</p><br/><p>\u201cBut today, I\u2019m going to take you away. From now on, you... belong to Meng Hao. You are my... Paragon Bridge!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes shone with a bright light as he began to walk forward toward the bridge. The pressure of a Paragon rumbled out, and Meng Hao began to shine with scintillating light. He waved his right hand, and suddenly his Paragon Bridge appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cMerge!\u201d he roared, performing a double handed incantation gesture and then waving his finger toward his Paragon Bridge. Instantly, the two bridges began to merge together. The roar of the Bridge Soul could be heard from the Paragon Bridge as it ensured that nothing unexpected happened during the merger.</p><br/><p>As the process continued, the pressure radiating off of the Paragon Bridge grew stronger. Rumbling filled the air, and everything grew dim. A wind swept through the Ruins of Immortality, as if the Paragon Bridge were truly awakening!</p><br/><p>The pressure intensified, and the Heavens trembled. The Ruins of Immortality quaked, and soon the entire Mountain and Sea Realm was imperceptibly shaking. No power of expulsion could be felt from the Mountains and Seas, and yet it seemed like a pair of invisible eyes had turned their gaze towards it, as if recalling memories of the past.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t all... above the Mountain and Sea Realm, in the 33 Heavens, everything was shaking. Countless cultivators there were shocked, although they had no idea what exactly was happening.</p><br/><p>In addition... outside the 33 Heavens, far out in the great expanse, was a world in which several suns were hauling a huge statue. All of the cultivators there were also astonished.</p><br/><p>Shockingly, it was also possible to see that in the land of the statue, which was growing inexorably closer to the Mountain and Sea Realm, there was also a bridge hovering in midair. It was also a Paragon Bridge, but it was in ruins, as if it were in place only as a symbol and had lost all of its previous significance.</p><br/><p>That bridge also began to tremble.</p><br/><p>The voice of woman spoke out, gloomy and serious: \u201cSomeone is awakening it....\u201d</p><br/><p>Beneath the 33 Heavens, back in the Mountain and Sea Realm, in the Ruins of Immortality in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, Meng Hao threw his head back and roared. He suddenly flew up to stand atop the Paragon Bridge, where he first lifted his hands up into the air and then slammed them down onto the surface of the bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cMerge!\u201d</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s Paragon Bridge began to descend as the merging quickened. The aura of a Paragon rose up into the air, inundating Meng Hao. Even though this was his own Paragon magic, he was still affected, and coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>However, his eyes gleamed with focus. This time, he was going to take away the ruins of the Paragon Bridge no matter what! He was going to merge them with his own Paragon Bridge to make it stronger!</p><br/><p>\u201cMERGE!\u201d Meng Hao glowed with azure light as the Bridge Soul of his Paragon Bridge went all out, risking its own life as it controlled the bridge, causing it to descend further in its merging into the original bridge.</p><br/><p>This time there was a force of expulsion, which turned into a powerful backlash attack. Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao\u2019s mouth, and his Paragon Bridge appeared to be on the verge of collapsing.</p><br/><p>Apparently, the majesty of the broken bridge would not permit anyone to take control or ownership of it!</p><br/><p>\u201cMeat jelly! Parrot! Get out here!\u201d Meng Hao roared. Meng Hao wiped the blood off his lips as the meat jelly and parrot flew out of his bag of holding. As soon as they appeared, their eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-y-you... what are you doing?!\u201d the meat jelly said, trembling. The shattered bridge filled it with a sensation of complete terror. That bridge had once been powerful enough to affect Heaven and Earth, to shake the world. Even though that power was now broken, its aura was still there!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s THAT bridge!!\u201d the parrot squawked excitedly. \u201cSuppress it! Fudge! Lord Fifth will definitely help you suppress it!\u201d It transformed into a multi-colored streak of light that shot toward the broken Paragon Bridge. Meng Hao\u2019s Paragon Bridge then increased its own pressure and began to descend once more.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly gritted its teeth and spread out as it transformed into a flying rope. Apparently, the moronic meat jelly had decided to try to tie the broken Paragon Bridge and Meng Hao\u2019s Paragon Bridge together!</p><br/><p>Rumbling filled the air as the Paragon Bridges continued to merge together. Meng Hao\u2019s cultivation base was in full rotation, exploding with the full might of an Allheaven Dao Immortal. By now, the forced merger had reached the point where the broken bridge and Meng Hao\u2019s Paragon Bridge were now almost completely superimposed.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this point that the power of a backlash attack, as well as the aura of expulsion both exploded out. Performing an incantation gesture, Meng Hao unleashed his Demon Sealing Hexing magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already broken!\u201d he shouted. \u201cYou might have been supreme and almighty in the past, but now you\u2019re rubble! You\u2019re incomplete, not even half of what you used to be. With the will of my Paragon magic, and the form of the Bridge of Immortal Treading, I won\u2019t believe that I can\u2019t absorb you!\u201d His eyes were shot with blood, and blood sprayed out of his mouth. Gritting his teeth, he produced his fourth Nirvana Fruit and pressed it into his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMastiff!\u201d he roared, and the mastiff flew out to form a cape.</p><br/><p>\u201cParrot!\u201d The parrot and the copper mirror instantly formed together into the Battle Weapon. This time, it was not a long blade, but rather a glove! As the glove settled on Meng Hao\u2019s hand, he took seven steps forward, building up massive energy and then unleashing a powerful punch!</p><br/><p>It was the God-Slaying Fist, Meng Hao\u2019s most powerful fist strike, capable of shaking even cultivators of the Dao Realm. His Paragon Bridge was already beyond qualified to absorb the ruins of the bridge. With the power of the fist strike pouring into it, that last final distance between the two was closed!</p><br/><p>The two bridges were completely superimposed!</p><br/><p>At some point a woman, dressed in white, had appeared up above. It was Paragon Sea Dream, who watched Meng Hao merge the two bridges, a complex expression on her face.</p><br/><p>In the moment that the two bridges superimposed, the broken bridge trembled, and then... cracking sounds could be heard as it collapsed of its own accord! It was just like the World Tree, which destroyed itself rather than look up and see a sky controlled by the Ji Clan. The bridge was aware that it was simply too weak to do anything to prevent itself from being absorbed.</p><br/><p>If it were anyone else, the bridge would be able to fight back, even if it were weaker than it was right now. However... Meng Hao was different. He had the will of the Paragon Bridge, and the form of the Bridge of Immortal Treading. He had a Bridge Soul. Essentially... Meng Hao\u2019s Paragon Bridge was... the true supreme Paragon Bridge.</p><br/><p>Although it was not as paramount as the broken bridge had been, it was more complete!</p><br/><p>Since that was the case, there was no way for it to prevent the merging, so the broken bridge chose to use the last bit of its aura to destroy itself! It would rather explode... than be absorbed!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face flickered as he looked at the broken bridge crumbling and turning into ash. Then his eyes shone with a shocking, icy gleam.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou would rather destroy yourself than be absorbed, huh...? Well then, go ahead and blow yourself up. Your death will allow my Paragon Bridge to take your place, to be born anew!\u201d Roaring, Meng Hao pushed both hands down onto the Paragon Bridge, which instantly began to shine with brilliant light. Instead of attempting to merge with the broken bridge, the Paragon Bridge would consume it!</p><br/><p>It would consume the ancient broken bridge to give itself new life!</p><br/><p>In the future, there would be no broken bridge. There would only be Meng Hao\u2019s Paragon Bridge!</p><br/><p>Rumbling could be heard as the Paragon Bridge voraciously consumed the flying ash that was the remnants of the broken bridge. As it did, its aura rose dramatically, shaking Heaven and Earth!</p><br/><p>The Paragon Bridge truly did have new life. It was now no longer illusory in any sense of the word. It was... completely corporeal!</p><br/><p>When it became real, the 33 Heavens trembled, and all the bridges there collapsed. The incomplete bridge in the world of the statue, out in the vast expanse, also trembled and collapsed. For all eternity... it would never again exist!!</p><br/><p>Back in the Ruins of Immortality, Paragon Sea Dream\u2019s soft voice echoed out,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt used to have a name,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was called the Heaven Tra--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs of now,\u201d Meng Hao interrupted, \u201cit\u2019s called the Paragon Bridge!\u201d His words were not a show of disrespect. Rather, he didn\u2019t want to hear the former name. What he cared about was the current bridge, not what it had been in the past.</p><br/><p>Turning, Meng Hao waved his hand, causing the Paragon Bridge to emit a rumbling drone. The Ruins of Immortality shook as the bridge faded away. Meng Hao clasped hands and bowed to Paragon Sea Dream, then turned and left.</p><br/><p>Paragon Sea Dream hovered there, watching Meng Hao make his way off. Her eyes flickered with an absent-minded gleam.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack in the day, Big Brother Nine Seals... was just as imposing....\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1204: As Of Now, It\u2019s Called the Paragon Bridge!</strong></p><br/><p><strong>Note from Deathblade:</strong> The following is a little anecdote from Er Gen, translasted by anonpuffs. Keep in mind that in China, virtually all cell phones are basically pre-paid, although many allow you to overdraw your account.</p><br/><p><strong>Note from Er Gen:</strong> Let me tell you an embarrassing story, this afternoon I made a phone call to my old lady. There was a notification that the phone card was overdrawn, so I paid 10 yuan (about U.S. $1.60 at the time) for her. Then I called a friend, and there was another notification about an overdrawn card, so I paid 10 yuan again. I ended up making 4 calls and every time the cards were overdrawn, so I got mad. I ended up paying 10 yuan every time.</p><br/><p>Finally, I made yet another call, but outrageously enough they were overdrawn yet again. I got super mad and called customer service and let them have it. After a round of complaining, the customer service agent told me gently, \u2018Sir, they actually didn\u2019t owe any money on their accounts, it\u2019s your card that\u2019s overdrawn\u2026\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

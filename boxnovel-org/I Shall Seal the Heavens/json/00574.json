The Inner Sect disciple nodded, made a brand mark onto the jade slip, then clasped hands and left.</p><br/><p>Everything happened so quickly that the young woman was left standing there at a loss. She didn\u2019t even notice as Meng Hao grabbed her by the arm.</p><br/><p>That seemed to wake her up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026 hey, what are you doing?!\u201d she said, her eyes going wide. A look of terror appeared inside of them as she suddenly recalled who this person was, and the stories she had heard told about him within the Sect. She was about to struggle against him, when he wrapped his arms around her and flew up into the air.</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao flew over the Fourth Peak, the disciples who looked up to see him holding the young woman had strange expressions on their faces. Many of them looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the Little Patriarch holding\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen her before. From her garments she seems to be an Outer Sect disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! He was so peaceful earlier today. The sky isn\u2019t even dark, and he\u2019s already back to his old self?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, up in mid-air above the Fourth Peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut me down!!\u201d said the young woman, her face bright red. A look of rage had appeared in her phoenix-like eyes. She continued to struggle against Meng Hao, but he seemed to have no intention of releasing her. She could only look at his face, inches away from her own, her fury growing more and more intense.</p><br/><p>When the two of them finally landed outside of his Immortal\u2019s cave, the woman opened her mouth and bit viciously down onto his arm. He looked at her for a moment, smiled, and released her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to practice cultivation here for a while,\u201d he said with a smile, giving her a deep look. \u201cIt will only take a few days for you to realize who I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Eldest Brother of the Fourth Peak, Elite Apprentice of the Sect! Don\u2019t tell me that gives you the right to arbitrarily humiliate other disciples!?\u201d The woman backed up, staring at Meng Hao angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was an Elite Apprentice yesterday, not today,\u201d he said, laughing. With that, he sat down cross-legged and looked at the young woman.</p><br/><p>That got her even angrier. But then, she thought of his status, and the stories she had heard, and she began to tremble. She backed up further, putting herself even more on guard.</p><br/><p>She had heard far too many stories about this person. Any one of them was enough to cause an Outer Sect disciple like her to tremble with terror.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Soon, it was evening, and then night. Bright stars twinkled into being up above. They were dim at first, but quickly grew clear and bright.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because of the icy night wind, or the young woman\u2019s panic-stricken state. In any case, she shrank into a corner against the stone wall, looking quite helpless.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at her and then stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you move!!\u201d she cried, suddenly growing even more nervous. Ignoring her demands, Meng Hao walked over to her, retrieved a set of clothing from his bag of holding, and gently laid it over her.</p><br/><p>The softness of his movement caused her to gape in surprise.</p><br/><p>He smiled, returned to where he had been sitting before, and continued to meditate.</p><br/><p>The woman looked at him silently, her expression one of confusion and doubt. Even more confused were the surrounding Fourth Peak disciples who had hidden themselves in the area to watch the proceedings.</p><br/><p>They were all whispering to each other curiously about his compassionate action just now.</p><br/><p>Another person who was completely confused was Ke Yunhai.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the kid really had a change in personality?\u201d he murmured in astonishment.</p><br/><p>No words were exchanged through the entire night.</p><br/><p>The young woman was incredibly nervous the entire time. She didn\u2019t dare to meditate, nor close her eyes. She was too frightened of what she feared might happen if she did.</p><br/><p>However, her nervousness, coupled with the exhaustion from climbing the mountain during the test earlier, caused her to unwittingly fall asleep.</p><br/><p>When the first rays of dawn light touched her face, her eyelashes flickered and she slowly opened her eyes. Then she began to tremble. She quickly rose to her feet, causing the two robes which had been placed on top of her to tumble to the ground.</p><br/><p>The robes were thick, and were obviously quite warm.</p><br/><p>One of them had been placed on her by Meng Hao when she was awake. As for the other, he had covered her with it after she fell asleep.</p><br/><p>Just in front of her was a small ball of fire that emanated pulses of heat. The heat was filled with the power of Heaven and Earth, and relieved some of the exhaustion that had filled her body.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the woman stared in astonishment. She looked up at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>He was striding down some of the stone steps on the mountain, some fruit in hand. These were Spirit Fruits, something that Outer Sect disciples had no qualification to enjoy. Only Elite Apprentices could have access to them.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao put one down in front of the young woman.</p><br/><p>Her expression was complex. After having a night of rest, she seemed to have come to terms with her current situation. She still felt apprehensive, though, unsure of how she had attracted the attention of this Chosen of Heaven. She also wasn\u2019t sure why he had changed her entire fate with that single sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry the Spirit Fruits,\u201d he said, popping one into his mouth. \u201cThe flavor is incredible.\u201d He handed another over to her.</p><br/><p>She hesitated for a moment, then accepted and bit down onto one of the fruits. Suddenly, her eyes began to glow, and when she squinted, they looked like two crescent moons.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood?\u201d asked Meng Hao with a smile.</p><br/><p>The young woman\u2019s face flushed, and she nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Outer Sect is pretty chaotic,\u201d he continued, looking up into the sky. \u201cI\u2019ll help you pay back the debts you owe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young woman\u2019s hand stopped in mid-air, clutching at a Spirit Fruit. She bowed her head, saying nothing in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose Outer Sect disciples who have been treating you poorly have already been taken care of,\u201d he went on softly.</p><br/><p>The young woman\u2019s body trembled slightly. After a long moment passed, she looked up at Meng Hao, almost in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy are you treating me like this? I\u2019m just an ordinary Outer Sect Disciple, and you\u2019re\u2026. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao shook his head but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of Xu Qing? Who is she?\u201d the young woman asked. She rose to her feet and looked at him, her gaze filled with stubborness. She wanted to know the answer.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was quiet for a moment. Today was the third day, and unless something unforeseen occurred, Xu Qing should be waking up soon. Then this young woman would disappear. After all\u2026 she had long since already perished.</p><br/><p>Seeing the look in her eyes, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes slowly grew blank, as if he was recalling the past. In his mind\u2019s eye, he saw the events outside the Rebirth Cave, the killing of Ji Hongdong, and Xu Qing\u2019s tears. He saw himself raising his hand to wipe them away. He heard those voices from years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re safe now. No one will know your secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao. Will we\u2026 see each other again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry. There\u2019s a long road ahead. Who knows when it is that we will meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao still remembered how he had been about to turn around that day, when a warm, supple body embraced him from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d [1. The scene recalled between Meng Hao and Xu Qing happened in chapter 306 ]</p><br/><p>Xu Qing\u2019s voice, filled with determination, was strong enough to last through past, present, and future lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could think of Xu Qing as your next life,\u201d Meng Hao said softly. \u201cRegarding the two of us\u2026 we have an agreement to meet each other in the next life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p><strong>Note from Er Gen:</strong> This chapter is short by a thousand characters because I feel that for this chapter, it\u2019s just the right amount. If I force myself to write more, I\u2019m afraid it will lose its charm</p><br/>\n</div>"}

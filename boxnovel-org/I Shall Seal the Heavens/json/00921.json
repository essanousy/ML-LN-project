Although he was physically in the Fang Clan right now, he didn\u2019t have much of a sense of belonging.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my home,\u201d he murmured softly. \u201cMy dad and mom aren\u2019t here. Since they\u2019re on Planet South Heaven, Planet South Heaven is my home.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment, he was completely exhausted. After spending half a year in the Medicine Pavilion, and then experiencing the encounter moments ago, he was worn out mentally and in pain physically.</p><br/><p>Then he thought again about all of the merit points he had basically lost while he was in the Medicine Pavilion. It was like a knife stabbing through his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the pain\u2026.\u201d he thought, clenching his jaw. \u201cThankfully, I didn\u2019t go all the way through. Next time I\u2019m definitely going to arrange things ahead of time. No merit points, no watching me!\u201d Having made this decision, he let out a long sigh and then closed his eyes and rotated his cultivation base to begin his recuperation.</p><br/><p>Ten days later, he opened his eyes, and they shone with an energetic gleam. He took a deep breath. During the past half year, he had expended a lot of mental energy. Now that he was fully recovered, his eyes glittered. He produced the tome that had been given to him from his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Pill Elder gave this to me\u2026.\u201d After a moment of thought, he began to flip through the pages. The more he saw, the more brightly his eyes glowed. This was the true Classic of Plants and Vegetation, and it was incredibly detailed. There were even medicinal plants recorded therein that he hadn\u2019t seen in the Medicine Pavilion.</p><br/><p>As he skimmed its contents, Meng Hao suddenly realized that his divine sense had experienced growth after his experience in the Medicine Pavilion. He sent it out into the courtyard, where he saw Fang Xi sitting there abjectly. The parrot and meat jelly were not sitting on his shoulder as usual. They were nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gaped for a moment. He remembered seeing Fang Xi in the group of 500,000 spectators outside of the Medicine Pavilion, but he couldn\u2019t remember if the parrot and meat jelly had been there. He pushed open the door of his residence, and the sound caused Fang Xi to look up. His eyes were a bit blank, and when he saw Meng Hao, he sighed and rose to his feet.</p><br/><p>Hanging his head, he bitterly said, \u201cCoz, you need to punish me. It was all my fault. Lord Fifth and Lord Third, they\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apparently, he couldn\u2019t finish his thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Meng Hao in amazement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened with Lord Fifth. After you came out of the Medicine Pavilion, I was going to take him and Lord Third back here. However, something happened to Lord Fifth. All of a sudden\u2026 he headed toward tier 7 alchemist Fang Shuiyan, that old woman. Lord Fifth and her peacock started fighting\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was nothing I could do to stop it. Lord Fifth went crazy\u2026. Lord Third couldn\u2019t say anything to stop what was happening either, so he eventually just joined Lord Fifth.\u201d Fang Xi seemed to be completely out of sorts, and wasn\u2019t even speaking coherently.</p><br/><p>As soon as Meng Hao heard Fang Xi\u2019s story, he knew exactly what was going on. He remembered that peacock, and its luxuriant coat of feathers\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, the parrot was just having some fun with the peacock,\u201d Meng Hao said euphemistically.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving fun? Coz!\u201d exclaimed Fang Xi in agitation. He seemed upset. \u201cThere was definitely nothing fun going on!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see what happened. It\u2026 it was terrifying. The peacock\u2019s rear end virtually exploded! It was horrific!!\u201d Fang Xi shuddered. When he thought about what he had seen, he felt a sense of terror. Then he thought about how much time he\u2019d spent with Lord Fifth, and how the parrot was constantly glancing behind him, and all the hair on his body stood on end.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoz, that bird\u2026 you need to find a place to set it free. It\u2019s simply appalling!\u201d Fang Xi\u2019s breath came in ragged pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still young so you don\u2019t understand,\u201d Meng Hao said, sounding very sure of himself. \u201cAs far as the birds are concerned, it was just having fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoz, there\u2019s something else I didn\u2019t mention,\u201d Fang Xi continued, unable to hold back. \u201cOnce when I went out with Lord Fifth and Lord Third, we encountered a fierce bear, and Lord Fifth\u2026 Lord Fifth had\u2026 had some fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao patted Fang Xi on the shoulder and explained once again that it was all in good fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end,\u201d added Fang Xi, \u201cLord Fifth and Lord Third were taken away by Alchemist Fang Shuiyan\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Meng Hao, waving his hand nonchalantly, \u201cThat meat jelly can\u2019t be killed, and if the parrot dies, then the world will simply have one less scourge to worry about. Don\u2019t pay them any more attention.\u201d He was well aware that the two morons were incredibly tenacious, and couldn\u2019t be hurt easily. They were virtually indestructible.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, don\u2019t say anything more. Come on. Let\u2019s head over to the Dao of Alchemy Division. I wasted an entire half year in the Medicine Pavilion. It\u2019s time to go make some merit points!\u201d Meng Hao shot out of the Immortal\u2019s Cave and Fang Xi reluctantly followed him. The two of them sped toward the Dao of Alchemy Division as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Meng Hao\u2019s heart began to surge with excitement. He very much wanted to find out if his tactic of going to the Medicine Pavilion would solve his problem with the merit points.</p><br/><p>\u201cHardships prompt changes, changes bring solutions, solutions resolve hardships!\u201d Before long, the two of them reached the Dao of Alchemy Division and entered the outer mountains. Meng Hao was instantly recognized.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Fang Hao! He\u2019s here!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that he\u2019ll go to the Medicine Pavilion again!? It\u2019s too early, isn\u2019t it? Wait, don\u2019t tell me\u2026 he\u2019s going to give a lecture on plants and alchemy!?\u201d As soon as the nearby apprentice alchemists saw Meng Hao, they got very excited, and began to spread word to their friends in the clan.</p><br/><p>By the time Meng Hao got to Peak #7191, he was being followed by tens of thousands of people. He stepped onto the platform, cleared his throat, and was just about to begin speaking when suddenly, numerous beams of bright light shot toward the area. In the blink of an eye, the crowd exceeded 100,000 people.</p><br/><p>There were even alchemists who emerged from within the inner mountains to come hear Meng Hao lecture about plants and vegetation.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had proven to everyone how terrifyingly skilled he was with plants and vegetation. By now, most people were convinced that his skill was at least tier 8 level!!</p><br/><p>In the entire Dao of Alchemy Division, not counting Meng Hao, there were only nineteen people who were presently at tier 8 level when it came to skill with plants and vegetation. Those were the tier 8 alchemists, also referred to as Pavilion Elders of the Pill Pavilion.</p><br/><p>People like that would never go out and give lectures. From this, it can be imagined how enthusiastic the audience was. Before much time passed, the audience swelled to 200,000.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t need to say a word about the merit points. Everybody knew the rules, and immediately paid their due.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was also excited to note that the old woman Fang Shuiyan was no longer present on the opposite mountain peak. Without any competition to worry about, he shelved his idea of increasing prices and proceeded to give his lecture.</p><br/><p>Six hours later, having collected hundreds of thousands of merit points, Meng Hao gritted his teeth and decided to talk for four more hours. That pushed his profit into the 1,000,000 range, and Meng Hao went wild with joy.</p><br/><p>With so many merit points, Meng Hao now felt much more at ease. All he had to do was give a lecture for a few hours a day, and vast amounts of merit points would come flowing in. All of a sudden, he felt a sense that the Fang Clan\u2019s Dao of Alchemy Division was showing him quite a bit of hospitality.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao now lived a life of extravagance. He bought vast quantities of medicinal pills and medicinal plants. He even procured plenty of Immortal jade, which, after absorbing the spiritual energy, causing his Immortal meridian to become even more solid. On one occasion, after acquiring what was essentially the clan\u2019s entire yearly supply of Immortal jade, he was able to instantly solidify his Immortal meridian to a degree of ninety percent!</p><br/><p>His cultivation base experienced rapid growth. He no longer had eighty percent of the power of a true Immortal, but rather, ninety percent. His battle prowess even broke past that of a stage 4 Immortal. Back in his Immortal\u2019s cave, he produced the crocodile, and after a bit of sparring, determined that he was now comparable to a stage 5 Immortal!</p><br/><p>He was also just barely able to detect the power of Tribulation forming. He knew that once he became one hundred percent true Immortal, the Door of Immortality would descend.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a long time for that day to arrive,\u201d he thought, eyes glittering with excitement. \u201cI\u2019ve prepared well, so once I step into true Immortality, I\u2019m going to absorb huge amounts of Immortal qi from the Door of Immortality. I\u2019m going to open dozens of Immortal meridians in one shot!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the same reason why the Chosen of so many sects consolidated their power and waited for true Immortal destiny before making their breakthrough. They wanted to burst into true Immortality by opening multiple Immortal meridians. There were even some Chosen who opened sixty or seventy Immortal meridians in one shot.</p><br/><p>Such opportunities were available only when the Door of Immortality appeared. At other times, it would be impossible to experience such a wild leap in one\u2019s cultivation base.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Meng Hao continued to concoct Spirit Elixir with increasingly rare plants. The quality of the Spirit Elixir he was producing had reached a terrifying level.</p><br/><p>The life force in the Nirvana Fruits was growing stronger. Of course, his spirit stones were rapidly depleted, and when he finally reached the end of his supply, he started exchanging merit points to get more spirit stones.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, after making a few exchanges, he was unable to acquire any more spirit stones; the number of spirit stones that could be doled out to any given person was limited.</p><br/><p>Actually, few people were aware that such a rule existed. After all, not many people would ever spend as many merit points as Meng Hao had on spirit stones. Meng Hao was shocked by this development, and nearly went mad.</p><br/><p>Right now, he did not lack merit points, he lacked spirit stones. He even thought about selling his merit points for spirit stones, but that was actually a violation of clan rules. Of course, violating the rules didn\u2019t bother him, since he didn\u2019t care much about the rules to begin with.</p><br/><p>However, the Fang Clan was in a delicate state at the moment. Meng Hao knew that there were quite a few people who were secretly watching him, and even the slightest mistake could be turned into a major issue.</p><br/><p>There were some areas of the ancestral mansion that Meng Hao had never visited. He had stuck to and risen to prominence in the Dao of Alchemy Division. Thanks to his fame and position there, the people who considered him a problem couldn\u2019t make a move against him easily.</p><br/><p>For the most part, he wasn\u2019t very familiar with the Fang Clan. He wasn\u2019t well acquainted with the various relatives from other branches, and didn\u2019t even know very many people from the direct bloodline.</p><br/><p>The people he had dealings with the most were Fang Xi and 19th Uncle. He didn\u2019t really feel like getting very close with anyone else.</p><br/><p>He caught sight of Fang Donghan a few times, who always seemed to be trying to avoid him. Meng Hao knew quite well that he was a Chosen, just like Fang Wei. However, he had been suppressed by Fang Wei, and was looking forward to when Meng Hao and Fang Wei finally squared off. Meng Hao understood how he felt.</p><br/><p>As far as Fang Xiangshan went, she also avoided him. On the few occasions when they ran into each other, Meng Hao could see the fear in her eyes.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but sigh at this. Was he really that scary?</p><br/><p>Regarding the other Chosen, he didn\u2019t know them, nor did he have any desire to get to know them.</p><br/><p>He had no plans to stay in the Fang Clan for a long time. After all, he had only three objectives in coming here.</p><br/><p>The first was to get his Nirvana Fruits. The Second was to excel for his dad and mom\u2019s sake, and make all the Chosen of the Fang Clan look at him with respect.</p><br/><p>The third was to reach true Immortal Ascension!</p><br/><p>Once he achieved those objectives, Meng Hao would leave the Fang Clan. Then, he would use his Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion to join the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite. There\u2026 was where he would continue practicing cultivation and truly rise to prominence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to have someone to rely on. I learned that when I was in the Reliance Sect. Here in the Fang Clan of Planet East Victory, the Dao of Alchemy Division is what I have to rely on.\u201d Meng Hao took a deep breath, and his eyes glittered. Moments later, though, he grimaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019m out of spirit stones. What do I do about that\u2026?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

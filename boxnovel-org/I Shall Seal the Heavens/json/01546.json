In fact, his words seemed laced with sorrow. And yet, within the sorrow, Dao Fang could also hear hatred, a hatred that would not dissipate even if the 33 Heavens were destroyed. It was the type of hatred that could spawn killing intent so powerful that it would not be sated even if the starry sky were overthrown, or the Vast Expanse destroyed and filled with the reek of blood!</p><br/><p>As soon as he heard those words, his jaw dropped, and he subconsciously looked up toward the huge lizard outside of the Aeon Span, and the mysterious figure in the vortex on its head.</p><br/><p>Slowly, that figure began to grow clearer and clearer. Dao Fang began to pant, and his eyes went wide with disbelief. Soon... he could clearly see the figure\u2019s face in every detail.</p><br/><p>Dao Fang began to tremble, and his mind felt as if it were being filled with countless lightning bolts and thunderclaps. He simply couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. It was so preposterous that he couldn\u2019t help but rub his eyes to clear them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, how could it be him?\u201d he muttered to himself, shivering. \u201cI must be seeing things.... Ha ha....\u201d After rubbing his eyes he looked over again, and his face drained of blood. All he could do was gape in shock, his mind devoid of thought, a complete blank.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t prevent himself from shaking visibly, and his eyes were instantly shot with blood. He felt like his blood was about to pump in reverse; his tongue stuck in his mouth, and his mouth opened and closed as if he were speaking, and yet, no words came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d Meng Hao asked coolly. He began to walk forward, and the old lizard immediately lowered its head to accommodate him. As he strode out, all of the surrounding cultivators dropped to their knees, expressions of ardor on their faces. Even the parts of the army which were attacking the Aeon Span stopped and dropped to their knees.</p><br/><p>Countless voices joined together to form a sound that could shake Heaven and Earth. \u201cGreetings, Demon Sovereign!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mere sound of it caused the Aeon Span to shake.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao walked forward, his expression the same as ever. Soon he was standing right in front of the Aeon Span. There he hovered, looking at the incredulous Dao Fang on the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Meng... M-Meng Hao....\u201d Dao Fang stammered, seemingly having difficulty even speaking. From the look in his eyes, it was as if he were being faced with the most spectacularly unbelievable thing in all existence. He could scarcely believe his own eyes, or his own mind. Even just looking at Meng Hao left him feeling like his body was about to collapse, and he began to edge backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d he shrieked, shaking even harder than before. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible that you\u2019re Meng Hao. Meng Hao is dead. Dead, I tell you! Who are you? Why are you disguised as Meng Hao? There\u2019s no way you\u2019re actually Meng Hao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you personally witness my death?\u201d Meng Hao asked. He was in no hurry, and everything in the area was under the control of his divine sense. It was possible to say that no force or power who came here could threaten or harm the Mountain and Sea Butterfly.</p><br/><p>Not the Immortal God Continent. Not the Devil Realm. And of course, the 33 Heavens qualified even less.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s hatred had been festering for more than two thousand years. If one started counting from the moment of the 33 Heavens\u2019 betrayal, when they began to suppress the Mountain and Sea Realm, then the hatred of the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm stretched back even farther than that.</p><br/><p>Because of such hatred, Meng Hao wouldn\u2019t simply destroy the 33 Heavens in one fell swoop. That would not drive away the hatred. He would torment them; he would unleash the hatred upon them. Only in such a way could he, as well as the other cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm, give vent to the resentment which had been suffocating them for years!</p><br/><p>\u201cI... I....\u201d Dao Fang was nearly struck mute by Meng Hao\u2019s words. It was true. He hadn\u2019t personally witnessed Meng Hao die. Although it didn\u2019t seem possible that Meng Hao could have made a comeback, within Dao Fang\u2019s terror, he had to admit that the person in front of him... was definitely Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can he be so powerful?\u201d Dao Fang said bitterly. \u201cAnd how could he be back...?\u201d</p><br/><p>As his voice echoed out beneath the Aeon Span, the other cultivators of the 33 Heavens heard it, including the powerful experts who had just flown up. Among their number were Paragons who had interacted with Meng Hao in the past, and when they heard Dao Fang\u2019s words, their faces turned ashen, and their minds reeled.</p><br/><p>Having seen the army outside of the Aeon Span, they were already terrified and filled with anxiety. Facing such a huge army left them completely at wits\u2019 end, and they could only be as careful as possible. Even if they had to beg and plead for mercy, they would.</p><br/><p>For the 33 Heavens to be faced with an army like this was like a tiny kingdom facing an empire. There was simply no way to compare!</p><br/><p>It was like a baby fighting a strong young man.</p><br/><p>After seeing Meng Hao with their own eyes, and hearing Dao Fang\u2019s words, the powerful experts from the 33 Heavens began to shake in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-Meng... Meng Hao!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe's that Paragon from the Mountain and Sea Realm!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The experts from the 33 Heavens were in a pandemonium, especially the ones who had personally witnessed Meng Hao in action before. It was as if a huge disaster were bearing down on them from above. However, there were still some who didn't understand the height of the Heavens and the breadth of the Earth, and were still confident enough to make brazen statements.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! It's impossible! He\u2019s dead. And even if he didn\u2019t die back then, the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm Continent have been searching for him ever since. There\u2019s no way he could still be alive! And even if he were alive, how could he possibly have command of such a powerful force!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he ever have convinced such a huge army to fight for him? This is ludicrous!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell he won\u2019t be able to get past the Aeon Span. It was bolstered by the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm. It will take him a while to get through, and by that time, the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm will have arrived. This Meng Hao has walked right into a trap. He\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hovered outside of the Aeon Span, looking at the Outsiders, eyes flickering with killing intent and hatred, which he did nothing at all to hide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Aeon Span....\u201d he said. A vicious smile broke out on his face, and he began to laugh, a laughter filled with hatred. The Aeon Span had sealed the Mountain and Sea Realm for countless years. Shui Dongliu had spent his entire life planning how to break through it and buy a chance at freedom for the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was because of that shield, which had suppressed the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm for so many years, that the League of Demon Sealers\u2019 mantra also mentioned... the Aeon Span.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all had to face the Aeon Span....\u201d His laughter grew louder, until it echoed out through the entire starry sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Meng Hao, hereby decree that in this starry sky, there will henceforth be no Aeon Span!\u201d His voice echoed out like thunder, provoking an instant reaction. The starry sky of the Vast Expanse was altered. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not the will of the starry sky agreed. Meng Hao changed it, ensuring that the Aeon Span was something that could not exist for all eternity.</p><br/><p>He hated the Aeon Span!</p><br/><p>Without the slightest hesitation, he extended his hand and tapped the Aeon Span!</p><br/><p>As soon as his finger touched the shield it began to distort, and massive rumbling sounds echoed out. Apparently, natural and magical laws were being unleashed by Meng Hao. Instantly, it was as if the Aeon Span were incongruous with the entire starry sky, as if Meng Hao\u2019s will had become the will of Heaven. Natural law was changed!</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE....</p><br/><p>Cracks spread out from the spot where Meng Hao\u2019s finger had touched the shield. Instantly, they spread out to cover the entire Aeon Span.</p><br/><p>In the space of a few breaths, Dao Fang and the other powerful experts of the 33 Heavens watched in shocked disbelief as the shield that was the Aeon Span... shattered!</p><br/><p>It completely collapsed into countless pieces, destroyed as easily as a dried twig!</p><br/><p>As the innumerable fragments of the destroyed shield swept out in all directions, it seemed like the starry sky wished to expel them. Intense pressure crushed down on them, transforming them into powder. The shield which was the entire hope of the 33 Heavens, which had protected them from countless intruders over the years, and had simultaneously suppressed the Mountain and Sea Realm, preventing any cultivators from leaving... was instantly turned into ash.</p><br/><p>It was blasted into smithereens!</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Meng Hao, hereby decree that all who practice cultivation... may no longer self-detonate or kill themselves!\u201d Eyes flickering coldly, he waved his finger, instituting a new natural law which settled down onto the 33 Heavens.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the countless living beings within the 33 Heavens trembled, and their minds spun.</p><br/><p>It was almost as if the will of Allheaven wasn\u2019t willing to interfere with Meng Hao\u2019s revenge.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s hatred of the 33 Heavens, and the words he had just spoken, revealed the signs of what was to come. And that was... a complete and utter extermination, with no survivors!</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1546: Destroying the Aeon Span!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

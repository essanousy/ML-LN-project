This was especially true of Elder Sun, who licked his lips, his eyes glinting viciously.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao closed his eyes and then pointed his finger down towards the ground. Instantly, Demonic Qi shot up from the plain, swirling around to form a figure. This was none other than Meng Hao\u2019s Demonic Incarnation.</p><br/><p>The illusory figure contained Meng Hao\u2019s Spiritual Sense. It flickered as a black cloak suddenly wrapped around it, turning it into a black-cloaked man.</p><br/><p>The black-cloaked man floated there in the air, his facial features indistinguishable. Meng Hao\u2019s voice suddenly spoke out from within the hood: \u201cThe Tribe as a whole, as well as my true self, will not move. I\u2019ll send this clone ahead to that alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding Nascent Soul Cultivators nodded. Regarding Meng Hao\u2019s bizarre divine abilities, they were already used to them. To them, it was simply how things should be.</p><br/><p>The black-cloaked figure turned to Elder Sun. \u201cYou\u2019ve traveled through this area before, Elder Sun. Why don\u2019t you accompany me on this little expedition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Sun took a deep breath as he rose to his feet and then bowed.</p><br/><p>The Greatfather of the Crow Divinity Tribe also rose to his feet. He produced a bag of holding which he handed over to Meng Hao. This bag of holding contained a portion of the Tribe\u2019s Spirit Stones and other resources.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s black-cloaked Demonic Incarnation turned and flew off into the sky, followed by Elder Sun. In the blink of an eye, they turned into beams of colorful light that shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>After the Demonic Incarnation left, Meng Hao, who was still seated there cross-legged, opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll rest and reorganize here for a few days,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. \u201cAfterwards, whether we engage in business or war will depend on the will of the Tribe.\u201d Considering his position within the Tribe, his words actually counted as the voice of the Tribe.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Nascent Soul Cultivators nodded, and the Crow Divinity Tribe began to station themselves in the area. This would be their first period of prolonged rest during the entire migration.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Meng Hao\u2019s black-cloaked Demonic Incarnation flew through the air of the Western Desert Central region, along with Elder Sun.</p><br/><p>They moved at high speed, occasionally employing minor teleportation as they headed directly toward the alliance of Tribes.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Meng Hao asked, \u201cElder Sun, do you have any former acquaintances in this area?\u201d He\u2019d come to find that Elder Sun seemed very familiar with the region. Occasionally the man would look around at the scenery with what appeared to be a wistful expression.</p><br/><p>Elder Sun chuckled. \u201cTo be honest with you, exalted Sacred Ancient, I actually made a few enemies in this area some years ago. They chased me around, trying to kill me, which is how I came to be more familiar with the area.\u201d Elder Sun was skinny and wizened, and had a mustache shaped like the character . On the left side of his face was a scar that stretched all the way down to his neck, making his appearance especially sinister.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded, and declined to make further inquiries. The two of them continued to fly through the air in beams of colorful light.</p><br/><p>Time flashed by. They were able to move with incredible speed, traveling in ten days what it would take the flying machine one month.</p><br/><p>Actually, it took that long because of Elder Sun. Were Meng Hao traveling alone using his Demonic Incarnation, it would only take five days.</p><br/><p>One day, an area appeared up ahead on the plain. More than ten thousand tents were arranged in concentric rings around a city. They were densely packed in special patterns that made it look like a spell formation with protective powers.</p><br/><p>The more than ten thousand tents were organized into groups that made up eight different patterns like sealing marks, which of course represented the eight different Tribes which formed the alliance.</p><br/><p>The city was located in the very center. From his position up in the air, Meng Hao could see quite a few Cultivators coming and going. The whole scene was quite lively.</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao and Elder Sun were about three thousand meters away, the voice of an old man suddenly called out from the direction of the allied Tribes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome to the Eight Branch Alliance. We are an alliance formed by eight different Tribes, and are camping in this area for five months. During that time, flying is prohibited for three thousand meters in all directions. Fellow Daoists, if you have come to do business, then you are welcome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as the words could be heard, an old man suddenly appeared in front of Meng Hao and Elder Sun. On his face could be seen some blotchy, brown marks. He looked over Meng Hao and Elder Sun and then continued, \u201cI am Ou Yunzi. Fellow Daoists, you don\u2019t look familiar. I\u2019m curious as to where you might have come from.\u201d After examining Elder Sun, his eyes came to rest on Meng Hao, whereupon his pupils constricted.</p><br/><p>Ou Yunzi was at the early Nascent Soul stage, so the fact that he could not see the Cultivation base of this black-cloaked man caused his heart to fill with vigilance.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Meng Hao did not plan to speak, Elder Sun laughingly clasped hands and said, \u201cI am Sun Dahai. Our Tribe is migrating from the Western Desert North region, and are passing through the area. We heard that the Eight Branch Alliance built a city in the area, and thus decided to come trade for a few necessary items.\u201d [1]</p><br/><p>Ou Yunzi\u2019s eyes shifted away from Sun Dahai to look behind him and Meng Hao, where of course there was nothing. His expression ordinary, he suddenly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Eight Branch Alliance welcomes all Fellow Daoists who wish to engage in business. Welcome, both of you!\u201d With a laugh, he turned and gestured welcomingly. The three of them descended to the ground and began to walk toward the Eight Branch Alliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fact that you managed to migrate from the Western Desert North region all the way to here indicates that your Tribe is definitely extraordinary, Fellow Daoist Sun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, there were many twists and turns along the way, and we experienced many things. But, let\u2019s not talk about that. Fellow Daoist Ou, from the look of things, your Eight Branch Alliance seems highly likely to be able to enter the Black Lands. I offer you my congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your auspicious words, Fellow Daoist Sun. May I inquire, what sort of items are you looking to acquire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, nothing special. Just some odds and ends, although if there are any neo-demon hordes for sale, that would be excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing and smiling, Sun Dahai continued to chat vaguely with Ou Yunzi as they walked along.</p><br/><p>The entire time, Meng Hao remained silent, allowing Sun Dahai and Ou Yunzi to feel each other out.</p><br/><p>When they reached the border of the allied Tribes, Ou Yunzi smiled and clasped hands and watched as Sun Dahai and Meng Hao entered the city. Afterwards, a dour look appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a man\u2019s voice could be heard: \u201cBrother Ou, is there something fishy about those two?\u201d</p><br/><p>The air rippled next to Ou Yunzi as a man and a woman appeared. Both were middle-aged. The man wore a long scholar\u2019s robe and the woman was dressed in a Lady\u2019s gown. [1. Specifically, she is described as wearing the kind of casual garment that royal concubines or princesses would wear. Here are some pictures]</p><br/><p>Ou Yunzi glanced over at the two and then slowly said, \u201cThey say that they came from the North region. I didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary about that Cultivator named Sun. As for the black-cloaked man next to him, I couldn\u2019t see the level of his Cultivation base. Furthermore, his aura was cold and dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to forestall any mishaps, I suggest we allow them to be on their way of their own accord and\u2026\u201d Before Ou Yunzi could finish, he was interrupted rather impolitely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about,\u201d said the woman in the Lady\u2019s gown. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t possibly be a Spirit Severing Patriarch. Even if he\u2019s of the late Nascent Soul stage, he\u2019s only one person. The net has already been cast out. When it comes time to draw it in, no mishaps will occur. Fellow Daoist Ou, there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scholarly looking man laughed, and his eyes flickered coldly. \u201cHe\u2019s only one trifling person. Brother Ou, there\u2019s no need to take him to heart. We will let the net remain cast a few more days, and then, according to the agreement reached by the Elders, we will draw it in. If those two really came from the North region, along with their Tribe, then we\u2019ll be able to catch quite a big fish!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man laughed, and the woman continued, \u201cWhen the time comes to draw in the net, their Tribe will be revealed, and will become resources for our Eight Branch Alliance. Then, our months of rest here will not have been in vain.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of it will just count as bad fortune for them! They won\u2019t be able to blame anyone but themselves!\u201d With that, the man and woman departed.</p><br/><p>Ou Yunzi frowned. After a long moment, he shook his head. \u201cMaybe I really am just thinking too much into it.\u201d With that, he turned and disappeared.</p><br/><p>After entering the city, Meng Hao and Sun Dahai split up. Sun Dahai had practiced Cultivation for many years, and was experienced and astute. He was adept in making discreet inquiries and collecting news, so Meng Hao decided to stroll about the city alone. When he saw all the people, and the proliferation of various shops and stores, he was astonished.</p><br/><p>This place was quite large, and although you couldn\u2019t say that it had everything, there was quite a variety of things to purchase, from neo-demon hordes, to powerful solitary neo-demons, even a quite a bit of rather shoddy medicinal pills. There were even flying magical items.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there were no prices listed, only indications that these items could be purchased through auction. Even still, Meng Hao was able to get a feel for the majesty of the city. There were many Cultivators; it seemed the city could hold nearly ten thousand people, making the place quite bustling.</p><br/><p>As he walked, Meng Hao\u2019s pupils suddenly constricted as he noticed what appeared at first to be a simple structure, but was actually a luxurious shop. This shop happened to specialize in totems!</p><br/><p>Different Tribes had different totem branding methods, and this place happened to sell a variety of such methods for a variety of prices. This shop instantly caught Meng Hao\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>After careful examination, he found that most were relatively cheap, and were only designed for functionality, not for providing Cultivation base breakthrough.</p><br/><p>After looking around for a while, he felt that he understood the city a lot better. About two hours later, he had managed to stroll through about half of the city, when suddenly, he stopped in place.</p><br/><p>He had just sensed a bit of Demonic Qi coming from a shop nearby. After looking over, he was able to identify which shop; it was a place that sold totemic Sacred Ancients!</p><br/><p>Perhaps a better way to say it was that these were incredibly powerful neo-demons that could be turned into totems!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered, and he was just about to enter the shop when suddenly a man appeared in front of him. He was dressed like a scholar; this was none other than the man who had been speaking with Ou Yunzi earlier.</p><br/><p>The man laughed and blocked Meng Hao\u2019s way.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist, the things in this shop will be up for auction in seven days. If you want them, you can purchase them at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the man with cold, glittering eyes. Without a word, he turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged scholar\u2019s pupils constricted. When Meng Hao had looked at him, the man had used Divine Sense to try to feel Meng Hao out. However, all the Divine Sense could make out regarding the black-cloaked man was rippling nothingness. It couldn\u2019t pierce inside, not even the slightest bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man is very strange\u2026\u201d said the scholar, his eyes narrowing.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he walked through the city. However, deep within his cloak, his eyes gleamed with coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is pretty interesting. It seems almost everything is purchasable only at the auction\u2026. Everything seems ordinary, but if you think about it carefully\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><ol><li><span id=\"footnote-1\">Sun Dahai\u2019s name in Chinese is  - s\u016bn d\u00e0 h\u01cei.

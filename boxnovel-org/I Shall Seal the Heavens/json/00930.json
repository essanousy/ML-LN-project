Their first battle!</p><br/><p>Rumbling filled the air as the colors of gold and blood smashed into each other. The night sky suddenly grew bright as the power of reincarnation and the Black White Pearls collided, causing Heaven and Earth to tremble. Massive roaring echoed out in all directions.</p><br/><p>The Blood Demon head collapsed, and the world of gold shattered. The sensation of reincarnation faded away\u2026 and Meng Hao\u2019s Black White Pearls also collapsed.</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through Meng Hao, and his Eternal stratum immediately surged into action, giving him the power to completely shrug off the blow. What all onlookers saw was that Fang Wei\u2019s palm strike did nothing to stop him! He didn\u2019t even pause\u2026 he just stepped right into the East Ascension Pavilion!</p><br/><p>Fang Wei\u2019s eyes brimmed with icy coldness, and his face had turned a bit pale. Although he had been separated from Meng Hao\u2019s counterstrike to his palm attack, he was still struck by the backlash.</p><br/><p>Most shocking of all was that this was Brightmoon Lake, a place where Fang Wei practiced cultivation. He had formed a resonance with the lake water, and therefore held the upper hand. Furthermore, Meng Hao had been protecting Fang Xi.</p><br/><p>In the end, however, it was really difficult to determine which of them was actually more powerful!</p><br/><p>Almost in the same moment that Meng Hao set foot into the pavilion, dozens of Blackmoon Guards flew out across the lake toward him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao completely ignored them. Instead, his cold gaze flitted across the crowd and came to fall on Fang Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Cousin Fang Wei, why is it that I\u2019m not qualified to enter this pavilion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone who is being pursued by the Blackmoon Guards is naturally not qualified to set foot inside,\u201d Fang Wei replied coolly. The Blackmoon Guards were closing in on the pavilion, and even more were now converging further out beyond the lakeshore. Furthermore, it would only be a short time before their true experts arrived.</p><br/><p>In his heart, Fang Wei laughed coldly. He truly wanted to see how Meng Hao could possibly resolve the current situation.</p><br/><p>Fang Xi\u2019s face was ashen as he stood there next to Meng Hao, panting. He had never been inside the East Ascension Pavilion before, and would normally have been very excited. Right now though, the Blackmoon Guards were moments away from catching up, and when he thought about what would happen then, he couldn\u2019t help but take a deep breath and brace himself to go for broke.</p><br/><p>He had already decided that because all of this was happening because of him, he would take full responsibility, and make sure that the clan didn\u2019t cause any problems for Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d replied Meng Hao, smiling. Sharp whistling sounds could be heard as seven or eight Blackmoon Guards shot through the air behind him. Their expressions brimmed with killing intent, and they were just about to attack when\u2026</p><br/><p>Meng Hao casually raised his hand and showed something to the Blackmoon Guards behind him.</p><br/><p>Then, without even turning his head, he coldly barked, \u201cScrew off!\u201d</p><br/><p>As his voice echoed out, the Blackmoon Guards outside of the pavilion saw the item in his hand. Their faces fell, and they suddenly stopped in place, staring in disbelief at Meng Hao\u2019s hand, and the object therein.</p><br/><p>Then they began to pant. Meanwhile, more Blackmoon Guards converged in the area. All of them had the same reaction, as if lightning were crashing around inside their minds.</p><br/><p>The dozens of nearby Blackmoon Guards, and the hundreds that were gathered further off, all stared wordlessly in shock.</p><br/><p>When the Chosen in the East Ascension Pavilion saw what was happening, their eyes gleamed with a strange light. Fang Wei suddenly seemed to remember something, and his face turned extremely unsightly. Fang Yunyi gaped, unsure of how to react to this sudden development.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand what the Blackmoon Guards had seen that would suddenly cause them to stop in place and not dare to get any closer.</p><br/><p>Fang Hong stared in shock. Fang Xiangshan hesitated. Fang Donghan\u2019s eyes shone with curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you still doing here?\u201d said Meng Hao icily, still not deigning to look behind him.</p><br/><p>The instant the words left his mouth, the Blackmoon Guards behind him gasped. They suddenly clasped hands and bowed to Meng Hao, then bitterly turned and made their way off.</p><br/><p>Many among the audience around Brightmoon Lake saw this, and gaped in shock. They had just personally witnessed the Blackmoon Guards, brimming with killing intent, suddenly stop in place and then retreat en masse, clearly not daring to get even an inch closer.</p><br/><p>There were a few people in the crowd who had exceptional eyesight, and managed to catch a glimpse of the object Meng Hao held in his hand. They gasped, and expressions of blank disbelief appeared on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe command medallion of a tier 8 alchemist!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same as a clan Elder\u2019s command medallion\u2026. A tier 8 alchemist\u2019s command medallion!! That gives him the same status as a clan Elder! And clan Elders\u2026 are qualified to order the Blackmoon Guards to stand down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Hao concocted a Skypalace Sunspirit Pill, which means that he instantly became a tier 8 alchemist!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sounds of the tumult outside drifted into the pavilion, causing the cultivators gathered there to inhale sharply.</p><br/><p>Fang Xi gaped, and then suddenly went wild with joy.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao slowly lowered his hand, looking at Fang Wei with a slight smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you say I\u2019m qualified now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Wei\u2019s expression was extremely unsightly as he stared at Meng Hao. Before he could even respond, Meng Hao stepped forward and raised his right hand. Fang Yunyi\u2019s face fell, and he tried to escape, but his body involuntarily flew through the air toward Meng Hao, who grabbed him by the neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see me, and don\u2019t greet me properly,\u201d Meng Hao said, smiling, gently patting Fang Yunyi\u2019s cheek. \u201cAh, Yunyi, it seems that the last time I taught you a lesson, you just didn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s smile caused Fang Yunyi to begin to tremble. He was about to say something, when suddenly Meng Hao\u2019s face darkened and he slammed Fang Yunyi onto the floor of the pavilion.</p><br/><p>The pavilion was magically reinforced, and couldn\u2019t be damaged by such an action. It was incredibly tough, which resulted in Fang Yunyi letting out a bloodcurdling scream. Next, Meng Hao slammed him into the ground seven or eight more times.</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed from Fang Yunyi\u2019s mouth, and he screamed over and over again. He even begged for mercy. Fang Wei frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled and looked over at Fang Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnder my authority as an Elder, I\u2019m reprimanding a clan member. Junior Cousin Fang Wei, on what authority did you speak those two words to me just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Meng Hao grabbed Fang Yunyi by the hair, swung him around and then chucked him off to the side. Blood spattered everywhere. The Chosen in the room watched and said nothing. However, as they observed at Meng Hao\u2019s actions, each of them were thinking different things.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of Sun Hai, who was shivering slightly.</p><br/><p>Fang Wei\u2019s expression was extremely grim as he looked at Meng Hao. He was about to say something, when Meng Hao laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d he said, \u201cthe moon is out tonight, and the stars are bright. Tomorrow is the rise of the East Ascension Sun, an auspicious day. Besides, I see a lot of old friends here, which makes me happy. I won\u2019t make things any harder for you.\u201d He looked out at all the Chosen, each of whom had different expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>Sun Hai subconsciously bowed his head. Li Ling\u2019er stared in rage. Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s face flickered with killing intent, and Wang Mu looked like he wanted to fight then and there. Song Luodan and Taiyang Zi were both staring at him with clenched jaws.</p><br/><p>Their past experiences with Meng Hao were things that they would never be able to forget.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked slightly embarrassed, then chuckled bashfully as he looked down at the terrified Fang Yunyi, who lay there bedraggled and broken-boned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrite me a promissory note,\u201d Meng Hao said, narrowing his eyes and smiling. He immediately produced pen and paper from his bag of holding, which he held out in front of Fang Yunyi. \u201cYou know me, and you know what to write.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he patted Fang Yunyi on the head.</p><br/><p>Fang Yunyi\u2019s face was pale white. To him, Meng Hao was the most evil fiend imaginable in Heaven and Earth. Trembling, he used his own blood to write out a promissory note.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao accepted the promissory note, blew on it a bit to dry it, and gingerly placed it in his bag of holding as if it were a treasure. Then, he smiled at Fang Yunyi and said something that caused Fang Yunyi\u2019s blood to run cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cYunyi, you\u2019ll get no third chance. If you act like this again the next time you see me\u2026 I\u2019ll make sure you live a life worse than death.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s smile stretched from ear to ear, but his words were as cold as ice. It was a stark contrast that caused all of the Chosen in the pavilion to look on in reticent silence.</p><br/><p>Fang Yunyi started to pant and tremble, and his expression turned into one of extreme terror. He could sense the murderous intent in Meng Hao\u2019s words, and was also certain that when Meng Hao said he would do something\u2026 he would never fail to follow through on his promise.</p><br/><p>Fang Yunyi knew that if he did not respectfully greet Meng Hao the next time he saw him, Meng Hao would definitely\u2026 leave him wishing he were dead.</p><br/><p>He was frightened, well and truly frightened. Even Fang Wei was incapable of helping him in this situation, causing his fear to reach heights that it could not be described even with the word \u2018terror.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, screw off to whatever hole you crawled out of,\u201d said Meng Hao. He grabbed Fang Yunyi by the hair and violently tossed him out of the pavilion. Intense pain wracked Fang Yunyi\u2019s body as he flew out over Brightmoon Lake and landed in the middle of the crowd outside.</p><br/><p>After being helped to his feet, he left immediately, trying to put as much distance between himself and Meng Hao as possible. The entire time, his heart was gripped with icy terror.</p><br/><p>Back in the East Ascension Pavilion, Meng Hao looked around at the various Chosen, and a bashful smile appeared on his face, as if he were slightly embarrassed to have suddenly run into so many old friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Fellow Daoists!\u201d he said. \u201cWe meet again! I\u2019ve missed all of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking quite at ease, he walked up to Sun Hai and, before he could back away, slid his arm around his neck, as if they were good friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if it isn\u2019t L\u2019il Hai! How are you?! Have things been well? Why did you shave your head? Not bad, I think it\u2019s quite a unique hairstyle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Hai started to tremble, and he looked as if he might start crying at any moment. Meng Hao\u2019s shadow lurked perpetually in his heart, a point that could be seen clearly from his cleanly-shaven head.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao rubbed Sun Hai\u2019s shiny head and patted it a few times. Sun Hai choked with silent fury, feeling frustrated to the extreme. At this point, Meng Hao\u2019s gaze came to rest on Li Ling\u2019er. Subconsciously, he couldn\u2019t refrain from\u2026 looking at Li Ling\u2019er\u2019s curvaceous rear end.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya! Little sis Ling\u2019er, I haven\u2019t seen you for so long! You\u2019re even prettier than before. Your rear end\u2026 looks really nice\u2026.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me that way! You know, now that I think about it, we were actually engaged as children!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Ling\u2019er\u2019s expression was extremely dark as she stared at Meng Hao. Her chest rose and fell as she panted, and she looked like she was on the verge of exploding. Were it not for the fact that she knew she wasn\u2019t a match for Meng Hao, and that they were also in the Fang Clan, then she would definitely go all out to fight him.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Li Ling\u2019er was on the verge of bursting, Meng Hao quickly looked away, turning his attention to Fan Dong\u2019er. Instantly, his eyes brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? Inky! You\u2019re here too! Little sis Dong\u2019er, I\u2019ve already loaned you Inky for quite a while now, when will you be giving her back to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s eyes blazed with rage, and she raised her right hand. Cracking sounds could be heard as two violet flying daggers suddenly appeared. Mysterious flames hissed up from the daggers, and they emanated terrifying auras.</p><br/><p>\u201cI dare you to say one more word!\u201d she said through gritted teeth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

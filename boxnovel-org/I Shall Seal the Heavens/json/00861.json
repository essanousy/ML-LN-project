They were looking at the vortex screens, where the giant and the beasts were all bowing in worship to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>All of the sects wanted to recruit Meng Hao as a disciple, but the Nine Seas God World of the Three Great Daoist Societies had already made a move, leaving them with no opportunity.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the other Three Great Daoist Societies who were in such a position, but also the Five Great Holy Lands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Fang Mu is one of the most incredible Chosen to appear in countless years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations to the Nine Seas God World. Fang Mu will definitely demonstrate extraordinary talent and skill in the God World!\u201d In response to such words from the various Patriarchs, the old man from the Nine Seas God World laughed heartily. His expression was one of extreme contentment.</p><br/><p>By now, it was clear that Fang Mu was definitely in first place in this trial by fire!</p><br/><p>Of course, the crowds outside in the Ninth Mountain and Sea were in commotion. When it came to the final two stages of the heart and the Dao, Meng Hao was the first person to ever clear the entire stage. Not even Sir Fan had been able to do so.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had earned everyone\u2019s complete and utter attention!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe definitely deserves to be in first place!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis name will soon shake the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea. He\u2019s going to be number one among all Chosen! Once he joins the Nine Sea God World, if he continues on this path of growth, he\u2019ll definitely become a Divine Son! If he and Fan Dong\u2019er get together, then they\u2019ll definitely become a legend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t notice, but in the final twenty thousand deaths, Fang Mu was actually happy! Compared to the pain everyone else was in, that\u2019s probably even more frightening!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the echo of discussion spread throughout the Ninth Mountain and Sea, Patriarch Reliance was out in the starry sky, looked quite pleased. Then, he suddenly shuddered.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! I\u2019ve been thinking about this wrong! What the hell does that little bastard\u2019s life or death have to do with me? His being the center of attention has nothing to do with the Patriarch! We\u2019re enemies! Dammit! Dammit! I\u2019ve been looking at it all wrong!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Also somewhere in the starry sky was the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, his hair disheveled, his eyes narrowed as he looked off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong\u2026 much stronger than I remember,\u201d he murmured. Deep within his eyes flickered the glow of Wang Tengfei\u2019s spirit. \u201cMeng Hao, I truly can\u2019t wait until the moment when we meet again!\u201d With that, he turned and disappeared into the distance.</p><br/><p>In the Kunlun Society, Pill Demon and Chu Yuyan looked on with trembling hearts. Having personally witnessed everything that had gone on in the trial by fire, were they not already aware that Fang Mu was Meng Hao, they would never have possibly drawn a connection between the two.</p><br/><p>Fang Mu\u2026 really was the complete focus of attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlanet South Heaven is too small,\u201d Chu Yuyan murmured, a twinge of obsession visible in her eyes. \u201cYou were being held back there. Your world\u2026 is out among the stars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Back on Planet South Heaven, in the Fang Clan in the vast Eastern Lands, Meng Hao\u2019s parents looked at the vortex screens with smiles on their faces. Of course, buried within those smiles were emotional sighs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er really is going to leave us,\u201d murmured his mother, her voice soft.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, his father gently said, \u201cPlanet South Heaven is too small for him, and was limiting his growth. He was bound to leave South Heaven sooner or later. After this trial by fire is over, I won\u2019t try to get him to stay too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s just a child,\u201d she replied bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s grown up. If you don\u2019t let him fly, how can he ever come to know the boundless universe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on Planet West Felicity, Zhao Yifan was polishing his sword, and the desire to fight flashed within his eyes. Then he looked away from the vortex screen up in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must not underestimate all of the other members of my generation out there. I never imagined someone else like Meng Hao of Planet South Heaven existed. But now, this Fang Mu appears in the trial by fire!\u201d The desire to fight burned hot in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly hope that you participate in the arena matches!\u201d said Zhao Yifan, taking a deep breath and then closing his eyes. He would of course take part in the arena matches, and would actually lead the disciples of the Sublime Sword Flow Grotto into the fighting.</p><br/><p>Only one cultivator from the Nascent Soul, Spirit Severing, and Dao Seeking stages would come out victorious in the arena matches. Then, they would be recruited as a disciple by one of the Three Great Daoist Societies, and become a Conclave disciple at that.</p><br/><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that participation was restricted. On the contrary, if disciples from the Three Great Daoist Societies participated and took first place, then they would also be able to join the Conclave.</p><br/><p>As far as other sects went, they did not participate for the chance to join a Daoist Society, but rather, for the incredible prizes offered up in the arena matches.</p><br/><p>In the Nine Seas God World, Fan Dong\u2019er sat cross-legged with her eyes closed. Her complexion was ashen, and there seemed to be a trace of Karma in it. For some reason, she kept thinking about Meng Hao, whom she hated with a passion that had permeated even her bones.</p><br/><p>Behind her, as always, was the female corpse. When her master saw the corpse, he did not attempt to help her get rid of it. Instead, he told her that it was good fortune for her.</p><br/><p>However, Fan Dong\u2019er did not wish to have good fortune like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come just looking at this Fang Mu pisses me off!?\u201d thought Fan Dong\u2019er as she looked up at the vortex screen, her graceful brow furrowed. She was another of the Chosen who would participate in the arena matches.</p><br/><p>In the Li Clan on Planet North Reed, Li Ling\u2019er\u2019s expression was indifferent as she sat cross-legged in the clan\u2019s Daoist rite centers. Seated in front of her was a large group of Li Clan members, all of whom were listening to her give a speech about cultivation. To these clan members, Li Ling\u2019er was like a celestial goddess, selfless, incorruptible, and aloof.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, the vortex screens up above would draw the attention of the Li Clan members, and even Li Ling\u2019er would occasionally look over.</p><br/><p>When the clan members asked her if she would participate in the arena matches\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I will!\u201d she responded coolly.</p><br/><p>Taiyang Zi, as well as Sun Hai of the Church of the Emperor Immortal, were both required by their sects to participate in the fighting. Virtually all of the sects and clans sent their Chosen to join the arena matches.</p><br/><p>Some of them were people Meng Hao knew, but many were Chosen who hadn\u2019t ever been to Planet South Heaven.</p><br/><p>In the outside world, everyone was preparing for the arena matches. As for Meng Hao, the world around him shattered into pieces. When he reappeared, he was back in the lead position on the Ancient Road of Dao Seeking.</p><br/><p>Behind him were all the other competitors in the trial by fire. They looked at Meng Hao with awe in their eyes, even the masked young man and the cultivator with the mosquitos.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had used his own strength to crush the other participants in virtually every way.</p><br/><p>Ling Yunzi materialized up in midair. He hovered there, looking at the crowd for a moment before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ten stages of testing have concluded,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cBeing responsible for the Ancient Road of Dao Seeking, I will now select one thousand people to continue.\u201d With that, he waved his hand, causing several thousand Dao Seeking cultivators to instantly vanish, teleported back to their places of origin.</p><br/><p>One thousand people remained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you have passed the testing phase. Next, you may decide whether or not to participate in the arena matches.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the arena matches, anyone who makes it to the top 100 will receive a prize of 1,000 Immortal jades. Perhaps some of you are unfamiliar with Immortal jades. They are objects that can be used in cultivation after you reach the Immortal Realm. They are a rare thing in the Ninth Mountain and Sea. 1,000 Immortal jades is similar in value to 10,000,000 spirit stones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Meng Hao hadn\u2019t been very interested in participating in the arena matches. However, when he heard this, his eyes went wide and began to shine with a bright light.</p><br/><p>\u201c10,000,000 spirit stones\u2026.\u201d he thought, panting. \u201cThe Three Great Daoist Societies are way too rich! You get 10,000,000 spirit stones just for getting in the top 100?!?!\u201d Meng Hao was now feeling a bit excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you get into the top 16, the prize is 5,000 Immortal jades,\u201d Ling Yunzi continued. As his voice echoed out, Meng Hao got even more excited. All of the remaining participants were now panting eagerly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you reach the top 8, the prize is 10,000 Immortal jades!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind filled with roaring, and he was mentally adding up how much 10,000 plus 5,000 plus 1,000 Immortal jades was in spirit stones. After finishing the calculation, his eyes began to shine with fierce light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prize for reaching the top 4 is an Immortality Illumination Vine!\u201d continued Ling Yunzi, which instantly caused many among the thousand remaining participants to cry out loud in disbelief. Meng Hao didn\u2019t seem to care too much, but the eyes of the others around him instantly went completely bloodshot.</p><br/><p>To most people, Immortal jades were just material wealth, and although they could be used in cultivation, that wouldn\u2019t help until the Immortal Realm. However, an Immortality Illumination Vine could completely change one\u2019s fate in life, and could make true Immortal Ascension possible!</p><br/><p>This was especially important because of the fact that a true Immortal had recently appeared on Planet South Heaven. In the following thousand years, Immortality Illumination Vines could be considered precious treasures to everyone, except perhaps Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>They could change fate and determine the future!</p><br/><p>There were different prizes offered on the other two Ancient Roads. However, regardless of the stage they were in, when the cultivators found out what rewards that were being offered, it sent their blood boiling. They weren\u2019t the only ones. When the crowds in the Ninth Mountain and Sea heard of the prizes available on the three Ancient Roads, their eyes went bloodshot, and they began to breathe heavily. Were it not for the fact that they didn\u2019t possess the requisite qualifications, they too would be there to participate in the fighting.</p><br/><p>This was especially true when they heard that one of the prizes on the Ancient Path of Dao Seeking was an Immortality Illumination Vine.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the prize is... an Immortality Illumination Vine!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! If I had known that, I would have participated! In the next thousand years, anyone who has an Immortality Illumination Vine has a high likelihood of becoming a true Immortal!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue Immortality! Although using an Immortality Illumination Vine doesn\u2019t measure up to seizing destiny, it doesn\u2019t matter how you become a true Immortal among the stars, you\u2019re still a true Immortal!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Yunzi looked out with satisfaction at all the looks of shock. However, when he looked at Meng Hao, he could tell that although he was cheering like everyone else, it seemed a bit perfunctory. After a moment of thought, Ling Yunzi spoke out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu, although you are a Conclave disciple of the Nine Seas God World, if you don\u2019t perform enough meritorious service in the future, you won\u2019t be awarded with an Immortality Illumination Vine. You must seize this opportunity to acquire one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao quickly nodded his head, and then suddenly asked, \u201cHow many spirit stones is an Immortality Illumination Vine worth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Yunzi\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re priceless,\u201d he responded. \u201cIf you put one up for auction, it\u2019s very likely that it would sell for millions of Immortal jades.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao heard that, his mind spun, and he began to tremble. Immediately, his eyes went completely bloodshot, and his expression turned completely vicious.</p><br/><p>Seeing Meng Hao like this caused Ling Yunzi to clear his throat. He was gradually starting to understand Meng Hao\u2019s personality a bit more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoever takes first place will receive a prize of\u2026.\u201d Ling Yunzi paused dramatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cA drop of blood passed down by the Three Great Paragons!\u201d</p><br/><p>The response to his words was complete silence. However, there were some people who began to tremble, and expressions of intense disbelief covered their faces, looks that exceeded the ones that had appeared when they were told about the Immortality Illumination Vines. The outside world was quiet too, but only for a moment, after which a great tumult broke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cA drop of blood from the Three Great Paragons! Heavens! That would contain the Dao of the Three Great Paragons!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Three Great Paragons!? According to legend, they were powerful experts from ancient times. They\u2026 they actually left behind a drop of blood!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this for real?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the Patriarchs in the starry sky palace could hardly believe it. They shot to their feet, panting, expressions of shock written on their faces.</p><br/><p>Only Meng Hao didn\u2019t seem to have much of a reaction. However, Ling Yunzi\u2019s next words, which were clearly directed at him, caused Meng Hao\u2019s heart to skip a beat.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu, if you put this drop of Paragon\u2019s blood up for auction, it would be easier to find a phoenix feather or a qilin horn than to find someone in the Ninth Mountain who could afford it.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

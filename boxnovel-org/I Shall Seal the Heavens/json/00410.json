It closed in on the Outlander Beast, radiating frenzy and determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat neo-demon certainly is loyal to its master\u2026.\u201d said the Earth Priest with a soft sigh. He had seen many neo-demons, but few that would show such care for a master, that would display such madness and ignore everything else in order to protect him.</p><br/><p>The parrot\u2019s excitement actually appeared to others as determination. Furthermore, its joy at being able to try out a new furred beast made it seem as if it were loyally protecting its master.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the Earth Priest that was thinking in this way. Many of the other Crow Scout Tribe members saw the scene that was playing out, and the parrot within the multicolored light, and were filled with admiration.</p><br/><p>They watched as the multicolored beam of light that was the parrot shot toward the Outlander Beast, which roared as it approached. The parrot ignored everything, seemingly ignoring any potential threats to its life, willing to die together with the Outlander Beast. It whistled through the air, circling around behind the Outlander Beast, whereupon it charged in to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat parrot neo-demon is extraordinary!\u201d said the Earth Priest, flabbergasted. \u201cIt actually knows that the Outlander Beast\u2019s only weak spot is not its front but its back!\u201d The admiration in his eyes grew stronger.</p><br/><p>The Grand Elder\u2019s eyes grew wide as he watched what was happening. He too was astonished by everything that was happening. The Greatfather\u2019s face flickered, and his eyes grew wide. He glanced at the Earth Priest, and then at the parrot. He suddenly started to look a bit suspicious.</p><br/><p>Off to the side, Meng Hao heard the Earth Priest\u2019s words and coughed lightly. He looked over and could see that the Earth Priest really did deeply admire the parrot. Meng Hao sighed inwardly at the man\u2019s simplicity, realizing that he himself really had changed quite a bit over the years.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the determined parrot looked like it was about to fulfill its dream. Looking like the member of a suicide squad, its eyes red, trembling with excitement, it shot toward the Outlander Beast. However, at the critical moment, the Outlander Beast suddenly flickered and then disappeared. A moment later, it reappeared in a different location.</p><br/><p>Apparently, it could sense the parrot\u2019s motives. It\u2019s eyes filled with fury and it roared: \u201cOutlander!\u201d</p><br/><p>The roar completely disoriented the parrot, and sent it tumbling backward through the air. It couldn\u2019t even get close; it looked like this Outlander Beast really was causing it some problems. However, the parrot wouldn\u2019t let some slight setbacks knock it out of the game. It let out a shrill squawk, and its eyes glowed with anticipation. Its appearance was that of both excitement and lechery fused together. The combination made it look quite vulgar and lewd. Once again, it shot toward the Outlander Beast in a colorful glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a loyal neo-demon!\u201d cried the Earth Priest, clearly moved. \u201cA truly rare neo-demon of utmost loyalty! Look everyone, despite being injured, it persists, bravely defying death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of the surrounding Crow Scout Tribe members felt the same way.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster Meng sure is lucky to have a neo-demon as loyal as that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It looks a little bit ugly, but its moral character is definitely worthy of praise!\u201d</p><br/><p>They looked at the parrot with envy in their pure, simple hearts. They wished that they, too, could have such a devoted and faithful neo-demon.</p><br/><p>However, even as the Earth Priest and the various envious Tribe members were watching the parrot and sighing emotionally\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run, darling!\u201d cried the parrot, speeding up. \u201cLord Fifth is here to vanquish you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As his words echoed out and entered the ears of the Crow Scout Tribe members, strange expressions appeared on their faces. Their mouths dropped open as they realized what the parrot meant by its words. They could scarcely believe it.</p><br/><p>The Earth Priest looked shocked for a moment, but then a look of realization and then admiration appeared. \u201cSo, it can even employ strategy!\u201d he said, and then let out a long sigh. \u201cWhat a noble display of character to use such a tactic to prevent its master from being injured by the Outlander Beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the conclusion reached by the Earth Priest didn\u2019t seem very plausible, there were still some of the Crow Scout Tribe members who seemed to agree. However, most had strange looks on their faces. The Sky Priest looked over at the Earth Priest and was about to say something, then hesitated and simply smiled wryly.</p><br/><p>The Grand Elder was looking in shock at the Earth Priest as if he didn\u2019t even know the man.</p><br/><p>As for the Greatfather, the expression on his face grew even more strange, and he also could do nothing more than smile wryly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao coughed lightly once more. The naivet\u00e9 of the Earth Priest was something one didn\u2019t see very often.</p><br/><p>Up in mid-air, the parrot squawked as it shot toward the Outlander Beast, which roared and sent out an attack which manifested as terrifying ripples. They slammed into the charging parrot, making it impossible for it to near the Outlander Beast. However, its determination and excitement only continued to grow in the face of these setbacks. It seemed even more determined to try out this Outlander Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeyyy, you really can put up a fight. Struggle if you wish, my darling. That just makes Lord Fifth more excited!\u201d With a roar, the parrot charged again.</p><br/><p>It shot forward with incredible speed. As it neared, a popping sound could suddenly be heard as hundreds of parrots appeared, all of which shot toward the Outlander Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cStruggle away, my darling! Struggle and beg for mercy under Lord Fifth\u2019s pounding!\u201d The parrot roared with excitement as it neared the Outlander Beast, which howled back. The illusory parrots all exploded, but there was one parrot left which managed to successfully penetrate the Outlander Beast.</p><br/><p>The instant the penetration occurred, the Outlander Beast\u2019s body trembled, and a look of confusion filled its face. The look quickly turned into one of humiliation and unprecedented madness. It let out a howl that shook everything, louder than anything that had been heard up to this point. The loudness was such that it kicked up a violent tempest!</p><br/><p>A popping sound could be heard as the parrot suddenly appeared in mid-air off to the side. It was trembling excitedly, and its eyes were glowing. \u201cScream, scream your throat out! No one will come to save you!\u201d</p><br/><p>By this point, the surrounding Crow Scout Tribe members were watching on dumbstruck. Many of the ones who had previously thought the parrot to be loyal and brave, now had faces completely pale. It was as if their whole world had been overturned. They stared blankly up into the air at the indescribably vulgar parrot.</p><br/><p>The Earth Priest gaped again. However, it took only a moment before a bright glow began to shine in his eyes. It was a glow of admiration, and understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to provoke a reaction from the Outlander Beast, the parrot neo-demon is taunting it! What wisdom! What praiseworthy courage!\u201d The Earth Priest sighed. \u201cFellow Daoist Meng, you truly have incredible luck to possess a neo-demon like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Crow Scout Tribe Greatfather couldn\u2019t take it any longer and was about to say something. However, he then noticed the intense admiration in the eyes of the Earth Priest. The Greatfather sighed and held his tongue.</p><br/><p>As for the Grand Elder, he stood there with wide eyes, staring in shock at the Earth Priest. The Sky Priest also had a very strange expression on her face. The two of them then exchanged a wry smile.</p><br/><p>At the same time that the Earth Priest spoke, the parrot let out another squawk. It shot again toward the Outlander Beast, which let out another howl. Subsequently, the beast and the parrot engaged in a back and forth battle. The parrot, of course, did the giving and the Outlander Beast did the taking.</p><br/><p>Howls continued to ring out until finally the parrot let out a roar. It was unclear what technique it used specifically. Ignoring any potential injuries, it smashed through, once again penetrating into the Outlander Beast. The Outlander Beast let out a shocking howl, accompanied by a look of terror. It hovered in mid-air, trembling. As of this moment, it was no longer paying attention to Meng Hao\u2019s Demonic Qi. Instead, it turned and began to flee.</p><br/><p>The parrot once again materialized, trembling and looking excited. It looked proud at its subjugation of a beast that it had never tried out before. It let out a squawk as it shot in pursuit of the Outlander Beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run away, darling!\u201d it shouted. \u201cCome come, there are a few positions Lord Fifth hasn\u2019t tried. Don\u2019t run!\u201d With that it turned into a prismatic beam of light that raced after the Outlander Beast.</p><br/><p>The Crow Scout Tribe members witnessed this whole scene, as did the powerful experts from the other Tribes, via Divine Sense. All of them were left with trembling hearts and indescribably bizarre feelings.</p><br/><p>To see the mysterious Outlander Beast flee instead of fight\u2026 was thoroughly shocking. Even more astonishing was the parrot, who apparently didn\u2019t even fear death. Its method of attack was of course unimaginably bizarre.</p><br/><p>Seeing the parrot heading off into the distance, Meng Hao let out a sigh of relief. Having called the parrot over, he had prepared himself for the worst. Looking around at the strange expressions on the Crow Scout Tribe members, and the look of admiration in the eyes of the Earth Priest, Meng Hao made a firm decision to never again call the parrot unless it was absolutely necessary\u2026.</p><br/><p>As the crowds of people dispersed, the Greatfather gave Meng Hao a wry smile, and then forced out some words of praise regarding his totem tattoo. Then, shaking his head, he made his way off.</p><br/><p>The Grand Elder looked over Meng Hao with a serious expression, then gave him a rare bow. After that, he and the equally conflicted Sky Priest left the district behind the mountain.</p><br/><p>As for the Earth Priest, it looked like he wanted to say a few words to Meng Hao. However, when he noticed that Meng Hao didn't seem concerned at all regarding the safety of the parrot, he simply gave him a stern and disapproving glare and then turned into a prismatic beam of light that shot off in the direction the parrot had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled wryly, not sure of what to say. He simply watched the Earth Priest disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that naive Earth Priest ever realizes what the parrot is really like, the man\u2019s sky will no longer be blue, and he will no longer view life as beautiful\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao thought about what that scene might look like, and then felt somewhat sorry for the Earth Priest. Finally, he turned and made his way back to his courtyard.</p><br/><p>Two days passed. On evening of the second day, the Earth Priest returned. He looked somewhat distracted, and his face was pale as if he had been the subject of a vicious attack. After returning, he went directly into secluded meditation.</p><br/><p>During the two days, Meng Hao found that whenever he went out, the Crow Scout Tribe members that caught sight of him looked at him with awe. Sometimes it even bordered on fear, as if they feared offending him, and didn\u2019t dare to approach him. As soon as they saw him, sweat would break out on their foreheads and they would hurry off in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>At long last, the wickedness of the parrot was having an effect on Meng Hao. It didn\u2019t take long before the entire Crow Scout Tribe knew about the events regarding Grandmaster Meng\u2019s wicked neo-demon. The news rapidly began to spread to the other four Tribes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This vibration was intense, and seemed to encompass the entire mirror, starting from within.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was shocked, but his expression didn\u2019t change. His gaze flashed as he looked at Demon Weapon Lonelytomb.</p><br/><p>The first time he encountered Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, he had received the Devil Construct, incarnated into the Devil Spear. He had also learned how the real Demon Weapon Lonelytomb was sealed within an ancient battlefield.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao also knew that the ancient battlefield had something to do with the Demon Immortal Sect. Once inside the Demon Immortal Sect, he should have been able to use the reaction of the Devil Construct to locate Lonelytomb!</p><br/><p>However, throughout all his experiences in the First, Second and Third Plane, he hadn\u2019t been able to find even the slightest trail to follow. And yet here\u2026 in the lands of the Fourth Plane\u2026 he finally had a trail!</p><br/><p>The white-robed man with the black and white hair was none other than\u2026 the Third Generation Demon Sealer! And the spear in his hand was none other than\u2026 Demon Weapon Lonelytomb!</p><br/><p>One man, one spear, hovering in mid-air, splitting everything under Heaven into three parts!</p><br/><p>His energy shook the Demon Tribes and leveled immense pressure onto the Cultivators. It was as if in Heaven and Earth, although he might not be the ultimate supremacy, he was still esteemed and respected to the utmost degree.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind trembled as he looked at the Third Generation Demon Sealer, and he began to breathe heavily. This truly was\u2026 a Demon Sealer!</p><br/><p>When he saw the Third Generation Demon Sealer\u2019s energy, Meng Hao suddenly felt intense anticipation regarding his own path as the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer. He suddenly wished to one day be able to hover in mid-air and split everything under Heaven!</p><br/><p>Everything that was happening inside the mirror continent filled Meng Hao with shock, and also astonished all of the Cultivators from South Heaven, who were all breathing heavily. It was at this point that the eyes of the emaciated old man flickered. This was none other than the old man who had been first to enter the passageway from the Third Plane. He performed a minor teleportation as he headed toward the mirror below.</p><br/><p>The movement immediately attracted the attention of the others. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he watched him.</p><br/><p>The emaciated old man moved with incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, he was standing on the surface of the mirror that made up this huge continent. Then he began to move forward. It almost looked as if he were about to enter the ancient battlefield. However, he actually was only moving across the surface of the mirror.</p><br/><p>He abruptly came to a stop after a few breaths of time. He pushed his hand down onto the surface of the mirror, which seemed to stimulate it, causing distortions to appear. Suddenly, a middle-aged man appeared across from the old man, except within the ancient world. He wore a suit of battle armor, and when he lifted up his hand, a fireball appeared, within which could be seen a crimson bird.</p><br/><p>Originally, everything visible existed only within the mirror. However, due to the stimulation provided by the old man, and some other unknown reasons, the crimson bird suddenly flew out from inside the mirror.</p><br/><p>It seemed to have broken through some sort of seal to fly out from inside the mirror and then appear on the outside!</p><br/><p>It was currently shrinking in size, and its flames were growing dim. It looked quite different than it had inside the mirror. And yet, as soon as it appeared on the outside, it emanated a powerful aura!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the flame bird that appeared. Shockingly, a moment later, four beams of light shot out through the distortions. Within these beams of light could be seen two swords, a fan, and a flying shuttle.</p><br/><p>The four items flew out explosively just behind the flame bird. As for the old man, he laughed and flew into the air, waving his sleeve toward the flame bird to capture it.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked at what was happening, and yet, they didn\u2019t hesitate. In the blink of an eye, dozens of people flew up into the air toward the four beams of light and the magical items within.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao moved the quickest. Even as the old man was subduing the flame bird, Meng Hao passed everyone to lay hands on the green-colored flying shuttle.</p><br/><p>It was shaped like an awl, and glittered with blinding light. The coldness which emanated off it was oppressive. As soon as Meng Hao touched it, he felt as if his body was filled with winter. Eyes glittering, he entered the Second Anima and held tightly to the flying shuttle.</p><br/><p>His body flickered and he stretched out his left hand. A gale force wind screamed out, causing the Ji Clan members and Northern Reaches cultivators who were pursuing the fan to be sent tumbling backward. Even as they came to a stop, Meng Hao closed in and swept his arm to snatch the fan.</p><br/><p>The moment he touched it, an indescribable heat exploded out within him. Meng Hao gave a cold snort and, without hesitation, entered the Fifth Anima!</p><br/><p>His powerful fleshly body and shocking cultivation base instantly suppressed the flying shuttle and the fan. They struggled, but couldn\u2019t fly out of Meng Hao\u2019s hand. He quickly put them into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the two flying swords were snatched up by others. Fang Yu managed to get one, Ji Mingkong the other. Everyone else could only watch on with unsightly expressions at the others who had acquired treasures. Then they looked over at the emaciated old man.</p><br/><p>The old man finally put away the flame bird. His acquisition was clearly the best of all, which anyone could see. The flame bird was a precious treasure. As for the other items, although they were extraordinary, they couldn\u2019t compare.</p><br/><p>The old man laughed hoarsely, then glanced over the group from South Heaven. His gaze stopped for a moment on Meng Hao, whereupon it seemed to fill with dread. Finally, he looked back at the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoists, there is quite a bit of good fortune to be had in this place. There\u2019s no need to stare at me collecting things, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He chuckled, then backed up a few paces. He lifted up his right hand, and although the move seemed casual, pulsating rings of light could be seen within.</p><br/><p>Ji Mingkong\u2019s position amongst the Ji Clan members had been second only to the now deceased Ji Mingfeng. He looked at the old man and growled, \u201cThere may be more good fortune, but you seem to know a lot more about it than we do.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words caused the eyes of everyone present to begin to glitter brightly. Clearly, everyone was extremely interested in how the old man had extracted items from within the mirror.</p><br/><p>The old man laughed, then slowly began to speak: \u201cWell, it\u2019s actually easy to explain. Any of you can do exactly as I did. This is the Fourth Plane, and not many people ever make it here. Therefore, few people in the outside world know much about what it\u2019s like.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mirror-like continent beneath us is actually a seal. Sealed inside is a battlefield, or perhaps, an entire world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithin the seal, time is eternal. If you can stimulate it from the outside, and open a breach, then you can create a storm within the eternal time inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like causing a reverse black hole. The objects inside will be sucked out to scatter into the outside world. Of course, that process will cause said objects to be weakened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for exactly how to do it, I don\u2019t think you need me to go into a detailed explanation. The battlefield beneath us is enormous, and the potential acquisitions all depend on your own luck.\u201d Having finished his explanation, the old man gave a final glance to the crowd of people, then flashed off into the distance at top speed.</p><br/><p>Everyone else looked down at the mirror with flashing eyes. They all had their own judgements regarding what the old man had said. However, regardless of anything, it seemed that of what the man had told them, eighty to ninety percent was probably true.</p><br/><p>In that case, this place\u2026 was a once-in-a-lifetime source of good fortune for all of them!</p><br/><p>Everyone exchanged glances. Then the Ji Clan members scattered, flying in opposite directions. The Cultivators from the Northern Reaches, Southern Domain, and Western Desert also sped off in different directions. Meng Hao looked at Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine by myself,\u201d she said with a slight smile. She turned and flew off into the distance, looking for good fortune of her own.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath. He looked down at the world within the mirror for a moment. Then his eyes flickered. He picked a direction and shot off at high speed.</p><br/><p>He only had one objective, and that was the Third Generation Demon Sealer!</p><br/><p>As for everything else, although it was interesting to him, when compared to the League of Demon Sealers, it was all secondary.</p><br/><p>He proceeded onward for the time it takes half an incense stick to burn. His brow was furrowed as he considered how strange this place was, especially the three most powerful experts that he had seen. They hovered in mid-air in the world inside the mirror, clearly visible, but unapproachable!</p><br/><p>Down below, the mirror continent seemed to be endless and without borders. However, it was possible to sense that far off in the distance, there was in fact an end to it all. However, once on the actual surface of the mirror continent, it truly seemed limitless. Even after moving forward for a long time, the Third Demon Sealer still seemed far, far away.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was muttering to himself about this when suddenly his eyes flashed. Not too far away he had caught sight of a magical battle taking place within the world of the mirror.</p><br/><p>There were two Cultivators fighting with a mass of black fog. Magical techniques spread about in all directions and magical items slammed out in attack. When he caught sight of the magical items, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes began to glitter.</p><br/><p>One of the items was a golden leaf that he wouldn\u2019t originally have paid much attention to. However, Meng Hao happened to have noticed that upon the surface of the golden leaf was a pattern that looked like a lotus.</p><br/><p>It was a made up of ten swords, shaped together to look like a lotus!</p><br/><p>It looked exactly like Meng Hao\u2019s own Lotus Sword Formation. He couldn't help but make an \u201ceee?\u201d sound as soon as he saw it. He looked at it closely for a moment, then lifted up his right hand and punched down. The punch caused the surface of the mirror to tremble. Distortions appeared, transforming into something that looked like a vortex. However, they quickly dissipated.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever as he entered the Fifth Anima. A boom could be heard from his fleshly body as he punched down again. The vortex instantly formed again, along with a black hole. An enormous gravitational force appeared inside of the mirror world, causing three magical items to suddenly be sucked in.</p><br/><p>Next, those very three magical items flew out beneath Meng Hao\u2019s feet. One of the items was cracked in the process and instantly exploded. The other two shot off in two different directions at top speed, apparently possessed of sentience.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao performed a minor teleportation, then transformed into a green smoke and a black moon. He reappeared in mid-air, and snatched his hand out to grab the golden leaf. It emanated a buzzing sound as well as a blinding light, and apparently intended to cut Meng Hao\u2019s hand in half.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao let out a cold snort, then flicked his sleeve to collect up the golden leaf. He pushed two fingers down hard onto its surface, preventing it from struggling and flying away.</p><br/><p>A look of happiness appeared in his eyes as he collected it up. But then he looked back down at the world in the mirror, and his mind trembled.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that he noticed that the golden leaf he had just acquired, as well as the item which had exploded and the other item which had escaped, were\u2026 still inside the world of the mirror.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they simply ghosts?\u201d he thought. \u201cOr are the items which flew out perhaps not real?\u201d He frowned as he thought back to how the copper mirror had begun to vibrate earlier.</p><br/><p>After some more thought, Meng Hao suddenly trembled and looked back down at the lands inside the mirror world.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Daniel Dunn, Thunder PKO, Tomislav Fistric, Salim Mudrik Baraba, Christophe Barry, Ibrahim Tamra Akt\u00fcrk, and Yanuar Yaputra</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

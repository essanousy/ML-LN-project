Patriarch Big-head laughed heartily and then once again slapped his bag of holding to produce what appeared to be nothing more than an ordinary grain of rice.</p><br/><p>It was plump, glossy and white. At first glance, the sight of it would make you hungry.</p><br/><p>The eyes of Patriarch Rubicund and Patriarch Pockmarks narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis object was pried from the mouth of an ancient Giant Locust,\u201d said Patriarch Big-head, his voice cool. \u201cIt was passed down through generations to me. After studying it thoroughly, I refined it anew. It can be used to break any spell formation in Heaven and Earth.\u201d He waved his hand, and suddenly, waves of rice grains flew out from his hand, pouring in sheets toward the black, foggy wind ahead of them.</p><br/><p>The pure white rice instantly began to turn dark. It only took the space of a few breaths for it to become pure black. Patriarch Big-head gasped, and a strange look appeared in his eyes. His body trembled, and he began to shrink as if he were being withered. Veins of blood appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoists, I need power from your Cultivation bases!\u201d He lifted his right hand, and Patriarch Rubicund and Patriarch Pockmarks immediately began to transmit power from their Cultivation bases. Patriarch Big-head absorbed it without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Other surrounding Cultivators heard the words uttered by Patriarch Big-head. Patriarch Pockmarks glanced at the remaining Han River Sect disciples, and soon, a mutual understanding was reached by everyone. Power poured out from the Cultivation bases of the hundreds of surrounding Cultivators. Patriarch Big-head turned into a black hole as he sucked in the power. His eyes turned bright red, and he raised his hand straight up into the air and extended a finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuminous Rice\u2026\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. Instantly, the blackened sheets of rice began to emit blinding rays of light, which shot out, forming together into a vast sheet of brightness. The light illuminated the surrounding darkness of the foggy wind, and if you didn\u2019t look too closely, everything suddenly didn\u2019t seem as mysterious as before.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Big-head bit down on the tip of his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood. The glowing blood, which was filled with the power lent by the surrounding Cultivators, melded into the shining rice grains within the foggy wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Army Transformation!\u201d</p><br/><p>A powerful boom filled the air, and the surrounding Cultivators instantly saw a vast array of emaciated figures appear within the fog. They were short, about half the size of an average person, and did not appear to be any sort of Heavenly Army. In fact, they looked more like evil spirits that had just crawled out of hell. All of the grains of rice transformed into such evil spirits.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, there were hundreds of them!</p><br/><p>The bodies of the evil spirits were indistinct, as if they couldn\u2019t quite fully manifest into the world. Even still, a cruel and bloodthirsty viciousness emanated out from them.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Big-head\u2019s face was pale as he retreated a few steps, clasped hands and bowed. \u201cHeavenly Army, I beseech you to break this formation! The more than one hundred people inside are my sacrifices to you, oh Heavenly Army!\u201d Up ahead, the fog roiled as the massive phantoms began to slam into the evil spirits. Shocking explosions rang out.</p><br/><p>Inside the spell formation, the parrot\u2019s eyes went wide with both fear and irritation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! That\u2019s an Immortal divine ability that\u2019s supposed to turn rice into soldiers. Who was it that changed it into something that summons evil spirits!? That\u2019s not something a Core Formation Cultivator could pull off, and it\u2019s also not a technique from the Ninth Mountain. That\u2019s something from\u2026 the League of Hellfire from the Fourth Mountain!</p><br/><p>\u201cSomehow that guy managed to get his hands onto an incomplete legacy\u2026. Dammit, everybody else can pretty much ignore these evil spirits, but considering the current state of my body\u2026 it could cause some big problems if I ran into them.\u201d For the first time, the parrot looked somewhat nervous. \u201cSo annoying\u2026.\u201d it said, taking in a deep breath.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, back in the Immortal\u2019s cave in the short mountain, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glowed brightly as he looked at the black pill furnace he held in his hand. On the surface of the pill furnace was the face of a youth, which looked back at Meng Hao with an expression that said it would never yield.</p><br/><p>This was none other than the pill furnace he had acquired in the Violet Furnace Lord trial by fire. [1. He acquired the black pill furnace in chapter 281]. However, from the moment he had acquired it, it had showed no sign that it would ever submit to him. At the moment, Meng Hao looked at it with brow furrowed. Finally, he gave a cold snort and performed an incantation with his right hand. Then, he pushed his finger down onto the face of the youth. It twisted and filled with a look of pain.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was currently surrounded by countless threads of Qi, visible only to himself. They swirled toward him from all directions to pour into the pill furnace.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still won\u2019t give in, fine,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. \u201cA pill furnace with a spirit inside is a bit better, but I\u2019m already used to the kind without.\u201d Meng Hao pushed down, and the Demonic Qi in the area poured in, transforming into a cage. The cage surrounded the image of the youth, and then transformed into something that looked like a net, which completely suppressed it.</p><br/><p>The youth screamed, filled with anxiety. However, the scream was weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I want to let you live, then you can continue to exist. If I want you dead, it will take a mere thought.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s voice was cold, and even as he spoke the words, the net tightened, thoroughly restricting the youth in all aspects. The blackness of the pill furnace began to grow dim, to be replaced by a violet color.</p><br/><p>Glancing at the pill furnace, Meng Hao waved his right hand, whereupon a vast quantity of medicinal plants emerged. His left hand flickered like a ghost as he began to catalyze, extract fluids, make adjustments, and feed ingredients into the pill furnace. A flame appeared in his right hand; it was not red, but violet.</p><br/><p>This flame was none other than the East Pill Everburning Flame, the legacy alchemic flame stoked by his Violet Core. This ever burning alchemic flame would allow him to employ the Spirit Summoning Incantation. [2. The Spirit Summoning Incantation was one of the three gifts given to him by Grandmaster Pill Demon in chapter 294]</p><br/><p>Just when Meng Hao was about to begin concocting, the anxious voice of the parrot was transmitted into his mind. Meng Hao immediately sent out his Spiritual Sense, whereupon he saw the fog in the outside world, as well as the hundreds of vicious evil spirits.</p><br/><p>He was silent for a moment, and then looked at the pill furnace. His eyes filled with determination as well as a cold glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what price you have to pay, give me three days!\u201d he transmitted back. Then he severed his connection with the outside world and began to concoct.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree days\u2026\u201d thought the parrot, a feverish light shining in its eyes. A flicker could be seen at its feet, and the meat jelly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Fifth gets it, b*tch! How annoying! I never imagined that someone would have a Hellfire legacy. Even though it\u2019s not complete, it still\u2026 could restrain Lord Fifth!\u201d The parrot eyed the meat jelly earnestly. \u201cThree days. You need to cooperate with me for three days. If Meng Hao isn\u2019t finished by that time, then we\u2019ll just have to flee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only on rare occasions would the meat jelly not be talkative. However, as soon as it heard about the Hellfire legacy, its eyes grew wide.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly shivered and nodded repeatedly. \u201cThe League of Hellfire from the Fourth Mountain\u2026. How is it possible for them to appear here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Time passed slowly. Meng Hao\u2019s expression remained calm the entire time. Rumbling sounds were already detectable from outside of the Immortal\u2019s cave, the results of the unanticipated problems the parrot had mentioned.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wasn\u2019t the type of person to lay blame on others. True, it had been the parrot\u2019s idea to lure all the people here. However, even though unexpected problems had cropped up outside, Meng Hao was still confident that they could be handled.</p><br/><p>This was the self-confidence of a Cultivator.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as there are no Nascent Soul Cultivators, then all I have to do is put on the blood-colored mask, and I can take care of everything myself if I have to. This is a good opportunity to teach the parrot a bit of a lesson.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s left hand flickered as he poured more medicinal plants into the pill furnace, along with a mouthful of Violet Qi. This Qi was not Core Qi, which could give birth to divine abilities, but normal Cultivation base Qi.</p><br/><p>The purpose of this action was to cause his alchemic flame to grow even stronger. A variety of complex thoughts filled his mind as he began to concoct the Perfect Gold Core Pill.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, this pill would require quite a bit of time to concoct. However, Meng Hao was a Grandmaster of the Dao of alchemy. Furthermore, he had his legacy flame and the Spirit Summoning Incantation. Considering all of that, he was confident that he could reduce the concocting time by quite a bit.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Three days later, the squawks of the parrot echoed out throughout the foggy wind. Explosions filled the air. The fog had already subsided by about half. The killing intent of the Cultivators from the three great Sects billowed to the Heavens. They had been trapped for days now, and had constantly been sending power out from their Cultivation bases. They were growing more exhausted, but their hatred for Meng Hao caused them to intensify their efforts.</p><br/><p>Of the hundreds of evil spirits, only about half remained. As for the more than one hundred Cultivators who ran about within the spell formation, many were coughing up blood and their bodies were stooped over. They did not seem to fear for their lives; nonetheless, they slowly began to slip into unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>As more and more of them passed out, the forces of the three great Sects grew nearer. Patriarch Big-head pulled out more rice, flinging it out into the air. Darkness filled the area, even the sky itself. There were no clouds; this darkness bore the appearance of a turbid magical river.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe yellow springs appear\u2026. This is definitely the work of the League of Hellfire\u2026.\u201d The parrot laughed bitterly. Inside the fog, a light glittered as the meat jelly appeared. It flew through the air listlessly, looking dispirited. The two of them had used quite a variety of special defensive techniques throughout the past three days, but now they were running out of steam.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d said the parrot hatefully. \u201cIf I had just one more year to practice, or five hundred Cultivators, then the power of this trifling incomplete legacy couldn\u2019t possibly break through Lord Fifth\u2019s Celestial spell formation!\u201d Suddenly, an explosion could be heard from within the Immortal\u2019s cave.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. He had used all the energy he could muster to concoct the Perfect Gold Core Pill. At the critical moment, the pill furnace began to shake. Strands of golden light began to emanate out from within, bathing the entire Immortal\u2019s cave with a golden glow.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s hair was in disarray, his expression listless. And yet, determination still glowed within his bloodshot eyes. His alchemic flame burned as he continued to refine the pill, increasing its medical strength.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sky in the outside world, which was dark and gloomy to begin with, suddenly filled with massive amounts of black clouds. The black clouds churned and seethed, covering an area fifty kilometers in diameter. The illusory visage of the yellow springs was concealed, and the gruesome darkness banished. However, the Earth below only grew darker. Booming sounds filled the air as countless bolts of lightning writhed up above like silver snakes.</p><br/><p>This was not the Heavenly Tribulation of Perfection. This was Pill Tribulation caused by a medicinal pill!</p><br/><p>However, if the pill was successfully concocted, and Meng Hao consumed it, then the Tribulation would change. Its explosiveness would increase exponentially, and it would transform into a horrifying, exterminating Heavenly Tribulation!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

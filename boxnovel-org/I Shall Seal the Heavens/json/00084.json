I don\u2019t mind if there\u2019s no reward, but this poison\u2026.\u201d A look of indignation had appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face. But before he could even finish speaking, the fissure in the ground closed up completely. There was no trace that it had even existed. Patriarch Reliance was nowhere to be seen and didn\u2019t speak. The only things that remained were the seven burning lamps and the flickering light they cast. The seven Cores and the one Nascent Soul let of thin streams of Qi. The streams didn\u2019t emanate up, though. As soon as they left the lamp, they were sucked into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch Reliance, I allowed myself to be poisoned because of you. You're from the senior generation, and you're a powerful expert. How could someone as powerful as you do something like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m neither an expert nor powerful,\u201d replied the Patriarch with a light cough. \u201cI\u2019ve been like this since I was young. And that is not an ordinary Spirit Stone, kid. Your Cultivation base just isn\u2019t high enough to be able to tell. Wait until you\u2019re at the Spirit Severing stage, then you will know how amazing that treasure is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Patriarch, what\u2019s going on? I went through a lot of trouble! Why are you doing this!?\u201d Meng Hao was furious. But everything around him was completely silent. Patriarch Reliance didn\u2019t say anything; in fact, he seemed to be ignoring Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, I don\u2019t need any other rewards. I just need help dispelling this poison. You\u2026 Patriarch, Disciple was constantly trying to figure out ways to bring those people here to help you recover your Cultivation base. How can you do this to me?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao shouted out a few more times, but could see that Patriarch Reliance wasn\u2019t responding. Even though he was just a simple scholar, he was enraged to the extreme at the moment. He had been deceived, and couldn\u2019t help but begin to curse.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch Reliance, you\u2019re a bastard!\u201d For Meng Hao to say something like this showed that he was exceedingly incensed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s voice could be heard. \u201cKid, who do you think you\u2019re cursing? Do you really dare to cuss at me? I\u2019ll slap you to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m cursing you!\u201d replied Meng Hao angrily. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna slap me, then go ahead. I\u2019m poisoned, so I\u2019ll die soon anyway. Get out here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance coughed a couple times. \u201cAhhhh. Never mind, never mind. I\u2019ve always had a good temper. Hey, you\u2019re the sole heir of the Reliance Sect. At the moment, we\u2019re the only people in the whole Sect! I\u2019m not going to get angry at you. Actually, a lot of people have cursed me over the years. It doesn\u2019t really matter. Look, you can\u2019t really blame me. I can\u2019t even go back out! My secluded meditation zone has been sealed. I could only come out if you brought another group of people. I couldn\u2019t help you now even if I wanted to.\u201d His words became more and more convincing as he spoke. He really had just renewed the seals, and if he wanted to break through, would need to spend several months doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d said Meng Hao, finally understanding the truth of the situation. He could only gnash his teeth and continue to curse. But no matter what he said, Patriarch Reliance didn\u2019t respond. In the end, he just started humming a little tune. The happy little tune echoed out, and eventually Meng Hao realized that nothing he did would accomplish anything. Shameless Patriarch Reliance was not going to make an appearance.</p><br/><p>His face filled with dark anger, he looked around. There were no bags of holding left behind from the Core Formation experts. Patriarch Reliance was obviously incredibly stingy and had taken them for himself. Meng Hao\u2019s gaze fell upon the seven Demonic lamps. Gritting his teeth, he slapped his bag of holding. Ten flying swords appeared and flew straight toward the lamps.</p><br/><p>Before they could even get close to the lamps, however, the swords began to tremble and glow brightly. Then they shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was livid. Seeing the Qi from the oil lamps seeping into the ground, he smacked his bag of holding again and the two wooden swords few out. They didn\u2019t meet the slightest resistance, but when they reached the oil lamps, they passed right through them, as if they weren\u2019t even there. There wasn\u2019t the slightest reaction from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Nascent Soul Cultivator and six Core Formation Cultivators,\u201d said Patriarch Reliance, his voice cheerful. \u201cTheir spiritual energy is quite abundant. As for your crappy swords, well, my seven demonic lamps are cut off from all other magical items. Non-sentient items can\u2019t affect them. Maybe if you were a bit more skilled, you would have some more options. But sorry, you can\u2019t steal things from me!\u201d He continued to hum his merry little tune. At the moment, he sat cross-legged in front of a small Feng Shui compass about the size of a hand. The strands of Qi that sank down from above became bright red, and then were absorbed by the compass.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face grew more and more grim as he retrieved the wooden swords. He had never imagined that Patriarch Reliance, being of the senior generation and having such an elevated Cultivation base, would treat Qi Condensation Cultivators with such shamelessness. A reward of a simple low-grade Spirit Stone? What was worse was how he claimed the Spirit Stone was an extraordinary object.</p><br/><p>No matter from which angle Meng Hao looked at it, it appeared to be completely ordinary. It was nothing more than a low-grade Spirit Stone.</p><br/><p>Before, Meng Hao had thought he cared a lot about Spirit Stones. But it turned out Patriarch Reliance was as stingy as an iron chicken from which feathers could not be plucked! He was a complete miser!</p><br/><p>\u201cOne low-grade Spirit Stone. You bastard, you did this on purpose!\u201d Meng Hao clenched his fists. He felt like he was about to go crazy. Not only were his words impolite, but in his heart, any and all good impressions he\u2019d even had of Patriarch Reliance were wiped clean.</p><br/><p>After a while, he turned, his jaw clenched. He wanted to throw the low-grade Spirit Stone away, but finally, he put it into his bag of holding. Then, he stalked off angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, you\u2019re leaving? Okay, okay. Don\u2019t forget to come back some time to hang out with Patriarch! You\u2019re my only heir, and the Sect only has the two of us now. This is your home; you can come back any time. I get lonely sometimes, so make sure to come back and keep me company.\u201d He continued to hum his happy tune.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t say anything. He walked away angrily, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s little tune echoing in his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, it\u2019s too bad I\u2019m sealed in here, otherwise I would see you off personally.\u201d Patriarch Reliance\u2019s voice was incredibly cheerful as he watched Meng Hao from within his secluded meditation chamber. \u201cMeng Hao, you\u2019re such a good kid. You\u2019re just a bit too uptight. Hopefully in the future you can learn to be a bit more like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not going to come out?\u201d said Meng Hao wrathfully. At the moment, he was walking past an area covered with a gray-colored restrictive spell. Suddenly, he stopped walking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Listen, I never tell lies. If I say that I can\u2019t go out, then I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help you, it\u2019s just, hey\u2026. Uh. What are you doing?\u201d In the middle of his complacent little speech, he suddenly stopped talking and his eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had turned and was looking closely at a gray restrictive spell. During the battle between Lord Revelation and Patriarch Reliance, the restrictive spells in the entire area had been damaged. They were slowly recovering, but at the moment, there were still cracks visible. Some of the cracks were large enough to be holes, actually, although they were slowly sealing back up.</p><br/><p>Within this restrictive spell was a veritable mountain of Spirit Stones. They had been collected by Patriarch Reliance over the course of his entire life. Most of them were low-grade Spirit Stones, but more than a few were mid-grade Spirit Stones, which were far more valuable.</p><br/><p>Without a word, Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding. A wooden sword appeared and stabbed directly into the hole. Immediately, the sword\u2019s ability to absorb spiritual energy was manifested. The restrictive spell shook, trying to repair itself, but was unable to. The second wooden sword appeared, and it too was stabbed into the hole. The swords spread apart, and soon the hole was as wide as the hand of a child.</p><br/><p>Normally, Meng Hao couldn\u2019t do something like this. But because of the cracks and holes in the spell, he had a unique chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d echoed Patriarch Reliance\u2019s voice from within the ground. He stared in shock. He had a stingy personality, but enjoyed being able to put his lifetime accumulation of treasures on display. He liked to watch people\u2019s eyes turn red when they could look at, but not touch the treasures. He was also supremely confident in his restrictive spells. They were connected to his life force, so unless he died, no one would be able to break through them.</p><br/><p>However, because of some strange properties that existed in Lord Revelation, some problems had cropped up when Patriarch Reliance absorbed him. Because of that, the restrictive spells were a bit slow in their recovery. This was a bit of a slip-up on his part.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, even with that hole there, you won\u2019t be able to take all those Spirit Stones,\u201d laughed Patriarch Reliance. \u201cThere are too many. You won\u2019t be able to fit them inside. Oh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m a generous person. Go ahead and take a few, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao let out a cold harrumph. Now that the wooden swords had opened up a hole, he reached deep into his robe and pulled out the bag of the Cosmos and aimed it at the little hole.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base charged into action like a wild horse. The mountain of Spirit Stones began to shudder, and then, one by one they began flying out of the hole, sucked into the bag of the Cosmos.</p><br/><p>Faster and faster, the Spirit Stones flew into the black-hole that was the bag of the Cosmos. Patriarch Reliance watched the dazzling display, and a horrified shriek rang out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bag of the Cosmos\u2026. Dammit, how can you have that! It\u2019s invisible to Spiritual Sense, and can contain mountains and rivers. You, you, you\u2026. My Spirit Stones! I went through innumerable trials and tribulations throughout my life to accumulate that many Spirit Stones. Meng Hao, leave some behind for me!\u201d His agonized cry continued to echo out, and the ground began to quake. He was obviously releasing some of his power. And yet the seal had just been put in place\u2026.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao laughed coldly as he listened to Patriarch Reliance\u2019s miserable cries. Soon the mountain of Spirit Stones shrank to become a small hill. Meng Hao was truly venting his spleen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to rip me off?\u201d thought Meng Hao, gritting his teeth. \u201cThen I\u2019ll rip you off even more! I\u2019m going to clear out all of your treasures!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, you traitor! This is too excessive!\u201d Patriarch Reliance felt as if the organs in his body were going to explode. He wanted to burst out of the seal, but it had just been put in place. It would take months before he could break it.</p><br/><p>He could never have imagined that Meng Hao would have a bag of the Cosmos, nor that he would be able to snatch away his lifetime accumulation of Spirit Stones. At the moment, Patriarch Reliance felt as if a giant invisible blade were rotating around him, slashing him for every Spirit Stone that he lost.</p><br/><p>It was as if he were being hacked to pieces. His heart ached.</p><br/><p>He had always had a strange personality. In comparison to other Cultivators of his generation, he was a true weirdo. His greed and stinginess grew along with his Cultivation base and his age. He didn\u2019t have even the slightest bit of an aura of a powerful expert. He didn\u2019t seem to have a bottom line in anything either.</p><br/><p>Several hundred years ago, during his first Severing, his Dao enlightenment had been regarding greed. You could say that it had been branding onto his spirit, and was a part of his Cultivation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

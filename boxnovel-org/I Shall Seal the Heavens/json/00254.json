It was impossible to tell what he was thinking. His voice echoed out as if from unfathomably deep waters, immediately attracting the attention of all the onlookers.</p><br/><p>Everyone, even Zhou Dekun, seemed to have assumed that Meng Hao had already lost. He didn\u2019t appear to have even the slightest hope of achieving victory. Even a Violet Furnace Lord wouldn\u2019t be able to identify the pill formula of an ancient pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat of this pill?\u201d interrupted Chen Jiaxi. \u201cFang Mu, why be wordy about it? Losing is losing! There\u2019s no need to struggle against it!\u201d He gave a cold laugh.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked calmly at Chen Jiaxi.</p><br/><p>When he spoke, his words were neither hasty nor halting. \u201cThe outer layer of this pill bears evidence of having been buried in the ground for at least one thousand years. Its death aura is dense, infecting even the jade box. However, the pill has not been harmed at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strange thing is that the middle layer of the pill is different. It contains only seven hundred years of time. Furthermore, although some of the plant and vegetation variations appear at first to have been refined with the ancient non-smelting technique, in fact, there are actually traces of smelting fire on them.\u201d As Meng Hao spoke, Chen Jiaxi\u2019s cold smile grew wider.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe inner layer of the pill,\u201d continued Meng Hao, \u201cis very strange. There are seventeen various plant and vegetation variations there, none of which exceed two hundred years in age! That is why it took me a bit longer to inspect it. I\u2019m not sure why this supposed Primordial Heavenly Replenishing Pill, which can extend one\u2019s lifespan by one thousand years, would have an exterior, a middle, and a center, that are so vastly different!\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, a buzz rose up from the audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Don\u2019t tell me the pill is a fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be fake? There was obviously celestial music just now, and the dancing child. Those things couldn\u2019t be fake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Fang Mu is just babbling nonsense?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Cultivators discussed the matter, Chen Jiaxi began to laugh uproariously. His grim, cold laughter echoed out in all directions.</p><br/><p>He flicked his sleeve, and once again spoke, his voice dripping with ridicule: \u201cFang Mu, by simply admitting defeat, then I, Chen Jiaxi, could show respect to your status as a Furnace Lord of the East Pill Division. But instead, you use low-down, underhanded means to attempt to achieve victory! You try to besmirch this ancient medicinal pill by saying that it\u2019s a forgery!? Competing with you has truly brought me great loss of face! What a waste!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the East Pill Division has produced an alchemist such as you. Such an utter disgrace! No wonder you had to finagle your way into being a Furnace Lord. Now I, Chen Jiaxi, thoroughly understand the entire situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yiming\u2019s expression also filled with derision. Zhou Dekun\u2019s face was bright red. As an alchemist, defeat should be recognized, and respect for the Dao of alchemy should never be forgotten.</p><br/><p>He sighed inwardly, and was just about to open his mouth in an attempt to smooth the situation over, when Meng Hao\u2019s calm voice once again rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I ever say the pill was a forgery?\u201d he asked, his expression the same as ever. He appeared to be completely oblivious to the gazes of the onlookers, as well as to Chen Jiaxi\u2019s complacency.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sharp-tongued punk!\u201d cried Chen Jiaxi, throwing any thoughts of mercy to the wind. \u201cAre you still trying to argue? Just now you obviously implied that the pill was fake, didn\u2019t you? Do you have an explanation for that? Fang Mu, do you have even the slightest scrap of face left?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the Black Sieve Sect disciples were now looking at Meng Hao. Their faces were filled with strange expressions. Patriarch Violet Sieve and the other two watched on wordlessly with furrowed brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you pipe down!?\u201d roared Meng Hao. His eyes filled with a brilliant light that shone like lightning on a pitch black night. His words echoed out like thunder across a plain, echoing out with such force that Chen Jiaxi\u2019s mind was instantly shaken. Without realizing it, he stepped backward a few paces, the sound ringing in his ears.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stepped forward. He spoke, his words devoid of any courtesy: \u201cYou babble nonsense! You invert right and wrong! You don\u2019t measure up to me when it comes to the Dao of alchemy, nor can your skill with plants and vegetation compare to mine. You are even further behind when it comes to Instantaneous Formula Scrying. And yet you still dare to bare your fangs and brandish your claws in front of me?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Fang Mu, made three points just now, and none of them contained the word \u2018forgery.\u2019 That word came from you, you self-righteous twit! This competition was your idea. Defeat after defeat has revealed your true face, you stooge! You ask me if I have face? Let me ask you? Who is there that would possibly give face to you?\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s voice grew louder and louder, each sentence stabbing into Chen Jiaxi\u2019s psyche like a sharp sword. His eyes filled with flames of fury. However, as Meng Hao approached him, dread welled up in his heart, and he again retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a mere scarlet-robed master alchemist of the World Pill Division. Even people above you in the World Pill Division don\u2019t qualify to constantly accuse me of finagling my way into being a Furnace Lord. I became a Furnace Lord because of the graces of Grandmaster Eternal Mountain, and he approved of the pill I concocted. Therefore, repudiating me is the same as repudiating Grandmaster Eternal Mountain, and therefore the whole of the World Pill Division!\u201d Meng Hao took another step forward, his words ringing out around him in a roar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch actions on the part of a member of the World Pill Division are nothing less than treason against your Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>The roar of Meng Hao\u2019s words sent Chen Jiaxi\u2019s mind spinning. His eyes filled with veins of blood. \u201cYou\u2026.\u201d His body trembled and he raised an accusatory finger toward Meng Hao. He was normally capable of sharply incisive words, but now, his mind was in chaos, and he couldn\u2019t even speak.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s words roared out like thunder: \u201cIn an attempt to further your personal glory, you\u2019re even willing to repudiate Eternal Mountain and commit treason against your Sect! You are a lowlife, worse than pigs or dogs! What makes you think you have the face to stand in front of Fang Mu and rave so arrogantly? What gives you the courage to stand on the same stage as me when I am lecturing about alchemy?\u201d Meng Hao flicked his sleeve. His words slammed into Chen Jiaxi\u2019s ears, causing his body to shake and his mind to reel and rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu!\u201d he shrieked shrilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, let\u2019s discuss this medicinal pill of yours. Its exterior is a thousand years old, its middle is seven hundred, and its interior roughly three hundred. It is no forgery. However, it will not add a thousand years to your lifespan. Why? Because this pill is clearly a poison pill! The outer layer is simply a coating, while the middle layer serves to conceal the poison congealed within the center!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of scoundrel alchemist are you to produce such a pill? Furthermore, what is your intention in bringing it out? Don\u2019t tell me you planned to sell it to the senior generation of the Black Sieve Sect? Upon consuming this pill, the Qi passageways will turn backward, and the Qi and blood will reverse their flow. Within the space of three breaths, you will begin to bleed from your eyes, nose and mouth. Within ten breaths, your garments will be soaked with gore, and you will be in such excruciating pain that you will wish you weren\u2019t alive. After enough time passes for an incense stick to burn, your blood will freeze, and you will be dead!\u201d Meng Hao waved his hand, sending the jade box and the red pill flying back to Chen Jiaxi, who stood there, his hair disheveled, his entire body quivering.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gave a cold snort, then continued in a voice that could sever nails and chop iron: \u201cThat is the response of Fang Mu. If you pulled out a forgery, I could identify it easily. But to pull out a poison pill like this shows how truly pernicious you are. Worthy of death! There is no need for me to continue to compete with you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Jiaxi felt as if his mind were being ripped in two. \u201cThis is no poison pill!!\u201d he bellowed madly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf so, then why don\u2019t you consume it?!\u201d said Meng Hao, his voice as sharp as a blade, his eyes flickering like lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d raved Chen Jiaxi. He had gone through countless hardships to acquire this pill, and actually had planned to sell it at an exorbitant price to the Black Sieve Sect. However, Meng Hao\u2019s words just now had caused Patriarch Violet Sieve and the other two Patriarchs to stare suspiciously. The surrounding Black Sieve Sect disciples also stared, their expressions grim.</p><br/><p>Li Yiming felt as if his internal organs were about to burst. The tables had turned too quickly. Just now, Chen Jiaxi had clearly been in the superior position, and then in a blink of an eye, everything had been reversed. Li Yiming\u2019s mind spun blankly.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just him. Zhou Dekun watched on dumbly. He had been very sure that the pill was real, and had never imagined that the events just now could occur. Everything Meng Hao said seemed perfectly reasonable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you!!\u201d Chen Jiaxi\u2019s mind spun so violently he almost couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening. He had been pushed into the ultimate corner by Meng Hao. If he didn\u2019t consume the pill, then everyone would obviously suspect him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu!!\u201d he howled.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he threw the pill into his mouth. Immediately, streaks of blood snaked through his eyes, and blue veins bulged on his forehead. He looked like some sort of devilish fiend. Patriarch Violet Sieve hesitated for a moment when this happened, but didn\u2019t move to interfere.</p><br/><p>The ruddy-faced man sitting next to him also was shaken inwardly, yet did nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve consumed it,\u201d he howled glaring at Meng Hao. \u201cDid you see, Fang Mu? I consumed the Primordial Heavenly Replenishing Pill!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two, three\u2026\u201d said Meng Hao, his voice light. When he said the word \u201cthree,\u201d three breaths had passed. Chen Jiaxi\u2019s face suddenly changed. His body began to tremble, and his face distorted. He let out a blood-curdling scream, and then blood began to ooze out of his eyes, mouth and nose.</p><br/><p>Immediately, all of the Cultivators present on the fifty-seventh mountain of the Black Sieve Sect burst into a commotion. Many of them shot to their feet, their eyes filled with astonishment.</p><br/><p>Li Yiming\u2019s vision began to grow dark, and his mind filled with a spinning roar that caused him to nearly lose consciousness.</p><br/><p>Zhou Dekun gasped, his face filled with disbelief as he looked at Chen Jiaxi standing there, screaming miserably, blood dripping down his face.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Violet Sieve\u2019s pupils constricted, and then began to fill with fury. Next to him, the ruddy-faced old man frowned, and his eyes began to fill with displeasure.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stood there on the stage, continuing to count softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour, five, six\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao counted, Chen Jiaxi fell to the ground, screaming shrilly. His body thrashed, and blood flew everywhere. His Qi passageways had reversed, and popping sounds could be heard ringing out from within his body. A mist of blood sprayed from his mouth, turning his red robe into a true garment of gore.</p><br/><p>All of this was exactly as Meng Hao had described. Soon, the tenth breath would arrive, and Chen Jiaxi would die. However, the moment Meng Hao spoke the word nine, his body suddenly flickered forward. His right hand pressed down onto the top of wheezing Chen Jiaxi\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Immediately, Chen Jiaxi\u2019s screaming ceased. His body trembled, and his aura was feeble, but it seemed that his trip down the road of death had paused momentarily. From the look of it, though, he only had a few moments left before death found him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the sake of Grandmaster Eternal Mountain, Fang Mu is going to save your life today,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. His face was as calm as ever. Therefore, no one knew that his heart was actually surging with waves of indescribable excitement.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

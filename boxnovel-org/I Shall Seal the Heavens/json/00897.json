No matter where he went, he was the center of attention. After all, he was Fang Wei, the long time number one Chosen of this generation in the Fang Clan.</p><br/><p>He was famous in all the Ninth Mountain and Sea!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, although he wasn\u2019t the legitimate eldest grandson of the Fang Clan, he essentially held that position.</p><br/><p>In this generation of the Fang Clan, the only person who ranked above him in seniority was Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>As he sat there calmly, he glanced at Meng Hao for a moment, then closed his eyes. A year before, when the clan had convened the welcoming ceremony, he did not make an appearance; he couldn\u2019t care less that Meng Hao had been scheduled to return.</p><br/><p>The only reason he came today was because the strength of Meng Hao\u2019s bloodline had piqued his interest.</p><br/><p>The air in the temple was very solemn. All of the people seated inside were Fang Clan Elders, and although not every single clan Elder had come, this group comprised the majority of those who were on Planet East Victory.</p><br/><p>Each person in the temple looked like an Immortal Deity. All of them, be it in terms of their qi and blood, or in terms of their aura, were terrifying to the extreme. As Meng Hao looked around, he realized that he couldn\u2019t gauge any of their cultivation bases.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Meng Hao gained a clearer understanding of how powerful the Fang Clan was.</p><br/><p>If you didn\u2019t count the Ji Clan, this clan could actually be considered the number one clan in all the Ninth Mountain and Sea. The year that Lord Li disappeared, if the Fang Clan had been stronger by just a hair\u2026 the Ninth Mountain and Sea might now be following a Lord Fang.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was also well aware that he was really only looking at the tip of the iceberg. The Fang Clan had even deeper and more powerful resources, making them a force that few would ever trifle with lightly.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Meng Hao\u2026 was the eldest grandson of the direct bloodline of the Fang Clan. It was easy to imagine what would have happened if he hadn\u2019t experienced the Seventh Year Tribulation. Had he grown up in the Fang Clan, his status and fame would definitely have made him well-known throughout the Ninth Mountain and Sea, as well as the Eighth Mountain and Sea.</p><br/><p>All of the Elders were now looking at Meng Hao. It was impossible to tell whether they were happy or angry; their expressions were abstruse and impossible to read, and filled the hall with incredible pressure. As for Fang Wei, and his father and grandfather, undetectable gleams flickered in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was the only person standing, right there in the middle of the temple. As for the pressure that emanated from those surrounding him, Meng Hao didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, Grand Elder Fang Tongtian finally spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Hao!\u201d he said, his expression solemn. His voice echoed out in the temple, making it sound almost as if a throng of people were speaking. Everything trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving offered sacrifices to the ancestors, you are now officially a member of the Fang Clan. Henceforth, you shall enjoy access to the Fang Clan\u2019s cultivation resources, and many things will now tilt in your favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, there is something you must never forget!\u201d The Grand Elder\u2019s expression was suddenly threatening, although it lacked any anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you are a member of the Fang Clan, you must follow all of the clan rules. Violate those rules, and it doesn\u2019t matter how strong your bloodline is, or that you have a 30,000-meter Bloodline Gatebeam. Despite that\u2026 you will still be punished!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of the clan rules, I will give you a detailed copy that you can study in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stood there silently, looking at the Grand Elder.</p><br/><p>After the Grand Elder finished speaking, a white-haired, ruddy-faced old man seated off to the side smiled and said, \u201cLadies and Gentlemen of the clan, let us discuss how the cultivation resources will be allocated to Fang Hao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er is the eldest grandson of the direct bloodline,\u201d someone said. \u201cIn fact, he is the highest-ranking grandson of his generation in the entire Fang Clan. He\u2019s had a hard time in the outside world during these years. Now that he\u2019s back in the clan, he should naturally be given the very best of everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Immortal\u2019s cave next to Brightmoon Lake has good fortune of Heaven and Earth inside,\u201d another person said. \u201cFurthermore, the remains of a Heavenly Dragon can be found therein. It is absolutely the best Immortal\u2019s cave in all of Planet East Victory. From my perspective, that Immortal\u2019s cave should definitely be given to Hao\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another of the Elders looked at Meng Hao with praise in his eyes and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. For years, no one has possessed the qualifications to have that Immortal\u2019s cave. We of the direct bloodline have him as our eldest grandson, and in fact, the highest-ranking grandson of his entire generation! He is the only one who could possibly be qualified to have that Immortal\u2019s cave.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was not a situation where people were trying to bring Meng Hao down by over-praising him. These people truly wanted Meng Hao to have the best resources to help him advance himself in the quickest manner possible.</p><br/><p>Almost as soon as the Elder from the direct bloodline finished speaking, other Elders began to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not entirely proper. Hao\u2019er has just returned, and hasn\u2019t yet made the least contribution whatsoever to the good of the clan.You can\u2019t reward him with that Immortal\u2019s cave on the basis of his position alone. That wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely. In the Fang Clan, one\u2019s standing is based on how much one has contributed to the clan. To avoid causing other clan members to have feelings of resentment, Hao\u2019er should not be given that Immortal\u2019s cave.\u201d</p><br/><p>It only took a moment for a clamor to arise as numerous Elders began to give their opinions. In the end, Meng Hao could tell that about thirty percent of the Elders disagreed, with only about ten percent standing on Meng Hao\u2019s side. The rest maintained their silence.</p><br/><p>The Grand Elder had predicted that something like this would happen, so he sat there silently, his expression the same as usual.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that suddenly, Fang Wei, who sat in a chair surrounded by over a hundred young companions, suddenly opened his eyes to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cRespected Elders, I regret to inform you that Junior has already taken the Immortal\u2019s cave by Brightmoon Lake and gifted it to someone.\u201d His voice was placid and seemingly devoid of any emotion whatsoever. As soon as he spoke, the direct bloodline Elders\u2019 faces grew dark. However, none of them offered any sort of response.</p><br/><p>An imperceptible flicker appeared in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes. The words spoken by Fang Wei carried much meaning. This was a meeting of Fang Clan elders, and none of the other members of the younger generation had seats except for Fang Wei.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, his words actually carried a domineering weight that seemed to be intolerant of any opposition. It was so domineering\u2026 that even the direct bloodline Elders didn\u2019t dare to retort.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked over at Fang Wei, and Fang Wei looked back at him for a moment before closing his eyes.</p><br/><p>Then, the direct bloodline Elder spoke up again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than the Immortal\u2019s cave, there are also the ten batches of Rainbow Immortal Evanescence Pills concocted by Pill Elder from the Dao of Alchemy Division. That type of pill is a rare medicine that provides mysterious assistance when rising from the Spirit Realm into the Immortal Realm. Seven batches of those pills should be given to Hao\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate either,\u201d said another Elder. \u201cOnly ten batches of pills are concocted per year, and the medicinal plant ingredients are all extinct in the outside world. The Rainbow Immortal Evanescence Pill is the Fang Clan\u2019s strongest type of pill that exists in the gap between the Spirit and Immortal Realms. They are concocted for the benefit of the entire junior generation. Therefore, giving seven batches to Hao\u2019er is impossible. I say, one batch should be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>As before, the Grand Elder said nothing. It was at this point that the white-robed Fang Wei opened his eyes and spoke again.</p><br/><p>\u201cRespected Elders, I regret to inform you that Junior has already made arrangements for all ten batches of Rainbow Immortality Evanescence Pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, silence once again filled the entire temple. Fury burned in the direct bloodline Elders\u2019 eyes, but all they could do was clench their jaws and maintain silence.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had not spoken yet either, but his brow had gradually become furrowed as he looked over at Fang Wei. Fang Wei had only spoken twice, yet each time his words had silenced the Elders. This fact revealed a lot.</p><br/><p>In addition, Meng Hao was gradually coming to detect something familiar about Fang Wei, although he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on what it was. After a moment, he began to wonder if he was just imagining it.</p><br/><p>Silence reigned in the temple, and while the direct bloodline clan members sat there gloomily, there were Elders from other bloodlines who were smiling slightly. Finally, Grand Elder Fang Tongtian cleared his throat and then began to speak, his eyes shining.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, since we have a disagreement regarding the Immortal\u2019s cave and the medicinal pills, let\u2019s put those matters aside for now. Hao\u2019er, you are the eldest grandson of the direct bloodline, so I will take responsibility for you now. There will be no more discussion. You will be given the highest quality compensation from the clan.\u201d With that, he waved his right hand, causing a jade slip to fly out and come to float in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this jade slip to the clan\u2019s Hall of the People. That is where you can withdraw your monthly set cultivation resources.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the Immortal\u2019s cave\u2026.\u201d The Grand Elder muttered to himself for a moment, then waved his hand, causing a gentle light to spread out, which rapidly solidified into a map.</p><br/><p>There were various dots of glowing light on the map, each of which represented an Immortal\u2019s cave. The closer the Immortal\u2019s caves were to the center of the map, the stronger the auras they emitted. In the very center of them all was a lake, which was none other than Brightmoon Lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, go ahead and select an Immortal\u2019s cave from among the ones you see here. The dim lights represent Immortal\u2019s caves that have already been spoken for.\u201d As the Grand Elder spoke, about eighty percent of the lights on the map went dark. Not many were left behind. There were still a few next to Brightmoon Lake, but most were located in other areas, and especially along the edges.</p><br/><p>All eyes were on Meng Hao, and most of the onlookers seemed concerned, although it was impossible to tell whether such feelings were true or false.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was silent for a moment, then clasped hands and bowed to the Grand Elder.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand Elder, Junior has come to Planet East Victory upon my father\u2019s request to take my two Nirvana Fruits. I don\u2019t really care about Immortal\u2019s caves or medicinal pills. I don\u2019t need them. I just want my Nirvana Fruits.\u201d Having directly spoken these words, Meng Hao gazed at the Grand Elder.</p><br/><p>Complete silence filled the temple.</p><br/><p>Finally, the Grand Elder waved his hand as if he couldn\u2019t accept Meng Hao\u2019s refusal of the Immortal\u2019s cave and other things.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, you just got back to the clan,\u201d he said, his voice kind. \u201cYou need some time to get familiar with everything. An Immortal\u2019s cave, cultivation resources, and those medicinal pills are things that, as a member of the Fang Clan, belong to you by right.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding the Nirvana Fruits, fear not, they\u2019re yours. Naturally, they will be returned to you. I personally promised your father exactly that when he left.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that matter. Although, it is a significant affair. Two days from now, I will make an announcement throughout the entire clan, inviting clan members here to bear witness to the returning of the Nirvana Fruits into your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t respond. Originally, he didn\u2019t have any desire to come to the Fang Clan. Now that he was here, and he understood the situation, he was even less willing to stay.</p><br/><p>In fact, he was even of a mind to simply leave right then and there. However, when he thought of his parents\u2019 hopes, he took a deep breath, and a fierce glow appeared in his eyes for a brief moment. He nodded, and then decided to say one more thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand Elder, there is also an Immortality Illumination Vine that my father had prepared for me. Could you please return that to me as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the Grand Elder could even respond, the white-robed Fang Wei\u2019s voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI regret to inform you that I\u2019ve already made arrangements for that Immortality Illumination Vine as well,\u201d he said coolly.</p><br/><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes sparkled with icy coldness. He looked over at Fang Wei, smiled slightly, and then began to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Cousin Fang Wei,\u201d he said, his voice ice cold despite his smile, \u201capparently, I beat the crap out of you too hard when we were young. That\u2019s the only explanation for why you\u2019ve become such a nutcase. Otherwise, what would possibly make you think it was acceptable to steal from me?\u201d [1. In chapter 800 it talked about Meng Hao bullying Fang Wei when they were both children]</p><br/><p>When Fang Wei heard this, his eyes glowed with icy coldness as he stared dead at Meng Hao.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

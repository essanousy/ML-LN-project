He glanced back, his eyes filled with venomous anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Chang\u2019en, if you can recruit help from outside, then so can I! Trifling Shaman Cultivator. If you take his powerful Spirit minion out of the equation then I could slaughter him easily. With those type of Cultivators, the only main thing to worry about is their Spirit minion. I\u2019ll behead him in an instant!\u201d He let out a cold snort, and then eyed his fellow Clansmen. \u201cYou head back without me. This matter isn\u2019t finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Xu Clansmen dispersed. Xu Luodi flicked his sleeve, transforming into a colorful beam that shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only thing I can do is to go ask help from Mr. Sang Luo. He\u2019s at the late Foundation Establishment stage, with seven Dao Pillars. He can easily take care of the Shaman Cultivator. The only problem is that he has a very eccentric personality, and might not agree to help\u2026. But considering the price paid for that matter a few years ago, he\u2019ll surely agree. It will all be worth it if I can get that Spirit lake!\u201d His mind made up, Xu Luodi sped up.</p><br/><p>He flew for about a day before arriving at the foot of a lonely mountain. A few vultures circled about overhead. Up ahead was a pile of wood about six meters tall. On top was a corpse.</p><br/><p>The corpse had clearly been rotting there for several months. The sight of it was quite horrifying. A few vultures were perched on top of the wood pile, picking at it. They glanced at Xu Luodi, their eyes shining mysteriously. They clearly weren\u2019t afraid of the living.</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Luodi requests an audience with Mr. Sang Luo,\u201d he said, eying the corpse, his heart thumping. The corpse was clearly completely lifeless. However, he recognized the remains as belonging to a local Clan Lord whose Cultivation base had been at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><br/><p>His words rang out into the lonely mountain. After some time passed, a raspy voice drifted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow looked down on me a few months ago, so I grabbed him and brought him here. I tied him up as punishment, but never imagined he would be so weak. He died after only two months. You, what matter brought you here today!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Luodi took a long breath as he gave a deep bow toward the lonely mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I\u2019ve encountered some trouble. I would like to ask for Mr. Sang Luo\u2019s assistance to kill someone.\u201d He spoke directly, knowing that Mr. Sang Luo didn\u2019t like long-winded explanations.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill someone\u2026. Wahahahahaha!\u201d A peal of ear-piercing laughter rang out. \u201cBecause of the friendship we developed that year, I can help you. But there are some requirements. A lot of requirements, actually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d said Xu Luodi, lifting up a bag of holding. He tossed it out, and before it could hit the ground, it spun off into the distance, snatched up by some invisible force.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me a few days,\u201d said the raspy voice. \u201cAfter I finish refining this guy\u2019s bones, then I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Suddenly, the vultures picked up the corpse and flew off with it into the lonely mountain.</p><br/><p>Xu Luodi took another deep breath, his eyes glowing brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Chang\u2019en, let\u2019s see how you fight back this time!\u201d His eyes filled with killing intent, Xu Luodi sat down cross-legged to meditate.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, back in the Xiao Clan mountain village, Meng Hao also sat cross-legged, in a small room near the lake. A soft glow surrounded him that allowed him to see out of the room, but prevented anyone on the outside from seeing inside.</p><br/><p>The glow was being cast by nine paper talismans. The talismans had been painted by the young Xiao Clan woman and then personally delivered to Meng Hao. After setting up the talismans, she had departed with a respectful bow.</p><br/><p>After she left, Meng Hao spat out the lightning mist, which spread out to cover the area. Finally, he could open his bag of holding without anxiety. He pulled out the Sieve Earth Pill he\u2019d acquired from the Black Sieve Sect, and examined it closely.</p><br/><p>As he looked over the pill, the meat jelly hat on his head began to talk. \u201cHey, where did I leave off just now? Right, let\u2019s continue the matter from yesterday. You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s immoral! You can\u2019t just throw me down onto the ground. That\u2019s too excessive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t respond. The meat jelly hadn\u2019t stopped talking at all. It seemed it could speak on a single subject for an entire day. It would be one thing if it didn\u2019t repeat itself, but it did, and never seemed to get bored, either.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would happen if you hit a little kid\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also bad for the grass and plants\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little fish and other creatures are all innocent\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like a buzz in Meng Hao\u2019s ears. He tried to ignore it, but the meat jelly hat\u2019s voice seemed to be growing louder. Eventually, it was shouting, its voice so loud that it drifted past the lightning mist shield to the outside. When they heard the voice, the Xiao Clan members all exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>\u201cSHUT UP!!\u201d Grinding his teeth, Meng Hao grabbed the hat and threw it onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? I wasn\u2019t finished. Where did I leave off? Oh well, let me change topics. You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s immoral\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao lifted his head up toward the sky, his expression more and more unsightly. After a moment, he stood up and began to trample on the hat.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s pedantic face suddenly appeared. Even though Meng Hao was fiercely trampling it, it didn\u2019t let out any miserable cries. Instead, it seemed to speak even more earnestly. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s too cruel! It\u2019s too immoral!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d said Meng Hao, taking a few steps back and clenching his jaw. \u201cYou escaped, why are you following me? Go away. Go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? I\u2019ve bonded you as my master. Bonding a master means bonding for life. I would never, ever be so immoral as to leave. I would never do something so lacking in principle, so lacking in\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao slowly lifted his head up and stared blankly into the air. Enough time passed for two incense sticks to burn, and he finally looked back at the hat.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026so lacking in character. I just told you seven hundred and forty-five things that I lack. Do you see how civilized I am? How sincere? In a word, I would never leave you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t say anything. He suddenly lifted his hand and summoned a Flame Dragon, which slammed into the hat. This time, a miserable cry rang out, only to be quickly replaced by endless chatter. The hat was undamaged. As Meng Hao stared at it, veins popped out on his forehead. He had always thought of himself as good-tempered, but as of now his temper was exploding. He jumped up and down a few more times on the hat, trampling it.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 a few moments later he stopped. Continuing to gush words, the hat returned to Meng Hao\u2019s head. This time, however, it changed colors. Now it was green, and its appearance was a bit more exaggerated than before [1. If you're unfamiliar with what green hats mean in Chinese culture, check out this article].</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face turned dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, child, don\u2019t struggle. I\u2019m a good person. I\u2019m trying to help you. You\u2019re on the path of wickedness, but I\u2019m willing to use my own power to help you. Child, perhaps you are unaware of how many young people take a wrong step in life, and then regret it for an eternity. I\u2019ll help you cast off the bitterness. I\u2019ll help you free yourself from that damned bird. I failed in my last life, and the life before that, and the life before that, too. That damned, despicable bird is the only bird I\u2019ve never converted!\u201d The hat seemed to be grinding its teeth now. \u201cIn this life, I will convert it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this bird you keep talking about?!\u201d said Meng Hao, his face grim. A strange feeling had risen up inside of him. This hat couldn\u2019t be killed and couldn\u2019t be thrown away. It really was extremely annoying.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d asked the hat, suddenly flying off of Meng Hao\u2019s head. It\u2019s shape suddenly rippled back into the meat jelly. The archaic face appeared, and it looked disbelieving as it gazed at Meng Hao. \u201cHeavens, you really don\u2019t know who that damned, mass-murdering, shameless\u2026.\u201d The meat jelly began to quiver as it let off streams of curses. Meng Hao let out a long sigh and looked up into the air. After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, he finally looked back at the meat jelly.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly was finally concluding its description: \u201c\u2026should be thrown into a cesspool, damned bird? You really don\u2019t know who it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao glared at the meat jelly for a long moment before slowly saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t know?\u201d asked the meat jelly, shocked. \u201cYou really, really don\u2019t now? Impossible! You really, really, really don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI. Don\u2019t. Know!\u201d Meng Hao clenched his teeth. It was really frustrating trying to communicate with this meat jelly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! You have its aura on your body, but you don\u2019t know. How is this possible? How can you not know? Heavens, heavens. You really, really, really don\u2019t know?\u201d Its eyes widened and filled with a look of complete disbelief.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t know what to say. He closed his eyes and sat down to meditate. With a bang, the meat jelly transformed back into a bright green hat and flew back onto Meng Hao\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Considering that Meng Hao was wearing scholars\u2019 robes, the hat was extremely conspicuous. Anyone who caught sight of it would surely do a double take.</p><br/><p>Enough time passed for an incense stick to burn.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, how can you not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Two incense sticks.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Inconceivable! You actually don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything? Oh, I understand. You\u2019re ashamed. Look, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a good person. I will do everything I can to bring you back from the path of wickedness. I\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face grew more and more unsightly. He really had reached his breaking point. His temper exploded. He roared, grabbing the hat and throwing it outside. He slapped his bag of holding, and nearly a hundred flying swords appeared and shot toward the hat. Meng Hao\u2019s hand flickered with incantations, and the Flame Dragon and Wind Blade appeared.</p><br/><p>A boom rattled out in all directions, striking fear into the hearts of all the Xiao clan members. Xiao Chang\u2019en\u2019s eyes went wide. Even though he couldn\u2019t see what was happening, the explosion itself was astonishing.</p><br/><p>The young woman looked dazed, and then a strange expression appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao ground his teeth, stalking forward, slashing his finger and covering it with blood. In a twinkling, the Blood Finger had appeared. His other hand flashed with the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex.</p><br/><p>Massive explosions filled heaven and earth. A moment later, the ripples died down. Meng Hao\u2019s entire body exuded bitterness as he stared at the meat jelly, which skipping and hopping about energetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so strange. You really don\u2019t know. How is it possible? You really don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

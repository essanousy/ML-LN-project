Earlier, Meng Hao had been pestering him, but now, the feeling he gave off was like that of some primordial wild beast. His gaze, his aura, the blood-colored tempest, all caused the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief to feel incredibly shocked.</p><br/><p>His expression was grave as Meng Hao walked forward, eyes glowing with coldness. It only took him a moment to reach the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, after which he waved his hand, causing a blood-colored light to spread out. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of blows.</p><br/><p>Booms echoed out. Around them, the fierce fighting continued, and up above, the battle of the peak Dao Seeking experts continued.</p><br/><p>Originally, the Southern Domain had been in the weaker position, but now that Meng Hao had risen up with his Blood Demon and the sixth level of the Blood Demon Grand Magic, everything\u2026 had been turned around!</p><br/><p>If Meng Hao could just kill the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, then the Southern Domain\u2026 would probably\u2026 have a chance to eke out a victory!</p><br/><p>The morale of the Southern Domain cultivators surged, and they lashed out with increasingly vicious attacks.</p><br/><p>Outside of the spell formations, one of the golden-armored giants had been killed, and the other stood there trembling, completely terrified of Meng Hao. The huge golden door, having lost one of the giants that had been supporting it, was now tilting awkwardly to the side.</p><br/><p>The giant watched in horror as Meng Hao fought the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, and its scalp began to grow numb. Finally, it threw the huge door down and turned to flee.</p><br/><p>After all, it was not a cultivator, but rather, a giant descended from an ancient bloodline. The thought of fighting Meng Hao struck terror into its heart.</p><br/><p>However, in the same instant that it turned to flee, the cold, detached woman who floated in the churning green mist looked over with flashing eyes. Her beautiful hand stretched out and pointed at the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cFleeing before the battle is finished? I\u2019ll exterminate your bloodline to the ninth degree of kinship!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, the giant began trembling, and a sealing mark appeared on its forehead. The mark began to burn, deep into its skin, all the way to the bone. The giant let out a miserable shriek, and madness appeared in its eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall erase your mind,\u201d said the woman calmly, \u201csend you into insanity, replace your life force with madness. Kill a hundred thousand enemies, and the curse will be lifted.\u201d The giant howled, and its expression twisted into one of insanity. Its eyes were blood-red as it leapt toward the Southern Domain army.</p><br/><p>Any Southern Domain cultivators it encountered were ripped to shreds before they even had a chance to flee. The giant crushed them with its feet, then picked them up and tossed them into its mouth. Blood flowed down its chin, and it seemed to be completely mad.</p><br/><p>To the Southern Domain forces, a mountain-like giant with strength similar to Dao Seeking was a huge influence on the battle as a whole. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of Southern Domain cultivators were killed.</p><br/><p>It was virtually impossible to stop. The only way to faze it would be for tens of thousands of cultivators to all attack it in unison. Unfortunately\u2026 there was no way the Northern Reaches cultivators would give the Southern Domain the opportunity to do such a thing. Under the direction of the woman in the green mist, the Northern Reaches cultivators began to push forward in an offensive.</p><br/><p>An endless sea of people surged forward like the tide in a general charge.</p><br/><p>In the battle between the Dao Seeking experts up above, Patriarch Song and Pill Demon were anxious, and yet were incapable of doing anything to provide assistance to the Southern Domain. All they could do was watch as the flow of battle once again reversed.</p><br/><p>Booms filled the air as Meng Hao fought back and forth with the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. The number one figure from the Northern Reaches had powerful energy, an incredible cultivation base, and wild, vicious attacks. That, along with Meng Hao\u2019s sixth level of the Blood Demon Grand Magic, made it seem as if the ground itself were about to explode up into the sky.</p><br/><p>As they struggled back and forth in combat, Meng Hao saw the giant going crazy, and could sense the sinister woman hovering in the green mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to die!\u201d he said to the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. Killing intent flickered in his eyes as he lifted his right leg up and then began to spin around rapidly. He turned into a cyclone that shot forward and slammed into the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief\u2019s incoming fist attack.</p><br/><p>A huge boom echoed out, and blood sprayed from the mouths of both opponents. However, it was at this point that Meng Hao suddenly vanished, then reappeared in the place of a Northern Reaches cultivator next to the charging giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll die for that!\u201d roared the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. Meng Hao\u2019s nimble manipulation of the battlefield was giving him a headache. He was just about to give chase when Meng Hao decisively waved a hand, causing a gigantic red mist to appear. The mist instantly churned into a vortex that swallowed up the roaring giant.</p><br/><p>A crunching, chewing sound could be heard. The sound was grating to the ears, and anyone who heard it couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.</p><br/><p>Blood flowed out from the vortex, along with miserable screams. Rumbling could be heard as the vortex then faded away. The red mist within flowed toward Meng Hao, fusing into him, making him\u2026 even stronger!</p><br/><p>He turned and punched directly at the incoming Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. A huge boom could be heard as, for the first time, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief was sent tumbling backward. His expression showed first shock, and then fury. Then his body flickered as he changed shape into a three-legged golden crow!</p><br/><p>Brilliant light shone off of him, making him look like a sun. Intense heat blasted against Meng Hao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the woman in the mist looked on with coldly glittering eyes. She stretched out her hand, causing nine magical symbols to fly out at top speed. They swirled together in midair to form a huge sealing symbol!</p><br/><p>The shockingly powerful sealing symbol immediately flew directly toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppress!\u201d said the woman lightly, her voice cold and devoid of any emotion. Her face was pale to begin with, but unleashing the nine magical symbols left it even paler.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent. His cultivation base surged as he raised his left hand, within which appeared a shocking black claw, roughly the same size as a human fist.</p><br/><p>As soon as the claw appeared, a brutal aura exploded out. At the same time, something that resembled the shriek of a cat echoed out, causing everything to shake.</p><br/><p>This claw was none other than one of the items Meng Hao had acquired during the eruption of the ancient Dao Lakes! After refining it for some time in the past, he was finally able to use it!</p><br/><p>It was not the claw of some wild beast, but actually, a cat!</p><br/><p>It was a cat\u2019s claw!</p><br/><p>The claw was black, and the cat it had come from was also completely black.</p><br/><p>As soon as it appeared, a brutal aura filled the air, and the astonishing shriek of the cat shook the minds of everyone in the area. It almost seemed to be an attack levied against the soul. Catalyzed by Meng Hao\u2019s cultivation base, the claw flew up into the air and expanded. It grew larger and larger until it was dozens of meters wide. Instantly, the claw slashed toward the incoming three-legged golden crow.</p><br/><p>The three-legged golden crow trembled, but was incapable of evading the strike. The claw slashed into it, and its three legs instantly exploded. It let out a miserable shriek as it morphed back into the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and his arms were slashed to pieces. He shot back in astonishment, simultaneously using a magical technique to instantly regrow his lost arms.</p><br/><p>His face was ashen and his voice weak as he said, \u201cNine Hells Burial Cat!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, the sealing symbol continued to barrel toward Meng Hao. He looked up at it, and the Blood Demon Grand Magic vortex rumbled up around him, transforming into a tempest, and then a Blood Demon head. Its expression was savage as it shot toward the sealing symbol, surging with a shocking energy that seemed capable of ripping everything apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisperse!\u201d said Meng Hao, his voice echoing out. The huge sealing symbol shuddered, then began to split apart. Cracking sounds could be heard, and then it exploded, transforming once again into nine magical symbols. Three of them were now dark, and gradually faded away. The other six flew back to the woman in the mist.</p><br/><p>Then, Meng Hao began to slaughter his way toward the woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour turn to be suppressed!\u201d he said. \u201cNinth Mountain!\u201d He pointed out with his index finger, and everything shook. The Ninth Mountain appeared, followed by the Blood Demon Grand Magic, which fused into it, turning it bright red. It then shot directly toward the woman in the mist.</p><br/><p>As it descended, a huge fissure opened up in the ground below, which consumed no small amount of Northern Reaches cultivators. The woman\u2019s face flickered, and she suddenly reached out and grabbed the remaining trembling wraith, then hurled it up into the air.</p><br/><p>The wraith transformed into a shooting star which shot toward the Ninth Mountain. At the same time, the woman performed an incantation gesture, which caused her six remaining magical symbols to fly up at top speed and form a halo that joined the wraith as it slammed into the Ninth Mountain.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOMMMMM!</p><br/><p>Shockingly, the descending power of the Ninth Mountain seemed to have been obstructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack White Pearls!\u201d Meng Hao said coolly. A black and white mist appeared around the Ninth Mountain, which then turned into two pearls. As they rotated around the Ninth Mountain, a rumbling could be heard, and the mountain began to descend once more. The wraith was shattered into pieces, and the halo exploded in a brilliant flash of colors. They were incapable of blocking the Ninth Mountain as it continued to descend toward the shocked woman.</p><br/><p>Colors flashed in the sky and rumbling filled the air. The green mist was blasted to bits. The woman, as well as quite a few of the Northern Reaches cultivators in the area, were all completely crushed under the mountain.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, there was a new mountain in the land!</p><br/><p>Everyone in the area was shocked, including the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. His eyes were shot with blood. Because of Meng Hao, the Northern Reaches had sustained far too many losses in this difficult battle.</p><br/><p>Originally, victory had been a certain thing for the Northern Reaches, but now\u2026 all because of Meng Hao, the tide had turned! If they couldn\u2019t handle Meng Hao, then the Northern Reaches\u2026 would lose!</p><br/><p>Having reached this conclusion, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief\u2019s eyes flickered with determination. Originally, he wanted to avoid using the ancestral statuary, as it would waste a significant amount of qi reserves. That was why he had first attempted to handle Meng Hao himself.</p><br/><p>Now he could see\u2026 that he had made a mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cI should have used the ancestral statuary from the beginning, regardless of the cost!! However, it\u2019s still not too late!</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, to be suppressed by my clan\u2019s ancestral statuary will be your good fortune!\u201d The Imperial Clan Chief\u2019s eyes radiated determination as he pointed one finger up toward the sky and another down toward the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestral statuary, please reveal yourself!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

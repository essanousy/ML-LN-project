She had a slight smile on her young face, which she quickly covered up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m pretty close with Grandmaster Pill Cauldron,\u201d he continued, smiling as he crouched down next to her. \u201cIf I make the introduction for you, it will probably help quite a bit.\u201d The cold wind blew across his face and caused his hair to lift up, revealing his distinct profile. Beneath the moon like this, the slight darkness of his skin was not visible. There was something distinctly handsome about him, and also something slightly strange.</p><br/><p>Hanxue Shan couldn\u2019t keep a straight face. She laughed, giving Meng Hao a sidelong glance. Her eyes shone in a way that seemed to indicate her mood was lifting, and the despondency which had filled her the past few days was passing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like YOU\u2019RE Grandmaster Pill Cauldron!\u201d she said with a laugh. Then, she intentionally straightened her face again, as if she were enduring great suffering. She continued, her tone not exactly polite: \u201cYou\u2019ve never even been to the Southern Domain, how could you possibly be familiar with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao scratched his head, then laughed as he sat down next to her atop the pile of broken rocks. Ruins and rubble surrounded the two of them, and the snow fluttered down from above. The cold wind whimpered as it blew past.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and allowed an unfathomable expression to fill his face, something he\u2019d picked up from Zhou Dekun. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Even though I\u2019ve never met Grandmaster Pill Cauldron, we\u2019re both Grandmasters of the Dao of alchemy, and have long since been friends in spirit. After you get to the Violet Fate Sect, when you see Grandmaster Pill Cauldron, ask him if he remembers the person he saw in the snowstorm that year.\u201d He looked up into the sky with a look of reminiscence. It would have looked very realistic if not for the fact that he was looking at Hanxue Shan out of the corner of his eye.</p><br/><p>Hanxue Shan covered her smile with her hand, looking at Meng Hao with her beautiful eyes. Seeing his expression, she couldn\u2019t hold back her laughter any longer. When she laughed, it sounded like bells. The depression in her heart seemed to be dissolving.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cAfter I get to the Violet Fate Sect, when I see Grandmaster Pill Cauldron, I\u2019ll ask him exactly that.\u201d Then winked and continued in a crafty tone, \u201cI think I should probably add some information, though. I\u2019ll remind him of something that person said in the snowstorm that year. He said, \u2018Every time it snows, think of me.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds a little bit flirty\u2026.\u201d said Meng Hao, coughing lightly. He laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, though. Ordinary people can\u2019t understand the relationship between myself and Grandmaster Pill Cauldron.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hanxue Shan laughed again. \u201cIn Holy Snow City, that\u2019s what two people who care about each other say when they part.\u201d She laughed again, then rubbed her chest and straightened up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then, I forgive you,\u201d laughed Meng Hao. He gathered together some snow from the ground and held it in his hand, watching it as it melted. It seemed the melting of the snow caused memories to rise up within him; he suddenly thought back to the Violet Fate Sect. The images of all the people he knew there began to flit through his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if they\u2019re all okay\u2026.\u201d he thought, looking off in the direction of the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>Seeing the manner in which he had picked up the snow, Hanxue Shan continued in a low voice, \u201cActually, I only admire Grandmaster Pill Cauldron, that\u2019s all. The things I told you before weren\u2019t really true. All I really want is a pill that he personally concocted.\u201d Seeing Meng Hao smiling, her eyes turned hard and she earnestly added, \u201cJust one pill would leave me completely satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao shook his head with a smile. He looked at her, so delicate and innocent, and then muttered something to himself. Finally, he retrieved a medicinal pill from his bag of holding. It was a Foundation Establishment Day pill that he had concocted some time ago. The quality of the pill wasn\u2019t bad; it contained more than eighty percent medicinal strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to offer you this pill as a gift,\u201d he said. After a moment\u2019s thought, he used his fingernail to carve the character \u201cSnow \u201d onto its surface. Then he handed it out to her. \u201cThis medicinal pill is more valuable than one concocted by Grandmaster Pill Cauldron. The reason is not because of the pill itself, but rather, because it was concocted by me.\u201d He smiled.</p><br/><p>Hanxue Shan thought for a moment and then took the pill. She held it in her hand and looked down at it. She was about to say something when Meng Hao suddenly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you run into any problems in the Violet Fate Sect,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can use that medicinal pill to gain an audience with Grandmaster Pill Demon. After he sees it, he will resolve whatever situation you\u2019re in.\u201d Meng Hao smiled as he spoke, but his voice contained hints of melancholy. As for Hanxue Shan, her eyes went wide. His words gave her the unconscious feeling that he was being intentionally mysterious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Grandmaster Pill Demon asks about me\u2026.\u201d before he could finish, Hanxue Shan suddenly interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him that whenever it snows, you think of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was taken aback. He could only imagine the expression that would appear on his Master\u2019s face were he to hear such words. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud, a laughter that contained happiness. There was something beautiful about it, although no one could possibly understand what it meant except he himself.</p><br/><p>Continuing to laugh, Meng Hao descended from the pile of rubble and began to walk off.</p><br/><p>However, before he could take three steps, his expression suddenly flickered. Immediately, he dashed back, grabbed Hanxue Shan, and then Bloodburst Flashed away.</p><br/><p>The instant he disappeared, a noiseless beam of mysterious light shot through the night to land in the exact position they had just been standing in. An explosion ripped through the air, causing the ground to tremble. The pile of rubble where Meng Hao and Hanxue Shan had just been standing on was transformed into nothing but ash drifting on the wind.</p><br/><p>Some distance away, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes gleamed coldly as he looked at beam after beam of light approaching from far away. Without hesitation, he held Hanxue Shan in his arms and retreated backward.</p><br/><p>The rest of the Frigid Snow Clan members were instantly roused from sleep. The four Grand Elders, Hanxue Bao, and the more than two hundred Cultivators all leaped out of their beds.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you want to wipe out the Frigid Snow Clan to the last man!\u201d said Hanxue Bao wrathfully. His Cultivation base had fallen, and he was no longer an eminently powerful expert of the Spirit Severing stage. Now, he could only wield the power of the late Nascent Soul stage. As he spoke, he stamped his foot down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>The ground rumbled, and cracks spread out in all directions. The earth showered up as a Thorn Rampart shield emerged. The shocking thorns spread out in all direction, and a massive roaring sound filled the air.</p><br/><p>As the Thorn Rampart appeared, nearly a thousand Cultivators came into view outside in the snow. Among this group of a thousand, there were eight who seemed far more shocking than the others. No snow touched their bodies; even as it neared them, it was destroyed.</p><br/><p>These eight were Nascent Soul Cultivators. Six of them were from the Western Desert, the remaining two being from the Black Lands Palace. It seemed this deadly attack on the Frigid Snow Clan was being led by the Western Desert.</p><br/><p>The exterminating power of a Spirit Severing Cultivator wasn\u2019t a threat that faded from people's minds after only a few days. These people obviously dared to attack the Frigid Snow Clan because they knew its true circumstances.</p><br/><p>Booms filled the air. The thousand Cultivators along with the eight Nascent Soul Cultivators employed magical techniques and divine abilities, constantly attacking the Thorn Rampart.</p><br/><p>The ground quaked, and the Frigid Snow Clan Cultivators\u2019 faces flickered as they stood there silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder they came so quickly,\u201d said Hanxue Bao, his cold gaze coming to rest somewhere off in the distance, upon something no one else could see. \u201cThey\u2019re benefiting from the augury of the Western Desert\u2019s Constellation Tribe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao approached, holding Hanxue Shan protectively. As he did, he heard Hanxue Bao\u2019s words, whereupon he looked out past the thorns into the snowstorm outside. A moment passed, and then he blinked his right eye seven times. Immediately his view of the world changed. Everything became black and white. At the same time, out in the snowstorm, Meng Hao caught sight of a figure that he hadn\u2019t been able to see before.</p><br/><p>It was a man wearing a white robe with a hood that obscured his face. Ripples were emanating out from his hands and floating in front of him was a black bowl, within which churned turbid waters. It seemed to be some sort of magic.</p><br/><p>The instant that Meng Hao looked over, it seemed the white-robed man sensed it. He looked up and directly at Meng Hao. Meng Hao\u2019s heart trembled. What he saw were eyes with two pupils.</p><br/><p>He felt something clawing at his heart, whereupon he immediately ended the technique he had been using. His vision of the world went back to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see him too?\u201d said Hanxue Bao, looking over at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Constellation Tribe is one of the three great Tribes of the Western Desert. They excel at augury, and believe that all the stars in the night sky are Demons.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a rumbling sound could be heard. Outside the Thorn Rampart, three giants appeared in the snowstorm. Each one was over one hundred and fifty meters tall, and caused the ground to shake as they moved. They held enormous cudgels in their hands as they charged forward.</p><br/><p>Up above in the sky, piercing shrieks could be heard as multiple Flood Dragons appeared.</p><br/><p>Further off in the distance, glowing war chariots could be seen charging forward. Magic swirled around the eight Nascent Soul Cultivators, along with magical items.</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore the outside world! Focus on activating the spell!\u201d As Hanxue Bao\u2019s powerful voice echoed out, the four Frigid Snow Clan Grand Elders, as well as the other Clan members, lowered their heads to look at the spell beneath them.</p><br/><p>The Thorn Rampart shook and began to crumble. It seemed it wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up against a combined attack like this for very long.</p><br/><p>A sigh escaped the mouth of Hanxue Bao. He waved his right hand, catalyzing another Thorn Rampart seed, which grew out to fortify their defenses.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that Constellation Tribe member is here. He\u2019s really suppressing the power of the Thorn Rampart.\u201d Anxiety seeped onto Hanxue Bao\u2019s face. However, it was at this moment that a bright glow suddenly emanated out from below.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s activating! Patriarch, the spell is activating!!\u201d Frantic, joyful cries rose up from the Frigid Snow Clan members.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked back and saw the glow of the spell in the ground growing stronger and emitting a bright glow. From the look of it, it would fully activate in quite a short time.</p><br/><p>The Frigid Snow Clan members were starting to get excited. However, it was at this time that suddenly a huge boom filled the air. Everyone\u2019s attention was drawn off into the distance. All of the magical techniques and items of the enemy were being drawn together to form into a massive glow of extermination that resembled a star. It was with indescribable speed that it shot forward, slamming into the Thorn Rampart and smashing it into pieces.</p><br/><p>Hanxue Bao let out a growling roar. He lifted his right hand into the air, causing the Thorn Rampart to reform once again. He shot forward, flashing an incantation signal and then waving his arm. A tempest shot forward, roaring toward the star of extermination, slamming into it and destroying it. Blood sprayed from Hanxue Bao\u2019s mouth, and he staggered backward, his face listless.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch!!\u201d Grief and indignation appeared on the faces of the Frigid Snow Clan members. Hanxue Shan gnawed on her lower lip, her face pale. After everything she had experienced, she was no longer afraid, just concerned.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao said nothing. He looked at the dawn light spreading out, and the Western Desert Cultivators. A strange glow appeared in his eyes as he looked off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf my calculations are correct, any moment now\u2026.\u201d His heart began to thump as he saw a soaring fog appear off in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave faith in the Lord Fifth, gain eternal life\u2026. Three circles to the left, then three to the right. Shake those butts!\u201d When the faint voice drifted across the air, a strange smile broke out on Meng Hao\u2019s face. It continued to grow stronger until he started laughing.</p><br/><p>------</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Paul Venesky, \u0e1b\u0e32\u0e13\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e4c \u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e17\u0e23, Teemu Joensuu, and Stanley Bertumen</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

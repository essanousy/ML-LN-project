It slashed into Lord White\u2019s five unleashed Essences, starting with the Essence of extermination. Meng Hao shuddered as the meat jelly armor absorbed the brunt of the force. The Battle Weapon sliced like a sharp knife through bamboo as it destroyed the Essence of extermination and continued onward.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, Lord White's magic of the Essence of power closed in. It was capable of disrupting all sorts of power, be they of the fleshly body or the cultivation base. It was like Lightness-in-Heaviness, and at the same time, Heaviness-in-Lightness. The intense disparity caused Meng Hao to cough up a mouthful of blood. His face paled as the meat jelly armor shivered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSever!\u201d Meng Hao roared, his eyes completely bloodshot. Disregarding any injuries, he used all of the power of the Battle Weapon to slash down. Rumbling sounds filled the starry sky, which seemed to be on the verge of being sliced apart. The Battle Weapon sliced through the Essence of power like a hot knife through butter!</p><br/><p>However, the Dao of the curse Essence then became a boundless fog that completely surrounded Meng Hao. His body began to wither, and the meat jelly armor let out a plaintive cry; cracking sounds began to emanate, as if it were on the verge of shattering.</p><br/><p>Lord White\u2019s Essences were far beyond those of ordinary 5-Essences Dao Sovereigns. They were terrifying to a degree that Meng Hao had never seen before!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely not weak,\u201d Lord White said in a sinister voice. \u201cHowever, in the end... you have too few Essences. As an Allheaven Dao Immortal, you are powerful, but you cannot truly defy the Heavens, nor can you defy me!\u201d The curse power mist roiled, swirling around Meng Hao as if it wished to burrow into him through the pores on his skin.</p><br/><p>A vicious expression could be seen on Meng Hao\u2019s face as the Battle Weapon slashed out with scintillating, mysterious light. Ignoring the serious injuries that were being inflicted on him, Meng Hao slashed through the curse power, toward Lord White!</p><br/><p>However, there was still plenty of Essence power in between them. Next was the Essence of land, which filled the space between them with what seemed to be planets and continents.</p><br/><p>At this point, the meat jelly armor shattered into pieces, which then reformed into the shape of the meat jelly. It seemed extremely weak, and immediately transformed into a gray light that shot back into Meng Hao\u2019s bag of holding.</p><br/><p>He lost the meat jelly armor, but in the moment before it disappeared, it still helped him to resist the power of the Essence of land. Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao\u2019s mouth, but he still shot forward like lightning, like a shooting star, slamming into the Essence, slicing through with the Battle Weapon, backed by all the power of an Allheaven Dao Immortal.</p><br/><p>The starry sky trembled, and everything dimmed. As the Battle Weapon slashed out, massive pressure exploded out, allowing Meng Hao to blast through the planets and continents to appear directly in front of Lord White.</p><br/><p>However, it was in this moment that Lord White\u2019s final Essence erupted out. It was none other than Timeshift magic, which caused the world to distort and run in reverse. It was like a wind of time, which caused all of the other four Essences which Meng Hao had already vanquished... to suddenly appear again!!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo beginning, and no end. That is Time. Since you cannot defeat my five Essences magic, then you do not qualify to be my opponent!\u201d As Lord White\u2019s voice undulated out, Meng Hao once again coughed up a mouthful of blood as his internal injuries flared. He could no longer sustain the Battle Weapon, which vanished, returning to the form of a copper mirror, which flew back into Meng Hao\u2019s bag of holding.</p><br/><p>In that moment, the five Essences magic was restored, forming something like the image of a world up in the starry sky.</p><br/><p>This was Lord White\u2019s five Essences world, a world in which the flow of time was distorted, in which lands rumbled, in which the power of extermination threw everything into chaos, in which extermination and curses flowed through Heaven and Earth, and which pulsed with the Essence of power. It was a shocking world which seemed capable of sweeping over anything.</p><br/><p>It immediately began to rumble through the air, crashing down toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>A sensation of deadly crisis surged up inside of Meng Hao. His eyes were bloodshot, and inside, he was sighing. However, in that very instant, the will to fight burned even hotter in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a sudden onslaught won\u2019t work, then... I\u2019ll change styles!\u201d Flames danced within Meng Hao\u2019s eyes. As the shocking Essence world crushed down toward him, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture, which instantly caused the fluctuations of the League of Demon Sealers to spring up inside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe League of Demon Sealers can seal Greater Demons of Heaven and Earth. I wonder if perhaps... Essences can also be sealed?\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered with a strange light as he became more convinced that his idea would work. Without any further hesitation, he performed an incantation gesture and then waved his finger toward the incoming Essence world.</p><br/><p>Eighth Demon Sealing Hex!</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s cultivation base, life force, soul, divine sense, everything that was him flowed into the Demon Sealing Hexing magic which he was unleashing.</p><br/><p>That image of a world, which seemed so impossible to fight back against, all of a sudden seemed to slow down. Although no observer would notice this, Meng Hao could sense what was happening. As soon as he unleashed the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex, countless, innumerable strands of light appeared to entangle the Essence world, causing it to falter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIts working!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered, and even as a look of shock appeared on Lord White\u2019s face, he performed another incantation gesture and then waved his finger again.</p><br/><p>Demon Sealing, Seventh Hex!</p><br/><p>Demon Sealing, Sixth Hex!</p><br/><p>Demon Sealing, Fifth Hex!!</p><br/><p>Karma. Life-Death. Inside-Outside. Three Hexing magics all erupted out of Meng Hao, flowing out through his finger. Instantly, the starry sky went silent, and the Essence world experienced a Heaven-shaking, Earth-toppling transformation.</p><br/><p>It stopped in place, and was now surrounded by a boundless gray mist, which writhed and seethed as numerous magical symbols appeared on its surface. That was none other than the manifestation of the Life-Death Hexing.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, Karma Threads appeared on the Essence world, spreading out into the void, connecting it to who-knew-how many people. Most of those threads connected it to Lord White, and yet, as of this moment, the Karma Threads were merging together to transform into numerous sealing marks!</p><br/><p>This was Karmic Hexing!</p><br/><p>Finally, a massive power of expulsion descended from the starry sky onto the Essence world. Suddenly, the Essence world experienced a bizarre transformation. First it increased in size dramatically, then it shrank down, as the power of the Inside-Outside Hex exploded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d Lord White cried hoarsely.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had experienced a sudden stroke of inspiration, and now his eyes were shining brightly as his four Hexing magics descended onto the Essence world. It was at this point that the Demon Sealing Jade within his bag of holding began to speak in its archaic voice after having been silent for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Sealing Hexing magic can seal the Greater Demons of Heaven and Earth. This is Righteous Bestowal!</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Sealing Hexing magic can seal the magic of all living things. This is the Reproaching Seal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind spun as the voice echoed out within him. He then raised his right hand, and his eyes shone mysteriously as he pushed out toward the Essence world.</p><br/><p>\u201cReproaching Seal!\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>As soon as the two words left his mouth, a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering sound erupted out, causing the starry sky to tremble. At the same time, an enormous magical symbol appeared, which then shot down onto the Essence World, sealing it!</p><br/><p>Sealing the Essences!!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the entire Essence world went still, almost as if it had been turned into stone. No ripples emanated from it, and its aura was gone. Lord White, who was hovering not too far off, experienced a backlash, and coughed up a huge mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis....\u201d He didn\u2019t recognize the Demon Sealing Hexing magic, but it reminded him of something that had left him with a deep impression long ago, and that was....</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dao of Lord Li!!\u201d Lord White\u2019s face flickered as he realized that his connection with his Essence had been severed. Although it wasn\u2019t anything permanent, at the moment, he was completely incapable of unleashing Essence power.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was equally shaken. He looked at the sealed Essence world, and could sense the intense fluctuations of the Demon Sealing Hexing magic inside of him. Gradually, the glow in his eyes grew brighter.</p><br/><p>Now, Lord White was looking at Meng Hao, not just with fear, but with the intense desire to kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven without Essence, I can still cut you down!\u201d he said, waving his sleeve. His right hand then shot out toward the starry sky in a clawing motion. Instantly, five rifts were torn open.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive Venoms of the Seventh Sea, sow chaos in the skies of the Mountains and Seas, disturb the peace of all living things!\u201d Lord White bit the tip of his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood. Instantly, it became a blood sea which shot up toward the five rifts and then poured into them. Next, thumping sounds began to emanate out.</p><br/><p>Apparently, there were entities inside of those rifts who were breaking through a barrier, attempting to pass through the rifts. With each thump, the starry sky trembled. Suddenly, cracking sounds could be heard as two spindly antennae burst out from within one of the rifts. They were followed by... a vicious bug which scuttled out rapidly. Soon, a 30,000-meter, pitch-black centipede appeared in the starry sky!</p><br/><p>As soon as it appeared, it let out a shocking screech which caused all hearts to tremble!</p><br/><p>Next, cracking sounds echoed out from the second rift as a crimson-red, three-horned viper popped out, tens of thousands of meters long, its forked tongue flickering, its eyes gleaming coldly. It threw its head back and howled as, all of a sudden, countless eyes appeared all over its body!</p><br/><p>Next, cracking sounds could be heard from the third, fourth and fifth rifts, as more creatures emerged. There was an enormous scorpion, surrounded by swirling black mist, and a violet toad as big as a mountain.</p><br/><p>Last of all was... a 30,000-meter long lizard with rugged scales that dripped with slime. It was a completely shocking sight!</p><br/><p>\u201cFive Venoms, kill this person!\u201d Lord White\u2019s eyes flickered, and the five venomous creatures roared as they charged toward Meng Hao.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His face completely drained of blood, and he felt as if the shadow of death were looming over him.</p><br/><p>He clearly remembered the scene when he had entered this Blessed Land, how so many Cultivators had exploded, their Dao Pillars sucked away. He was from the Black Lands, and knew a secret method that he had been able to utilize to stay safe. But with Meng Hao here, he felt an incredible pressure weighing down upon him that he had never felt before.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it seemed that no matter what he said, Meng Hao wouldn\u2019t believe him. Meng Hao completely had the upper hand. Faced with such life-or-death danger, Lu Tao\u2019s schemes disappeared like ash into the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d said Lu Tao pleadingly. \u201cThunderclap Leaves can be absorbed into magical treasures to imbue them with the power of lightning. Why don\u2019t you believe me!?\u201d His voice was hoarse, and from the look on his face, he had been pushed to the limit and had nothing more he could say. His eyes suddenly seemed to flash with understanding. He gave a hoarse laugh, and his eyes filled with boldness born of desperation. \u201cI get it. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t believe me, it\u2019s that you want to kill me!</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! Just shatter my spell, then. I, Lu, have already explained the Thunderclap Leaf\u2019s usage. If you\u2019re going to kill me, then just kill me. But you can forget about getting the information from my jade slip!\u201d Gritting his teeth, Lu Tao pushed down hard on the jade slip. If Meng Hao was really going to destroy the spell, then he would crush it to make sure the fish died and the net was torn; everyone would lose.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked calmly at Lu Tao. Some time passed, and then he sighed. He lifted his hand and pushed down again. A boom sounded out. What was destroyed, however, was not the spell, but rather the jade slip in Lu Tao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao destroyed it, transforming it into pieces of ash.</p><br/><p>This caused Lu Tao\u2019s face to fall and his heart to grow cold. Obviously, this action on the part of Meng Hao indicated that\u2026 he didn\u2019t believe him!</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, or don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m out of patience,\u201d he said coolly. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t believe what Lu Tao said about the Thunderclap Leaves being able to imbue magical treasures with the power of lightning. But Lu Tao spoke his words too easily. They might be true, but Meng Hao couldn\u2019t imagine that the Thunderclap Leaves collected by Patriarch Reliance would be so simple.</p><br/><p>A bitter smile appeared on Lu Tao\u2019s face, as if he had nothing left to say. Meng Hao nodded slightly, then began to press down onto the spell. This time, he would completely destroy it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019LL TELL!!\u201d Lu Tao\u2019s body was trembling, and his heart nearly collapsed into pieces. The shaking of his Dao Pillar turned into a look of resolve in his eyes, and a bitter smile on his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he said, quivering. \u201cBut you have to swear that after I tell you, you won\u2019t do anything to damage my spell.\u201d He smiled a painful smile. Everything he had said before was filled with half-truths, and yet, none of it even touched on the real truth, the most important part. Facing up against death the way he was now, however, he had no choice but to be honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak,\u201d said Meng Hao, his expression the same as ever, but his eyes shining mysteriously.</p><br/><p>Lu Tao took a deep breath, and was silent for just a moment. Then, with a pained look, he slowly began to speak. \u201cThunderclap Leaves come from the Thunderclap Tree. But the Thunderclap Tree\u2019s real name is Sieve Net Thunder, or Mulberry Thunder Tree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was placid, and it was impossible to tell what he was thinking. He looked coolly at Lu Tao. This in turn caused indescribable terror to fill Lu Tao\u2019s heart. His anguished expression grew stronger, and the coldness within him completely encompassed his heart and filled his body. He began to tremble with fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a legend about the Mulberry Thunder Tree. According to this legend, in ancient times there was an almighty being who achieved enlightenment while sitting underneath a Sieve Net Thunder Tree. Heavenly Tribulation descended, desiring to wipe out this new Dao. The will of the lightning infected the tree. As for the almighty being, it split apart the Tribulation Lightning and then stepped into the stars.</p><br/><p>\u201cThough the almighty being departed, the Sieve Net Thunder Tree absorbed some of its Dao in addition to the power of the Tribulation Lightning. It was destroyed, and yet, a thousand years later, a sprout appeared within the dead trunk!</p><br/><p>\u201cThus was born a tree that was mulberry, but not mulberry. Thunder, but not thunder. A Sieve Net Mulberry Thunder Tree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he listened to Lu Tao, but he said nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn regards to the almighty being which achieved enlightenment underneath the Sieve Net Mulberry Thunder Tree, what he said that day beneath the tree was that if he could not achieve ultimate supremacy, he would rather his body be shattered, and stay underneath the tree for all eternity!\u201d Lu Tao lowered his head as he spoke, hiding the stubborness which shone in his eyes.</p><br/><p>A strange expression appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face as he listened to the story. It seemed to him unlikely that Lu Tao was making this story up as he went.</p><br/><p>\u201cCountless ages have passed since the Sieve Net Mulberry Thunder Tree appeared. Eventually, it became part of the heart of the earth, which then caused more trees to sprout. Yet, they contained the experiences from events in ancient times. Because the will of the Heavens evolved, this tree was eventually able to cast off that which withered it. Today, it is as precious as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Tao was silent for a moment before continuing. \u201cMost Cultivators will use the tree to meld it with magical items, or even absorb it into their Dao Pillars, acquiring the invincible thunder which exists within the Sieve Net Mulberry Thunder Leaf.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, in the Black Lands, there is a type of larva called Frigid Snow, which exists in the snowstorms of mid-winter. Of all the remarkable bugs in the world, it is ranked number ninety-seven. It\u2019s a remarkable larva; it doesn\u2019t produce silk, but rather, intense coldness. It is quite prized by Cultivators, and if it can be acquired, is viewed as a precious treasure. It can be refined into a Frigid Spirit, embodied into a Frigid treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis larva is not common, but not exceedingly rare, and occasionally appears.\u201d At this point, Lu Tao paused for a moment and looked at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked back at him, and their gazes locked for a moment. Lu Tao sighed inwardly, and then continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat only a few people know, however, is that there is an unusual relationship between the larva and the Sieve Net Thunder Mulberry Tree. If the larva consumes the leaves of the tree, it is possible for it to become the number four ranked remarkable bug\u2026 the Eyeless Larva!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Eyeless Larva turns into a chrysalis, and will produce a thread of silk. That thread cannot be broken, nor can the body be destroyed. The body cannot be destroyed, and the thread cannot be broken. It creates an unstoppable cycle. The thread becomes an invincible precious treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Eyeless Larva has only appeared twice throughout history, and each time, the thread it produced caused a sensation in the Cultivation world. There was even conflict in the Eastern Lands. To this very day, no one knows what caused the death of the Eyeless Larvae that appeared twice before.\u201d Lu Tao sighed inwardly. Having finished speaking, he looked deeply at Meng Hao, then closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao muttered to himself as he looked at closed-eyed Lu Tao. Finally, he laughed. Turning, his body transformed into a prismatic beam which shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>After Meng Hao left, Lu Tao opened his eyes. He looked blankly up at the sky, then let out a long sigh. Soon, his eyes filled with a cold glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything I said now was ninety percent true and ten percent false. That guy might by smart, but he\u2019ll have a hard time telling which is which. He\u2019ll definitely go looking for the Frigid Snow Larva. If he really does feed it the Sieve Net Thunder Mulberry Leaf, then he\u2019s dead!</p><br/><p>\u201cAll I have to do now is endure this pain a bit longer until the Black Sieve Sect finishes. Then I\u2019ll be able to find some clues in this place to find what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d A grim look on his face, he took a deep breath, and then closed his eyes to begin repairing his spell.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was lost in thought as he flew through the air. Of course he wouldn\u2019t believe everything that Lu Tao told him. However, he was fairly certain that at least some of what he\u2019d said was true. It would have been too difficult to simply make up such a story on the spot. Perhaps half was true and half were lies.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith desire, comes incompleteness. If I have no desire, then the storms will not touch me.\u201d Meng Hao smiled as he continued onward. Everything he passed was completely barren; he didn\u2019t see even one rogue Foundation Establishment Cultivator. Up ahead, the Hundred Spirits Tower emitted a bright glow which surrounded everything.</p><br/><p>From such a distance, Meng Hao was unable to spot Xu Qing amongst the crowd. He silently took out the good luck charm and poured some spiritual energy into it. Immediately, he felt the teleportation power.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t teleport immediately. It would require some time before the power could be activated. Meng Hao took a deep breath and then shot toward the peak of a nearby mountain. He sat down cross-legged. Ignoring what was happening around him, he continued to pour spiritual energy into the good luck charm, feeling the teleportation power growing in intensity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to wait for the time it takes half an incense stick to burn\u2026\u201d This was his first time using the good luck charm, so it was also his first time encountering its downside.</p><br/><p>His current location wasn\u2019t exactly safe, but there were no people around, only the glow emanating from the Hundred Spirits Tower. However, his Perfect Foundation was still capable of resisting it. If too much time passed, though, it would become more difficult to fight back. Therefore, he concentrated fully on the good luck charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder where I\u2019ll be teleported to\u2026.\u201d His eyes flickered as he felt the teleportation power surging. He placed his right hand on the ground. The dirt began to churn, and tentacles burst up out of the soil. They transformed into a violet-golden fruit the size of a palm. Meng Hao closed his fingers over it and then placed it into his bag of the Cosmos.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that suddenly, something flickered in the air near the Hundred Spirits Tower. It wasn\u2019t large, but Meng Hao immediately recognized it. It was none other than what he and Han Bei had encountered before teleporting out of the square cauldron\u2026 the meat jelly!</p><br/><p>It floated in mid-air, its archaic features gazing curiously at the Hundred Spirits Tower.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, it emitted a piercing howl which filled heaven and earth. The wind and clouds surged, and the ground shook. Even the Hundred Spirits Tower trembled as if it might collapse. The hundreds of phantoms which circled around all began to shriek. Lightning began to build up on their bodies.</p><br/><p>Surrounding the tower at its base were nearly one thousand Black Sieve Sect disciples, all sitting cross legged. In the forefront were eight Core Formation Cultivators. As soon as the meat jelly appeared and the clouds whipped into a frenzy, their eyes opened, and they looked up into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s appeared!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat thing is Ultimate Vexation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes filled with excitement, and their hearts pounded as their hands flickered incantations. Immediately, the ground in front of them began to glow, and suddenly Patriarch Violet Sieve and the beautiful middle-aged woman appeared. Nascent Soul Cultivators!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it was fished out!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall acquire this item today!\u201d cried Patriarch Violet Sieve. His eyes were fixed on the meat jelly and they shined with intense expectation.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

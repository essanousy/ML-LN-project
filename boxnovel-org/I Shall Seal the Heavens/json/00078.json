He laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe arrived here even faster than us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou three Sects didn\u2019t notify me, so I was forced to divine things for myself,\u201d said Lord Revelation in a cool tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d said one of the Cold Wind Sect Core Formation Eccentrics. He wore a long black robe. \u201cNow that the kid has been found, it won\u2019t be long before we can get into Patriarch Reliance\u2019s meditation zone. This matter has been going on for quite a while. Even the great Sects in the Southern Domain are aware of what\u2019s going on.\u201d His gaze had fallen onto Meng Hao, and he looked at him expressionlessly, as if he were cricket.</p><br/><p>The lot of them didn\u2019t pay him any heed whatsoever as they spoke, as if they knew that their words could decide his life or death. In fact, their conversation would determine his fate.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao said nothing. He knew that if he wanted to fight back against their bullying, he would have to think of a method. His mind spun as he analyzed the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch,\u201d said Liu Daoyun, bowing with clasped hands toward one of his Sect\u2019s Core Formation Eccentrics. \u201cThis person has a treasured spear hidden on his person.\u201d He lifted his head and looked at Meng Hao with a sneer, the venom written clearly on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, the tiny Qi Condensation Cultivator turns out to be of the ninth level\u2026.\u201d said the black-robed Cultivator coolly, his face seemingly permanently red. \u201cNo wonder he was able to throw the Cultivation World of the State of Zhao into such chaos.\u201d He lifted his hand toward Meng Hao as if he were about to grab him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am here, and so is the spear,\u201d said Meng Hao suddenly, his eyes flashing. His voice could sever nails and slice iron. A wild look appeared in his eyes that seemed to say he knew he was powerless to prevent them from taking his treasures, but if they did, he would end his own life immediately.</p><br/><p>Hearing Meng Hao speak, the old man who had been about to make a move on him stopped and frowned. The onlookers also frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Cultivation base is low and weak,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cIf the older generation wishes to rob my treasures, please do so. But if I lose even one treasure, then I will end my life. And if I am dead, then I can\u2019t take you to Founder Patriarch\u2019s meditation zone. I would rather die than be robbed by you!\u201d As he spoke, his face shone with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can just kill you,\u201d said one of the six Core Formation Cultivators, \u201cthen use a heaven-defying Soulsearch to drag the location out of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao heard this, he let out a hearty laugh. Not the slightest look of fear could be seen in his eyes. His laughter echoed through the mountains, stabbing into the ears of the old Eccentrics.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you plan to Search me then go ahead. Only Inner Sect Disciples know the location of the Patriarch\u2019s meditation zone. But even if you know the location, without me alive, conscious, and unharmed, you\u2019ll never be able to get inside.\u201d When they heard this, all the old Eccentrics stared at him with eyes as cold as ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou of the elder generation have profound Cultivation bases. Surely you know some Spirit Puppetry arts. But without my consciousness there, or if I have been injured in any way, you won\u2019t be able to enter. You must have my complete and utter support!\u201d Decisiveness filled Meng Hao\u2019s voice. He gave them the feeling that he had thrown all caution to the wind, which made them frown.</p><br/><p>Actually, when it came to Meng Hao, they didn\u2019t care so much about him; what they truly were interested in was Patriarch Reliance\u2019s Sublime Spirit Scripture. The Eccentrics frowned and then looked toward Lord Revelation.</p><br/><p>He stared at Meng Hao, his eyes flashing. Even though he was capable of divining many things, he wasn\u2019t able to divine anything at all about this particular matter. All eyes were on him as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t divine the details. But even if ninety-five percent of what this kid says is false, we still can\u2019t afford to gamble on it.\u201d His words echoed the thoughts of all the onlookers. These Eccentrics were experienced and astute, as well as crafty. However, all their scheming couldn\u2019t assure victory under these circumstances. This was because\u2026 they couldn\u2019t afford to bet. Even if most of what Meng Hao said was a lie, there could be some truth to it.</p><br/><p>If they lost, they lost the chance to get into Patriarch Reliance\u2019s Immortal\u2019s Cave. That in turn would mean they lost any chance at the Sublime Spirit Scripture. Anyone, be they at Foundation Establishment or Core Formation, could use Qi Condensation Manual of the Sublime Spirit Scripture to form a second Core Lake within their bodies. They could also repair the Dao pillars they had formed during their Foundation Establishment. If successful, it could make a Cracked Foundation into a Flawless Foundation. To a Core Formation Cultivator, this would also have a big influence on their Core level, which was something they all yearned for.</p><br/><p>There were only three great books in the world which contained the secrets methods of how to Cultivate a new Core Lake, even beyond the Qi Condensation stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d said one of the six, a noble-looking old woman with a hoarse voice. When her words rang out, everyone grew silent. \u201cWe are here for the Sublime Spirit Scripture. There\u2019s no need to cause further complications. Child, we won\u2019t steal any of your treasures, nor will we Soulsearch you or turn you into a puppet. But you must assist us, otherwise you are well aware of what the consequences will be. Which is more important, your life? Or the Patriarch\u2019s? As for which decision is best, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need our advice on that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was silent for a moment, then suddenly said, \u201cGive me one million Spirit Stones! And, I demand the right to kill this person!\u201d His eyes flashed as he pointed at Liu Daoyun.</p><br/><p>Liu Daoyun\u2019s face grew somber and venom flickered within his eyes. He had just been contemplating various ways to kill Meng Hao. To be suddenly singled out by Meng Hao caused him to reflexively step backwards a few paces.</p><br/><p>His heart raced, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He knew that these Patriarchs would most likely give in to Meng Hao\u2019s every demand to get what they wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarchs\u2026\u201d said Liu Daoyun, his face pale as he looked up at the two Core Formation Patriarchs from the Cold Wind Sect.</p><br/><p>The red-faced old man gave a cold snort. He flicked his sleeve and looked at Meng Hao with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will not happen! Tiny Qi Condensation Cultivator, you have an exaggerated opinion of yourself. You dare to make demands of us?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao,\u201d said one of the Core Formation Eccentrics, an old man in a red robe. \u201cDon\u2019t bring up the matter of killing again. And as for the Spirit Stones, we have no way to meet your demand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I get no Spirit Stones, and if this man doesn\u2019t die, then I, Meng, will absolutely not agree to take you of the elder generation to the Patriarch\u2019s meditation zone. Without my heartfelt consent, you\u2019ll never get into his Immortal\u2019s Cave.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s voice was resolute, and his face emanated an expression that said he was ready to risk everything. He would die without even a frown if he had to.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao\u2026\u201d Liu Daoyun stared at him murderously, his eyes filling up with killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d said the dignified old woman in her husky voice. \u201cAs for this Cold Wind Sect disciple, your request is denied. Regarding the Spirit Stones, I will take the responsibility for that. I will give you one hundred thousand now, and the rest after we open the Immortal\u2019s Cave.\u201d If Meng Hao hadn\u2019t made any demands, it would have aroused suspicion. She flicked her sleeve, and a bag of holding flew toward Meng Hao. He didn\u2019t catch it, but instead moved backward and let the bag fall to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d said Meng Hao slowly. \u201cThe killing is off the table. Liu Daoyun, pick up that bag of holding and take the Spirit Stones out of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman\u2019s eyes flickered imperceptibly. The other Core Formation Eccentrics also gave him flickering looks.</p><br/><p>Liu Daoyun was furious to the extreme. However, Meng Hao\u2019s request was not overly excessive. Even the red-faced old man didn\u2019t say anything, but rather indicated for Liu Daoyun to comply.</p><br/><p>Liu Daoyun took a deep breath, pushed down his fury, then walked forward to pick up the bag of holding. He shook the bag, and a massive amount of Spirit Stones poured out onto the ground. They glittered brightly. Liu Daoyun looked at them for a moment, and started to breathe a bit faster.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked over the Spirit Stones, his expression calm. Then he collected them into his own bag of holding. He had no choice but to exercise caution. These people were not Foundation Establishment Cultivators, but rather of the Core Formation stage. If they wanted to kill him, it would be easier than stepping on a bug.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that they couldn\u2019t afford to gamble in this matter, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand up to them at all, regardless if it were regarding Cultivation base or scheming.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Meng Hao did not attempt to pull of some tricky, crafty plot. Instead, he plotted openly. He was betting that even if these people didn\u2019t believe him, they had no choice but to believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have your Spirit Stones. But this is a weighty matter. Please consume this medicinal pill.\u201d The old woman lifted her right hand, and a black-colored medicinal pill appeared.</p><br/><p>When it did, a wind instantly picked up, as if a massive amount of spiritual energy were being gathered up. Slowly, the image of a wicked centipede came to be visible on the surface of the medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression changed. He looked at the pill cautiously.</p><br/><p>When Liu Daoyun saw all of this happening, a hideous grin appeared on his face. The Foundation Establishment Cultivators floating in the air watched on, their faces expressionless, but their eyes sneering at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>As for the Core Formation Eccentrics, none of them batted an eye. If the old woman hadn\u2019t produced a pill, they probably would have. Their eyes glittered as they watched.</p><br/><p>In terms of scheming, Meng Hao was like a child compared to them. If his plots had truly displeased them, then any ideas he came up with would be useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you consume the pill, then you can lead the way. If you don\u2019t consume it, then we will have to try out our Soulsearch and Spirit Puppetry arts.\u201d The old woman spoke coolly, her expression containing neither happiness nor anger. She flicked her fingers, and the poison pill shot forward to hover in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao hesitated for a moment in thought. He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not the pill really was poisonous. Perhaps it was something else even more nefarious. But he didn\u2019t seem to have any other choice. He clenched his jaw, then reached out and grabbed the pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of poison pills, I have one as well,\u201d said the red-faced old man with a laugh. He flicked his wide sleeve, and a reddish pill appeared in his hand. It flew to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, our Sect happens to have one as well.\u201d It turned out the Core Formation Cultivators from the three great Sects all had poison pills. The pills transformed into beams of light as they flew toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The old woman\u2019s face was calm, and it was impossible to tell what she was thinking. She looked around coolly at her fellow Eccentrics, saying nothing. They were all circumspect and far-seeing. If Meng Hao swallowed one poison pill, he might as well swallow more. This way, he wouldn\u2019t just be under the control of the old woman. This was the most fair method.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing the Fellow Daoist\u2019s actions, I must humbly act to save my own face.\u201d Lord Revelation smiled and waved his right hand. A three-colored medicinal pill appeared and raced toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Compared to the other medicinal pills, this pill appeared extraordinary. Meng Hao wasn\u2019t sure why, but when his gaze fell onto this pill, his entire body felt jittery.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

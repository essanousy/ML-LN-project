Most of the rattan vines had dried and withered, and leaves floated down from the mountain into the river below. Perhaps they, like that gourd bottle from years ago, would eventually reach the Milky Way Sea and then float on to the Great Tang in the Eastern Lands.</p><br/><p>Beneath Mount Daqing lay three counties. Yunjie County was the most flourishing of the three. It wasn\u2019t very large, but it bustled with people. When market day came, people from the whole mountain region gathered there, and a hubbub of voices would fill the air.</p><br/><p>On this day, a young man wearing a clean, blue scholar\u2019s robe walked into Yunjie, seemingly restless with emotion. Though he was a stranger, his face looked familiar. It was, of course, Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>He walked down the familiar streets, passing houses and shops. As he strolled through the mortal world, he recalled many things from the past. This place contained his memories from childhood, the lonely bitterness of his youth, and his stubborn attachment to his studies. So many unforgettable events.</p><br/><p>Passing a large courtyard, he said, \u201cThat would be where Miss Sun lives\u2026.\u201d The walls which had seemed so tall in the past, now looked somewhat short. Past the walls were Miss Sun\u2019s bedchambers, a place that had been the subject of many fantasies in the past.</p><br/><p>He had often imagined that Steward Sun would take a liking to him, and then offer him Lady Sun\u2019s hand in marriage. She was rumored to be as beautiful as a goddess.</p><br/><p>Three years had passed, not a very long time, but to Meng Hao, it seemed as if an entire generation had come and gone.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head emotionally, he was about to move on, when suddenly the main doors of the Sun mansion opened and a sedan chair emerged. Meng Hao stopped. How often in the past had he looked into the courtyard, hoping to catch a glimpse into Lady Sun\u2019s bedchamber? His eyes flickered as he gazed at the sedan chair. The wind suddenly lifted the screen curtain of the sedan, and he saw an extremely fat girl inside, her face covered with dark spots. She was young. Meng Hao\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t recognized the serving girl next to her, he would never have believed that the young woman was actually Miss Sun.</p><br/><p>The sedan chair disappeared into the distance, and Meng Hao continued walking, feeling a bit regretful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just destroyed the image of my dream lover\u2026\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cWell, the sages were right: avert the gaze from inappropriateness. I shouldn\u2019t have looked, shouldn\u2019t have looked.\u201d A look of pity appeared on his face as he walked away.</p><br/><p>Around noon, Meng Hao found himself staring blankly at a large house off in the distance. It was worn-out and dilapidated and there were clearly people living inside. He could hear noise drifting out from inside. It sounded like the occupants were arguing.</p><br/><p>This was Meng Hao\u2019s ancestral residence. Years ago, he had been destitute, and was forced to sell it. Inside that house were many beautiful and happy memories from the past, as well as the bitter, yet empowering memories from the time after his parents went missing.</p><br/><p>Image after image appeared in Meng Hao\u2019s mind. He stood there until dusk began to fall.</p><br/><p>Silently, he approached the door, raised his hand, and knocked.</p><br/><p>The knock silenced the din of argument that had continued unceasingly throughout the afternoon. After a moment the door opened. A middle-aged man stood there, frowning. His face was covered with lines from a lifetime of hardships.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Li\u2026?\u201d said Meng Hao quietly, looking at the man in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d the middle-aged man stared in surprise. He looked closely at Meng Hao, and then a look of disbelief filled his eyes. \u201cMeng Hao? You\u2026 Where have you been? Come in!\u201d With a look of pleasant surprise, the man dragged Meng Hao into the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, come see who it is!\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged woman sat inside, tears in her eyes. When she heard her husband\u2019s words, and saw Meng Hao, she gaped for a moment, then rose to her feet, her eyes beaming with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is Meng Hao\u2026\u201d said the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, everyone said you just up and left that year. Let Auntie have a look at you.\u201d She stood in front of him, looking him up and down, her eyes filled with happiness. She seemed to have forgotten the afternoon spent arguing. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for years. You\u2019ve grown taller, but, ai, you\u2019re so skinny. You must have endured a lot over the years.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, have a seat. Auntie will cook a few dishes for you. You just got back, stay a while. You may have sold this place to your Uncle Li, but it\u2019s still your home.\u201d She gave a kind, happy smile to Meng Hao, then glared at the man and went into the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Soon, the table was filled with food. Looking at the couple in front of him, and the kindness in their eyes, it reminded him of the times after his parents had gone missing. Without the help of Uncle and Aunt Li, things would have been much more difficult for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe harvests haven\u2019t been good these years,\u201d said Aunt Li, serving some food to Meng Hao. \u201cWe gave our house to our son so that he could get married. Since this place was empty, we moved here.\u201d She gave him a kind look. \u201cWhere have you been all these years? We looked all over for you, but were never able to find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao listened to them talk and felt their kindness in his heart. He told them a somewhat vague story of traveling to a different part of the nation to study. After the meal was finished, he gave the couple a deep bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Li, Aunt Li, I would like to repurchase my ancestral home. After all, my mother and father left it for me. Here are some pieces of silver. You two can continue living here and help take care of the place.\u201d He pulled out some pieces of silver from within his robe and put them down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Uncle Li hesitated, looking at his wife. Aunt Li said nothing, but after a moment passed, nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said resolutely. \u201cThis house is yours, left to you by your father and mother. Your Uncle Li and I are getting old, so as you suggest, we will stay here. But we don\u2019t need the silver. We looked after you as you grew up. You\u2019re like our own child! How could we take your money?\u201d She put the silver pieces back into Meng Hao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t say anything, instead clasping his hands and bowing deeply to them once again.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t stay for the night. Instead, he gathered together some things from the house that contained memories, then made his farewells and slipped off into the darkness of the night. He didn\u2019t take the silver with him. He left it on the bed.</p><br/><p>Later, he sat cross-legged on a bed in an inn, looking out at the night sky. He sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m no longer part of the mortal world, and yet, it\u2019s hard to sever all the ties.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cWell, if they can\u2019t be severed, then I shall just let them remain.\u201d</p><br/><p>At dawn the next morning, Meng Hao found the Wang Family carpenter shop. There, he saw an aged Uncle Wang, his face full of wrinkles, sitting in the shop staring at nothing. In front of him was a wood carving that looked just like Wang Youcai. Uncle Wang\u2019s face seemed to be filled with an indelible sorrow.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao thought for a moment. He wasn\u2019t sure whether or not Wang Youcai was dead. After being promoted to the Inner Sect, he had sought out Little Tiger, then gone to inspect the area where Wang Youcai had fallen off the cliff. He hadn\u2019t been able to find any clues regarding what had happened.</p><br/><p>With a sigh, Meng Hao walked into the carpenter shop.</p><br/><p>Sensing that someone had arrived, Uncle Wang lifted his head. When he saw Meng Hao, he stared in surprise. Rubbing his eyes, he stood up, trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re\u2026 Meng Hao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Wang, it\u2019s me.\u201d Meng Hao reached out to support the old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Youcai?\u201d he asked. It seemed he hadn\u2019t forgotten the details about what happened that year. Looking at Meng Hao, he suddenly seemed excited. \u201cYou both went missing at the same time that year. Where is he\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoucai wasn\u2019t able to return, so he asked me to send a message for him,\u201d said Meng Hao with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back in a few years. You can rest at ease, sir. Youcai is living very well.\u201d He helped Uncle Wang into his chair, then sat with him for a while chatting. He told him that they had gone off to study, and Youcai was so talented that he wanted to continue studying for some time before returning.</p><br/><p>Tears of excitement rolled down Uncle Wang\u2019s face. He listened to Meng Hao\u2019s story, nodding, and it seemed as if some of the wrinkles on his face disappeared. Meng Hao continued to tell some interesting anecdotes, and the old man smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kid was always smart. He never wanted to study carpentry from me. He would spend all day thinking about other things. Good, good. If he can go out to study, it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Uncle Wang\u2019s smile widened. Around noon, Meng Hao left, escorted to the door personally by Uncle Wang.</p><br/><p>Little Tiger and Fatty weren\u2019t from Yunjie County, but rather the other two surrounding counties. Meng Hao wasn\u2019t very familiar with Little Tiger, but felt confident that he could take care of himself. On the other hand, he definitely had to go pay a visit to Fatty\u2019s family to let them know he was doing well.</p><br/><p>Fatty was most likely in the Southern Domain. Meng Hao sighed inwardly.</p><br/><p>That afternoon, he went looking for Steward Zhou, but couldn\u2019t find him. After asking around, he learned that Steward Zhou had moved his household away about half a year ago. People said he\u2019d moved to the capital city of the State of Zhao. Learning this, Meng Hao made no further inquiries, and left Yunjie County.</p><br/><p>There were many memories here, but Meng Hao knew that as soon as he had entered the Reliance Sect, his path lay in the direction of the State of Zhao, and the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>He left in silence, taking with him only a few items which he stored in his bag of holding: some pots and bowls, and some bed quilts. The pots and bowls had been given to him by his father as a gift, and the bed quilts had been quilted by his mother. To Meng Hao, these things were priceless.</p><br/><p>There were three counties below Mount Daqing. In addition to Yunjie County, there was Yunhai County and Yunkai County. Fatty\u2019s home was in Yunkai.</p><br/><p>It was smaller than Yunjie, and although it was not as bustling, it was surrounded by vast tracts of land and was therefore quite a wealthy place. This was especially true of the handful of great families, who controlled sizeable properties and wealth.</p><br/><p>Fatty\u2019s father was the famous Moneybags Li of Yunkai County. From what Fatty had told him in the past, his family employed several hundred workers, and you could spend an entire day walking through the family compound, which was filled with menservants and maidservants.</p><br/><p>He had said his chamberpot was made of silver, his quilts purchased from the capital city of the State of Zhao, and that from childhood, maidservants would heat his bed for him before he slept. That arrangement had continued as he grew up, and he said he couldn\u2019t even remember how many maidservants he\u2019d touched in his life. In any case, he had never lacked for want of anything, all the way down until the time his marriage had been arranged. His fianc\u00e9e was an extremely beautiful young woman from a family of famous scholars in Yunkai. His father had put a lot of thought, and money, into successfully arranging the matter.</p><br/><p>As he thought back to Fatty\u2019s expression when he talked about it, Meng Hao smiled. He walked into Yunkai County.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

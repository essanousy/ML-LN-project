Before the person could get off of the plateau, the huge man\u2019s flying sword hit him, piercing his neck. He fell twitching to the ground in a shower of blood, rattled out a last breath, then died. The huge man grabbed his victim\u2019s bag of holding, then turned and headed back into the Public Zone.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao watched the grisly scene unfold, then further observed what was happening on the plateau. The sounds of slaughter drifted along with the wind, which carried the scent of blood and gore into Meng Hao\u2019s nostrils.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can get rich overnight in this place, but it\u2019s also extremely dangerous. For cultivation, for Spirit Stones, people put their lives on the line. It\u2019s not really worth it.\u201d Meng Hao frowned. He was almost at the peak of the third level of Qi Condensation, but what was happening up there was just too chaotic. It would be too easy to be injured, and if he were robbed, it would have a long-lasting effect.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao thought about the lack of Spirit Stones in his bag. If he depended on receiving Spirit Stones distributed by the Sect, who knew how many years he would have to wait. Muttering to himself, he looked up at the Cultivators on the plateau. They fought fiercely, each and every one having suffered injuries. Suddenly, Meng Hao had a flash of inspiration, an idea.</p><br/><p>His idea grew more and more clear, and his eyes began to shine. He turned and hurried off, not to the Immortal\u2019s Cave in the Southern Mountain, but rather down to the Outer Sect. He skirted the main square, and eventually arrived at a building.</p><br/><p>The building appeared to be ancient, and was surrounding by the fragrant aroma of medicine. Inscribed above the doorway were characters which read: Pill Cultivation Workshop.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t his first time coming here. Actually, in his first month after being promoted to the Outer Sect, he had come here once to check out the various medicinal pills which were for sale. That was when he had learned about the Fasting Pills you could buy which would prevent hunger for several days.</p><br/><p>The only currency used here was Spirit Stones and Spirit Condensation Pills. Unfortunately, the exchange rate was very unfair. For example, one Spirit Condensation Pill could be traded for ten Fasting Pills. Because of this, few people came here, and it tended to be cold and deserted.</p><br/><p>When he arrived, Meng Hao didn\u2019t hesitate. It wasn\u2019t large inside, and sitting cross-legged right in the middle of the room was a sickly looking middle-aged man. Surrounding him on the interlocking wooden shelves were an assortment of gourd bottles, inscribed upon which were the names of various medicines.</p><br/><p>There were Blood Coagulation Pills which could treat external injuries, Skeletal Relaxation Pills to relieve fatigue, Spirit Refreshment Pills to temporarily increase energy and of course Fasting Pills and Appetite Control Pills. There were even Marrow Growth Pills which could treat broken and crushed bones.</p><br/><p>There were many types of medicines, but all of them were considerably costly. For most, the cost of three to ten pills was one Spirit Condensation Pill. To most disciples of the Inner Sect, a Spirit Condensation Pill was worth fighting over, so few were willing to come here and trade them away.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao strolled around the Pill Cultivation Workshop muttering to himself, his eyes glittering. Then, he pulled out five Spirit Condensation Pills and exchanged them for a handful of different types of medicines.</p><br/><p>It seemed the sickly man didn\u2019t see customers like Meng Hao very often. He brightened up immediately, handing over the bottle gourds of medicine.</p><br/><p>Placing all the bottles gourds into his bag of holding, Meng Hao left, carefully taking a circuitous route through the mountainous forest back to the Immortal\u2019s cave. By the time he arrived, night had fallen.</p><br/><p>He sat down cross-legged, looking at the four bottle gourds.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sages said, if you do not expend, you will not profit. I\u2019ve paid a lot this time, and I\u2019m going get a lot in return.\u201d Quietly comforting himself in this way, he stood and left the cave, returning shortly with a long tree branch about the thickness of his arm, along with a large pile of leaves.</p><br/><p>He pulled a green robe out from Zhao Wugang\u2019s bag of holding and tore the seams apart, then laid it out in front of him. It seemed the right size, so he pulled another robe out, tore the seams, and placed it with the first. He looked down, contented.</p><br/><p>Next, he crushed up the leaves to produce a thick sap. Then, he dipped his fingers into the makeshift ink and wrote several large characters onto the cloth in sweeping calligraphy.</p><br/><p>He looked at it, feeling quite satisfied, then closed his eyes and began doing breathing exercises.</p><br/><p>The night passed, and early the next morning, he picked up the tree branch and left the cave hurriedly.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long to reach the plateau, and despite the early hour, there were already a few disciples there locked in battle. The fierceness of the fighting was readily apparent. Ignoring the other Cultivators, Meng Hao passed the large stone tablets and walked onto the plateau. His eyes scanned the surroundings, until falling to rest on a boulder which stuck up out of the ground along the border.</p><br/><p>He walked over and sat down cross-legged on the boulder, looking every bit the peaceful and harmless scholar. Occasionally some of the others would look at him darkly, whereupon he would reveal some of his cultivation level. Frightened, they left him alone. He decided to wait until more people arrived.</p><br/><p>Time passed, and gradually, more and more fellow disciples arrived in the Public Zone. Soon, there were about twenty people. Some of them looked at the kind, scholarly Meng Hao, and started to walk toward him. All he had to do was reveal a bit of his cultivation level and they would retreat in shock.</p><br/><p>After a while, he figured there were enough people. He slapped his bag of holding, retrieving the cloth strip. He attached it to the tree branch, which he then stabbed into the clay soil next to the boulder. The mountain breeze lifted the cloth up, turning it into a streaming banner. It caught the attention of quite a few of the people nearby, particularly the characters written on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cPill Cultivation Workshop Outlet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark green characters seemed to flash, causing the facial expressions of the nearby Reliance Sect disciples to change. Some seemed astonished, others confused. Some sneered and others frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cPill Cultivation Workshop Outlet? What does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that guy is an apprentice alchemist sent by the Sect\u2019s Pill Cultivation Workshop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks familiar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Discussions broke out on the plateau after Meng Hao revealed the flag. But after a bit of time passed, the fighting and robbing resumed. Blood showered and screams rang out.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes shone as he looked about at the people in the Public Zone. Not far off from him were two Cultivators of the second level of Qi Condensation, locked in combat, their eyes red. One of them had a shoulder sliced open by his opponent\u2019s flying sword. Blood showered out, and he seemed to be in quite a difficult position.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, come here,\u201d called out Meng Hao. \u201cBrother, the sages said, it is unwise to risk one\u2019s life when injured. You seem to be bleeding quite profusely from your shoulder. It won\u2019t benefit you to let yourself be killed. I happen to have a Blood Coagulation pill here from the Pill Cultivation Workshop. It can heal all of the sword wounds on your body in less time than it takes to take three breaths.\u201d As Meng Hao made his sales pitch, the two fighting men ignored him and continued to fight. The injured Cultivator\u2019s eyes grew redder, and the wound on his shoulder grew worse. Then, blood poured from his chest as his opponent\u2019s flying sword hit him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, you got wounded again,\u201d admonished Meng Hao of his first potential customer. \u201cQuick, come buy a Blood Coagulation Pill! Otherwise, you might be defeated. All you have to do is give me one Spirit Stone, and I\u2019ll give you the Blood Coagulation Pill. It\u2019s definitely worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d roared the injured Cultivator, retreating a pace. \u201cThe Pill Cultivation Workshop is a rip-off, but they charge one Spirit Stone for five Blood Coagulation Pills. You\u2019re even worse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, it\u2019s not expensive. Your life is much more precious than a Spirit Stone. If you die, then all your Spirit Stones will belong to someone else. All you have to do is buy some of my medicine, and then you\u2019ll have the chance to win and snatch your opponent\u2019s bag of holding. All for the price of a single Spirit Stone. Is that expensive? You\u2019re not buying medicine, you\u2019re buying your own life.\u201d Meng Hao stood. Perhaps his words had affected the wounded Cultivator. He struggled backwards a few paces, hesitation showing on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d roared the man\u2019s opponent, pointing his flying sword. \u201cIf you mess things up for me, then after I kill this guy I\u2019ll come after you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy it!\u201d said the injured man, slapping his bag of holding and producing a Spirit Stone which he shot toward Meng Hao. Meng Hao snatched it out of the air and tossed back a Blood Coagulation Pill. The Cultivator grabbed it and placed it onto his shoulder wound. It stopped bleeding almost immediately.</p><br/><p>Refreshed, his spirit enlivened, he leaped back into the fight. Suddenly, his opponent retreated, blood flowing out from his wounded chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, Brother,\u201d said Meng Hao, switching customers. \u201cYour opponent bought one of my Blood Coagulation Pills and is now brimming with energy. I think if you don\u2019t buy one as well, you will be facing much peril. I don\u2019t just have Blood Coagulation Pills. I also have Skeletal Relaxation Pills to counter fatigue. I\u2019ll give you one each for two Spirit Stones. That will guarantee you healing and plenty of energy. You\u2019ll definitely be able to achieve victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d said the first man indignantly. He didn\u2019t know what to say. Was this Pill Cultivation Workshop Outlet Pill boy here to help him or hurt him? He had just gone from a miserable situation to one of hope. Then, this happened. He attacked more incisively in his indignation. The scene playing out in front of him was exactly the same as when he had bought his medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you win, then you\u2019re actually spending someone else\u2019s Spirit Stones on the medicine,\u201d said Meng Hao enticingly, holding the medicinal pills in his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s really worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d said the man who had already bought a pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, give it to me,\u201d said the Cultivator who had originally held the upper hand. Despite his hatred for Meng Hao, hearing the other man demand the medicine caused him to grit his teeth and open his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give three Spirit Stones!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, he\u2019s offering three. If you can\u2019t top that, I\u2019ll have to give the medicine to him. Take care!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give four!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, he\u2019s offering four. Four!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSix!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit. I give up. Die!\u201d The Cultivator who had originally held the upper hand turned on Meng Hao, furious. At first, the battle had been quite simple. But once Meng Hao got involved, everything got complicated. He flew toward Meng Hao, murderous intent filling his face, clearly aiming to exterminate him.</p><br/><p>As he neared, Meng Hao\u2019s visage, meek, scholarly and business-like, suddenly changed, growing somber and stern. Just before the Cultivator reached him, he took a step forward, his right palm slapping forward. Spiritual energy poured out with a bang.</p><br/><p>The Cultivator flew back with a shriek, overwhelmed by the spiritual energy of Meng Hao\u2019s third level of Qi Condensation. The attack had struck him unconscious.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao snatched his bag of holding, and then his somber, stern expression changed, and he was once again the weak scholar. All the onlookers were shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, I believe you just offered me six Spirit Stones,\u201d he said shyly, looking a bit embarrassed.</p><br/><p>The other Cultivator's face paled, and his body trembled. He stared at Meng Hao with astonishment and terror. How could he ever have imagined that things would turn out this way? How could this apparently weak and feeble person have changed so much? It was almost as if what he had just witnessed was a dream.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

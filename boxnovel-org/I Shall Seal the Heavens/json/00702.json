The hand snatched up Meng Hao and Xu Qing\u2019s soul, then shot up into the sky.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, they vanished\u2026.</p><br/><p>The only thing left behind was the wreckage of the Black Sieve Sect, and tens of thousand of ashen-faced disciples. True Patriarch Six-Dao\u2019s stood there, an unsightly expression on his face.</p><br/><p>He glared with clenched jaw at the redness in the sky as it faded away.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Demon Sect!\u201d His heart dripping with blood. He had been defeated, thoroughly and utterly defeated, leaving him with unmitigated terror that raced through his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Southern Domain\u2019s Top Expert!\u201d he thought. Previously, he had despised the thought, but after this day\u2019s battle, he had no choice but to admit that Patriarch Blood Demon absolutely was the Top Expert in the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think even Jian Chenzi from the Solitary Sword Sect is a match for Blood Demon.\u201d His face sank further. Finally, he flicked his sleeve, transforming into a black smoke that shot down into the ground.</p><br/><p>The Black Sieve Sect had not been completely destroyed. However, the majority of the Hundred Thousand Mountains had been crushed. Only about 20,000 remained. Whether it be in terms of the Black Yang or the Sieve Yin factions, the Sect had been severely damaged.</p><br/><p>Four Spirit Severing experts had died!</p><br/><p>Innumerable Nascent Soul and Core Formation cultivators had also lost their lives. Thanks to the Black Sieve Sect\u2019s Dao Reserve, they could still technically be considered a great sect. However, the sect was so badly mangled that it would be difficult to match their previous pinnacle even after ten thousand years passed.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the blood-colored shield covering the Southern Domain vanished. The blood-colored shields that had been erected over the Violet Fate Sect, Solitary Sword Sect, Golden Frost Sect, and the Li and Song Clans also disappeared.</p><br/><p>The sects and clans were no longer sealed. Their powerful experts immediately sent divine sense out into the Southern Domain to settle accounts with the Blood Demon Sect. However, when they saw the wreckage of the Black Sieve Sect, they gasped.</p><br/><p>Instantly, they concealed any desire they had to settle accounts.</p><br/><p>Gradually, word of the ancient title of \u2018Top Expert\u2019 once again began to spread throughout the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>A few hours after Meng Hao\u2019s departure, Pill Demon appeared in the air above the Black Sieve Sect. His face looked more ancient than ever as he looked down silently at the wreckage below.</p><br/><p>After a long moment passed, he sighed and began to murmur to himself. \u201cI\u2019m the Master, and I couldn\u2019t even save my apprentice. Do I even qualify\u2026 to be his Master\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe kowtowed three times, and called me Master\u2026.\u201d Finally, Pill Demon raised his head up, determination glowing in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been living an easy life for far too long now\u2026. I\u2019ve long since reached the point where I\u2019m not willing to search for the Dao of Immortality\u2026. Is it because I\u2019m afraid? Perhaps.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe time has come for Severing\u2026.\u201d Shaking his head, he left and returned to the Violet Fate Sect.</p><br/><p>Three days after returning, a great Dao descended. In that moment, the eyes of all the powerful experts in the Southern Domain turned toward the Violet Fate Sect.</p><br/><p>In truth, it was not a single great Dao which descended, but rather, a succession of three!</p><br/><p>In the Solitary Sword Sect was an old man wearing a white robe, in front of whom floated a sword of moonbeams. \u201cViolet East\u2026 is finally performing his Severing!\u201d he said softly.</p><br/><p>In the Golden Frost Sect, deep in a restricted area, within a field of blackness, a mysterious glow suddenly appeared that looked like eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s been simmering for all these years, did he finally reach a conclusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li and Song Clan experts, as well as many others, all gazed toward the Violet Fate Sect to bear witness to the goings on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn his previous life, Reverend Violet East refused to become a false Immortal of the Ji Clan. He longed to be a true Immortal. Unfortunately, he passed away in meditation before his Immortal Tribulation arrived. He transmigrated his next life from the cycle of reincarnation into a medical pill, and when the spirit of that pill awakened, it became Grandmaster Pill Demon\u2026.\u201d [1. I pointed this out a long time ago, but would like to reiterate that the characters in Pill Demon\u2019s name literally mean \u201cPill Ghost.\u201d I came up with the translation very early on in ISSTH, before I started reading ahead in the story. By the time I learned of his full story, the name had already stuck, and I didn\u2019t want to change it. So just to be clear, the name does not contain the same character that is usually translated as \"Demon\" in the story.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThree great Daos, and three Severings in a row. Based on the knowledge he has from from his last life, it seems he\u2019s going from Spirit Severing\u2026 directly into Dao Seeking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering the latent talent of Reverend Violet East, and the nature of this Severing, it won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s at the peak of Dao Seeking. The only question is\u2026 will he be able to reach true Immortal Ascension this time?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue Immortal\u2026 true Immortal\u2026. Either reach Immortal Ascension, or experience the soul scattering in death. After that there is no reincarnation, only a complete blotting out of one\u2019s existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>In addition, there was one other powerful expert who appeared, someone who sat in a blood-colored mountain, wearing a blood-colored robe. \u201cThe path to true Immortality that opens every 10,000 years, has once again opened. The opportunity to become a true Immortal has once again appeared. I wonder\u2026 how many will experience the downfall of their Dao, dispersing their bodies and souls? Meng Hao, destiny links both you and me to the League of Demon Sealers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it was for selfish reasons that I forced you to join the Blood Demon Sect, I have absolutely no ill intentions toward you whatsoever. I\u2019m just not too pleased with the inflexible, pedantic eight generations of your league!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe League of Demon Sealers. Wardens of the great Nine Mountains and Seas. Is your heart\u2026 with the Nine Mountains and Seas, or outside!?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is outside, then you are not worthy of the Mountain and Sea Realm. If your heart is here, then why haven\u2019t you sealed the Heavens, Demon Sealer!?</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting in ancient times, the League of Demon Sealers has always been heartless. Could it be that the Ninth Generation\u2026 is the same\u2026? I refuse to believe it!</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t harm you, and in fact, I will give you great good fortune. I will help you to grow up, and I will be your Dao Protector. When you wish to leave this place, I won\u2019t stop you. I just hope that your experiences and time here in the blood Demon Sect will make you pause for thought when it comes time to make those critical decisions in the future.\u201d The man sighed as he muttered to himself, and it echoed throughout the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>The name of the mountain the man stood on was Mount Blood Demon.</p><br/><p>The Blood Demon Sect was one of the five great sects of the Southern Domain. In the past, it was a place of incredible mystery that struck fear into the hearts of anyone who heard its name. In fact, few people knew exactly where it was. They only knew that Blood Demon Sect disciples were all decisive killers.</p><br/><p>For example\u2026 Li Shiqi!</p><br/><p>Another well-known figure among the rising stars of the sect was Wang Youcai, who was surrounded by the glow of blood wherever he went.</p><br/><p>Actually, the Blood Demon Sect was not a very large place. It consisted of only five mountains.</p><br/><p>The centermost mountain was Mount Blood Demon, which was surrounded by four other mountains that had no true names, but rather, were called by the names of whoever occupied them.</p><br/><p>Currently, Meng Hao sat cross-legged on Mount Blood Demon. Behind him was a cave mouth that emanated a glow of blood, and pulsed with a cold, imposing aura.</p><br/><p>In front of him was Xu Qing\u2019s soul, surrounded by a glowing sphere of red light.</p><br/><p>He looked at her, and she at him.</p><br/><p>They were as separated as Yin and Yang, but their gazes seemed capable of lasting an eternity.</p><br/><p>Also standing there on Mount Blood Demon was a figure surrounded by an aura of blood. It was impossible to see his face, but he was currently staring off into the sky. \u201cHave you thought it through?\u201d he said slowly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t reply. He had been in the Blood Demon Sect for several days now. When he first arrived, the blood-colored figure had spoken a few words to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you wish to accompany your beloved for your whole life, or for a single lifetime? A whole life includes a single lifetime, but a single lifetime does not include whole life. A single lifetime is a simple matter, and I can help you with that. As for a whole life\u2026 I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the choice which had been set before him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t respond. He only looked at Xu Qing. She didn\u2019t say anything either. She only looked back at him.</p><br/><p>That lasted all the way to the moment in which the blood-colored figure spoke again. Finally, Meng Hao responded, his voice soft. \u201cXu Qing and I have an agreement. She lives, I live. She dies, I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood-colored figure was silent for a long moment before his ancient voice once again echoed out in Mount Blood Demon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you choose a single lifetime, then I will fuse her soul into her fleshly body. By nourishing it with a miraculous object of Heaven and Earth, she can be completely recovered in a hundred years.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, her soul has been damaged, and her body weakened. The fusion is difficult and if it fails, she won't last even a hundred years. Even if it does succeed, she will be incapable of Spirit Severing. You will be able to spend a thousand years with each other, until her longevity reaches an end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you choose a whole life, then\u2026 she must enter the cycle of reincarnation. Her soul will travel to the underworld of the Fourth Mountain, and she will be born anew. As to which Mountain she is born in, it is impossible to say. Before reaching Immortal Ascension, she will remember nothing from her previous life. However, in the moment she does reach Immortal Ascension, she will remember everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, she will be able to accompany you for your whole life.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a choice to make. Take her to the underworld to be reincarnated. Or, live with her here for a thousand years.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you take her to the underworld, then I can make you a promise. I\u2019m on good terms with K\u1e63itigarbha, the Earth Store Bodhisattva. Your beloved will be able to avoid any suffering in the underworld, and upon reincarnation, she will be accompanied by incredible good luck. Afterward, there will be a high likelihood that she can achieve true Immortal Ascension.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a month to decide. I\u2019ll be waiting for you in the Blood Pond.\u201d Gradually, the blood-colored figure transformed into a glow of blood that faded away into the surroundings.</p><br/><p>The sun rose and set. Meng Hao looked at Xu Qing, and she gazed tenderly back.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t speak, they just looked into each other\u2019s eyes. Day, after day, after day\u2026.</p><br/><p>Half a month went by, although it seemed like an eternity. Finally, she smiled. \u201cSend me into the cycle of reincarnation. I don\u2019t want a thousand wonderful years. I want to spend my whole life with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>She looked at him for a moment. \u201cWe agreed, didn\u2019t we? I want to grow old with you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao shook his head. He was about to open his mouth to speak when Xu Qing smiled and interrupted him. \u201cYou\u2019re scared that you won\u2019t be able to find me, aren\u2019t you?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Blood Demon said that if we pick reincarnation, then it\u2019s impossible to tell which Mountain I will end up on\u2026. However, let\u2019s make an agreement. You come looking for me, and I\u2019ll wait for you\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to fear, Junior Brother. Our agreement in this lifetime, is an agreement for a whole life\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my next lifetime, I\u2019ll definitely dream of you treading through the Heavens to come find me. You\u2019ll hold out your hand to take mine, and then we will live the rest of our lives together.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to talk any more about what decision to make. We can live together for ninety-nine years. In the final year\u2026 I\u2019ll enter the cycle of reincarnation.\u201d Xu Qing looked at Meng Hao earnestly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at her and then nodded, pain stabbing through his heart.</p><br/><p>She smiled, a beautiful smile. He reached up toward the glowing red pearl that contained her soul, and it floated down onto his palm. He closed his eyes and clutched it as if he was embracing her.</p><br/><p>He would never forget how her beauty had turned into old age.</p><br/><p>He would never forget how some of his life force contained hers.</p><br/><p>Finally, he opened his eyes and stood up. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which Mountain you are reincarnated to, I will find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he carefully took Xu Qing\u2019s soul into the mouth of the cave behind him, which glowed brightly like blood.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao walked into the shallow cave, quickly reaching its end. Up ahead was a blood-colored pond, within which was a withered corpse. It emanated invisible ripples that made it look incredibly ferocious, and growing out of its forehead was a blood-colored horn.</p><br/><p>He wore a tattered blood-colored robe, and the skin visible through the tears was dark-red flesh covered with blue veins. The entire image was quite terrifying. His lips were shriveled, his eyes sunken in, his entire body dried up. Visible within his mouth, were razor-sharp fangs.</p><br/><p>His body was the shape of a human, but this was clearly no cultivator.</p><br/><p>This was a Demon! Patriarch Blood Demon! [2. In contrast, Blood Demon's name does use the character I usually translate as \"Demon.\" And yes, the characters are exactly the same as the Blood Demon from the Demon Immortal Sect]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After hearing that Meng Hao was also from the Vast Expanse School, their interest waned. Sometimes plotting, scheming and even open fighting went on between the various factions of the Vast Expanse School. However, most people weren\u2019t willing to bring those conflicts with them into a trial by fire. One could very well end up hurting oneself in so doing.</p><br/><p>The four Dao Lords ignored Meng Hao, and he ignored them. He continued walking until he was at the same point along the line as them. There he stopped, and looked at the area up ahead.</p><br/><p>Obviously, these four men were sitting in this spot for a reason, and Meng Hao was well aware of exactly why.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, not even Dao Lords dare to step past this point?\u201d he thought. Moments ago, the Dao Lords had mentioned a third tribulation. Obviously, the different areas he had entered every three years were the tribulations these people were referring to.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first tribulation was tenfold, the second tribulation was twentyfold, and the third tribulation was fiftyfold. Could it be that this fourth tribulation is a hundredfold?\u201d Even as Meng Hao stood there pondering the situation, the Dao Lord who had asked him about his identity earlier opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fourth tribulation increases the pressure by a hundredfold,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to be careful, kid. I don't know how you got here, but... if you step in there without having a 4-Essences cultivation base, you\u2019ll almost certainly be killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao turned and clasped hands in thanks to to the Dao Lord. Then he turned back, took a deep breath, and to the shock of the four Dao Lords, took a step forward!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking to die?!\u201d That was what all four of the shocked Dao Lords were thinking as Meng Hao started to walk. Rumbling sounds simultaneously echoed out.</p><br/><p>Almost instantly, his legs were shredded to pieces. Half of his body was destroyed! His arms burst into a mist of blood, and in the blink of an eye, the rest of his body was shredded to pieces by the hundredfold pressure!</p><br/><p>Only his head remained within the blood mist, as well as... 108 Soul Lamps. Three of those lamps were lit, and the rest were extinguished.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao only had his head left, but he roared nonetheless, and blue veins popped out on his skin. Then, his Soul Lamps began to vibrate, and then one of the remaining three suddenly went dark!</p><br/><p>After the lamp was extinguished, the blood mist which had exploded out began to form back together into a body. Although it was covered with wounds, Meng Hao managed to take a breath, then cough up a mouthful of blood as he fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>The hundredfold pressure continued to crush down onto him as he struggled up into a cross-legged position. Then he closed his eyes, rotating his cultivation base and circulating the life force which had come from extinguishing the Soul Lamp as he fought back against the pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d The four Dao Lords on the other side all stood up, faces covered with expressions of disbelief. All of them were panting, and their eyes were as wide as saucers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe's... he\u2019s actually holding up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly 4-Essences cultivators can enter the fourth tribulation. Not even we can step in there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember three years ago when Dao Lord Flamefire from the Seventh Sect walked in, and was killed instantly....\u201d Their minds were reeling as they stared at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>A moment later, one of them suddenly whispered, \u201cJust now, was I just seeing things, or did he have 108 Soul Lamps?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three gasped. Moments ago, they had been so preoccupied with the fact that Meng Hao actually took a step forward that they hadn\u2019t paid much attention to his Soul Lamps. Now that they thought back, they couldn\u2019t help but exchange astonished glances.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did someone inhuman like this appear in the sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI noticed that he only had two lit Soul Lamps. If... if he actually extinguishes those final two, then how powerful will he be?\u201d With each moment that went by, the men were more and more shaken.</p><br/><p>A few days later, the group of four looked on with mixed emotions as Meng Hao opened his eyes. He took a deep breath, and then oh-so-slowly rose to his feet. It was difficult to do, but after he finished the movement, he gritted his teeth and began to walk forward, completely ignoring the four Dao Lords.</p><br/><p>As he proceeded along, he got farther and farther away, until he disappeared from view. The Dao Lords could do nothing but sit there in silence, completely shaken by the fact that Meng Hao was walking through the tribulation that they themselves could not even enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly two Soul Lamps left,\u201d Meng Hao thought. \u201cThe final two....\u201d His vision was swimming, and his breath came in ragged pants as he proceeded along with great difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter those two Soul Lamps, I can step into the Dao Realm!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that moment, I will be able to form my Essence, and use its power to begin completing the Ninth Hex!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is when I will see if my speculations are correct!\u201d After forming the outline of the first sealing mark of the Ninth Hex all those years ago on the Vast Expanse Shrine, he had begun to speculate about a certain matter.</p><br/><p>He had the feeling that this clone of his would actually only be able to complete one sealing mark in his single lifetime. Most likely, he wouldn't be able to complete even two, let alone nine.</p><br/><p>The Seal the Heavens Hex was simply far too powerful and majestic. It was a Hexing magic that, realistically speaking, shouldn\u2019t even be able to exist in the starry sky of the Vast Expanse.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath as he trudged forward. Another three years passed in the blink of an eye. However, he still hadn\u2019t reached the fifth tribulation, the reason being that he was moving much more slowly than before, and also had to rest frequently.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until five years later that Meng Hao reached the point where he could start jogging. Only then did he eventually catch sight of the border of the fifth tribulation.</p><br/><p>There, he saw cultivators.</p><br/><p>There were two of them, seated cross-legged at almost the same position along the path. Astonishingly, both were 4-Essences cultivators, and one of them, a middle-aged man in a black robe, was at the peak of 4-Essences, just around the corner from 5-Essences.</p><br/><p>The two men took note of Meng Hao\u2019s arrival, and one of them even looked at him with a hostile glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s finally here,\u201d said the middle-aged man. \u201cAncient Realm.... Wow, an Ancient Realm cultivator who can pass through the fourth tribulation. Perfect for our plan....\u201d Obviously, any Ancient Realm cultivator who could make it here would obviously be a very important person in the sect, and most likely a future Paragon.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he hesitated for a moment.</p><br/><p>In that moment of hesitation, Meng Hao had already jogged up and was approaching the border itself.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man and the other 4-Essences Dao Realm experts exchanged a glance, and when they saw the decisiveness in each other\u2019s eyes, they gritted their teeth and cast all doubts aside.</p><br/><p>They looked over coldly at Meng Hao, who was now only about one step away from entering the fifth tribulation.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man with the hostile expression didn\u2019t seem very anxious, nor did he seem to notice that Meng Hao apparently had the courage to immediately step into the next region. Only people with incredible power would be able to forego resting and measuring up the next area.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, why don\u2019t we make a deal....\u201d the middle-aged man said, his voice cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said the other Dao Realm expert. \u201cThe two of us don't wish you any harm. In fact, we want to offer you something incredibly helpful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither of them were paying much attention to where Meng Hao was standing. Both of them were of the opinion that virtually no one would ever do anything except rest here before taking another step.</p><br/><p>However, even as the words left their mouths, Meng Hao completely ignored them, and stepped forward, his eyes glittering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to kill yourself?!?!\u201d The two Dao Realm experts were completely shocked, and rose to their feet anxiously. As for Meng Hao, a violent tremor ran through him.</p><br/><p>The pressure that was crushing down on him had rocketed directly to... one hundred and fifty times the original pressure!</p><br/><p>His body instantly collapsed, and not even his head remained intact. He transformed into a mist of blood, provoking grim expressions from the two Dao Realm experts. They had been waiting a long time for someone to come along and fall into their scheme; how could they ever have guessed that the person to show up would be a complete idiot?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a moron that kid is! He deserved to die a worse death than he did for stepping in there like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares if he dies or not? He\u2019s screwed things up for us now. Dammit!\u201d However, their curses were suddenly cut short, and their jaws dropped in shock.</p><br/><p>The blood mist that was Meng Hao was acting differently than similar situations they had seen in the past. Instead of dispersing, it began to form back together. It only took a moment for it to once again turn into the vague shape of a person.</p><br/><p>When they looked closer, they were shocked to find that... 108 Soul Lamps could be seen within that figure. Two of those Soul Lamps were lit, with the rest being extinguished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis....\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at this point that one of those two Soul Lamps suddenly winked out. As a result, the life force remaining in the blood mist caused it to begin to form together, even as the intense pressure weighed down!</p><br/><p>Apparently, some incredible power was forcing the blood mist back into the shape of a body!</p><br/><p>However, the intense pressure seemed to be interfering, as if the power of one extinguished Soul Lamp wasn\u2019t enough to complete the task. But then... the final Soul Lamp flickered, and then, to the disbelief of the two Dao Realm experts, suddenly...</p><br/><p>Turned dark!</p><br/><p>In that moment, everything went completely silent. Then, a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering blast of energy shot out from the blood mist, sending the two Dao Realm experts staggering backward in shock!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He stood on the treasured fan he had just acquired, using as much spiritual power as he could muster to flee at top speed. He feared that if he was even the least bit slow, he would be attacked and robbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst I offended Eccentric Song,\u201d sighed Meng Hao, \u201cand then the Violet Fate Sect\u2026 But it\u2019s not my fault, they forced me to trade.\u201d In his mind, he was innocent. At the time, he had no choice but to trade the spear\u2026. Sighing repeatedly, he pushed himself to go faster, getting closer and closer to the State Shield Mountain range.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to find a place to hide for a while. If someone catches up with me, I\u2019ll be in great danger\u2026\u201d Meng Hao frowned. The power of the treasured fan faded, and he dropped to the ground, tucking the fan away and starting to run.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will I be able to reach Foundation Establishment? Then I\u2019ll be able to really fly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two days passed, during which time Meng Hao didn\u2019t rest at all. He just kept running, thinking about how he hadn\u2019t rested at all since Shangguan Xiu began to chase him on Mount Daqing. But he had no choice. The thought of what would happen if he didn\u2019t was too ghastly to contemplate.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, deep in the State Shield Mountain chain, atop the plateau next to the treasure mountain, Wu Dingqiu held up a Go piece, smiling broadly. After thinking for no less than one hour, he slowly put the piece onto the board.</p><br/><p>Eccentric Song\u2019s face was like iron. With a cold snort, he slammed a piece down onto the board.</p><br/><p>\u201cEccentric Song, your Cultivation base is so refined. You shouldn\u2019t allow yourself to be in such a mood.\u201d Wu Dingqiu stroked his beard and laughed. He looked as calm as a cool wind. \u201cCultivators of our generation should be able to settle our Qi and calm our minds. Even with mountains crumbling around us, our expressions shouldn\u2019t change. But look at you! Are you really so ill-at-ease because of some nobody from the junior generation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf our positions were switched, you would be the same,\u201d said Eccentric Song sourly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! If I, Wu, were in this position, I would only offer praise, and would certainly not feel anger. In the Violet Fate Sect, we cultivate our disposition, and would not allow something like this to arouse our anger. No offense, Eccentric Song, but as far as this type of cultivation goes, you really have something to learn from the Violet Fate Sect.\u201d Wu Dingqiu laughed, obviously quite pleased with himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this,\u201d he continued. \u201cAfter we finish this game of Go, you can come with me to the Violet Fate Sect. I will allow you to peruse our Moral Cultivation Manual, and then you will understand what it means to settle the Qi and calm the mind.\u201d Wu Dingqiu\u2019s smile was so wide that wrinkles appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Eccentric Song harrumphed, refusing to respond and simply looking off into the distance. Wu Dingqiu\u2019s smile grew stronger, and he too looked off into the distance. Shortly, two figures could be seen racing toward them through the forest. It was Qian Shuihen and Lu Song. They gripped an iron spear between the two of them as they made a beeline for the plateau. They were followed by a small group of other Violet Fate Sect disciples.</p><br/><p>Qian Shuihen and Lu Song stepped foot onto the plateau and both began to speak at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Elder Wu. Disciple has accomplished the task. I have acquired the treasured item through trade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Elder Wu, fortunately, I have not failed in my mission. I was able to trade for the spear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eccentric Song\u2019s face was grim as Wu Dingqiu\u2019s laughter rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent. Good job, you two.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI will take it upon myself to promote both of you to the Inner Sect. You didn\u2019t cause any problems for that kid, did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am pleased to report that we made a fair trade,\u201d said Qian Shuihen hastily. Next to him, Lu Song nodded fervently, looking excited. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cause any problems for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEccentric Song, come, let\u2019s take a look at this treasured, divine spear.\u201d Wu Dingqiu laughed. He flicked his sleeve, and the iron spear flew toward him.</p><br/><p>The instant it touched his hand, Wu Dingqiu\u2019s expression changed. His eyes flashed as he examined the spear closer. Grim-faced Eccentric Song also took a close look, whereupon, his eyes began to shine. He stared open mouthed, then suddenly smiled.</p><br/><p>Wu Dingqiu\u2019s expression grew more and more unsightly. No matter from which aspect he looked at the spear, it was ordinary in nature. Refusing to believe that it was true, he pointed the spear at a random Demonic beast further down the mountain. The creature didn\u2019t even notice.</p><br/><p>The expression on his face was unsightly to the extreme. He slowly raised his head, looking coldly at Qian Shuihen and Lu Song.</p><br/><p>When they saw the look in Wu Dingqiu\u2019s eyes, their excitement faded, and they began to tremble. Blank expressions filled their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you trade for this spear?\u201d asked Wu Dingqiu, one word at a time.</p><br/><p>Looking nervous, Qian Shuihen said, \u201cDisciple gave two thousand Spirit Stones, seven Earthly Spirit Pills, one of the Sect\u2019s Hellfighting Spikes, and\u2026 and a Plateau Charging Pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Dingqiu\u2019s face grew dark.</p><br/><p>Next, Lu Song spoke: \u201cDisciple gave one thousand, five hundred Spirit Stones, three Heavenly Spirit Pills, a treasured fan, and a magical pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eccentric Song burst out laughing. It was the laughter of release, as if all of his pent up depression from the past few days had suddenly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Wu Dingqiu was mad enough, but when he heard the price the two disciples had paid, along with Eccentric Song\u2019s peals of laughter, his rage exploded. He suddenly let out a furious roar. \u201cGood-for-nothing fools! This iron spear is a fake!\u201d</p><br/><p>It echoed out like thunder, shattering the Go board. Cracks appeared on the surface of the mountain beneath his feet. Qian Shuihen and Lu Song tumbled to the ground, blood spraying out of their mouths.Their heads spun as Wu Dingqiu\u2019s single word echoed in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cFake\u2026\u201d They were stunned.</p><br/><p>This word thundered out in all directions along with his roar, filling nearly half of the entire State Shield Mountain range and reaching even Eastern Refinement City.</p><br/><p>It eventually reached the ears of Sun Hua, filling him with confusion. After a moment, his expression changed, and a look of shock filled his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe spear was a fake?\u201d He looked at his companions, and looks of realization appeared on their faces as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that the iron spear that was a fake, could it\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, Qiao Ling was in the midst of introducing a magical item to a Cultivator when she heard the noise outside. Amazed, she thought back to Meng Hao\u2019s iron spear, and a strange look appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>Next to the pill furnace, the middle-aged man opened his eyes, and they flickered with a mocking expression. Without a word, he closed them again.</p><br/><p>Far away from the plateau in the State Shield Mountains, Meng Hao lowered his head and ran even faster.</p><br/><p>Eccentric Song\u2019s splitting laughter undulated throughout the mountains. Wu Dingqiu\u2019s face couldn\u2019t look more horrible. He, an Elder of the Violet Fate Sect, had been hoodwinked by a Cultivator of the Qi Condensation stage. Even though it didn\u2019t directly involve him, he would definitely lose face when word spread.</p><br/><p>He wanted to track Meng Hao down immediately. He turned to look at Qian Shuihen and Lu Song, who stood there terrified. He was disgusted, but in his heart he sighed. These disciples had spent all their days within the Sect, and didn\u2019t have any experience dealing with outsiders. They were flowers raised indoors, inexperienced and incapable of dealing with schemes.</p><br/><p>With a cold harrumph, he tossed the iron spear to the ground and took a few steps forward, casting his senses about in search of Meng Hao. But then, Eccentric Song stepped forward to block his way, laughing complacently.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist Wu, please don\u2019t lose your temper,\u201d he said. \u201cYour Violet Fate Sect stresses the need to settle the Qi and calm the mind, to cultivating one\u2019s disposition. Don\u2019t allow a small matter like this to arouse your ire. When it comes to this type of cultivation, you should really do a bit more research into your Sect\u2019s Moral Cultivation Manual.\u201d Eccentric Song laughed heartily. Earlier, he had been prevented from leaving no matter what he said, so of course now he would do the same thing to Wu Dingqiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wu Dingqiu\u2019s face grew dark, and he stared fixedly at Eccentric Song. But he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou broke the Go board, so now we can\u2019t finish,\u201d said Eccentric Song with a smile. \u201cHow about this: You were going to take me to your Violet Fate Sect, right? Well, let\u2019s go! We can chat and play Go for a few months.\u201d The depression had faded completely from his heart. Seeing Wu Dingqiu like this made him incredibly happy. As far as the treasures Meng Hao had taken, he didn\u2019t care anymore. What was most important to him was the look of outrage and insult on Wu Dingqiu\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>He pulled at Wu Dingqiu, clearly having no intention of allowing him to resist.</p><br/><p>Wu Dingqiu\u2019s heart was filled with gloom. He glared at Eccentric Song, then let out a long sigh. He knew that the man wouldn\u2019t let him pursue Meng Hao. He stamped his foot angrily, then allowed Eccentric Song to pull him up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou useless imbeciles won\u2019t be able to keep up,\u201d said Wu Dingqiu, looking down at trembling Qian Shuihen and Lu Song. \u201cThe Inner Sect promotion is a failure. Return to the Sect and immediately go into secluded meditation!\u201d The other disciples watched on, pale-faced.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you, Meng Hao,\u201d said Lu Song, lowering his head, his face twisted with rage. \u201cI will never forget this, you shameless bastard!\u201d He ground his teeth when he recalled Meng Hao\u2019s bashful expression, and it looked as if his eyes might erupt with flames. He had never met anyone so impudent in his entire life. The spear was obviously a fake. His face filled with pain when he thought of how much he had paid for it. When he thought about the lost chance to enter the Inner Sect, he was so angry that he almost spat up blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless! Despicable!\u201d said Qian Shuihen, thinking about his precious items. He picked up the iron spear. \u201cMeng Hao, you are a complete scoundrel!\u201d As he thought about the failure of the Inner Sect promotion, he really seemed about to go crazy. And then he thought about all the medicinal pills and magical items, and his hatred for Meng Hao ascended to skies.</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other, sharing a look of pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will place this spear up inside the Sect to remind us that we must kill Meng Hao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fierce killing intent filled their eyes, and yet, the trial by fire was over, and they were required to return to the Sect. Their rancor and murderous thoughts could only be concealed in their hearts, never to be erased.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Meng Hao was both scared witless and also felt that he was being accused wrongly. Sighing, he increased his speed, running as fast as he could for seven days straight. Eventually he found an Immortal\u2019s cave in the deep mountains. Exhausted, he sat down cross-legged and began to meditate and do breathing exercises.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it worth it\u2026?\u201d he sighed to himself. He was tired from the days of running, but had simply been too frightened of being caught. Now, he was on his last legs.</p><br/><p>Two days later at dawn, he opened his eyes and began running again. For half a month, he didn\u2019t dare to let anyone see him. Finally, deep in the remote mountains, when he felt it was safe, he used a flying sword to carve out a cave, then sealed himself inside to meditate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

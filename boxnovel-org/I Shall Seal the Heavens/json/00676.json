He slowly rose up from his cross-legged position.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave that place, my child\u2026. Come to me\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you for over two hundred years\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. Come\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour blood is most suited to reach maturity, and your soul\u2026 needs to slumber\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome\u2026. I\u2019m waiting here for you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression grew more blank, and he began to walk away from the seaweed. When he was about thirty meters away, the Immortal Shows the Way inside of him suddenly began exude a faint stream of Qi that bored into his Nascent Soul. Immediately, his Nascent Soul grew faint, and then suddenly, deep inside, a Flying Rain-Dragon became visible!</p><br/><p>It was very small, and seemed to be sleeping. However, the stream of Immortal Qi found it and bored directly into the Flying Rain-Dragon.</p><br/><p>In that instant, the Flying Rain-Dragon opened its eyes and roared.</p><br/><p>As the roar sounded out, an enormous Flying Rain-Dragon fully 30,000 meters long appeared around Meng Hao. Shocking ripples emanated off of it as it roared.</p><br/><p>ROOOAAARRRRR!!</p><br/><p>The Dawn Immortal\u2019s aura vanished, and a tremor ran through Meng Hao. His eyes suddenly became clear, and looked up at the astonishing Flying Rain-Dragon.</p><br/><p>The Flying Rain-Dragon turned its head to look at him, and in that instant, Meng Hao felt as if he were looking at himself.</p><br/><p>Then, the Flying Rain-Dragon vanished. Meng Hao\u2019s face was pale white as he thought back to what had just happened. Then he cast his vision inside of himself, to find that the Resurrection Lily had sent countless tendrils throughout the entirety of his body.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flashed with killing intent, and he returned to his original spot next to the seaweed. The Resurrection Lily trembled and shrank back, and by the time Meng Hao sat down cross-legged, it had completely hidden itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight here, right now, I\u2019m going to borrow the power of Reverend Silverlamp to thoroughly sever away the Resurrection Lily!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe method I will use to do so\u2026 is the power of Spirit Severing! My path of Spirit Severing\u2026 my First Severing, will be of the Resurrection Lily!!</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish to be the master of my own life. I will not allow any outsider to control me. What I want is freedom. My path in life is a journey, and my Dao is a direction! I will continue on in that direction and pursue truth. I will exercise control over my own freedom, and live with independence!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is my will of Spirit Severing! I will crush all obstacles, and destroy anything that blocks my way. Whatever stumbling blocks I encounter will be trampled underfoot!</p><br/><p>\u201cFearful of nothing! Freedom! Independence!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavens will not obscure my gaze, and the Earth will not shackle my feet!</p><br/><p>\u201cFor freedom, I can pay any price!</p><br/><p>\u201cFor independence, I will sever anything!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Resurrection Lily is like a mountain obstructing my way on the path of life! When I pass it, then my path will stretch out into the distance!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Resurrection Lily is a fetter, a cage restricting my freedom. I will sever it\u2026 and in the instant of that severing, I will have my independence, and can practice cultivation in freedom!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my First Severing!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my Spirit Severing Domain!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my Dao of Spirit Severing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glowed with enlightenment. He had remained submerged in the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage for too many years. He had undergone the baptism of the Demon Immortal Sect and had been doggedly pursued by the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. All of that left him feeling as if he had been reborn, purified by fire. Finally, in this moment, he reached complete understanding.</p><br/><p>In the moment that he was enlightened, Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base began to rumble. The two Cultivation base portions within him that were struggling to combine, suddenly began to fuse together at high speed.</p><br/><p>It seemed that his thinking just now had governed the rotation of his Cultivation base. In that instant of realization\u2026.</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s entire body began to tremble, and the two portions of Cultivation base instantly merged together. His Nascent Soul vanished, and at the same time, Meng Hao\u2019s body began to shine with brilliant, multicolored light.</p><br/><p>The light circulated around the area, swirling about to slowly form together in front of Meng Hao, transforming into a blade as he opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>A multi-colored blade that contained a great Dao of Heaven and Earth!</p><br/><p>The blade contained the full power of Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base, which was the combination of his nine Nascent Souls, including the five elements of Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>It also contained the memories and experiences of his two hundred years of cultivation. When Meng Hao looked at the blade, it was like looking at himself!</p><br/><p>In this moment, Meng Hao\u2019s heart contained neither joy, nor sorrow. It was as if he had forgotten everything except for his thirst for freedom, and his desire to pursue independence.</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Lily inside of him seemed to sense that it was in danger. It could hide from his Divine Sense so that Meng Hao couldn\u2019t sense it, but it could not hide even the slightest bit from this blade.</p><br/><p>The intense sense of impending death caused the Resurrection Lily to begin to struggle, as if it wished to burst out from inside of Meng Hao. It wanted to once again wrest away the initiative, and yet, as soon as it moved, a dim light began to emanate out from the skeleton floating in the seaweed. Up above, the surface of the sea in the Third Ring began to surge.</p><br/><p>Next, imprints of the Whitebone Lily began to shine on all of the Sea Demons in the Third Ring. The marks looked like grotesque faces, and emanated ghastly auras.</p><br/><p>Those auras combined to suppress the Resurrection Lily.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Lily struggled, and then began to shriek with a voice that no one except Meng Hao could hear.</p><br/><p>What was more, the illusory image of a five-colored Resurrection Lily sprang up behind him. It was in a completely frenzy, and struggling madly. Meng Hao\u2019s expression was calm, although his body was withering rapidly, as if his life force and Cultivation base were being sucked away by the Resurrection Lily.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he remained there motionless, staring at the blade in front of him.</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Lily screamed and shrieked, and its struggles grew more intense. However, the suppressive power coming from the Reverend Silverlamp\u2019s Whitebone Lily rushed in. It seemed to deal a severe blow to the five-colored Resurrection Lily. Its body was on the verge of dissipating, and it had no choice but to once again attempt to absorb Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Some time afterwards, when Meng Hao\u2019s body had shriveled and become almost skeletal, the blade in front of him jerked slightly, then slowly rose up.</p><br/><p>As the blade lifted up, an immeasurably powerful, heaven-shaking aura arose with it. Instantly it pierced through the surface of the sea and up into the skies, forming a connection with the vast heavens!</p><br/><p>From a distance, the Third Ring seethed and churned as a beam of light shot up into the dark night, making it seem like daytime.</p><br/><p>In that moment, as Saint Soul Sun hovered above the Milky Way Sea, his face flickered and he suddenly turned his head to gaze at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone is performing Spirit Severing. But how could this Spirit Severing provoke such transformations in Heaven and Earth!?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Saint Flying Immortal and Saint Sea Divinity also got the same feeling. They looked at the beam of light, and how the sky was being illuminated, and their faces filled with astonishment.</p><br/><p>The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch currently sat cross-legged in meditation in Seahold. Suddenly, his eyes snapped open and he looked off into the distance, an expression of joy appearing on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose\u2026 are the ripples of Spirit Severing. It\u2019s him!! So he is here! He truly is exceptional! His Spirit Severing can connect with the Heavens of Ji, and provoke changes in the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you dare to perform Spirit Severing in front of me? Let\u2019s see how you escape this time!\u201d The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch gave a cold snort and stood up. It was at this point that his face suddenly flickered with an expression of disbelief. Even with his level of willpower, what he saw left him speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The beam of light shooting up from the sea did not stop in the sky. It shot out into the starry sky, causing the heavenly bodies themselves to emanate bursts of starlight as they suddenly changed position to form an astral blade!</p><br/><p>The blade shined down on the lands of South Heaven, and soon, everyone therein could look up into the sky and see the image of the massive blade.</p><br/><p>It was almost as if it had shattered the sky above the lands of South Heaven and was now descending upon it.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, the aura of a great Dao descended from the sky toward the Milky Way Sea. It penetrated the surface of the waters and fell on the blade floating in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blade of the First Severing actually provoked transformations among the stars!\u201d exclaimed the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. \u201cWhat Dao did he gain enlightenment of?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDaos have rankings, they can be great or small. This Meng Hao\u2019s Dao\u2026 just what is it? It can cause the stars to transform into a Heavenly Blade that will assist him in Dao Severing!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Blade is a Heavenly Dao. The blade of the First Severing is also the first Dao of Spirit Severing!\u201d [1. Please note that in Chinese, the words for \u201cblade\u201d and \u201cDao\u201d sound almost exactly the same.] The 10th Wang Clan Patriarch\u2019s face filled with complete astonishment, and he stopped moving. As of this moment, he didn\u2019t dare to get even close to Meng Hao\u2019s location. A great Dao was coming, and with his Cultivation base, if he got near, he would die for sure.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the State of Zhao floated in the Milky Way Sea on top of Patriarch Reliance. The entire island suddenly rumbled, and an enormous head stretched out from the water to look up into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat little bastard is performing Dao Severing\u2026. Dammit. The little bastard is an inhuman among inhumans! The Patriarch needs to get out of here! Fudge! You really piss me off, you little bastard!!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the lands of the Southern Domain, Xu Qing was in the midst of cultivation when suddenly a tremor ran through her, as if she had just sensed something. She rushed out of her Immortal\u2019s cave and looked up into the sky. It seemed as if she could actually see Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>In the Violet Fate Sect, Pill Demon was concocting pills when he suddenly froze. He looked up into the sky, and his face broke into a smile.</p><br/><p>Next to him was Chu Yuyan, who also seemed to sense something. She looked up, and seemed to lose herself staring at the sky.</p><br/><p>In the same moment, Fatty, Chen Fan, and all the other people in the Southern Domain who knew Meng Hao, all had different reactions. However, none came close to those of Xu Qing and Pill Demon.</p><br/><p>With one exception.</p><br/><p>In the Blood Demon Sect, a middle-aged man wearing a red robe was surrounded by a blood-colored glow. He stood on the peak of a mountain, looking up into the sky, a faint smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou and I are connected by destiny. The Blood Demon Sect\u2026 is definitely the home you shall return to.\u201d [2.

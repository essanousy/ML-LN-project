All of the cultivators in the Heavencloud Bazaar were completely shaken by Fang Shoudao\u2019s words, and could scarcely believe what they were hearing.</p><br/><p>The title of Crown Prince was simply that, a title. And yet, the Fang Clan seemed ready to go to war, and even make an enemy of someone who could step into the Dao Realm at any time.</p><br/><p>It completely defied reason!</p><br/><p>Even the other Fang Clan Elders gasped in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, this....\u201d The Elder who had reprimanded Meng Hao the most severely began to speak, his voice hoarse. However, even as the words left his mouth, other Fang Clan disciples stepped into the teleportation portal to go spread word to the Fang Clan on Planet East Victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Shoudao, sir, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Guru Heavencloud, his face flickering. \u201cThis was just a misunderstanding. Didn\u2019t we already make that clear...?\u201d His heart was now starting to thump; he actually didn't want to be forced to break through to the Dao Realm. After all, it was a critical matter of life and death.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only thing that was explained clearly was why the Crown Prince of the Fang Clan attacked you,\u201d Fang Shoudao responded immediately. \u201cWhat will happen now is that you will be punished for daring to use deadly force to try to punish the Crown Prince!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Fang Clan\u2019s Crown Prince, Hao\u2019er, has incredible latent talent, and is matchless in the entire world. He is a qilin of the Fang Clan, and of all the members of the Junior generation, I favored his grandfather the most. His father, is also one of the young lads I look most kindly upon. And as for Meng Hao himself, I will risk my life for him, for the sake of protecting a Chosen of the Fang Clan!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is our future Clan Chief!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is our future Patriarch!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is the most, most precious person in the entire clan! The most, most, most cherished one of us. The most, most, most, most important person!\u201d Fang Shoudao\u2019s proud voice echoed out in all directions, causing the other members of the Fang Clan to stare with wide-open mouths. All of the other cultivators in the area were also looking on in shock.</p><br/><p>Even Meng Hao had to clear his throat. His face was a bit flushed, not with bashfulness, but with true embarrassment....</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone who dares to provoke him is provoking the entire Fang Clan!\u201d Fang Shoudao declared. \u201cAnyone who dares to harm him, will provoke the Fang Clan into instant action, even if that action is a war of mutual destruction!</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er is absolutely one-of-a-kind in the Fang Clan, and there\u2019s not enough time in the day to show our care and affection for him. Heavencloud, you brat, I can't believe you actually dared to berate Hao\u2019er, much less slander him! I'm going to kill you!\u201d His voice echoed out in all directions, pouring into the ears of every person present, causing them to stare in shock.</p><br/><p>Virtually everyone who was listening got the impression... that he was actually ingratiating himself to Meng Hao. For him to say such things in this situation really seemed strange....</p><br/><p>In fact, it was obvious that he wasn\u2019t making this speech to the bystanders. It was clear that he was... speaking directly to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>However, this in itself caused everyone to be even more shocked than before. To hear such fawning words coming out of Fang Shoudao\u2019s mouth, especially to a member of the clan\u2019s Junior generation, actually revealed an even more stunning truth!</p><br/><p>Guru Heavencloud\u2019s heart was pounding, and from Fang Shoudao's words, he could tell that there was something he didn't know about. Obviously, Meng Hao\u2019s status far exceeded that of a simple Crown Prince. He was obviously so important that Fang Shoudao was willing to publically brown-nose him. This left Guru Heavencloud shocked to a profound degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you!\u201d Fang Shoudao continued, turning to glare angrily at the Elder who had reprimanded Meng Hao earlier. \u201cHow dare you ask the future Clan Chief, the future Patriarch, the clan\u2019s current immaculate qilin, our matchless Chosen... to kneel! Are you really surnamed Fang? Fudge! If I\u2019d known you were this kind of person, I wouldn't have arranged a beloved partner for your grandfather all those years ago! If your father hadn\u2019t been born, then I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with you, you spineless coward!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elder began to shake, and the blood drained from his face. He was just about to offer an explanation when Fang Shoudao turned back to Meng Hao, a kind, albeit strange, look in his eyes. Seemingly excited, he laughed loudly and said, \u201cHao\u2019er, how do you think we should punish this bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch--\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Meng Hao could say anything more, Fang Shoudao glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t call me Patriarch,\u201d he said. \u201cCall me Great-Grandpa. That's a bit more cordial.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat. \u201cGreat-Grandpa, allow me to take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he waved his finger toward the Elder, causing the old man to instantly tremble. Although nothing happened visibly, the Dao seed inside of him suddenly vanished. Instantly, the man seemed to grow older, and his vitality seemed to wane.</p><br/><p>Although his cultivation base was not harmed, the wave of Meng Hao's finger had cut off his path to the Allheaven!</p><br/><p>Even the old man didn\u2019t really understand what he had lost. However, in an Allheaven Clan, what Meng Hao had just done was actually the most severe type of punishment!</p><br/><p>Fang Shoudao\u2019s heart flip-flopped, and he took a deep breath. After taking a close look at the Elder, all of his previous suspicions were dispelled, and he looked back at Meng Hao with indescribable excitement.</p><br/><p>Then he waved his sleeve, causing the whole asteroid field to shake as a beam of light spread out to cover the entire area, completely locking it down.</p><br/><p>At the same time, light began to rise up from the Fang Clan\u2019s teleportation portal as hundreds of figures began to emerge. This was the Fang Clan. Even Fang Wei was present, along with Ancient Realm experts of the Elder generation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWipe out the Heavencloud Bazaar!\u201d Fang Shoudao said, waving his sleeve. Heaven and Earth rumbled, and wild colors flashed. Instantly, all of the teleportation portals on all of the asteroids were sealed, regardless of which sect or clan they belonged to.</p><br/><p>It was now impossible for anyone from outside the asteroid field to interfere.</p><br/><p>The cultivators who were not affiliated with the Heavencloud Bazaar were shocked, and did nothing to fight back against the Fang Clan. They were merely passers-by, and as long as they did nothing to help the Heavencloud Bazaar, they would not be affected.</p><br/><p>The magenta-robed cultivators\u2019 faces turned deathly pale. It was hard to say who did it first, but they all began to flee. However, the Fang Clan cultivators immediately flew out to give chase, cold smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurrender and we won\u2019t kill you!\u201d Threatening voices immediately rang out from the Fang Clan, causing everything to shake, and the void to vibrate. Surprisingly, azure light was emanating out from the members of the Fang Clan. Although it was faint, everyone could see it, and it caused them to feel a pressure and a trembling within their souls. It was as if... that azure color commanded the ultimate respect!</p><br/><p>When Guru Heavencloud saw what was happening, his face fell, and he backed up. However, even as he did, Fang Shoudao snorted coldly and prepared to attack. However, Meng Hao stepped forward first.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat-Grandpa, allow me,\u201d he said, his voice echoing about. Then he shot forward and resumed fighting with Guru Heavencloud. Within a few breaths of time, the two of them had already exchanged hundreds of moves, causing rumbling sounds to echo about. Meng Hao performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, unleashing the Essence of Divine Flame, a flame sea that engulfed Heavencloud\u2019s Soul Lamps and magical items.</p><br/><p>Guru Heavencloud\u2019s Ancient treasure was then hit by the azure light from Meng Hao, causing it to tremble and crack. Meng Hao charged forward, blasting out with the God-Slaying Fist.</p><br/><p>Wild colors flashed, and a screaming wind kicked up. All of the other fighting cultivators in the area began to tremble, and when they looked over, they gasped.</p><br/><p>It was as if all the energy of Heaven and Earth in the entire area was being sucked into Meng Hao\u2019s fist. As his fist descended, it felt as if the will of Heaven were descending.</p><br/><p>No matter what Guru Heavencloud tried to do to fight back, it was useless. The magical items held by his Soul Lamps shattered and transformed into ash, and his helmet was crushed. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he tumbled backward, his body half pulverized.</p><br/><p>When Fang Tongtian saw this, his eyes went wide, and as for Fang Shoudao, a strange light could be seen in his eyes. Although he mostly understood what had happened, and had braced himself for something like this, to see Meng Hao wielding this type of strength was shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Clan, you\u2019re forcing my hand!\u201d roared Guru Heavencloud. Looking around, he saw that most of his Heavencloud Bazaar disciples had surrendered, and that he had essentially lost control. More members of the Fang Clan were pouring out through their teleportation portal. Guru Heavencloud began to laugh bitterly, even crazily. By now, he realized that he had offended someone who he could not afford to have offended. Regret was useless, so he roared and, without any further hesitation, pointed his finger up toward the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cDao!\u201d he roared. It was only a single word, but when it left his mouth, everything shook violently. An indescribable energy of Heaven and Earth descended, swirling around him, creating a force that pushed Meng Hao away, making it impossible for him to get close.</p><br/><p>Everyone around Guru Heavencloud was trembling under the incredible pressure that pushed down from the starry sky.</p><br/><p>Fang Shoudao approached Meng Hao, looked up at Guru Heavencloud, and then slowly began to explain: \u201cWatch closely. This is what it's like to step into the Dao. I forced him into this so that you could have a chance to see for yourself what it\u2019s like. When your time comes, this experience will prove to be quite helpful. Your future is tied to the future of the entire clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDao!!\u201d Guru Heavencloud roared again. Rumbling sounds echoed out, and the pressure from up above grew more intense. The void vibrated, and ripples spread out in all directions. Layers of natural laws became visible, as well as numerous Essences.</p><br/><p>Beams of light shot up from Guru Heavencloud, rising higher up, growing more numerous and scintillating....</p><br/><p>Guru Heavencloud\u2019s energy rose, and the pressure of Heaven and Earth grew stronger. As of this moment, it was as if he were the center of attention of all the starry sky. Currently, not even Fang Shoudao could have tried to fight him.</p><br/><p>Whenever someone in the great circle of the Ancient Realm stepped into the Dao, they were essentially invincible. At the same time, that person could do nothing to interrupt the process; any attempt to do so could influence their chances of success!</p><br/><p>Failure... could not be endured!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's hard to say whether he\u2019ll succeed or not....\u201d Fang Shoudao said with a sigh. \u201cStepping into the Dao is very difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he looked at Guru Heavencloud. It was almost as if he were watching himself in the future, trying to step into the Dao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDao!!!\u201d Guru Heavencloud\u2019s final shout caused the starry sky to tremble and roil as a huge vortex formed. Within that vortex crackled countless lightning bolts, and just beyond it was what appeared to be a path.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to tell exactly where that path led....</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the Dao, and also... a path!\u201d [1. Don\u2019t forget that the character \u201cDao\u201d also means \u201croad\u201d or \u201cway\u201d] As Fang Shoudao\u2019s voice echoed out, Guru Heavencloud shot forward, going for broke as he charged into the vortex and stepped onto the path.</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1162: Heavencloud Steps into the Dao!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

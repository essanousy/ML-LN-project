Fine!\u201d squawked the parrot, flapping its wings. \u201cYou shall know how powerful an ancient Celestial bird is!\u201d The parrot\u2019s eyes had turned green; its dignity had been questioned! A multicolored light suddenly blazed out from it, filling the entire small mountain in the space of a single breath.</p><br/><p>Then, the light returned, as if it had collected something from within the mountain. The light gathered together, transforming into a pile of black soil the size of a fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee?\u201d said the parrot arrogantly, its voice shrill. \u201cThe secret of these black-colored lands can be found within this very mountain. This was refined out by me, Lord Fifth, personally!\u201d</p><br/><p>Off to the side, the meat jelly watched in a daze, completely quiet, as if it had just been enlightened. Despite its apparent sudden realization, however, it quickly grew more curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck is it?\u201d it said. It rolled its eyes as it considered Meng Hao\u2019s words from just now, and then the arrogant posturing of the parrot. Suddenly, it felt very excited and gushed, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to use that crap to fool us, you old bird! You don\u2019t have any idea at all what it is!\u201d</p><br/><p>The parrot looked scornfully at the meat jelly. This time, it didn\u2019t react at all like it had toward Meng Hao, causing the meat jelly to stare dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he looked closely at the soil, which was actually a dark purplish-green. Just looking at it, he didn\u2019t see anything unusual; in fact, it seemed quite ordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know where this random clump of mud came from, and yet you dare to claim that you\u2019re omniscient?\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. It seemed that the parrot\u2026 didn't like to be provoked by people.</p><br/><p>Even though the meat jelly had tried this method moments ago, to no effect, Meng Hao decided to try it out one more time.</p><br/><p>Even as the words were leaving his mouth, the parrot\u2019s colorful feathers stood up on end, a green light shone from within its eyes, and a white Qi began to seep out from the top of its head. It seemed that its dignity had been seriously slighted, something it couldn\u2019t accept in its arrogance.</p><br/><p>Apparently it could ignore whatever the meat jelly said, but not even the slightest bit of provocation from Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to look down on Lord Fifth!?\u201d shrieked the parrot furiously. \u201cLord Fifth is an ancient Celestial bird! There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t know! Mountains and Seas, the Heavens, who doesn\u2019t know that if you have faith in the Lord Fifth, you can attain eternal life!? You listen to Lord Fifth, buddy. This stuff is Immortal Sense soil! Many years ago, an almighty member of the senior generation painted a talisman out amidst the stars. He threw it down, with the intention of sealing this particular planet. However, someone else blocked it, and as the talisman entered the planet, it was burned into ash.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, that almighty ancient had an exceedingly high Cultivation base, and therefore, the magical symbols he painted contained divine abilities. Even though it became ash, it still contained the power of an Immortal. The ash fell down onto this very land. That\u2019s why the soil in this place is black, because the land here contains the remnants of that burned talisman! I, an ancient Celestial bird, saw all this happen, so many years ago. How could I possibly be mistaken!?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing all this, Meng Hao\u2019s pupils constricted, and his heart trembled.</p><br/><p>A Cultivator who wielded power great enough to be able to paint magical symbols among the stars, and use them to seal an entire planet\u2026. Before the events at the Rebirth Cave, Meng Hao would not have easily believed that such a thing could be true. But after seeing Choumen Tai, he now had a much greater understanding of such matters.</p><br/><p>Right now, he breathed deeply as he looked at the incensed parrot, having already been seventy to eighty percent convinced of what it was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome almighty person capable of painting a seal that can lock down a whole planet, that\u2019s just shocking,\u201d he thought. \u201cBut for someone to interfere with it, to burn it and cause the ash to create the Black Lands\u2026 well who was that?\u201d At the moment, the character Ji was hovering in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can be hard to distinguish illusions from reality,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice story, but who knows whether it\u2019s true or not?\u201d Actually, Meng Hao was mostly convinced already, but he allowed no change of expression to appear on his face.</p><br/><p>The parrot looked even more enraged. It flew around in circles around the Immortal\u2019s cave, glaring at Meng Hao. Then, it opened its mouth and spit out a glowing green light which shot toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>It happened so fast that Meng Hao had no chance to dodge. The green light entered into him through his forehead, transforming into information that branded itself onto his mind.</p><br/><p>The information consisted of a few hundred characters. They were complex, but after examining them, Meng Hao realized what it was: a vision technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse this technique, and look again! This Celestial technique has been branded onto you, so there\u2019s no need for enlightenment or study. Just use it!\u201d The parrot glared at Meng Hao, apparently unwilling to rest until Meng Hao believed what he said.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao closed his eyes. When he opened them, the pupil of his right eye shrank. As it did, he felt as if Cultivation base power were suddenly being emitted out of his right eye.</p><br/><p>In an instant, it felt as if his Cultivation base were withered, causing Meng Hao to feel quite alarmed. Suddenly, a strand of the Immortal spiritual energy within his body went toward his right eye, fusing with it.</p><br/><p>He felt a stab of pain in his right eye, and tears flowed out of it. His vision grew blurry, but then cleared. Now, the world as he viewed it through his right eye looked very different, although it was hard to describe exactly how.</p><br/><p>He looked down at the violet-green clump of soil.</p><br/><p>Even at first glance, Meng Hao\u2019s mind was shaken. Slowly, pulses of a golden-colored aura became visible, floating up from the soil and congealing in the air to form faint magical symbols. The symbols, of course, were golden-colored; furthermore, they emitted an intense pressure that only Meng Hao was able to sense.</p><br/><p>Under the influence of the pressure, the magical symbols seemed to transform into tiny people. All of them floated there in front of Meng Hao, and they appeared to be painting something.</p><br/><p>There was only a tiny bit of pressure, but it caused Meng Hao\u2019s mind to fill with a roaring sound, and his Spiritual Sense to grow unstable. He suddenly closed his eyes, cutting off his vision and thus ending the technique. Even still, his face was pale, and it took him a while to recover his senses. When he opened his eyes, his right eye was filled with veins of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, did you feel it?\u201d asked the parrot haughtily. \u201cLord Fifth knows everything. This is nothing but a clump of dirt with a bit of magical symbols in it. If you had encountered the ash created by the true Immortal Talisman that year, you wouldn\u2019t have been struck absentminded, you would have been struck dead!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know, soil like this is everywhere in this black-colored land. You can\u2019t say there\u2019s a huge amount, but there is quite a bit. People like you who can actually gaze upon the will of the Immortal Talisman, well, let\u2019s just say you\u2019re as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Were it not for the fact that this area is suppressed, it wouldn\u2019t have lasted until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this soil is taken away from this land, then it will become useless. Oh, and let me tell you another secret. If you possess enough fortune and luck, you can collect more soil like this, and then you might gain enlightenment regarding some of the divine abilities within the magical symbols of that almighty senior. Now, please repeat after me in a loud voice: Have faith in the Lord Fifth, gain eternal life! When the Lord Fifth appears, who dares to cause strife! Many years ago, countless people chanted these very lines!\u201d It looked at the pale-faced Meng Hao even more egotistically, apparently more and more convinced of how powerful it was.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao ignored the parrot. \u201cSuch a powerful aura\u2026 especially considering this is just a tiny clump of soil. And yet, it contains such shocking power. To think that there is more of this dirt throughout the Black Lands\u2026.\u201d He began to breathe deeply, and his eyes glowed.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of the words of the Demon Sealing Jade.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Immortal of the Ninth Mountain; the pinnacle of brushwork; magical symbols of all creatures; collapse of the Heavens\u2026. The power is fused within this land, transformed into destruction, and filled with Demonic life force. This land\u2026 can be used to cultivate\u2026 the art of Righteous Bestowal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered. The method for cultivating the art of Righteous Bestowal already existed in his mind. During his time focused on healing his injuries, he\u2019d had no time to work toward enlightenment, but having seen this clump of soil, he suddenly found himself lost in thought.</p><br/><p>Time slipped by. Soon, half a month had gone past. The parrot and the meat jelly had disappeared somewhere, and were no longer in the Immortal\u2019s cave. The interchanges between these two old enemies usually involved the meat jelly provoking the parrot in some way. However, the parrot was always able to respond with only a few words that would send the meat jelly shrinking in on itself.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was focused on the art of Righteous Bestowal. Occasionally he would use the vision technique to examine the soil; each time he would come up lacking in some aspect of enlightenment or another. As he continued to study it, he would sometimes take out Ji Hongdong\u2019s bag of holding. The magical sealing symbol was still there, but it was growing weaker. After a few attempts at breaking it, Meng Hao got the feeling that it wouldn\u2019t be long before he would be able to open the bag.</p><br/><p>Time slowly passed. Other than research, he spent his time thinking. He didn\u2019t consume the Outlander Pill that Master had given him. True, it could extend longevity, but more importantly, it could be used to suppress the Resurrection Lily.</p><br/><p>He could only consume three in his life, and did not wish to squander those opportunities.</p><br/><p>As for the Primordial Heavenly Replenishing Pill, it could also extend longevity, but he only had one. At the moment, he didn\u2019t have enough Spirit Stones to duplicate a copy, so after a moment\u2019s thought, he sealed it back up. At the moment, he was completely recovered; his longevity was significantly shortened, but it wasn\u2019t an extreme emergency.</p><br/><p>For now, what he was most worried about was the Heavenly Tribulation that would come with his Perfect Gold Core. Right now, he had all the ingredients he needed to make the Perfect Core Pill, except for one plant.</p><br/><p>The plant he needed wasn\u2019t extremely rare; Meng Hao guessed that even in the Black Lands, he would most likely be able to get ahold of one.</p><br/><p>However, after thinking for quite a long time about the Heavenly Tribulation, Meng Hao still had no idea how he would deal with it, other than the meat jelly.</p><br/><p>On one particular day, after gaining a bit of enlightenment regarding the Celestial soil, Meng Hao\u2019s mind suddenly quivered. He sent his Spiritual Sense out roughly fifty kilometers out from his Immortal\u2019s cave. There, he could see Huang Daxian, very cautiously leading a group of grim, malevolent-looking Foundation Establishment Cultivators in his direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeniors,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cup ahead, the four of you will be able to see the place where that guy is staying.\u201d His nose was bloodied, and his face swollen, and it seemed he was even missing a few teeth. His expression was very dispirited.</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap,\u201d said one of the four Foundation Establishment Cultivators with a cold snort. \u201cKeep leading the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to see if this guy truly has the superhuman abilities you claim!\u201d said another. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s the supposed medicinal pills!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four Cultivators\u2019 eyes glittered with avarice. Among the four, one was surprisingly of the great circle of Foundation Establishment. The other three were in the mid Foundation Establishment stage. These four held sway over the region with iron fists, and they were quite well-known. Their bodies were festooned with what could almost be called totem tattoos, very similar to those of Western Desert Cultivators, although not quite the same.</p><br/><p>The four of them exchanged glances and began to converse in hushed tones.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to be careful. With so many medicinal pills, he must not be an ordinary person. Make sure not to damage his bag of holding before he dies, otherwise this trip will have been in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. We\u2019ll all attack at once, and wipe him out. Don\u2019t give him a chance to destroy his own bag of holding before that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Daxian looked furious, but didn\u2019t dare to say anything other than to mumble in agreement with them.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao retracted his Spiritual Sense. Huang Daxian was branded with his Spiritual Sense, so Meng Hao was aware of all of his activities, including the disaster he had brought upon himself because of the medicinal pill, and how he had been captured.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to, Meng Hao could just exterminate all of them. However, after thinking about the Celestial soil which contained the Celestial talismanic symbols, he changed his mind and allowed Huang Daxian to lead them here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need enough Celestial soil. The more the better. That will increase my ability to achieve full enlightenment.\u201d Meng Hao closed his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

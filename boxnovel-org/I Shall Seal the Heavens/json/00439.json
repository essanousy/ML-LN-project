Vast numbers of neo-demons blotted out the sky and land. There was something very special about these Dragoneers; their neo-demon hordes all consisted of a single type of neo-demon.</p><br/><p>One of them possessed a huge flock of vicious gray seabirds that whistled through the air. Bizarrely, each of these birds had three claws and the image of a human face on its chest.</p><br/><p>Astonishingly, another of the Dragoneers was surrounded by multiple giant ants. The largest of these ants were roughly six meters long; as for the small ones, there were too many to even count. They looked savage as they swarmed forward, blanketing over everything.</p><br/><p>The final Dragoneer was an old man with a proud expression on his face. Nine wasp nests floated in the air around him, and he was surrounded by a cloud of poisonous wasps. The shocking sound of their buzz was enough to cause anyone\u2019s scalp to go numb.</p><br/><p>Uniform neo-demon hordes were the standard for orthodox Dragoneers. These were the types of Dragoneers who each benefited from a legacy. Many such legacies had been passed down through various Dragoneer bloodlines for generations.</p><br/><p>Considering that they could summon vast hordes of uniform neo-demons, it was very easy to see the difference between them, and Rogue Dragoneers, most of whom had mixed neo-demon hordes.</p><br/><p>After seeing these three Dragoneers appear, Meng Hao\u2019s face was calm as he stood atop the Wild Giant\u2019s enormous frame. It howled as it charged forward, instantly attracting the attention of everyone outside of the shield.</p><br/><p>His appearance immediately caused Zhao Youlan\u2019s expression to flicker. She examined Meng Hao closely for a moment and then frowned.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the three rank 9 Dragoneers from the Spider Branch looked over at Meng Hao, then exchanged glittering glances. They all began to flicker incantation gestures, causing several thousand neo-demons from each of their hordes to suddenly shoot directly toward the shield.</p><br/><p>These three groups of three different types of neo-demons formed together to make a neo-demon horde nearly ten thousand in number. Their shocking roars lifted up to the Heavens as they advanced. Meng Hao gave a cold snort. The howling Wild Giant suddenly leaped up into the air, shooting out through the shield, its eyes filling with the thirst for blood as it charged toward the incoming neo-demon horde.</p><br/><p>In mid-air, Meng Hao\u2019s right hand waved, causing the totem tattoos on his right arm to begin to glow. Suddenly, intense light shot out, flickering into a flock of black crows.</p><br/><p>The instant the black crows appeared, they let out piercing cries. Suddenly, all the corpses on the battlefield began to emanate a pulsing black aura, which was then sucked upward toward the black crows. It was like a black mist that swirled around the crows and then shot toward the incoming neo-demons.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, a green light began to flicker around Meng Hao. Big Hairy and the rest of the Greenwood Wolfpack appeared, along with the Black Bat. They too shot out in attack.</p><br/><p>As for the Black Bat, it almost appeared like Meng Hao didn\u2019t care about it; in reality, he attached a lot of importance to the creature. It was a neo-demon that had been suppressed by a wooden sword. He was quite certain that the power it was revealing now was not the full extent of what it was capable of. Either it was intentionally holding back, or needed more time to recover from the serious injury.</p><br/><p>If it was the latter, then that meant it was very weak right now. Even still, its weakness allowed it to employ a Cultivation base of roughly level 7.</p><br/><p>Shocking booms filled the air as the two neo-demon hordes slammed into each other and then dissolved into fierce fighting.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao himself had attracted quite a bit of attention on the battlefield. Dragoneer battles were large in scope, and gave rise to powerful auras. Within the blink of an eye, this Dragoneer showdown had turned into the fourth of the great battles occurring.</p><br/><p>One of the three Spider Branch Dragoneers let out a cold laugh and then said, \u201cYou trifling Rogue Dragoneer. You killed Zhou Ye by a fluke! Your mixed neo-demon horde might have some fantastic neo-demons in it, but you don\u2019t stand a chance against the three of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was their only enemy, and their only mission was to draw him out and kill him.</p><br/><p>Seeing him fighting back against them, the three exchanged another glance, then all began to flash incantation gestures. Immediately, the rest of the neo-demons around them lifted their heads up and roared, then charged forward.</p><br/><p>The impressive sight and the thunderous roaring caused many of the surrounding combatants to suddenly look over to watch this part of the battle.</p><br/><p>Laughing coldly, the three Spider Branch Dragoneers performed more incantations, causing the totems on their bodies to begin to shine. Suddenly several hundred level 10 neo-demons magically appeared in the air around them. In unison, they charged toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will help you to understand the truly crushing power of Dragoneers!\u201d Even as the words left their mouths, their neo-demon hordes, nearly thirty thousand in number, closed in on Meng Hao. It truly seemed as if Meng Hao\u2019s own neo-demon horde would have difficulty fighting back. They would surely be completely consumed.</p><br/><p>His face as calm as ever, Meng Hao\u2019s cold eyes glanced over the incoming neo-demons. With that, he casually shook his arms and legs. Immediately, totemic light began to emanate out from him. Within the glowing light were several thousand howling Greenwood Wolves, as well as Flame Thrushes and Stone Golems. There was also an innumerable group of neo-demons whose bodies were surrounded by rippling shields of water.</p><br/><p>A shocking roar then filled the air as the savage red crocodile crawled out onto the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Then, a shriek could be heard as black mists billowed up. Within the black mist crawled a black lizard that looked like it had just emerged from the yellow springs of the underworld. Its appearance immediately caused the air to vibrate.</p><br/><p>Next, a droning sound could be heard as the fierce, green Demonsquitos appeared around Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>As one neo-demon horde after another appeared, the faces of the three Spider Branch Dragoneers instantly fell. At the same time, Meng Hao began to stride forward. As he did, the air around him rippled as twenty of the three hundred meter large spiders appeared, along with over ten thousand smaller spiders. They whistled throughout the air, a vast horde of nearly thirty thousand neo-demons that caused everything to shake. They instantly charged toward the three Dragoneers.</p><br/><p>As soon as Meng Hao\u2019s neo-demons slammed into the hordes from the Spider Branch, miserable cries filled the air. The three Dragoneers\u2019 hordes were completely incapable of blocking Meng Hao\u2019s. Facing the slaughter and injury, they tried to fall back. Unfortunately for them, Meng Hao\u2019s neo-demons quickly surrounded them.</p><br/><p>The three Dragoneers\u2019 faces fell and grew ashen. At the same time, Zhao Youlan\u2019s eyes went wide and filled with an expression of disbelief. Then, her soft voice could once again be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh Priest, it seems that if we wish to kill this man, we will first need to draw out their most powerful expert, the Greatfather of the Crow Soldier Tribe. Only when he is also present can I execute our plan to completely exterminate these Five Tribes. High Priest, please take action!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Spider Branch High Priest, the old man in the green robe, smiled in response to her words. He waved his wooden wand, and then employed minor teleportation. When he reappeared, he was directly in front of Meng Hao. As soon as he arrived, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered. Having sensed the man\u2019s imminent arrival, Meng Hao was ready. He shot backward, his eyes cold.</p><br/><p>Back inside the shield, the Crow Gloom Priest could tell that something fishy was going on, but he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what. Unfortunately, there was no time to analyze the situation to try to figure out the source of his strange feeling.</p><br/><p>Gritting his teeth, he said, \u201cCrow Soldier Tribe Greatfather, please intercept that High Priest to buy some time for Grandmaster Meng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to him, the Crow Soldier Tribe Greatfather\u2019s eyes glimmered with coldness. His body disappeared in a minor teleportation. When he reappeared, he was blocking the Spider Branch High Priest, preventing him from nearing Meng Hao. The two looked at each other, and, without a word, instantly employed divine abilities. Booming sounds filled the air as the fifth major encounter began on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>As for Meng Hao, he also could tell that something strange was going on. He had participated in a similar Cultivator war back in the Black Lands. Based on how that war went, it could be said that such wars were usually not finished in a short period of time. Usually, protracted battles went on for days before the situation began to favor one side or the other.</p><br/><p>Unless one side was clearly in a position of superiority in terms of power, allowing them to crush the other side, then the only option was to try to slowly weaken the other side.</p><br/><p>However, despite clearly not being in the position to crush the Five Tribes, the Spider Branch, after not even a single day of battle, was using this strange tactic to try to force the Five Tribes to play their trump cards.</p><br/><p>It appeared as if the Spider Branch were going all out, regardless of being assured of victory. Such impulsive attacks must surely be a part of some greater plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be some deadly gambit waiting to be sprung. If I were them, what would be my tactic?\u201d Meng Hao controlled the neo-demons surrounding the hordes of the three Dragoneers and simultaneously glanced around the battlefield. The first thing he took note of was the rippling scene up above. That was where the Five Tribes\u2019 Sacred Ancients were locked in battle with the fearsome Demonspider that was attempting to emerge.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt most likely won\u2019t involve them\u2026. The totemic Sacred Ancients are not Cultivators, but rather powerful neo-demons who can spawn totems. Their battle exceeds my understanding.\u201d Frowning, Meng Hao looked at the thousands of battling Cultivators, then back at the shield. Finally, he looked up at the battling Nascent Soul Cultivators.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s me. I count as one of the major parts of the battle. However, if they wanted to kill me specifically, they would do so with decisiveness. If you look at it that way\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s face suddenly flickered. Without hesitation, he shot backward, both hands flickering an incantation. Flickering protective shields immediately appeared around him.</p><br/><p>Almost at the exact moment that Meng Hao began to retreat, Zhao Youlan\u2019s eyes began to glow with a cold light. She took a deep breath as she carefully lifted up her right hand to reveal a wooden box.</p><br/><p>When she opened the box, a black glow instantly emanated out. At the same time, a tremor ran through Zhao Youlan\u2019s body. She bit her tongue with her beautiful teeth and then kneeled down on one knee, holding the box up above her head with both hands.</p><br/><p>As soon as she lifted the box up, the black glow spread out in shocking fashion. A painful radiance appeared which seemed capable of consuming and replacing all other light.</p><br/><p>The Spider Branch Cultivators all suddenly produced black, pasty medicinal pills which they then consumed. After they did, their eyes suddenly turned completely black.</p><br/><p>The Cultivators from the Five Tribes suddenly felt something pulling at them, causing them to involuntarily look over.</p><br/><p>The instant that they did, their hearts all began to tremble.</p><br/><p>The faces of the Tribe members within the shield flickered. They could feel nothing; only those outside the shield could sense the pulling power of the black glow. However, it was this very fact that made the Crow Gloom Priest\u2019s face suddenly go pale white.</p><br/><p>His voice hoarse, he said, \u201cExotic Heartdevil Flower!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s pupils constricted. However, he was already on guard. A bloody glow surrounded him as he directly employed the Blood Death World to defend against the calling of the black glow.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Meng Hao\u2019s face flickered. This was because it was at this very moment\u2026 that the Resurrection Lily chose to explode out with power.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao instantly sent his will out to call all of his neo-demons. They immediately began to rush back toward him.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Nitish Markandeye, Ajai Sivadas, Omar Herrera, Chris Lee, and Lim Derek</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

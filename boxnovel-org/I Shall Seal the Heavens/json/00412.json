Actually, it was some distance away in the boundless mountain chain. In accord with his usual custom, Meng Hao took his neo-demon horde to increasingly remote areas. Hearing the voice, he didn\u2019t move, but rather just listened for a while.</p><br/><p>Usually, Meng Hao didn\u2019t run into people out here. He was usually alone; therefore, after hearing the voice, Meng Hao sent out some Spiritual Sense to check out the situation.</p><br/><p>Not far off, separated from Meng Hao by a medium sized mountain, was a group of seven or eight Crow Scout Tribe members. Currently, they were facing off wrathfully against a group of three others. From their clothing, it was obvious these others were Crow Soldier Tribe members.</p><br/><p>In the middle position of these three people was a young man. His Cultivation base was at the early Foundation Establishment stage. The two people flanking him were a bit older, and their faces were covered with cold grins, as well as contempt, as they stared at the Crow Scout Tribe members.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Wu Chen and Wu Ling were among the Crow Scout Tribe members. Wu Hai was also there, as well as a few others with whom Meng Hao was familiar. All were outstanding figures in the younger generation of the Crow Scout Tribe.</p><br/><p>They were surrounded by neo-demons, all of whom radiated fierce auras and glared at the three Crow Soldier Tribe members.</p><br/><p>Situated between the two groups was an indistinct, shimmering net. Laying unconscious and motionless within the net was a small, black snake.</p><br/><p>Wu Ling gritted her beautiful teeth and said, \u201cWe found that Ironblack Snake! We paid a heavy price for it, too. We captured it, so what the hell gives you the right to take it!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man from the Crow Soldier Tribe laughed coldly, virtually ignoring the members of the Crow Scout Tribe. He walked toward the black net and then waved his hand, clearly intent on taking it away. Wu Ling clenched her jaw and then performed an incantation with her right hand. Instantly, the Greenwood Wolf next to her leaped forward. At the same time, totemic power billowed out from Wu Ling\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>When this happened, a look of disdain appeared in the eyes of the Crow Soldier Tribe youth. He waved his left hand, whereupon a pitch-black, decomposing Zombie Wolf materialized. It lifted its head up and roared as it shot toward Wu Ling.</p><br/><p>The faces of all of the Crow Scout Tribe members instantly flickered, and they attacked simultaneously. A huge boom rang out, and the Crow Scout Tribe members staggered backward spitting up blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel 6 neo-demon\u2026.\u201d cried Wu Hai bitterly.</p><br/><p>Wu Chen\u2019s face was ashen. Wu Ling looked like she knew what she was doing, but unfortunately, there was nothing they could actually do. The rotting Zombie Wolf stood there looking at them coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Crow Soldier Tribe and your Crow Scout Tribe have the same roots. If it weren\u2019t for that, all of you would die today for provoking me!\u201d The young man looked scornfully over the Crow Scout Tribe members, then snatched up the black net. He turned to leave, then suddenly looked back. He had just caught sight of Hairy #5, who lay off in the forest, observing the goings on.</p><br/><p>Hairy #5 was usually relatively high-spirited, and was deeply curious about all sorts of matters. Moments ago, he had been passing by, and his attention had been caught by the putrescent Zombie Wolf. He couldn\u2019t help but look on with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoah,\u201d said the young man, his eyes suddenly brightening with pleasure as he looked at Hairy #5. \u201cThat wolf\u2026 is extraordinary! I can\u2019t believe I ran into a Greenwood Wolf like that in this place. If I can take it back as a gift for Master, he\u2019ll definitely be extremely pleased!\u201d He laughed loudly. His two fellow Tribe Members next to him looked at Hairy #5 with expressions of pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>Hairy #5 was no longer small, and had quite a mighty bearing. They could instantly see that he was far from ordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cHairy #5!\u201d said Wu Chen, recognizing him instantly. After staring in shock for a moment, his heart suddenly filled with joy. He looked around, and though he didn\u2019t see anything in particular, he knew what it meant if Hairy #5 was in the area.</p><br/><p>Wu Hai\u2019s expression also filled with joy. It was only Wu Ling who had mixed feelings. As for the other Crow Scout Tribe members, they all recognized Hairy #5 as well, and were instantly filled with happiness.</p><br/><p>Hearing them call out his name, Hairy #5 turned his head in surprise. He looked at them for a moment, then turned back with curiosity to stare at the Zombie Wolf.</p><br/><p>A look of savagery appeared on the face of the young man. He couldn\u2019t care less that the Crow Scout Tribe members recognized this Greenwood Wolf. As far as he was concerned, anything he looked at, especially things that he wanted to give as a gift to his Master, he could take. The entire Crow Soldier Tribe would definitely approve. As far as the other Tribes went, there was hardly anyone who could possibly contend with his Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet me that wolf! I want it alive!\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, the two people standing next to him sprang into action. Simultaneously, the rotting Wolf Zombie shot toward Hairy #5.</p><br/><p>As the two Cultivators flew through the air, their totem tattoos shone brightly, transforming into an enormous net which flew to encircle Hairy #5.</p><br/><p>Hairy #5\u2019s eyes flashed with coldness, and then his body flickered, exploding forward in attack. His mouth opened wide as he bit toward the youth. His speed was such that the young man had no time to react. In the blink of an eye, he was directly in front of the young man. As this happened, a black light sprung out from the young man\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The black light slammed into Hairy #5, who let out a miserable cry. Immediately, black aura began to emit from his body, and he quickly retreated. As he did, the putrefying Zombie Wolf closed in on him, its eyes glowing with grim coldness. It opened its mouth wide as it prepared to bite into Hairy #5.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that a howl suddenly could be heard from the nearby forest. A green beam of light shot out to slam into the body of the Zombie Wolf. It shook as it flew backward like a kite with its string cut. As it was thrown off to the side, Hairy #4 suddenly appeared to stand next to Hairy #5. He looked toward the three Crow Soldier Tribe members, snarling at them to reveal his sharp teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo! Haha! There\u2019s two!\u201d cried the young man. \u201cIf I present them both to Master, he\u2019ll definitely be thrilled!\u201d The young man was actually shocked inwardly. The attack just now had been too fast for him to even react to. Were it not for the protective totem his Master had given him, he would have been torn in two just now. This only made him more desirous of Hairy #5. His eyes glowed with coldness.</p><br/><p>He waved his right hand, causing a black bracelet to fly out. It suddenly let out a bang as it disintegrated in mid-air. It then transformed into a vortex, from within which multiple growling roars could be heard. Several black beams of light suddenly shot out, which transformed into more than twenty completely putrescent Zombie Wolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack! I don\u2019t care who lives or dies, just make sure the bodies of the Greenwood Wolves don\u2019t get too torn up!\u201d Vicious hatred emanated out from the young man\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>As soon as the Zombie Wolves appeared, a noxious reek billowed out. Furthermore, the forest floor in all directions began to wither and turn black. The faces of the Crow Scout Tribe members instantly fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cHairy #4, Hairy #5, get out of here!!\u201d cried Wu Chen urgently.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!\u201d cried the young man, laughing as he pointed toward Wu Chen and the others. Immediately, four of the Zombie Wolves turned toward the Crow Scout Tribe members, then turned into black beams of light as they shot forward in attack.</p><br/><p>The rest of the Zombie Wolves radiated savagery and madness as they charged toward Hairys #4 and #5.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao frowned as watched all of this happen. Finally, he gave a cold snort. Big Hairy looked up and began to howl. Immediately the sound of the howl filled the forest. Hairys #2 and #3, as well as the rest of the Greenwood Wolves, were all in the area. Hearing the howl, they immediately charged in the direction of Hairys #4 and #5.</p><br/><p>Their speed was such that it only took a blink of an eye for the young man as well as the Crow Scout Tribe members to see multiple beams of green light shooting toward them from within the surrounding forest. Suddenly, more than twenty Greenwood Wolves were there, each one beyond ordinary, emanating incredible might. This was especially true of two of their number, which were more than nine meters long and emanated flickering green glows. The savagery and coldness which shone in their eyes filled the entire area.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s face immediately fell. The rotting Zombie Wolves that were flying through the air sensed the sudden impending crisis, and immediately stopped and looked around vigilantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHairy #2! Hairy #3!\u201d shouted Wu Chen excitedly.</p><br/><p>The young man from the Crow Soldier Tribe looked shocked. The other two Tribe members next to him also looked around in surprise at the approaching Greenwood Wolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought my luck would look so good,\u201d said the young man after a moment, laughing loudly. \u201cSo many excellent Greenwood Wolves to present to Master! In his heart, I will definitely surpass Second Elder Brother and First Elder Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even as his laughter rang out through the woods, a savage howl ripped through the air in the forest. It circled about in all directions, along with an arrogant aura which immediately caused the neo-demons in the area to begin to tremble. Even the Cultivators of the Crow Scout and Crow Soldier Tribes felt their minds trembling.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a white blur appeared, shooting with such speed that nothing was visible but whiteness. The white blur slammed into seven or eight of the Zombie Wolves, whereupon booms echoed out along with bloodcurdling shrieks. The Zombie Wolves all exploded, sending a stinking black mist roiling out in all directions. The world-shaking white blur then transformed into a White Wolf who stood there with utmost grandeur, as if he could look down upon all Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>The White Wolf\u2019s body wasn\u2019t very large, and even looked somewhat weak. But the instant he appeared, all of the other Greenwood Wolves immediately fell prone, emanating an air of allegiance.</p><br/><p>The White Wolf raised its head up and howled, and as it did, the other Greenwood Wolves joined him. Within an instant, the entire wolf pack was howling in unison, causing everything in the area to shake. Even the trees were trembling. The Zombie Wolves began to quiver, and their listless eyes filled with veneration and submission.</p><br/><p>\u201cA White Wolf King!!\u201d This was what each and every one of the observing Cultivators was thinking at the moment.</p><br/><p>White Wolf King!</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s facial expression immediately changed, and he began to breathe heavily. He stepped back a few paces, looking at the White Wolf King, his eyes filling with unprecedented madness and avarice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Wolf King!! Who could have imagined that this place would have a Wolf King! Once Master finds out, he\u2019s going to be delighted!! It doesn\u2019t matter who this Wolf King belongs to, now that it has appeared, it belongs to me!\u201d The young man roared as he suddenly stretched out his right hand, within which he held a jade slip. Using the fastest speed he could muster, he crushed it, which sent a message to his Master, Gu La.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao, who was still observing the proceedings with Spiritual Sense, finally gave a cold snort and then strode forward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even\u2026 Big Hairy.</p><br/><p>By now, Big Hairy was a totemic Sacred Ancient. However, he was only level 11 not level 12. Nor had his Cultivation base reached that legendary realm of Heavenly Neo-demons similar to the Spirit Severing stage.</p><br/><p>Instead, he was at the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage. In the great lands of the Western Desert, there are a total of 12 levels of neo-demon growth. According to historical records, the peak was generally considered to be level 11 neo-demons who were similar to the Spirit Severing stage. Level 12 neo-demons, also called totems, were comparable to the Dao Seeking stage. Neo-demons like that had only existed during the golden age of the Western Desert. The true power of a totemic Sacred Ancient had almost everything to do with the faith that was exercised in it.</p><br/><p>However, what goes up must come down. That was all in the past. After the Apocalypse hit the Western Desert, even great Tribes with Spirit Severing Patriarchs could not compare to how they had been before, during the heyday of the Western Desert. Therefore, level 11 Heavenly Neo-demons were similar to the great circle of the Nascent Soul Stage. Level 12 were similar to Spirit Severing, and possessed the power to bestow totems. Most Western Desert Cultivators were not even aware of this; only Tribal Greatfathers and High Priests understood the matter thoroughly.</p><br/><p>It was the same with Meng Hao in his role as totemic Sacred Ancient. With more Tribe members, there was more faith power, which allowed him to grow stronger.</p><br/><p>When the Western Desert Apocalypse came, life force was exterminated. Neo-demons were affected, and even more so, totemic Sacred Ancients. All totemic Sacred Ancients were weakened severely. Thankfully, Meng Hao had nourished Big Hairy and the others using Demonic Qi. Because of this, Big Hairy and the other totemic Sacred Ancients of the Golden Crow Black Dragon Clan developed the ability to bestow totems earlier than usual.</p><br/><p>They were able to do so at level 11!</p><br/><p>Big Hairy stayed for quite some time in the Violet Sea. He let out yips and calls as he looked for Meng Hao. He ended up with nothing, and left sadly.</p><br/><p>One day, another old man came. His face was grim, and his Cultivation base was not clear. Meng Hao could see that he was surrounded by incredible killing intent as well as an ancient, archaic aura. The intensity of it caused Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base to tremble.</p><br/><p>The man looked at the sea for a long time before frowning. In the end, he gave a cold laugh and then left.</p><br/><p>That man was none other than the tenth patriarch of the Wang Clan!</p><br/><p>Many people came. One day it was a woman in a red garment. Although she was incredibly beautiful, her face was filled with a frown. Her gaze swept about and then she looked down at the Violet Sea. She happened to be directly above the position in which Meng Hao was sitting cross-legged at the bottom of the sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you for years only to find out that you\u2019re here, in the midst of Demonic Transmigration!?!? Instead of working hard at being a Cultivator you decide to become a Demon? What the hell?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy, you moron?! Are you a man or not? First you take advantage of me, and then just go on your merry way? How irresponsible could you be? I, I, I\u2026 What the hell am I gonna do in ten years? What the hell is a lone badass bitch gonna do by herself in the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane!?!?\u201d There was nothing the red-robed woman could do other than grind her teeth. A few days later, she left angrily, clearly incredibly frustrated.</p><br/><p>A few more days passed, whereupon a woman came who wore a long green garment. She was pretty, and emanated a medicinal aura. She hovered in mid-air for a long time as she looked out at the sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, where are you exactly\u2026?\u201d she said softly. A very long time passed, she sighed and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>Before making her way off into the distance, she looked at the Violet Sea and then threw a medicinal pill down into the waters. This was a medicinal pill that she had personally concocted, and it represented her personal Dao of Alchemy, which had reached its peak.</p><br/><p>The medicinal pill fell into the water and dissolved.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Meng Hao felt something tugging at his heart. A tremor ran through his corpse, which was still sitting cross-legged on the seafloor.</p><br/><p>Another dim morning, a white-robed woman flew out across the sea from the direction of the Black Lands. She seemed neither angry nor happy, but rather, cold. She hovered quietly in mid-air, looking around at the sea. After a long moment passed, she slowly looked down at the violet seawater.</p><br/><p>What she didn\u2019t know was that she was actually looking at Meng Hao himself.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao couldn\u2019t quite grasp that the woman he was looking at was\u2026 Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>Being separated from someone is not the most helpless feeling in the world. Even worse is when you are directly in front of the person you miss, but can\u2019t actually see them.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Meng Hao\u2019s emotions trembled. That tremor ran through the entire Violet Sea. Moments ago it had been calm, but now, huge waves rolled across its surface.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing stared blankly down at the sea. For an entire year.</p><br/><p>During that year, she did not leave, but instead passed the time on a mountain-island. Every day, she looked out at the sea. Every day, Meng Hao looked back at her.</p><br/><p>During that year, Meng Hao continuously tried to remember who she was\u2026.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing wasn\u2019t aware of it, but in order to prevent her from being disturbed, Meng Hao made the area surrounding the island a zone in which life was not permitted. No Western Desert Cultivator could step foot into that area.</p><br/><p>It became a world that belonged only to Meng Hao and Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>A year later, a jade slip that Xu Qing possessed began to glow brightly. It seemed to be a summons. The glow flickered with increasing frequency, causing her to rise to her feet. She looked quietly out at the sea before turning to leave.</p><br/><p>The instant that she turned, a single teardrop rolled out from the corner of her eye and fell down into the sea.</p><br/><p>The teardrop merged into the seawater.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuyan left behind a medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing left behind a single teardrop.</p><br/><p>The medicinal pill caused Meng Hao to tremble. The tear, however, dropped into the sea and then caused the Western Desert Violet Sea to suddenly explode with unprecedented tsunami waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was she\u2026?\u201d Meng Hao asked himself. As he asked himself this question, the tsunami waves grew even more shocking. They rolled across the entire Western Desert Violet Sea, causing all the Cultivators in the Black lands to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy am I in such pain\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat have I forgotten\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was that woman\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho were all those people\u2026?\u201d As Meng Hao murmured to himself, storm winds raged and huge waves battered the surface of the sea. Roaring filled the air.</p><br/><p>Even as he asked himself these questions, Meng Hao let out a soundless, frenzied roar. As the teardrop moved down, the seawater parted to make way for it, creating something almost like a path.</p><br/><p>The teardrop proceeded unobstructed. It was as if it were being guided down into the depths of the Violet Sea. It continued down into the blackness toward where Meng Hao\u2019s corpse sat cross-legged.</p><br/><p>The teardrop neared Meng Hao and then landed onto his pale, bloodless lips. Then, it seeped into his mouth and transformed into a deep bitterness.</p><br/><p>The bitter tear spread out within Meng Hao\u2019s mouth, causing his corpse to suddenly move. An indescribable aura suddenly exploded out from him.</p><br/><p>As it did, the tsunami waves on the sea grew even more astonishing!</p><br/><p>After a long, long time passed, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes suddenly\u2026 opened!</p><br/><p>When his eyes opened, a roaring sound filled his mind. Countless memories, countless images, poured out, filling his mind, restoring him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath is not the end of life, but rather, the beginning\u2026. I am Meng Hao!\u201d After a long moment passed, he looked quietly out at the black seafloor. However, what he saw with his eyes was actually the sky above the surface of the ocean.</p><br/><p>He was awake! He was enlightened!</p><br/><p>In the instant of his enlightenment, he realized that ten years had passed since that teardrop fell. As for how much time had passed since he began his process of understanding the Violet Sea, a full\u2026 one hundred and fifty years had passed!</p><br/><p>Without that teardrop, Meng Hao would not have awakened. He would have continued his Demonic Transmigration. Ten thousand years later, he would have awoken. When that happened, the world would have had one less Cultivator. The legacy of the Demon Sealers would have been severed. At the same time, a new Greater Demon of Heaven and Earth would have appeared!</p><br/><p>The instant he woke up, the great waves on the surface of the Violet Sea calmed. All of the specters sank down into the seawater, vanishing from the world above.</p><br/><p>The entire Violet Sea became deathly quiet.</p><br/><p>Down in the depths of the Violet Sea, Meng Hao\u2019s life force once again burned vigorously. After a few days passed, he had already surpassed his previous pinnacle. Before, such intense life force would have provoked an incredible reaction from the will of extermination in the violet Sea. He would have been completely and thoroughly exterminated.</p><br/><p>But now, the Violet Sea did nothing to get rid of him.</p><br/><p>That was because Meng Hao was the Violet Sea. And in many ways, the Violet Sea\u2026 was Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>He slowly lifted up his right hand. As he did, the entire Violet Sea quietly sank down a full thirty meters.</p><br/><p>The majestic Western Desert Violet Sea sank down thirty meters, making more of the island-mountains visible.</p><br/><p>This scene caused all of the Cultivators in the Black Lands to be completely shocked. One group of people after another came out to investigate. However no one could figure out or even guess why the sea had suddenly sunk by thirty meters.</p><br/><p>The real reason was because that was how much seawater was needed to congeal a violet character for water on the back of Meng Hao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>This mark signified that Meng Hao could control the power of death of the Violet Sea. This was his\u2026 Water-type totem tattoo!</p><br/><p>As he looked down at his hand, Meng Hao waved it, causing the seawater that surrounded him to part, creating an opening three hundred meters wide. Within that opening, no water existed.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a bloody light sparkled on his index finger. This light represented the life force of the blood totem as it magically made its appearance.</p><br/><p>Under Meng Hao\u2019s control, a ghost image of the blood totem slowly appeared on the back of his right hand. Slowly it began to fuse with the Violet Sea totem, which represented death.</p><br/><p>As they fused, as the ghost images sprang up, Meng Hao\u2019s body suddenly shook.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood represents life!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Violet Sea represents death!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen life and death collide, that is extermination. When life and death mix together, it is the source of all life\u2026. This is my fifth element Water!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt represents life, and also represents death. It is a source of extermination, and also a source of life!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Water-type totem will form my first Nascent Soul. Its color is a combination of violet and blood. It\u2026 is my fifth element, Water, my Blood-Violet Nascent Soul!\u201d His eyes shone with a strange light as he suddenly clenched his right fist. The Water-type totem tattoo disappeared. It didn\u2019t dissipate, but rather sank down into Meng Hao\u2019s body, branding itself onto his Perfect Gold Core.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered with determination. As of this moment, he suddenly looked, not like a Cultivator, but like an alchemist!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, he was Grandmaster Pill Cauldron!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy body is the pill furnace\u2026.\u201d he murmured. His blood began to circulate rapidly. Tremors ran through his flesh, making it seem as if he truly had become a great furnace of Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Inside of him, there was no flame, but rather\u2026 his life force!</p><br/><p>Using his life to concoct pills, and using alchemy to concoct a Nascent Soul, he would create his own Five Colored Nascent Soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy heart is the pill formula!\u201d He placed his hands onto his knees and closed his eyes. Within his heart existed a method that had never been used before, and probably never would again, to begin his Cultivation base breakthrough. This was a way to acquire a Perfect Nascent Soul even though he had never been told the true method for forming such a Nascent Soul.</p><br/><p>This was Meng Hao\u2019s pill formula!</p><br/><p>\u201cConcoct a Five-Colored Nascent Soul! The first step is to make not one but five Nascent Souls!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s body filled with a roaring sound as he used pill concocting techniques to begin to refine his own body.</p><br/><p>After fusing the Water-type totem onto his Perfect Gold Core, Meng Hao used his own body as the pill furnace and his heart as the pill formula, to be able to concoct a Nascent Soul.</p><br/><p>This was something that had never occurred in the Cultivation world before Meng Hao. It was his own path, his own way of practicing cultivation. It was a road that would reach the peak of perfection!</p><br/><p>Time passed. Suddenly, cracking sounds could be heard from his Perfect Gold Core. Fissures appeared. Moments later, his Perfect Gold Core suddenly exploded, transforming into a primordial Qi vortex.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a Blood Violet glow could be seen!</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Sofoklis Schortsanitis</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

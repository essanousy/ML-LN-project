All of them hungered to pay homage to the Great Tang, and to stroll through Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>The military strength of the Great Tang was incredible, and even possessed garrison states populated entirely by cultivators. There was no location in the mortal worlds of South Heaven in which people did not pay homage to the Great Tang.</p><br/><p>It was no surprise that there were great numbers of sects and clans in the Eastern Lands. Their strength and influence exceeded that of any of the powers that existed in the Northern Reaches, Southern Domain or Western Desert. In terms of sects alone, there were nine major ones.</p><br/><p>In addition, there were seven great clans with vast numbers of disciples, followers, and clan members. The Eastern Lands were a flourishing place with countless Chosen, many of whom were famous even in the other continents.</p><br/><p>Even the Imperial family had its own Daoist teachings and doctrines, which they used to exercise control over the whole continent. Emperor Tang himself possessed a powerful cultivation base, and although he rarely made public appearances, his power held sway over the all the land.</p><br/><p>Chang\u2019an was the center of it all, and was encircled by ten defensive fortresses. Of those, eight belonged directly to the Great Tang, with the remaining fortresses belonging to two different clans.</p><br/><p>One was the Fang Clan and the other was the Ji Clan!</p><br/><p>Just because they occupied the defensive fortresses didn\u2019t mean that these two clans bowed their heads to the power of the Emperor. They were independent, and in fact, above everyone else. It was the other sects and clans who bowed their heads to them!</p><br/><p>This was especially true of the Ji Clan. The Heavens themselves belonged to the Ji Clan, so who was there that could possibly surpass them?</p><br/><p>As for the Fang Clan, they had vast and powerful resources at their disposal. Although they were only a subdivision of the main clan, they were still deep and immeasurable. Of course, in compliance with their clan rules, they respected the Great Tang, and would protect the Tang Dynasty for all time. After all\u2026 the Tang Emperor was surnamed Li! [1. The character in the surname of the Tang Emperor is , which is a very common name. It's th same as Lord Li, previous ruler of the Ninth Mountain as well as the Li Clan, which we know exists on Planet North Reed, and whose auxiliary branch was destroyed by Meng Hao]</p><br/><p>However, despite the fact that these were the circumstances surrounding Meng Hao at the moment, they were far distant from his daily life.</p><br/><p>Currently, Meng Hao sat cross-legged in a courtyard in the Fang Clan, underneath an ancient tree. Sitting next to him was a trembling little crocodile who was oh-so-cautiously looking at the man sitting cross-legged in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>That man was none other than Meng Hao\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er,\u201d he said, \u201cyour future path is your own to tread. As to what you do and how you do it, your mother and I can assist from the sidelines, but will not help you directly. The most important thing you should focus on is\u2026 Immortal Ascension!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already halfway into true Immortality, lacking only that final half step. Then you will be in the Immortal Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chance to gain true Immortality is something that comes along once every 10,000 years. There are many cultivators of the elder generation, and even current Chosen, who are willing to suppress their own cultivation bases, all for the chance to get that true Immortal destiny.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring this 10,000 year period, the true Immortal destiny lies in the lands of South Heaven. However, since you weren\u2019t born on South Heaven, it cannot belong to you. The location of your true Immortality is on Planet East Victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe simplest way to achieve true Immortal Ascension is by means of the rarely seen Immortality Illumination Vine. Use that to gain enlightenment regarding the meaning of Immortality, and you can achieve true Immortal Ascension.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Immortality Illumination Vines are rare, it is not impossible to acquire them. In fact, there are enough that, during each 10,000 year period, most powerful sects manage to produce one or two true Immortals. However, the vines are only effective in the 1,000 years after the true Immortal destiny appears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second way to achieve true Immortal Ascension is very difficult, and that is to acquire the Immortal destiny that appears once every 10,000 years, and use it to tread the path to true Immortality. That is the path your master Pill Demon must take.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of these types of Immortals are true Immortals.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master is going about it the most difficult way. If he succeeds, then he will most certainly be taken away by some powerful organization and made a Conclave disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, when the time comes for your master\u2019s true Immortal Ascension, the lands of South Heaven are going to be a very lively place. The various Chosen of other sects and clans who have left South Heaven will return to fight for their chance. When that time comes, I will act as Dao Protector for your master.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for you, after you help your master transcend his tribulation, then you will go to Planet East Victory. Father has already prepared an Immortality Illumination Vine for you there!</p><br/><p>\u201cInitially, using the Immortality Illumination Vine produces a slightly inferior result. However, cultivation isn\u2019t always dependent on the first steps, and using that method can also lead you to great glory.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there are only these two ways to achieve true Immortal Ascension?\u201d asked Meng Hao, a bit surprised. \u201cWhy could the Resurrection Lily achieve it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t flowers and flowers aren\u2019t people. The path of the Resurrection Lily can be learned from, but if cultivators try to follow it, they will find it very difficult to realize their Dao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a third path which is not dependent on any of the planets or any Immortal lands. It is to achieve true Immortality\u2026 by your own power!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a very rare thing. According to the legends, only Patriarch K\u1e63itigarbha, the Earth Store Bodhisattva of the Fourth Mountain [1. Ksitigarbha was previously mentioned in chapter 702], has ever traveled that path. Other than him, no one has ever pulled it off. When he did, it caused all of the Immortal qi in the Mountain and Sea Realm to surge and swirl towards him, such that everyone knew about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs to how to tread that path, even I don\u2019t know.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s father shook his head. Even though he had a high opinion of Meng Hao, he didn\u2019t think it was possible for him to tread that third path. \u201cFor now,\u201d he said, looking at Meng Hao sternly, \u201cfocus on my nine sword forms. Make sure you understand them thoroughly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sadly, Meng Hao\u2019s older sister Fang Yu was still unable to emerge from secluded meditation. Meng Hao\u2019s return had caused many in South Heaven\u2019s Fang Clan to act with great caution. They were unfamiliar with him, and didn\u2019t dare to even try to probe him for information.</p><br/><p>Word of Meng Hao\u2019s deeds in the Southern Domain had long since spread amongst the cultivators of the vast Eastern Lands.</p><br/><p>When it came to the Ji Clan, there quite a few people there who were currently vacillating nervously\u2026. Those people were the Chosen who owed Meng Hao spirit stones from back in the Demon Immortal Sect. There were Chosen from other sects in the Eastern Lands as well, all of whom had mixed feelings about Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>As they sat there beneath the tree, Meng Hao\u2019s father waved his hand, causing a scintillating command medallion to fly out toward Meng Hao. It came to rest in front of him, where it floated in the air. It only took a glance for Meng Hao to be able to sense the vast ancientness pulsing off of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion,\u201d said Meng Hao\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, when you leave the lands of South Heaven, you could return home to the clan to continue your cultivation, or you could use this medallion to join the Ninth Mountain\u2019s Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite and cultivate their Daoist magic!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Ninth Mountain and Sea, there are many Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temples. Whenever one of those temples opens its doors, it will attract a lot of attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, only the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite of the Ninth Mountain continues to pass on its legacies. Many cultivators practice cultivation among them, making them one of the most superlative Daoist Societies in the Ninth Mountain. By the time any Daoist rite temple is revealed to the world, it will already long since been left untended and abandoned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the most powerful of Chosen can join the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite. Lord Li joined, as did Lord Ji. The Fang Patriarch of that era also joined. Their requirements for accepting disciples are very strict. However, if you possess an Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion, then you can join directly as a Conclave disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake good care of this medallion!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe medallion has another function. I happened to discover an Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple. Although it\u2019s deserted, if you enter it, the temple will automatically come to life\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccept the medallion\u2019s guidance, and you can cultivate enlightenment in the temple. It will greatly improve your chances at achieving Immortal Ascension.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, after the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple comes to life, others will detect it. Therefore, Chosen from the sects and clans of the other planets will come to try to seize the luck and good fortune in the temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat they will be most interested in obtaining is the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will be your chance to hone your skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked closer at the medallion, and inside, he could just barely make out an Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple, filled with countless figures practicing cultivation. There was also a glowing Immortal who was giving a sermon regarding the Dao.</p><br/><p>The music of a great Dao floated through the air, which Meng Hao couldn\u2019t hear clearly. However, it caused him to perceive an unusual sensation of being bathed in an celestial radiance, with Immortal qi swirling around him.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, he trembled, and recovered his senses. He quickly reached out to take hold of the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep the Dao medallion safe, and achieve Immortal ascension. Those are my tests for you. If you can\u2019t accomplish these things\u2026 then it would be better for you to stay here with me and your mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can fight with all your might against the Chosen of the sects and clans of the other planets, if you can protect this medallion, if you can achieve true Immortal Ascension, then\u2026 your mother and I will be confident that you are ready to leave us and forge your own glorious future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao clutched the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion, looked up at his father, and slowly nodded.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s father looked back and then smiled. It was a smile full of love and encouragement.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave this crocodile here. When you achieve Immortal Ascension, it will be the mount you can use when you leave. Hao\u2019er\u2026 you did not have me and your mother at your side in this lifetime. You\u2019ve reached your current stage by relying only on your own efforts!</p><br/><p>\u201cLikewise, I believe that in the future\u2026 you won\u2019t need help from me or your mother. Your path will lead you much further\u2026 and you can do it on your own!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath and then bowed to his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow go. We cultivators don\u2019t focus on the trifles in life. Besides\u2026 you\u2019ve grown up.\u201d His father\u2019s smile grew wider. From the look in his eye, you could see that he wished for his son to be a dragon, to truly succeed. It was a look similar to the one Meng Hao had seen in the eyes of Ke Yunhai.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao rose to his feet and caught sight of his mother approaching. She walked up to him, adjusted his clothes, and then looked at him lovingly. She clearly did not wish to part with him, and was also worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said with a bashful smile.</p><br/><p>When she saw his smile, his mother shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same smile you used to make when you were little,\u201d she said, \u201cwhenever you were about to get into mischief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s smile grew even more bashful. He chatted a bit more with his parents, then clasped hands and bowed. Giving them a final deep look, he turned and made his way off into the distance.</p><br/><p>They watched him leaving, and Meng Hao\u2019s mother sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is how cultivators were meant to practice cultivation,\u201d his father said calmly. \u201cHao\u2019er is a dragon amongst men. His path\u2026 is his own to tread!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still worried though\u2026\u201d his mother said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was without our help that he stepped halfway into true Immortality,\u201d his father replied proudly. \u201cHe\u2019s grown up, and given his personality, it would be impossible for him to stay with us here for 100,000 years. Since we can\u2019t leave, he needs to temper himself with appropriate challenges. Moreover\u2026 in all the Ninth Mountain and Sea, there truly are few who have achieved a cultivation base like his at such an age!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just afraid that this Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite Temple that you\u2019ve activated will attract people above the Spirit Realm\u2026\u201d his mother said softly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s father laughed coolly. \u201cFang Xiufeng makes the rules here on Planet South Heaven, and I say\u2026 if anyone above the Spirit Realm dares to enter, I\u2019ll just kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao left the Fang Clan, the first time he had done so since arriving. The streets were busy, and as he looked around at the bustle, it was clear that this was a city of mortals. There were cultivators present too, but they didn\u2019t dare to act superior to others. Apparently, cultivators were not permitted to act aggressively in the lands controlled by the Great Tang.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked up, and off in the distance he could see an enormous city. That was\u2026 Chang\u2019an.</p><br/><p>At first glance it looked ordinary, but when Meng Hao circulated his Immortal qi, he was shocked to find that there were ninety-five gold dragons spiraling through the air above the city. Occasionally they would let out shocking roars. Of course, it was something that everyone else could not see or hear.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the ninety-five dragons merged together into a figure sitting there in midair. When Meng Hao looked at it, the figure seemed to sense his gaze, and then looked back at him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a majestic voice filled Meng Hao\u2019s mind. \u201cThe son of Elder Brother Fang. As expected, you are quite extraordinary. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. Allow me to bless you with some qi reserves to incorporate into your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ninety-five dragons each spit streams of draconic qi, which merged together into an extremely lifelike golden dragon. It turned into a golden beam of light that shot through the air and merged into Meng Hao. As it swirled through his body, an incredibly refreshing feeling filled him.</p><br/><p>Cracking sounds could be heard from inside him, and an otherworldly aura seemed to be washing over him, like a baptism. It almost seemed as if he had formed a resonance with the land, and could now see various Daoist magics and natural laws wherever he looked.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s mind trembled as the figure looked away from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor Tang!\u201d gasped Meng Hao. He was certain that the person just now\u2026. was the Emperor of the Great Tang!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lands of South Heaven are filled with hidden dragons and crouching tigers\u2026.\u201d he thought. \u201cThe Emperor of the Great Tang has an unfathomable cultivation base. Is South Heaven the only place like this, or are the other planets similar? Perhaps only people in the same Realm as father can understand such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao clasped hands and bowed toward Chang\u2019an. Then, he transformed into a beam of colorful light as he followed the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion\u2019s guidance toward the temple. His second true self became the shadow beneath him, following him wherever he went.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had just appeared outside the city, and was about to head off into the distance, when his eyes glittered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard mom say that the Ji Clan isn\u2019t too far away from here\u2026.\u201d A bashful smile appeared on his face and he rubbed his bag of holding. He still had many promissory notes inside, some of which were written by Chosen of the Ji Clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to go settle accounts\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao thought with a dry cough. He took out a jade slip which continued a detailed map of the vast Eastern Lands. After examining it for a moment, he headed toward the Ji Clan\u2019s fortress\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

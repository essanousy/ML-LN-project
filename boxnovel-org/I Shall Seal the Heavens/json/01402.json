He flung it out, simultaneously sending his mind and will into it. Rumbling sounds echoed out as the Mountain and Sea Realm Grand Aegis appeared, surrounding, not Meng Hao, but the butterfly!</p><br/><p>It enveloped the butterfly, protecting it along with all of Meng Hao\u2019s relatives and friends. Then Meng Hao took a step forward and transformed into a beam of light that shot directly toward the icy 9-Essences Paragon.</p><br/><p>As they closed in on each other, performing incantation gestures the whole time, the domineering aura radiating off of Meng Hao grew even more intense, and he looked more ferocious than ever. Moments later, the intense sounds of battle filled the void of the Vast Expanse.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out, and then they separated. A split second later, they were once again locked in fierce combat. Meng Hao waved his hand to summon numerous mountains. He transformed into an azure roc, which radiated a bizarre energy that made it seem like a true Demon as it screamed in for an attack.</p><br/><p>Shockwaves blasted out in all directions. Grinning, Meng Hao performed an incantation gesture and unleashed Hexing magic. The Eighth Hex erupted out, and the wave of his finger caused the icy woman to stop in place for a moment. In that instant, Meng Hao's Seventh Hex appeared.</p><br/><p>Next was the Sixth Hex, the Fifth Hex, and the Fourth Hex. A world of black and white appeared, which encompassed countless ages of reincarnation. A great Dao of Time appeared that could transform the Vast Expanse. The icy woman\u2019s face flickered, and the white-robed, white-eyebrowed old man took a threatening step forward.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the old man\u2019s voice rang out in all directions: \u201cDestroy the World-Butterfly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding Immortal God cultivators hesitated for a moment before resuming their charge. Under the leadership of the 8-Essences Paragons, they began to batter the shield.</p><br/><p>Booms echoed out as Meng Hao single-handedly fought against two 9-Essences Paragons. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and as he fell back, the Lightning Cauldron appeared above his head. Electricity danced as he switched positions with one of the Immortal God cultivators. When he reappeared, he was right next to an Immortal God Imperial Lord. His hand instantly shot out, and the Imperial Lord let out a scream as Meng Hao\u2019s fingers stabbed into his eyes. Meng Hao unleashed curse power to imprison his soul, then dug his eyes out of his head, grabbed his body, and lifted it over his head.</p><br/><p>Next, he physically threw him toward an 8-Essences Paragon who was charging toward him from off to the side. A boom rang out, and the 8-Essences Paragon was shaken, but only a moment later, he was closing in on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off!\u201d he roared, unleashing divine abilities and Essence power. However, in the same moment, Meng Hao vanished yet again, appearing unexpectedly next to another 8-Essences Paragon. His aura was different this time, brutally violent, and as he pounced on the Paragon, black fog roiled out, covering the two of them.</p><br/><p>A bloodcurdling scream rang out, and even as the icy Paragon hastened over, the fog faded away. Meng Hao was nowhere to be seen, but the 8-Essences Paragon\u2019s remains were left behind, mangled and ripped apart as if by a wild animal.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao appeared off in the distance, holding the man\u2019s Nascent Divinity in his hand. Eyes flickering with crimson light, he popped it into his mouth and began to chew slowly. Then he reached out with his right hand, and the Vast Expanse trembled as the Battle Weapon suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>It was not pitch black this time, but rather, bright red. In fact, if you looked closely, you would see that Meng Hao\u2019s hair was no longer black, but violet!</p><br/><p>Furthermore... the roots of his hair were actually red!</p><br/><p>Despite the vast force arrayed against him, Meng Hao had killed several people in quick succession, which left the icy female Paragon very grim-faced. To the majestic Immortal God Continent, killing a 9-Essences Paragon wasn\u2019t anything incredibly difficult, and yet Meng Hao was so bizarre and multifarious that it was impossible to lock him down.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that a beam of light brimming with insane destructive power shot out from the Immortal God Continent, piercing through the Vast Expanse, cleaving apart the starry sky, destroying natural laws as it bore down on Meng Hao. The fluctuations from the beam of light were otherworldly, causing Meng Hao\u2019s eyes to widen. It was impossible to tell what had emitted the light, but it didn\u2019t seem to have come from a cultivator. The bizarre sensation it gave off was palpable.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Meng Hao performed a Form Displacement Transposition and vanished. The position he had just occupied in the starry sky suddenly shattered and transformed into a black hole. All of the cultivators who were nearby were instantly transformed into ash.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered toward a certain mountain peak on the Immortal God Continent, upon which was a vicious-looking war chariot. What made him frown even more was that somewhere there on the Immortal God Continent, he could sense... two more 9-Essences auras!</p><br/><p>It was at this point that another beam of light rocketed out, and this time it was heading, not for Meng Hao, but for the Mountain and Sea Realm Grand Aegis!</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as the Grand Aegis collapsed. And yet, in that same moment, Meng Hao performed a double-handed incantation gesture.</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain and Sea Seal!\u201d he said, causing the collapsed fragments of the Grand Aegis to sweep together and envelope the nearby Immortal God cultivators, where it turned into a shocking sealing mark!</p><br/><p>It even enveloped the cold woman and the white-haired old man.</p><br/><p>In the moment the seal formed, Meng Hao flashed into motion, returning to the butterfly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d he said. The butterfly\u2019s wings flapped, and as they sped along, Meng Hao looked back coldly at the Immortal God Continent, and the group stuck in the sealing mark. Flicking his sleeve, he sent the Mountains and Seas out in front of him in formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen someone hits you,\u201d he growled, \u201cyou hit back!\u201d</p><br/><p>A mysterious, incisive light appeared in his blood-colored pupils as he said, \u201cThe Dao is in My Heart....\u201d</p><br/><p>A light shone out like an icy blade!</p><br/><p>He raised his hands into the air and splayed them wide. A strange resonance could be heard in his voice, which caused the Nine Mountains and Eight Seas to suddenly increase dramatically in size!</p><br/><p>The Mountains grew larger, and the Seas churned. In the blink of an eye, the Nine Mountains in front of him were completely and utterly shocking, the ultimate depictions of any type of mountain!</p><br/><p>Each and every one of those mountains was a world unto itself, and radiated a sharp and incisive will.</p><br/><p>Years and years ago, Paragon Nine Seals used this same precious treasure to destroy the Heaven Trampling Bridge, to fend off the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm, and prevent those two powers from harming the survivors from the Paragon Immortal Realm.</p><br/><p>Now, in Meng Hao\u2019s hands, the Mountain and Sea Realm erupted... with the true power which it held within!</p><br/><p>Nine majestic Mountains were like nine swords that could shake Heaven and Earth! As the power of those mountains radiated out, the faces of the crowds from the Immortal God Continent fell.</p><br/><p>The cold woman trapped in the Mountain and Sea Seal looked on with constricting pupils, and the white-robed old man was clearly shocked. Immediately, they began to confer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Shui Dongliu\u2019s legacy contains the secret to controlling the Mountain and Sea Realm! Impossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack when Nine Seals died, he managed to send out a discarnate soul. He used his death to completely rock us, shaking our foundation to the point where we couldn\u2019t destroy the Mountain and Sea Realm. However, even at that time, we were able to join forces to destroy the magic he used to control the Mountain and Sea Realm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone who can truly control the Mountain and Sea Realm, that terrifying conglomeration of the fury of the Immortals! Not even Nine Seals\u2019 discarnate soul within Shui Dongliu was able to do anything other than exercise basic control!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as these two Paragons were reeling in shock, Meng Hao waved his hands, and his eyes flickered with intense focus, with a deep longing for the Mountain and Sea Realm, and with a deep hatred for the enemy!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Will is in My Eyes!\u201d His cultivation base erupted with power as the second sentence left his mouth. Simultaneously, the Eight Seas began to churn and seethe, and in the blink of an eye, they had become seas of stars which shook the Vast Expanse. They merged with the Nine Mountains to erupt with... indescribable pressure!</p><br/><p>The instant that pressure appeared, the hosts from the Immortal God Continent coughed up mouthfuls of blood, and even the land mass itself began to quiver. Mountains fell into ruin, and the courses of rivers altered!</p><br/><p>One city after another on the land mass collapsed into rubble!</p><br/><p>It was like the end of days!</p><br/><p>This was the true power of the precious treasure that was the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had not acquired this magical control method from the legacy of Shui Dongliu. That legacy had given him ordinary magical techniques from the Mountain and Sea Realm, and nothing that could help him exceed Shui Dongliu.</p><br/><p>But what he did have was... the Seal the Heavens Incantation!</p><br/><p>When he had unleashed that incantation within the Mountains and Seas, it led to incredible power. However, at that time, the Mountain and Sea Realm had still been under the general control of Shui Dongliu, which made it difficult for Meng Hao to use it. In fact, back then, it was almost useless. It was only later that he came to understand that the true Seal the Heavens Incantation could only be used properly after he had become the Lord of the Mountain and Sea Realm and returned the Mountains and Seas to the form of a magical item!</p><br/><p>Like now!</p><br/><p>This was the Seal the Heavens Incantation!</p><br/><p>It had been created by his Master in the Eighth Mountain and Sea, a divine ability or Dao that was the laughing stock of the masses. And yet, that magical technique was no simple divine ability, it was actually... a control method for the entire Mountain and Sea Realm!</p><br/><p>The correct way to use it was not against a cultivator, but on the Mountain and Sea Realm itself, to unleash its truly deadly aspects as a precious treasure!</p><br/><p>No one knew what experiences the Noble Ran had gone through to create this particular divine ability. After its creation, he had spent the rest of his life extolling its virtues. In the end, he passed it on to Meng Hao, who eventually proved that... the Seal the Heavens Incantation was not a worthless incantation!</p><br/><p>After the true war of the Mountain and Sea Realm broke out, Meng Hao never ran into the Noble Ran again. In fact, now that he thought back, it seemed as if... the Noble Ran hadn\u2019t even been present during the fighting.</p><br/><p>However, now was not the time to contemplate that matter. Meng Hao waved his arms, and the Mountains and Seas erupted with shocking pressure. He took a deep breath as he suddenly understood what it meant to say... the Dao is in My Heart!</p><br/><p>That Dao referred, not to Essence, not to natural laws, nor to magical laws. It was shapeless, and existed in the heart, and it didn't matter if you were Demon or Immortal. It was all the same!</p><br/><p>The Dao is one\u2019s heart, and however deep your heart was, that was how profound your Dao would be!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he now understood that \u2018the Will is in My Eyes\u2019 referred to the outer manifestation of the Dao. Whatever he looked at... had a Dao, or was a Dao!</p><br/><p>\u201cI Shall Possess the Mountains and Seas....\u201d He flicked his sleeve, and the Nine Mountains rumbled as they tilted on their side to point toward the Immortal God Continent!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

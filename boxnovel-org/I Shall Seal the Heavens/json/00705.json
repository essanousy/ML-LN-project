It actually did have the air of a sect, although many of the people were actually engaged in deadly combat. The sound of mutual slaughter was intense, and the glow of blood glittered up radiantly.</p><br/><p>If disciples from other great sects in the Southern Domain came here, they would be quite out of sorts. However, as far as Meng Hao was concerned, it was just like the Reliance Sect, so it actually felt quite familiar.</p><br/><p>He stuck to his remote corner of the sect, ignoring everyone else. No one else cared to come to him, either. It was as if they didn\u2019t even notice his existence. Because of Meng Hao\u2019s experiences, a single glance was all it took for him to perceive the deep-seated feelings behind the cold expressions on their faces and the scorn in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he thought, his face calm. He wasn\u2019t the type of person who enjoyed rowdiness. He didn\u2019t care about mountain peaks and fighting over resources. He was happy to be left alone to practice cultivation in peace and quiet.</p><br/><p>At noon, Meng Hao rose to his feet. He casually felled some of the trees in the area and built a log cabin. Naturally, people noticed this, and everyone stared in shock, especially the people who harbored strong hostility toward him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually building a log cabin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like he\u2019s really made up his mind to immerse himself in cultivation. But, does he really think that this will allow him to remain separate from sect affairs?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Up on Mount Ironblood, middle-aged Chang Yi saw what was going on, and frowned.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Meng Hao opened his eyes and looked out of his log cabin. Approaching slowly on foot was a somewhat emaciated looking middle-aged man. His body emanated the ancientness of time, and he was very thin. There was a ruthlessness to him, which presently seemed to have been replaced by complex emotions.</p><br/><p>The ripples of a Nascent Soul cultivation base spread out from him, and when Meng Hao saw him, many different feelings filled him, along with a sense of reminiscence.</p><br/><p>As he walked up slowly, his appearance caused many of the surrounding disciples to be shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Elder Brother Wang Youcai!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Elder Brother Wang doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, look at his expression. Something strange is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>People watched as Wang Youcai walked up to Meng Hao and looked at him silently. Clearly, he was recalling past times.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, and neither did Meng Hao. As they looked at each other, both of them seemed to be recalling Mount Daqing.</p><br/><p>That was the place where they both began to walk their path of cultivation, and also the place\u2026 where Meng Hao and Xu Qing met.</p><br/><p>After a long moment passed, Wang Youcai clenched his jaw as if to some inner pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you drink?\u201d he asked. With that, he sat down cross-legged and tossed a flagon of alcohol over to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao caught it, and immediately took a long drink. The alcohol burned as it slid down his throat. It felt almost like a knife stabbing into his guts.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Fugui told me about what happened with Elder Sister Xu,\u201d Wang Youcai said, keeping his voice low.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded and took another drink. His earliest memories of the cultivation world contained the group from Mount Daqing: Wang Youcai, Fatty, and Dong Hu.</p><br/><p>The four of them, including Meng Hao, were taken by Xu Qing to the Reliance Sect. Later, Dong Hu and Wang Youcai apparently had a falling out, and Wang Youcai disappeared. Regarding Dong Hu, his disposition changed completely, and as for Fatty\u2026. Well, out of all four of them, he seemed to have ended up far, far happier than the rest.</p><br/><p>Wang Youcai and Meng Hao sat together drinking silently, each one wrapped up in various memories. Of course, there was one thing that existed in both of their memories, and that was Mount Daqing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you ever run into Dong Hu again?\u201d Wang Youcai suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot after I left the State of Zhao,\u201d replied Meng Hao. He looked at Wang Youcai, hesitated for a moment, and then asked, \u201cBack then, the two of you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis body was physically weak, so I ended up caring for him like a younger brother,\u201d replied Wang Youcai, his voice cool. \u201cI would help him when it came time to haul water, and if people picked on him, I would handle it. In the end\u2026 he shoved me off a cliff because of a pearl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t respond. He picked up the alcohol flagon and took a big mouthful.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful of Chang Yi,\u201d continued Wang Youcai. \u201cIn fact, be careful of everyone in the Blood Demon Sect\u2026. There is no such thing as camaraderie here. The only thing that matters is who is more vicious!\u201d With a sigh, he rose to his feet and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d said Meng Hao, looking up at him.</p><br/><p>Wang Youcai didn\u2019t reply. He knew that what Meng Hao said was true; he shouldn\u2019t have come. The entire sect currently viewed Meng Hao with hostility, which meant that after leaving, he would most certainly face some difficulties. And yet, he came anyway.</p><br/><p>In fact, in almost the same instant that Wang Youcai rose to leave, Chang Yi stood there on the first mountain peak, a cruel smile on his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, they know each other!\u201d He flicked his sleeve and flew up into the air. \u201cFollow me, Junior Brothers!\u201d Immediately, nineteen beams of light rose into the air from Mount Ironblood and teleported down toward the bottom of the mountain. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make a move, Meng Hao,\u201d he thought. \u201cYou can sit there and refuse to provoke anyone. But now, the time has come to see exactly what amazing abilities you have, and why the hell you deserve to be the Blood Prince.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll test you out and see exactly how profound you are. If you don\u2019t fight back hard, then I\u2019ll just keep pushing until you reach the boiling point. After all, I have plenty of methods to deal with you. If you fight back hard\u2026 well, that\u2019s what I\u2019m waiting for.</p><br/><p>\u201cHopefully, you\u2019ll end up killing someone, and then my Masters will have every right to throw you into the torture chamber!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Wang Youcai emerged from Meng Hao\u2019s log cabin, twenty beams of light, including Chang Yi, shot down toward the very same area.</p><br/><p>Their appearance on the scene instantly caught the attention of the Blood Demon Sect disciples in the surrounding forest. Their expressions turned lively; they knew that an entertaining drama was about to unfold.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, back on the second mountain peak, the seven apprentices of the Spirit Severing Patriarch were all paying very close attention. Merciless gleams glittered brightly in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow we\u2019ll see exactly how profound this Meng Hao actually is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Chang Yi has an irascible personality. A whole day hasn\u2019t even passed and he already reached the limits of his patience!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s behaving like that, this is a good opportunity to test out Meng Hao. We\u2019ll be able to learn a bit about him by observing how things turn out.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the fourth mountain peak, three figures wreathed in flames watched on coldly from outside their Immortal\u2019s caves. The disciples of the fourth mountain peak were also watching on, expressions of derision clear on their faces.</p><br/><p>One among their number was a young man, who held a magical fan in his hand. He exuded an air of coldness as his lips twisted into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cChang Yi really couldn\u2019t hold on very long,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good, though. This is only a test; presumably, there won\u2019t be too much of a ruckus. It does have to be said, though, that Chang Yi is quite the fool.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a single day, and Meng Hao was appointed directly by the Patriarch. If someone really tries to subdue him, the Patriarch will intervene. It\u2019s too bad a good opportunity will have been lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the fifth mountain peak, the pretty young woman\u2019s eyes were fixed on the scene that was playing out, and she was starting to get excited. As for the hunchbacked old man, he casually looked over to watch.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, do you think this Meng Hao will really be subdued if the matter turns serious?\u201d Her eyes flickered with viciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cSerious?\u201d said the old man, his tone one of pride in his own wisdom. \u201cOh no, it won\u2019t get serious. It\u2019s a small matter. At worst, the harmony will be broken temporarily. You have only practiced cultivation for a short time, but Master has lived for far too long, and has seen many things. I\u2019ve watched things like this play out too many times.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just watch, the dispute regarding Meng Hao being the Blood Prince is just starting. It will take quite some time before it gets resolved\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On Mount Blood Demon, Patriarch Blood Demon rested in the Blood Pond. His eyes opened, and he looked over at what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 what will he do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Shiqi was also paying close attention, and a profound glint could be seen in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the whole Blood Demon Sect was looking in Meng Hao\u2019s direction. They all knew that this was his first time making a true public appearance in the sect. They all wanted to see exactly how he would respond to the test.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was only a test\u2026.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was calm as he looked at the twenty beams of light approaching from Mount Ironblood. It didn\u2019t matter if it was Chang Yi up in front, or the other nineteen of his followers. They were all the same to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Of the nineteen, eight were Nascent Soul cultivators, and eleven were at the great circle of Core Formation. As for Chang Yi, he had the highest cultivation base, the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Youcai!\u201d cried out someone from the group. The sound of the voice was like springtime thunder echoing out in all directions.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even bother with any pretenses; as soon as the voice rang out, its speaker turned into a red beam of light that shot out from the group toward Wang Youcai, filled with killing intent. Blood-colored magical items also flew out, whistling through the air. Three of the Nascent Soul Cultivators directly shot toward Wang Youcai.</p><br/><p>As for everyone else, they surrounded the air, their eyes filled with coldness and derision as they eyed Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of Chang Yi, whose eyes were sinister and cold as he hovered in mid air, his hands clasped behind his back. He looked at Meng Hao, waiting to see what he would decide to do. If Meng Hao didn\u2019t make a move, then it meant allowing Wang Youcai to be seriously injured. If Meng Hao did make a move, well\u2026 that was exactly what Chang Yi was waiting for!</p><br/><p>He firmly believed that in that moment, his Masters would appear and subdue Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out, causing Wang Youcai\u2019s face to turn grim. He immediately teleported forward to escape, and at the same time transmitted an urgent message to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything! This is Chang Yi. His Masters control the torture chamber, and you can\u2019t give them any reason to subdue you down. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d Even as Wang Youcai teleported forward, Chang Yi laugh coldly and waved his right hand. Seven tiny flags flew out, which rapidly expanded in mid-air to form seals that forced Wang Youcai back to the ground. Wang Youcai\u2019s face flickered as the three Nascent Soul Cultivators closed in, their faces filled with vicious killing intent.</p><br/><p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Booms echoed out, and blood poured out of the corners of Wang Youcai\u2019s mouth. He retreated, performing an incantation gesture that caused a divine ability to appear. At the same time, he shouted, \u201cElder Brother Chang Yi, I\u2019m a disciple of the second mountain peak, do you really dare to attack me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second mountain peak?\u201d replied Chang Yi, laughing. An arrogant expression appeared on his face as he glanced in the direction of that very mountain.</p><br/><p>Immediately, a voice echoed out from the second mountain peak. \u201cAs is customary, we won\u2019t interfere with the matters of the torture chamber. Elder Brother Chang, if Wang Youcai violated any rules, then you can do anything you wish. However, if he didn\u2019t violate any rules, then you\u2019ll be held responsible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Youcai\u2019s face grew grimmer as he looked at the incoming vicious Nascent Soul cultivators. He gritted his teeth, and was just about to employ one of the sect\u2019s restricted techniques to stimulate his Qi and Blood, when suddenly Meng Hao stood up. His expression was calm as he arrived next to Wang Youcai with a single step and gripped his shoulder.</p><br/><p>In the moment that he appeared, all eyes instantly fixated on him. Everyone from all of the five mountain peaks were watching.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of Chang Yi, who was inwardly going wild with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Prince,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re really going to interfere with torture chamber matters?\u201d He suddenly glared angrily at the other Mount Ironblood cultivators, who looked a bit hesitant. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you apprehended him yet?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cultivators gritted their teeth. Ignored Meng Hao, they advanced on Wang Youcai, their killing intent radiating about intensely.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that a shocking coldness suddenly appeared in Meng Hao\u2019s placid eyes.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Caleb Gleason, Zaid Soboh, Matthew Gessen, Byron Seto, and Matthew Gessen</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

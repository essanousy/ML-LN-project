She looked at Meng Hao silently, then lowered her gaze to the Spirit Fruit in her hand. After a long moment, she took a few steps back to lean up against the rock wall. She put the fruit in her mouth and ate it. A smile appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what exactly you mean when you say \u2018next life,\u2019\u201d she said with a light smile. \u201cAll I do know is that this Xu Qing of whom you speak is truly blessed.\u201d The wind suddenly tousled her hair, which she tucked behind her ear.</p><br/><p>Having finished speaking, she sat down and took a deep breath, then closed her eyes. Without any further words, she concealed within her eyes the enlightenment she didn\u2019t wish anyone else to see.</p><br/><p>She was an intelligent young woman, more intelligent than most other young women her age.</p><br/><p>From the way Meng Hao spoke, she could tell that he was referring to something related to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you and Xu Qing have an agreement to meet here,\u201d she murmured to herself, \u201cif she is destined to awaken within my body. Well then\u2026 I am willing to let that happen. I am willing to let you reunite with her here.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this moment, in the Demon Immortal Sect, during that split second in which she, of her own initiative, expressed such willingness, a rare change suddenly occurred.</p><br/><p>The Cultivators of South Heaven entered the Second Plane via host bodies. That was something that didn\u2019t require the consent of the host bodies themselves. After all, they had long since perished, and were nothing more than corpses on the outside.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 despite having been dead for so many years, the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane was special. Their spirits existed within the plane, and those spirits\u2026 if they were willing, could allow the outside Cultivators to completely take over their identity.</p><br/><p>Normally speaking, the techniques cultivated by the host body that they had gained enlightenment regarding, would be available to the South Heaven Cultivators as vague memories. They could use them, but could not take them away.</p><br/><p>It was like they were\u2026 outsiders.</p><br/><p>Except now, something different was happening. A change was underway that would produce something more like\u2026 an insider.</p><br/><p>The young woman\u2019s eyes were closed hard, and did not reopen.</p><br/><p>Everything was quiet. Meng Hao did not speak. He sat there cross-legged, looking up into the sky, waiting silently as time slipped by, waiting\u2026 for Xu Qing to wake up.</p><br/><p>Under his protection, nothing would happen to her, and no one would be able to harm her in any way. Meng Hao did not cultivate any techniques. He simply watched as the sunlight grew brighter in the sky. He looked around at the world of the ancient Demon Immortal Sect. Within his heart, the feeling of being a part of this place only continued to grow stronger.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt very envious of Ke Jiusi.</p><br/><p>He envied the family that Ke Jiusi had in this Sect. He envied all of his Brothers and Sisters. He envied the fact that Ke Jiusi had friends who would even kill for him. However, what he most envied was\u2026 that Ke Jiusi had such a good father.</p><br/><p>Ke Jiusi had a father who would bend over backward for him. He would work hard behind the scenes to erase the scrawlings that were the errors committed by his son. He was a father whose tolerant heart could accept any errors on the part of his son.</p><br/><p>And then, there was the white hair that filled his temples, and the death aura that he did his best to hide. Clearly, Ke Jiusi\u2019s father, Paragon of the Fourth Peak, was reaching the end of his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all just a play\u2026 and I\u2019m merely observing it,\u201d he thought. \u201cBut if that\u2019s true, then why do I want so much to become a part of the play, to become one of the people here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought of Ke Yunhai, and his stern gaze. Deep within that gaze, Meng Hao could sense a deep love that somehow made him lose his way. He thought back to Mount Daqing and Yunjie County. He thought back to his own childhood, and his own father and mother.</p><br/><p>Back then, he had been very happy, completely without a care in the world. But then the violet wind swept through Yunjie County, and everything vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is my father\u2026?\u201d he thought. As he gazed off into the sky, his mood sank. \u201cIs he still alive in the world? Does he know that his image still exists in my thoughts, in my memories?\u201d</p><br/><p>Submerged as he was in this sea of bitterness, Meng Hao produced a flagon of alcohol from his bag of holding. He lifted it to his lips and took a long drink.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad. Mom. Do you know that I\u2019m already starting to forget what you look like\u2026? It\u2019s been too many years. The image of your faces is starting to fade away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be that way. It\u2019s just what happens when time passes. Sometimes I want to hold on to those images, but I can\u2019t\u2026. I really envy Ke Jiusi\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao took another long drink of alcohol. It burned as it slid down his throat and into his anxiety.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao rarely slipped into a mood such as this. Starting the year his father and mother went missing, he\u2019d had no choice but to learn to be independent and strong. In this moment, though, because of Xu Qing, he had started thinking of the past. The memories of the Southern Domain, of Mount Daqing, and the relationship between Ke Jiusi and Ke Yunhai, all struck a chord within him. He couldn\u2019t help but think of Yunjie County, his happy childhood, and of his parents.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt as if he understood this tyrannical silkpants, Ke Jiusi. If Ke Jiusi really was still alive, then perhaps after all the tens of thousands of years, this dead ancient Demon Immortal Sect was the only place where he truly existed.</p><br/><p>He had never left. He was here to protect the Sect, to protect the Fourth Peak. Year after year, for an eternity, he was here to protect that Pure Land which existed in his heart.</p><br/><p>Most likely, the people around Meng Hao in the Demon Immortal Sect would never be able to imagine what Ke Jiusi would be like tens of thousands of years later.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe saw his father die. He watched his Sect become desolate. He looked on as his friends perished. In the end, he bore witness to the absolute destruction of the Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were him, what would I do\u2026?\u201d Thoughtfully, Meng Hao took another long drink. Evening was falling. An entire day had slipped by while Meng Hao wallowed in his emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe Jiusi sent me back here, to the era in which his father was dying. I think I understand\u2026 what he wants me to do.\u201d A look of enlightenment filled his eyes. He was just raising the alcohol flagon to take another drink when suddenly, a hand reached out from behind him to grasp his wrist lightly.</p><br/><p>As he turned his head, he felt someone embracing him tightly from behind. It felt just like the embrace from back by the Rebirth Cave, that embrace which was filled with the fear of loss.</p><br/><p>A smile broke out on Meng Hao\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t speak, but rather, allowed the beautiful woman behind him to embrace him. She pressed up against his back, as if she were trying to hear his heart beating.</p><br/><p>It was as if the only way she could prove that everything that was happening was real\u2026 was to hear his heart beating. Perhaps everything around them was a dream, but within that dream, the two of them had each other.</p><br/><p><em>I thought that when I saw you, I would have the world. I didn\u2019t know that within your dreams, you already had me.</em></p><br/><p>It was evening, and soft, orange light shone down onto the Fourth Peak, creating dark shadows on the opposite side of the mountain. Within those dark shadows were two people, embracing each other.</p><br/><p>They seemed to wish that time could stop forever. Their longing, their promise, were no longer like sand floating in the wind.</p><br/><p>A long time passed. Soon, the sky was dark. Meng Hao looked at the woman in front of him. The features he saw were different from Xu Qing's, but the soul was the same ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Because her soul was different, her facial features suddenly seemed to change a bit. She grew colder, less timid and nervous. She grew more simple. Less a stranger.</p><br/><p>She was Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>She was not intelligent like Han Bei. She was not incredibly beautiful like Chu Yuyan. She was Xu Qing. Simple and cold, like her heart. When she loved someone, she didn\u2019t need a reason. She only needed to know that somehow, that person was part of her.</p><br/><p>She wore the robe of an Outer Sect disciple and had long, beautiful hair. Her features were delicate, and although they couldn\u2019t be described as immaculately beautiful, they caused Meng Hao to think of that one person who was always in his heart\u2026 Elder Sister Xu.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing looked at Meng Hao, and a smile broke out on her face. A warmth could be seen in her pupils, as well as longing, and over a hundred years of memories. She looked at Meng Hao, and recalled their past.</p><br/><p>He carried the look of someone who had experienced great changes, and was no longer young and inexperienced.</p><br/><p>She gazed at Meng Hao for a long time. She didn\u2019t ask why he was here, nor did she seem surprised to see him here as she woke up.</p><br/><p>It was as if to Xu Qing, it didn\u2019t matter where she saw Meng Hao, or when. Any time she encountered him, she felt at ease, calm.</p><br/><p><em>Surrounded by bustling crowds, you look at me, I look at you, and we smile at each other.</em></p><br/><p>It was as if such a meeting had happened a million times for her already. It was as if from beginning to end, even that time in the Violet Sea, she had complete and utter faith that the two of them would in fact meet again one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot surprised?\u201d said Meng Hao, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I be surprised?\u201d she said, shaking her head and smiling. \u201cYou made a promise, and we had an agreement... to meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao looked at her, much of the bitterness in his heart faded away. His smile grew wider. This was Xu Qing. Plain and simple Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>She believed that they would meet again. Because of their agreement with each other, it didn\u2019t matter when or where it was, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised. It was all because of her firm belief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been many years\u2026. Have you been well?\u201d she asked softly. To her, Meng Hao might be a few years younger than her. However, despite the fact that more than a hundred years had passed, his image never left her heart.</p><br/><p>She could never forget that time she watched as he leaned out over the edge of the cliff, holding down a rope to Wang Youcai and the others, and at the same time, making fun of them.</p><br/><p>She could never forget what he looked like in the ancient Blessed Land, when he stood protectively in front of her during her moment of helplessness.</p><br/><p>Even more unforgettable was the time in the Black Sieve Sect when, after merging with Matriarch Phoenix, she had woken up. Meng Hao had been about to leave the Sect when he turned and smiled at her.</p><br/><p>Never in her life would she be capable of forgetting what happened outside the Rebirth Cave.</p><br/><p>If secrets could count as accumulated emotions between two people, then she and Meng Hao had many. There were many secrets that only the two of them could understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to the Black Lands, and the Western Desert,\u201d Meng Hao said with a smile. As the evening wind blew Xu Qing\u2019s hair into disarray, Meng Hao reached up and grasped her wrist.</p><br/><p>She lowered her head, a slight smile tugging at her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d she said, looking back up at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied, grinning.</p><br/><p>The soft moonlight shone down on the two of them, covering them like a layer of silver sand. The beautiful wind lifted up their long hair.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing looked at Meng Hao, then suddenly gaped in astonishment as she realized something. Her eyes filled with a strange look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026. Why\u2026 why do you look the same as before?\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Jefferson Bell</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

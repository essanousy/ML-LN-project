That\u2019s what started this whole thing.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered with coldness as he proceeded onward. Off to the side, Patriarch Rubicund whistled toward him.</p><br/><p>The man gave a cold snort, then increased his speed. \u201cStealing auction items is a high crime! Then you used depraved tricks to steal our wealth! You\u2019re a disgrace to the Black Lands, which earns you the death penalty!\u201d Behind him, Patriarch Pockmarks\u2019 eyes were darkly sinister. Further back, the rest of the Cultivators were all looking at Meng Hao with intense killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Cultivation base is in the late Core Formation stage, and yet after three days you\u2019ve been unable to catch up to a paltry early Core Formation Cultivator like me? How do you have the face to raise such a ruckus?\u201d Meng Hao also increased his speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure know how to run your mouth! It won\u2019t be long before I help you to understand what it\u2019s like to live a life worse than death!\u201d As he spoke, Patriarch Rubicund used some unknown technique to cause his face to suddenly grow purplish-black. His speed then increased by several times as he shot toward Meng Hao. At this speed, he would catch up in the space of just a few breaths.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreedy to the bones,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. \u201cConsidering your Cultivation base, do you have any face whatsoever?\u201d The parrot opened its mouth and a gale force wind sprung up along, with a shocking roar.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s speed increased. Facing up against the fierce wind, Patriarch Rubicund and the rest of the hundreds of Cultivators behind him could do nothing except howl in rage as their speed decreased.</p><br/><p>Currently, none of them had any magical items. Some of them were able to use secret techniques or Core Qi to close some of the distance between them and Meng Hao. However, a single breath from the parrot would immediately increase the gap. Therefore, no matter what they did to increase their speed, it did no good and they were unable to catch up with Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>During the three days, their rage only continued to grow more and more intense.</p><br/><p>Seeing the distance between them and Meng Hao grow once again, the killing intent in Patriarch Rubicund\u2019s heart spread to fill his entire body. The Patriarch Pockmarks was exactly the same, as were all the hundred Cultivators behind them.</p><br/><p>After three days of travel, Meng Hao could tell from the landmarks and regions he was passing that he was getting close to his Immortal\u2019s cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering how pissed off they are, are you sure your idea will work?\u201d said Meng Hao to the parrot, frowning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019ll work,\u201d replied the parrot boastingly. \u201cYou can never go wrong when you listen to Lord Fifth. Just lead these people into our lair. You can go practice Cultivation and leave everything else to Lord Fifth!\u201d It patted its chest and proudly continued, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the more people there are, the more chaotic the aura will be, and the easier it will be to use that technique I mentioned to delay the Heavenly Tribulation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The frown remained on Meng Hao\u2019s face. During his three days of travel, he had discussed with the parrot the matter of delaying the Heavenly Tribulation. He knew that the method was a type of deception, using a variety of miscellaneous auras to confuse Heaven and Earth. It was like spreading a gauze over the face of the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><br/><p>Therefore, these pursuing Cultivators, more than a hundred of them, would actually be of some use to Meng Hao and the parrot. However, as to whether the technique would succeed, and as to whether the parrot would really be able to hold off the crowd, well, Meng Hao wasn\u2019t completely certain.</p><br/><p>Even as he was thinking about these things, his eyes suddenly flashed. He looked ahead of him, and his eyes narrowed; there he could see a dozen or so beams of prismatic light whistling toward him. He was being blocked in!</p><br/><p>There was a blockade up ahead, and people pursuing him from behind. The people up ahead merely had to delay him for a bit, and then the pursuers would arrive. He was encircled.</p><br/><p>Behind him, Patriarch Rubicund and many of the others all of a sudden looked very excited. Obviously, they had used various methods to call for help earlier, and the result was this group of people up ahead preparing to block Meng Hao\u2019s way.</p><br/><p>Among the approaching Cultivators was a middle-aged man of the mid Core Formation stage. Core Qi floated above his head, but it appeared to be a muddle of colors; clearly the man had just recently cultivated it. Furthermore, he obviously had a Mixed Core.</p><br/><p>His expression was grim as he sized up Meng Hao. Then, he performed an incantation sign, which caused the Core Qi to transform into the shape of the head of a wild beast. It roared as it shot forward.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever as he lifted his hand and then pointed a finger down toward the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cRighteous Bestowal!\u201d A strange light flickered in his eyes; in an instant, ghost images sprung up from the ground everywhere. Now, he could see wisps of Demonic Qi which were invisible to everyone else. They shot toward Meng Hao and then began to circle around his body.</p><br/><p>The invisible pulsating aura which surrounded Meng Hao coalesced into a phantom. It was blurry, but after taking shape, it emanated Meng Hao\u2019s aura.</p><br/><p>Next, he waved his hand toward the group of Cultivators up ahead, causing the phantom to shoot toward them.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t want to split his attention to control the phantom, so as soon as it neared the group of Cultivators, he said, \u201cBurst!\u201d</p><br/><p>The phantom immediately exploded.</p><br/><p>A huge boom rocked Heaven and Earth. What everyone else saw was Meng Hao simply pointing toward the group Cultivators, after which blood sprayed from their mouths. A few people even directly blew up. The face of the Core Formation Cultivator fell, and he retreated seven or eight paces. However, he was powerless to fight back against what seemed like an invisible gale force wind that slammed into him and sent him tumbling backward.</p><br/><p>Astonishment filled his face as he was knocked head over heels, blood spraying out of his mouth. Before, he had assumed that even if his opponent was extraordinary in some way, he was with a group of a dozen or more people. Furthermore, all he had to do was delay him, which should be no problem.</p><br/><p>And yet Meng Hao had used an unknown technique to simply point a finger and then unleash some sort of incredible power. The man\u2019s heart felt cold as he watched Meng Hao approach; he didn\u2019t dare to do anything further to stop him.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao shot forward, immediately passing the scattered group of Cultivators who had been attempting to block his path.</p><br/><p>This scene caused the hundred or so pursuing Cultivators to feel completely shocked. All of them slowed, hesitating. However, when they thought about their empty bags of holding, and the expression \u2018strength in numbers,\u2019 then their killing intent once again billowed up. Not a single one retreated; they immediately shot in pursuit of Meng Hao, stringing out in a line that resembled a sharp arrow.</p><br/><p>Time passed. After three or four more breaths from the parrot, Meng Hao finally caught sight of the short mountain and the Immortal\u2019s cave. He also saw the group of more than a hundred Cultivators living around the mountain.</p><br/><p>When they caught sight of him and his pursuers, looks of vigilance and uneasiness appeared on their faces.</p><br/><p>The instant they began to feel uneasy, the parrot\u2019s shrill voice blared out, \u201cOkay children, Lord Fifth is here with some guests. Get in formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Meng Hao transformed into a beam of light which shot directly toward the fissure in the side of the mountain.</p><br/><p>As he did, the parrot loosened its grip on his shoulder and flew into the air. The meat jelly bell attached to its foot made dainty clinking sounds.</p><br/><p>When the more than one hundred local Cultivators heard the parrot\u2019s voice, tremors ran through their bodies. Gritting their teeth, they immediately rose to their feet. Then, they began to run in a particular order and fashion, coiling around the short mountain as they did so.</p><br/><p>A strange expression appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face as he used Spiritual Sense to watch all of this. He thought back to what the parrot had called a Celestial spell formation, and all the running training it had made the Cultivators do. He hesitated for a moment, then clenched his jaw and sat down cross-legged. He pulled out the medicinal plants needed to make the Perfect Gold Core Pill and began to concoct.</p><br/><p>He would make the Perfect Gold Core Pill, consume it, and then replace his Violet Core with a Gold Core. Furthermore, he would go all out, breaking through from the early Core Formation stage into the mid Core Formation Stage, all using his Perfect Gold Core!</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that happens, I will delay the Heavenly Tribulation and cultivate Core Qi. If all goes smoothly, then when I leave this Immortal\u2019s cave\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glowed with a frigid light. \u201cI\u2019ll help them to experience true deadly pursuit!\u201d He took a deep breath and then produced the copper mirror, which he used to duplicate some of the medicinal plants he needed.</p><br/><p>Before, he would have had to be very careful, considering his lack of Spirit Stones. Furthermore, using the ultra high-grade Spirit Stones would have been far too distressing. Now, however, he had more than a million Spirit Stones in his bag of holding; therefore, he felt free to use them without being miserly.</p><br/><p>In addition to that, Meng Hao felt supremely confident in his Dao of alchemy, far more so than Chu Yuyan had been back when she concocted the Perfect Foundation Pill. Using the mysterious legacy technique of the East Pill Division, along with his alchemic flame, Meng Hao was more than seventy percent confident that he would succeed.</p><br/><p>Outside the Immortal\u2019s cave, Patriarch Rubicund, Patriarch Pockmarks, and all the others approached, faces filled with murder. They saw Meng Hao disappear into the short mountain, the detestable parrot flying around squawking, and the group of Cultivators running in circles around the mountain.</p><br/><p>All of it caused them to gape in shock for a moment, and then begin laughing uproariously. As more people arrived, they too looked at the Cultivators running in circles, and laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are these people doing? Have they gone insane?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they jogging for exercise?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of Cultivators are they? They\u2019re really losing face for the Black Lands!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sneering ridicule of the Cultivators who had been pursuing Meng Hao caused embarrassed looks to appear on the faces of the Cultivators on the ground. However, they didn\u2019t dare to stop running. This was the only Celestial magic that the parrot had taught them, which drew its power from people running.</p><br/><p>According to what the parrot said, this technique was incredibly, unbelievably amazing. It was supposedly the ultimate spell formation in all Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome come,\u201d cried the parrot excitedly as it soared through the air. \u201cEveryone put your voices together\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The more than one hundred local Cultivators hesitated for a moment. However, nearly a year of practicing had created a virtual instinct. As soon as one person cried it out, everyone joined together to shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave faith in the Lord Fifth, gain eternal life! When the Lord Fifth appears, who dares to cause strife!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their voices joined together and echoed out in powerful waves. As the sound rose up, so did a wind. It was hard to tell whether the wind was started because of the running, or because of their shouting.</p><br/><p>In any case, the wind caused the area fifty kilometers around the Immortal\u2019s cave to suddenly become blurry. The blurriness was faint, so faint, in fact, that no one noticed it all, not even Patriarch Rubicund, who was of the late Core Formation stage, or the others of similar level.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill everyone!\u201d cried Patriarch Pockmarks. \u201cDon\u2019t even leave a blade of grass left alive!\u201d His words floated through the air lightly, but were filled with shocking killing intent. As they rang out, the Han River Sect disciples behind him, as well as many of the other random Cultivators, transformed into prismatic beams. They shot forward, their faces twisted viciously, their killing intent billowing. It was with ultimate derision that they prepared to vent their venomous hatred of Meng Hao.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

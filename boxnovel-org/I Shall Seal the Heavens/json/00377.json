It was the same one that had appeared when he reached Foundation Establishment and Core Formation!</p><br/><p>When the young woman from the Fang Clan saw the mark, her expression had changed. Instead of striking Meng Hao, she changed the direction of her blow.</p><br/><p>Images from all of these scenes played out in Meng Hao\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>And now\u2026 the mark had appeared again! [1. As a recap, this mark first appeared in chapter 100. It was seen most recently when he met Fang Yu from the Fang Clan in chapter 309. The events mentioned in which she saw the mark were in the following chapter, chapter 310<span>]</span></p><br/><p>He felt an intense heat radiating out from the back of his hand. It turned into a stinging pain that spread throughout his body until he was completely submerged in it. Finally, he let out a roar.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a sort of boundless life force seemed to be released from within the pain. It spread through him, healing his body. Furthermore, he could sense that it also gave him the chance to accept the fourth legacy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an archaic voice sounded out in his mind. It was boundlessly ancient, transmitted from ten thousand years in the past. It did not come from the mark on his hand, but rather, the Frigid Snow Clan legacy!</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the third generation Grand Dragoneer of the Frigid Snow Clan. My name is Qi\u2019nan Ning\u2026. I accepted the legacy of the second generation in the frigid cold of midwinter. I gained enlightenment on Mount Agarwood. I severed my Dao on Midwinter Plain. Before me, the Clan was called Agarwood. After me, it was called Frigid Snow\u2026. Clan members, engrave upon your minds: our power was fading, we could not support ourselves. Sadly, we were forced to leave the Western Desert.\u201d [1]</p><br/><p>As the voice spoke, an image of a mountain appeared in the pupil of each of Meng Hao\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>This was Mount Agarwood. The same moment that the images of the mountains appeared, up above in the sky, the breach slashed by the Lightning Blade began to split open. An enormous mountain suddenly began to descend.</p><br/><p>The size of this mountain was difficult to describe; the power it radiated was boundless and shocking.</p><br/><p>Just barely visible on the mountain were two glowing characters that made up the word Agarwood. As the mountain descended, the ground shook and began to crack and sink.</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Pit disappeared, and the Lightning Blade shattered. A massive sinkhole appeared on the battlefield, which turned into an enormous basin. The two Nascent Soul Cultivators from the Black Lands Palace coughed up blood. Their masks shattered, revealing the shocked faces of two old men. Immediately, they began to flee.</p><br/><p>The two Nascent Soul Cultivators from the Western Desert also coughed up blood as they were tossed backward. The shock that filled their hearts was impossible to describe with words.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi\u2019nan Ning\u2026. Ten thousand years ago, he was one of the three most powerful figures in the Western Desert. He\u2026 he was actually a member of the Frigid Snow Tribe?! How is that possible?! How come the ancient records never mentioned anything about this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQi\u2019nan Ning\u2026..\u201d The black-robed Cultivator\u2019s face flickered. Behind him, Hanxue Zong stared mutely. He suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, a look of disbelief in his eyes. How could he ever have imagined that the Patriarch of his own bloodline was actually a member of the famous Agarwood Clan from ten thousand years ago!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy change the name of the Clan?\u201d Hanxue Zong didn\u2019t have any time to think about it further. The black-robed Cultivator, eyes glistening with concentration, lifted his right hand and was about to wave it when suddenly, his face flickered yet again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! How can this kid have so much latent talent? The legacy isn\u2019t concluded yet\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ground rumbled as the enormous Mount Agarwood descended. Meng Hao floated there, his eyes shining with a bright light. As of this moment, he knew with absolute certainty this time, he really was experiencing an incredible amount of good fortune.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Severing brands remained in his mind. He couldn\u2019t employ them except during the branding process, but\u2026 when it came time for his own Spirit Severing, it would be vastly easier.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, after he reached Spirit Severing, the power he would be able to wield would be unprecedented, and he would be able to use any of the brands that existed in his mind.</p><br/><p>Such good fortune was normally something he would never have access to; only Spirit Severing Cultivators should be able to acquire such things.</p><br/><p>However, due to chance occurrences, the good fortune fell upon him. As such, he would do everything within his power to acquire even more!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe legacies of the sixth, fifth, fourth and third generations\u2026 are not enough,\u201d thought Meng Hao. \u201cI must acquire the second generation legacy. I will not squander such good fortune. I\u2019ll use it to secure my future rise to prominence! I\u2019m not sure why the mark appeared on the back of my hand again just now, but now I have hope. I possess all the requirements, so therefore, I will definitely open up the full potential of these legacies! It doesn\u2019t matter if the second generation is Frigid Snow Clan or Agarwood Clan. Second generation legacy, come out!\u201d Meng Hao lifted his head up and roared. Light shone up from his eyes as he floated there in mid-air, his hair whipping about. The sight of it was shocking and strangely beautiful!</p><br/><p>Within his head, a ceaseless rumbling sound could be heard. This sound exceeded that of the sixth generation tempest, swept away the fifth generation ten thousand dragons, crushed the fourth generation Yellow Springs, and shattered the third generation Mount Agarwood. It transformed into eminently domineering, supreme noise.</p><br/><p>The sound seemed to be echoing out in response to Meng Hao\u2019s expression of desire.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Qi\u2019nan Tian, second generation Grand Dragoneer of the Agarwood Clan. With the legacy power of the Patriarch, I controlled the power of the four seasons. I am not an Immortal, but by controlling the seasons, I silenced the Western Desert. I am\u2026 the Heaven of the Western Desert!\u201d [2. The \u201cTian\u201d in his name means \u201cHeaven\u201d or \u201csky\u201d]</p><br/><p>The voice was common, but it echoed out with a soaring, overbearing aura. The domineering air emanated out from Meng Hao, changing everything. The patch of sky directly above Mount Agarwood suddenly looked bizarre in appearance.</p><br/><p>Within this patch of sky could be seen resplendent Spring flowers, a light Summer rain, dancing, frost-covered Autumn leaves, and bitter Winter snow!</p><br/><p>This patch of sky contained all four seasons, and its power spread out over everything, transforming the land, causing everything to tremble. The two Nascent Soul Cultivators from the Black Lands Palace coughed up blood, and their bodies began to wither as they slipped into unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>Blank expressions covered the faces of the two Western Desert Nascent Soul Cultivators. They couldn\u2019t feel or sense anything; their life force was slipping away.</p><br/><p>Hanxue Zong\u2019s body shook and his mind reeled; he coughed up a mouthful of blood as his body suddenly aged. Up ahead of him, the black-robed Cultivator\u2019s pupils constricted, and his eyes filled with terror and astonishment.</p><br/><p>Without even thinking about it, he backed up, panting as he stared at the Four Seasons Sky above Mount Agarwood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a Spirit Severing brand, that\u2019s\u2026 a Dao Seeking brand!! Dammit, the Frigid Snow Clan actually had a Dao Seeking expert! How is that possible? A Dao Seeking expert in the Western Desert\u2026. Agarwood\u2026. Agarwood\u2026.\u201d The black-robed Cultivator\u2019s face fell as he suddenly lost confidence in his ability to seize the legacy. \u201cIf I can\u2019t seize this legacy now, then it will never belong to me. Even if I kill this punk later, I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it. Dammit! How come this kid is so troublesome!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>A twisted look of madness appeared in his eyes. He had been preparing for this day for a long time, and needed the good fortune of the Frigid Snow Clan legacy for his Third Severing. As such, he wasn\u2019t willing to give up so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive generations. So, you can support five legacy generations. Dammit, there\u2019s only six in total. Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s going to acquire them all! This kid\u2019s greed is something rarely seen in the world! People as greedy as this deserve to die! I won\u2019t let you continue!!\u201d The black-robed Cultivator\u2019s heart buzzed. As of now, he no longer looked down on Meng Hao, but rather, was convinced that Meng Hao would be able to acquire the full legacy. Even though it seemed unbelievable, he didn\u2019t have time to think about the matter too much. Eyes glittering with killing intent, his body flashed. Drawing on the full power of his Spirit Severing Cultivation base, he shot in Meng Hao\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what price I have to pay, I will stop you!\u201d Determination filled his eyes as he slammed into the Four Seasons Sky, and Mount Agarwood.</p><br/><p>An indescribable pressure weighed down on his entire body, causing the black-robed Cultivator to shake, and his flesh to begin to evaporate.</p><br/><p>\u201cBREAK!\u201d he roared. The evaporation of his body suddenly slowed. He gritted his teeth and shot forward toward Meng Hao. In the blink of an eye, he was three hundred meters away from him!</p><br/><p>Those final three hundred meters would be extremely difficult to cross.</p><br/><p>Actually, he knew that the best way to handle this situation would be to wait until Meng Hao couldn\u2019t hold on any longer, and self-detonated. As far as interfering with the branding process, the best would be to take some action while at a distance. The most stupid method was what he was doing right now, which was to personally approach Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he had no other options. Interfering from outside did no good, and waiting for Meng Hao to self-detonate wasn\u2019t possible. Therefore, he had to move in as he was doing now.</p><br/><p>As rumbling sounds continued to fill the air, Meng Hao completely ignored the incoming black-robed Cultivator. Breathing heavily, he looked up into the sky, his eyes radiating intense determination. He had accepted five generations of legacies from powerful experts. However, as this happened, and the increasing power was revealed, it only made Meng Hao\u2019s desire for the first generation legacy grow even stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgarwood Clan, first generation legacy!!\u201d he roared.</p><br/><p>The sound echoed out into the ears of the black-robed Cultivator, causing his heart to begin to pound. An uneasy feeling filled his heart as he looked at Meng Hao, whose head was raised in determination. The black-robed Cultivator gritted his teeth, then raised his hand toward the blank-faced Hanxue Zong behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood and Will Liquefaction!\u201d he cried, pointing at Hanxue Zong. Hanxue Zong\u2019s body began to shake, and he let out a blood-curdling shriek. His body rapidly withered, and in the blink of an eye, he had turned into a desiccated corpse. All of the blood in his body spurted out and shot toward the black-robed Cultivator. It circulated around his body for a moment; then he shot forward at incredible speed.</p><br/><p>The three hundred meter distance began to close. However, the pressure of the five legacy brands pushing down on the black-robed Cultivator was rapidly eating away at the Frigid Snow Clan blood which gave him his speed. Once it completely disappeared, he would be in great danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!\u201d he cried. He was now less than thirty meters away from Meng Hao. He lifted his hand up, and a billowing Lightning Blade slashed down toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Inside his mind, Meng Hao used Spiritual Sense to transmit a message out. \u201cThe bloodline of Agarwood comes from the Western Desert. Western Desert totems come from countless demons. As for me, I\u2026 I am the Ninth Demon Sealer. Agarwood Clan legacy, yield to me as you should!\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p>Note from Deathblade about Agarwood: Sometimes translating a chapter goes super smooth and fast. Other times, I spend more time on a single passage or even word, than the rest of the chapter. This was one such chapter. In Chinese, what I'm translating as \"Agarwood\" is pronounced \"qi'nan,\" and is a sub-species of a type of a fragrant tree that in English is called agarwood. I probably spent about two hours total just researching this term, including some digging into a Sanskrit/English dictionary (the word apparently came into Chinese from Sanskrit). Special thanks to RWX for consulting with me about it. To save you the trouble of a google search, here's a link to the wikipedia article about it.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Tjandra Johannes, Lim Derek, Patryk Czajczy\u0144ski, Dante Madut, Jonas Winter, and Caleb Gleason</em></p><br/><p></p><div class=\"footnotes\"><ol><li><span id=\"footnote-1\">Qi'nan is the transliteration of \u201cAgarwood.\u201d Ning means \u201cpeace\u201d or \u201ctranquility\u201d<i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-left\"></i></span></li><li><span id=\"footnote-2\">The \u201cTian\u201d in his name means \u201cHeaven\u201d or \u201csky\u201d<i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-left\"></i></span></li></ol></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Cheering could be heard everywhere as countless people who had fought in the war were now returned to life.</p><br/><p>An old man appeared who was none other than Grandpa Fang. As soon as Meng Hao caught sight of him, a tremor ran through him, and he immediately rushed forward and kowtowed respectfully, tears streaming down his face.</p><br/><p>Grandpa Fang looked around in confusion, but then saw Meng Hao, and a smile broke out on his face. The truth was that years ago, he had accomplished the final mission given to him by Shui Dongliu, which had been to infiltrate the 33 Heavens and cause their land masses to collide against each other. That was when he had truly died. Laughing, he helped his beloved grandson to his feet.</p><br/><p>It was in that exact same moment that someone else emerged from within the vortex. As soon as she appeared, many people recognized her. She had once been the Divine Daughter of the Nine Seas God World... Fan Dong\u2019er!</p><br/><p>Actually, she hadn\u2019t died in the war. The white-robed corpse which accompanied her had dragged her down into the very depths of the void. Now she emerged, trembling, looking over at Meng Hao, and then all the other people she knew, and all the people who were being resurrected. Tears streamed down her face.</p><br/><p>As more people were brought back to life, the other excited cultivators explained everything which had happened in the past centuries. Eventually, after everyone had been resurrected, Meng Hao waved his hand again, and the vortex began to spin.</p><br/><p>Soon it was whizzing at top speed, and Meng Hao\u2019s eyes were glowing with powerful light. Back when he had only been half a step into the Ancestor Realm, there had been a certain person he had wished to resurrect but could not, a person who had come to be part of his heart long ago.</p><br/><p>But now, he had consumed Allheaven\u2019s clone, and stepped fully into the Ancestor Realm. Although he was not yet fully familiar with all of his powers, he was definitely far, far more powerful than he had been in the past.</p><br/><p>Considering the current level of his cultivation base, it was even possible for him to resurrect people from ancient times!</p><br/><p>\u201cFoster father....\u201d he said softly, gesturing at the vortex. Time flowed backward within the vortex, causing images to flit by until the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect appeared.</p><br/><p>No one was more moved by the sight than Ke Jiusi, who trembled visibly as he looked at the vortex. The sight of the Ancient Demon Immortal Sect caused great waves of emotion to batter his heart. They were emotions that could not be understood by anyone who hadn\u2019t experienced the loss of a father.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad....\u201d he said, his voice filled with emotion. Meng Hao performed an incantation gesture, then gestured once more with his finger. The vortex grew still as an ancient figure appeared. Gradually, his features became clear. It was... Ke Yunhai.</p><br/><p>Slowly, Ke Yunhai was pulled out from the vortex to join everyone else.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had reached back countless years into the past to resurrect Ke Yunhai!</p><br/><p>As Ke Yunhai hovered there, a blank look on his face, Ke Jiusi rushed forward, tears streaming down his face. He immediately dropped to his knees in front of his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao also hurried forward. Taking a deep breath, he fell to his knees in front of Ke Yunhai.</p><br/><p>\u201cFoster father!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ke Yunhai looked blankly at Ke Jiusi, and then closed his eyes. After a moment passed, they opened again, and he seemed to understand. A warm smile appeared on his face. Then he looked over at Meng Hao, and began to laugh.</p><br/><p>It was an unbelievable event within the starry sky of the Mountains and Seas. Everyone who had died in the war came back to life. By the time he was finished, Meng Hao, despite his incredible power, was very tired.</p><br/><p>But when he looked at the excited, happy cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm, he felt joy in his heart.</p><br/><p>He placed the new Mountain and Sea Realm back into the place where the old one had existed. The newly resurrected individuals were taken by their family and friends back into the Mountain and Sea Realm, where they continued to learn about the events which had occurred in the centuries after their demise.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Meng Hao didn\u2019t travel around through the starry sky, but instead stayed in the Mountain and Sea Realm, with Xu Qing, with his father and mother, and with Ke Yunhai.</p><br/><p>The new Mountain and Sea Realm continued to grow and develop. Within the Nine Mountains and Seas, the Mountain and Sea cultivators made new homes for themselves, and cultivated the magic of Meng Hao\u2019s League of Demon Sealers.</p><br/><p>The starry sky was quiet. The cultivators of the Vast Expanse School returned to Planet Vast Expanse, and as for all of the other living creatures, they also returned to their respective homes. All cultivators knew that the place where they lived was no longer called the Vast Expanse, it was the starry sky of the Mountains and Seas.</p><br/><p>The will of the starry sky was not Allheaven, it was Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was the lord of the starry sky.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the Mountain and Sea Realm became the ultimate power within the starry sky, and was like a Holy Land.</p><br/><p>Days passed. Years passed. Few people ever saw Meng Hao. He stayed in the Mountain and Sea Realm, on the Ninth Mountain, where he lived quietly. Five hundred years went by in a flash.</p><br/><p>During those five hundred years, Meng Hao seemed calm, but the truth was that he was constantly thinking about the curse which had been pronounced by Allheaven. There was one part which made him especially anxious, which had left a deep impression on him, and that was when Allheaven said, \u201ctime is limited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wanted to change things. He wanted to break the curse created by Allheaven when he was in his prime!</p><br/><p>But no matter what methods he attempted during those five hundred years, he could do nothing of the sort. Despite being in the Ancestor Realm, he was a far cry from Allheaven in his prime.</p><br/><p>Because of that gap, the curse... could not be broken.</p><br/><p>During the five hundred years which passed, generation after generation of Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators were born. As time passed, Meng Hao intentionally began to erase the evidence of his existence. He forbade people from talking about him or spreading stories, hoping that such a tactic would reduce the number of people who were connected to him by Karma.</p><br/><p>However, that was a difficult task to accomplish. After all, the most vile aspect of the curse was that it didn\u2019t just affect people who were connected to Meng Hao by Karma, but people connected by two degrees and on.</p><br/><p>The effects spread far and wide, and could not be negated.</p><br/><p>During the five hundred years, the Mountain and Sea Realm continued to thrive, and yet there were also strange things which occurred, things which could not be ignored. For example... generally speaking, Nascent Soul cultivators were supposed to be able to live for four or five hundred years, but now, that number had decreased to around two hundred.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, some cultivators who should clearly have been able to live for much longer, gradually weakened. Their longevity wasted away, and eventually... people began to die.</p><br/><p>However, the general growth and expansion of the realm ensured that such things went unnoticed. Except by Meng Hao. He noticed.</p><br/><p>Whenever a person died in such a fashion, he would appear by their corpse. Every single one of the corpses whose longevity had been severed had traces of the curse on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime... is limited,\u201d he thought bitterly. Eventually, the day came when people he actually knew began to show the withering signs of age. By now, Meng Hao was getting very anxious.</p><br/><p>He did everything he could think of. He used magical techniques. He created countless new natural laws. He did everything possible to weaken the power of the curse, and yet, he was unable to break it.</p><br/><p>Because of what was happening, he even went outside the Vast Expanse. After all, since the curse had been cast by Allheaven, then Allheaven was the one who could break it. However, even after utilizing all of the power of his divine sense, he was unable to find Allheaven\u2019s true form.</p><br/><p>Apparently he was hiding, unwilling to fight the final battle with Meng Hao. Even though Allheaven\u2019s true form was also weakening because of that, he still didn\u2019t appear.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

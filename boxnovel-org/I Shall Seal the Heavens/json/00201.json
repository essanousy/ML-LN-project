The cleansing nature of the rain made Meng Hao more than happy to fight in the downpour. He didn\u2019t waste power from his Cultivation base to push the rain away from him.</p><br/><p>He slowly released his hand and then turned. Rainwater poured off of his chin and hair, soaking his clothes. Lightning flashed in the darkness of night, and Meng Hao suddenly seemed to emanate a demonic aura.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Black Sieve Sect disciples were shocked. They looked at Meng Hao, not with contempt, but with concentration.</p><br/><p>The Black Sieve Sect Dao Child Zhou Jie looked at Meng Hao with narrowed eyes. He didn\u2019t attack, though, but continued to hold aloft the incense burner. Smoke curled up from it and was rapidly coalescing in mid-air. \u201cKill this person at any cost,\u201d he said, his cold voice ringing out in the dark, stormy night.</p><br/><p>There were more than ten Cultivators surrounding Meng Hao. Hearing the words of the Dao Child, they immediately prepared to attack. Magical techniques and treasured weapons of all sorts instantly bore down on Meng Hao. Booming sounds filled the air. This would be the most intense battle Meng Hao had ever faced; each and every one of these Cultivators was of the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, a small Sect wouldn\u2019t even be able to produce so many Cultivators of this level. A medium-sized Sect, even if they had so many, would never dispatch them all simultaneously. To any Sect, disciples of the late Foundation Establishment stage were good fortune from the Heavens. If even one from a group this size could reach Core Formation, he would be crucially important to the Sect.</p><br/><p>Only a super Sect like the Black Sieve Sect had such extensive resources to be able to afford to dispatch so many late Foundation Establishment Cultivators.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered. If he had not created his fifth Dao Pillar, then this battle would be extremely difficult, and potentially fatal. But now, with his fifth Dao Pillar, he was invincible to the battle power of the Foundation Establishment stage. Actually, you could say that currently, Meng Hao was the most powerful person under the Core Formation stage in the entire Southern Domain!</p><br/><p>He laughed coldly as the Black Sieve Sect disciples approached. His left hand made a grasping motion in the air, and immediately, the Flame Dragon appeared in the form of the Flying Rain-Dragon. It didn\u2019t completely appear, however. Meng Hao simply borrowed some of its heat to transform the surrounding sheets of rainwater into a thick mist.</p><br/><p>As the mist roiled about, Meng Hao slapped his bag of holding, and the two wooden swords flew out. They circled around him for a moment, and then shot away.</p><br/><p>The mist seethed, covering up the entire area so that nothing was visible. The heat in the area continued to turn to the rain into mist. Thunder pealed out, and lightning crashed down. One after another, blood-curdling screams rang out from within the mist.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s shadow flitted about inside, carrying death with it. The two wooden swords swept out in front of him, severing the head of a Black Sieve Sect disciple. The disciple\u2019s eyes filled with astonishment in the instant before he died.</p><br/><p>The sounds of slaughter drifted out. Meng Hao moved like a specter. Cracking sounds rang out from his right hand as he crushed another Cultivator. He tossed the body up ahead to block an incoming spear. A boom rang out as the corpse exploded to pieces. Meng Hao strode forward.</p><br/><p>He waved his right arm, summoning the Wind Blade. It shot out, slicing another body to bits. The pieces of the corpse shot out from the mist and fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jie frowned when he saw this. However, he continued to manipulate the incense burner. The smoke drifting up from it appeared to be about sixty percent congealed.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, another miserable shriek sounded out from within the mist. A Black Sieve Sect disciple, his body half destroyed, stumbled out. Just when it seemed he would escape successfully, Meng Hao\u2019s hand shot out and grabbed him by the top of the head. He pushed down, and the Cultivator screamed. Meng Hao\u2019s face emerged for a moment from the mist. He looked over at Zhou Jie.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jie looked back, and as their gazes locked, Meng Hao smiled, and then disappeared back into the mist. He released his hand, and the Black Sieve Sect disciple slumped to the ground dead, his eyes still wide open.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jie trembled at the sight of it, and an unsightly expression appeared on his face. The screams from within the mist seemed to be growing further and further apart. The booms grew weaker. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Zhou, save me!\u201d cried one of the Black Sieve Sect disciples. His right arm had been severed, and a horrified expression covered his face. Despite his all-out push to escape, the words were barely out of his mouth when a meter-long phantom hand shot out from the mist. It moved at incredible speed, catching up to the escaping Cultivator in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>It slammed into him, and a deafening explosion filled the air. The Cultivator\u2019s body began to tremble, and he opened his mouth to say something. Before he could, his body exploded.</p><br/><p>By this time, the mist surrounding Meng Hao was beginning to dissipate. Meng Hao walked out. From the look of his robe and long hair, he seemed like a weak scholar. But the coldness in his eyes caused Zhou Jie to tremble.</p><br/><p>More than ten Cultivators of the late Foundation Establishment stage\u2026 and only Meng Hao had emerged alive from the mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour excellency\u2019s methods are a bit too ruthless,\u201d said Zhou Jie, slowly lowering his hand. He knew that he had run out of time, and wouldn\u2019t be able to continue his work with the incense burner.</p><br/><p>The Black Sieve Sect had completely misjudged Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Actually, Patriarch Violet Sieve had received information regarding Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation base from the their Sect Elder who was currently in the Song Clan. He knew that his power exceeded that of the mid Foundation Establishment stage, and was more akin to the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Jie was now well aware that Meng Hao\u2019s battle power was not comparable to the late Foundation Establishment stage. In fact, it could exhibit terrifying pressure that exceeded such power.</p><br/><p>After close observation just now, Zhou Jie got the powerful sense that his opponent\u2019s spiritual power was completely different from that of others. It looked like spiritual power, but it seemed to somehow be branded specifically to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Logically speaking, the spiritual power of magical techniques with which Meng Hao attacked, should eventually dissipate back into Heaven and Earth. However, the power left over by Meng Hao\u2019s attacks did not dissolve away. Instead, they seemed to be rejected by Heaven and Earth. They just floated there like oil on water.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the explosiveness of this rejected power was one of the reasons Meng Hao was so powerful. Zhou Jie reached these conclusions quickly, but couldn\u2019t figure out any solution to the problem. Fear filled his heart.</p><br/><p>Because of this explosiveness, Meng Hao might be only at the mid Foundation Establishment stage, but decimating the late Foundation Establishment stage was as easy for him as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. That\u2026 was obvious!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s spiritual power was different. It belonged only to him. The spiritual energy of others belonged to Heaven and Earth. By practicing breathing techniques, Cultivators could borrow it. Based on the various stages of Cultivation, the amount of time it could be borrowed varied. However, regardless of anything, all of the spiritual energy would once again return to Heaven and Earth upon death.</p><br/><p>It was a cycle. Just like the nine paths in front of the gray-robed old man atop the World Tree, it was a rule of Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually not ruthless,\u201d said Meng Hao indifferently, \u201cyou people are. Actually, I\u2019m pretty softhearted. However, your presence here is a bit of a problem.\u201d He waved his hand, causing the mist behind him to disperse fully. The rain descended onto the two of them, seemingly dividing them inseparably. However, their gazes locked, and their expressions grew fiercer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Zhou Jie, Dao Child of the Black Sieve Sect!\u201d Zhou Jie suddenly lifted his hand. In it appeared a one foot long, blue-colored joss stick. The joss stick was lit, and smoke curled up from its end to form the shape of a sword that glowed mysteriously. This was clearly no ordinary joss stick.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Meng Hao from the State of Zhao,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. His right hand flashed an incantation gesture, and the two wooden swords appeared and rotated around him slowly. They emanated glowing sword auras, and emitted a droning buzz that made seem as if they thirsted for blood.</p><br/><p>This was not the first time Meng Hao had faced a Dao Child in battle. The first time was when he had fought Li Daoyi, and had forced him to flee, severing his arm in the process. Then he had encountered Li Shiqi, and had competed against her in demonstrations of strength. Now he was up against Zhou Jie.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had three Dao Pillars when I fought Li Daoyi,\u201d Meng Hao thought. \u201cI had four when I faced Li Shiqi. Now I have five. I will now prove that the power of my five Perfect Dao Pillars is invincible in the Foundation Establishment stage!\u201d An exuberant gleam appeared in his eyes. The two wooden swords seemed as if they could sense Meng Hao\u2019s desire for battle. Their droning grew even louder, and their sword auras gleamed even more brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look just like a woman I met while traveling a few years ago. I pursued her, but nothing ever came of it. She wasn\u2019t named Meng, though.\u201d Zhou Jie shook his head. Actually, Meng Hao was a person who he believed deserving of his respect. In truth, among the Foundation Establishment Cultivators of the Southern Domain, he had only ever respected about ten people. Each and every one of them was a Dao Child!</p><br/><p>But today, he recognized Meng Hao\u2019s existence. Meng Hao was someone who could stand shoulder to shoulder with the current generation of Dao Children.</p><br/><p>Even as the words left his mouth, Zhou Jie\u2019s body exploded with the power of the great circle of Foundation Establishment. It rippled out, causing his hair to fly about. The rainwater around him shot away from him, as if it didn\u2019t dare to touch him. A fierce look filled his eyes as he strode toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flashed, and he too began to stride forward. His Spiritual Sense shot out.</p><br/><p>Rain fell around them as this battle of those at the peak of the Foundation Establishment began!</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter sponsored by Fan from WA</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

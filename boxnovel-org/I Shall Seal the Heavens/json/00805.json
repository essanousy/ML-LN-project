He was well aware that Meng Hao had powerful backing, and didn\u2019t want to provoke him. However, the ancestral mansion was under his personal command. If Fang Xiufeng showed up, he wouldn\u2019t do anything to offend him. But for a member of the junior generation to dare to act in this way filled his heart with rage.</p><br/><p>His appearance on the scene immediately caused the surrounding Ji Clan members to grow excited. Ji Xuelin instantly \u201cregained consciousness,\u201d and looked excitedly at Patriarch Nine. Then he looked back at Meng Hao with anticipation regarding his imminent vengeance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re definitely going to get put in place this time!\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and looked up at the enormous bottle gourd Dharma Idol floating there.</p><br/><p>\u201cDharma Idol, huh\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao smiled. \u201cWell I have one too.\u201d Eyes glittering, he took a step forward. Up to this point, he hadn\u2019t called on the full extent of his power. Now, he rotated his cultivation base, and Immortal qi emerged. As soon as it did, everything trembled and shook, and an enormous Dharma Idol appeared that seemed capable of holding up the sky.</p><br/><p>The strength of this Dharma Idol was extraordinarily shocking; it was like some primordial giant whose face was that of Meng Hao!</p><br/><p>The sky shook and the ground quaked the moment the Dharma Idol appeared; natural law spread out, along with a vast pressure that weighed down on everything. The bottle gourd began to quiver, and it seemed to be expending all of its energy as it struggled to fight back against Meng Hao\u2019s Dharma Idol.</p><br/><p>The sky looked like it was on the verge of being torn to shreds, and ear-shattering booms filled the air. The incredible pressure seemed capable of tearing Heaven and Earth apart from each other, and the land looked as if it were about to shatter into pieces.</p><br/><p>Almost instantly, Meng Hao and the teenager were in a deadlock!</p><br/><p>The Ji Clan members looked on, panting, their expressions blank. Their scalps were numb and their minds reeled. They knew that Meng Hao was strong, but\u2026 how could they ever have imagined that\u2026 he would be this strong!?</p><br/><p>He could even fight Patriarch Nine to a standstill. And their Patriarch Nine\u2026 was an Immortal!!</p><br/><p>The teenager\u2019s face sank, and a strange light appeared in his eyes as he looked at Meng Hao. Inwardly, he let out a long sigh. He had known before that Meng Hao was extraordinary, but it wasn\u2019t until he actually faced up against him that he realized\u2026 he had underestimated him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true that he\u2019s actually\u2026 half a step into true Immortality!\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, the nearby cultivators had spread the news that Meng Hao had charged into the Ji Clan fortress. The news reached other sects, and soon all of the powerful experts of the Eastern Lands knew. Divine sense streamed forth, and gasps could be heard in the various sects throughout the Eastern Lands when they saw that Meng Hao could grapple with a false Immortal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Meng Hao is incredible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis father is extraordinary, and\u2026 so is he!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Fang Clan\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless eyes throughout the Eastern Lands were now fixed on the Ji Clan, and Meng Hao. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes blazed with the desire to do battle; ever since his incredible cultivation base breakthrough, he had not battled a false Immortal. He truly wished to know how such a battle would turn out!</p><br/><p>He reached out his hand and pointed toward the teenager, and his desire to fight was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake your move!\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>The Ji Clan cultivators were panting, especially those who normally flaunted their status as Chosen. Their faces were pale, and they were forced to admit that there was now a vast, unimaginable gap between themselves and Meng Hao. It was like the difference between Heaven and Earth, and was a chasm that could not easily be crossed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 is so much stronger than us!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s laughable to say that we are of the same generation. We can shake things up, but he\u2026 he can battle with our Patriarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026 don\u2019t even qualify to be his opponent\u2026.\u201d This fact was quite a blow to the Chosen. Earlier, they had heard about Meng Hao\u2019s strength, but to witness it with their own eyes was shocking to the soul.</p><br/><p>As he faced up against a bristling Meng Hao, Patriarch Nine realized that he was in somewhat of a dilemma. As the saying goes, if you ride a tiger, it\u2019s hard to get off. Even as he hesitated, an archaic voice suddenly rang out from thin air to fill the Ji clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ji Clan cultivates Karma. Spirit stones are material objects, and can be considered a seed of Karma. The Ji Clan must not be infected by such Karma. Anyone who owes this person spirit stones must pay them back!</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, pay heed. The Ji Clan\u2019s cultivation is different than that of the masses. To cultivate Karma, we must revere Karma. If you do not have the power to sever Karma, then you must yield to it!</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it to him! Him coming here to ask for his spirit stones is in fact an aid to you in severing Karma with him. Do you still not understand? Once the Karma is severed, your cultivation will surely flourish.\u201d</p><br/><p>As these few sentences reverberated through the air, the voice vanished. Patriarch Nine\u2019s body jerked to a stop as he realized that the voice had come from the true Patriarch of the Ji Clan here in the Eastern Lands. His energy immediately dissipated along with the Dharma Idol, and he clasped hands and bowed to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for the assistance you have provided to these children of the Ji Clan in severing Karma, my young friend. Please inform me of exactly how many spirit stones are owed, and I will give them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many people who appeared to be enlightened, and not just members of the Ji Clan. As for the handful of Chosen who owned spirit stones to Meng Hao, their bodies trembled as brilliant Dao light shone out from them. What seemed to be the music of a great Dao swirled around them, as if in this moment, their Dao heart was nudged forward.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao gaped in shock at this sudden reversal. That was especially so when he saw that the Dao light shining off of Ji Xuelin had intensified. From the look of it, he was experiencing a cultivation base breakthrough, which caused Meng Hao to breathe deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the Ji Clan\u2019s magic is so Heaven-defying!\u201d he thought. \u201cCultivate Karma, revere Karma, sever Karma\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He watched wide-eyed as Ji Xuelin suddenly clasped hands and bowed to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Meng, many thanks for helping me to sever the Karma from that year.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chosen who owed Meng Hao spirit stones immediately began to clasp hands toward him and bow in thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Elder Brother Meng!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Fellow Daoist Meng Hao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao abruptly took a few steps back. He was actually a bit angry. He had merely come here to collect some debts; how could it have ended with him helping them?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was that old geezer who was talking just now?\u201d he thought, frowning. \u201cHe\u2019s so powerful! With just a few words, not only was he able to settle the dispute, he provided his clan members with good fortune AND turned me into the grindstone to help them polish their understanding of severing Karma.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Meng Hao was just about to leave when Patriarch Nine hurried forward, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung friend, what are you doing?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow many spirit stones do they owe you? Tell me and I\u2019ll hand them over to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, no, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Meng Hao said hastily. \u201cAll of us are actually good friends, and I was just pulling a little prank. Let\u2019s leave the debt in place, alright? I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d By this point, he was already back at the huge gate.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that won\u2019t do,\u201d said the youthful-looking Patriarch Nine. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anything more, young friend. You\u2019re being too magnanimous.\u201d He turned to the Chosen. \u201cAll of you, tell me how much you owe. And tell me how much Xiaoxiao and the other two owe, too.\u201d Patriarch Nine had also been somewhat enlightened now. He knew that to sever a Karma infection was something of great importance to these Chosen.</p><br/><p>To Ji Xuelin and the others, it was clear that great fortune had just arrived. Having just been enlightened about such a great truth, they immediately responded.</p><br/><p>\u201c7,650,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c9,180,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c14\u2026 14,000,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c8,330,000!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAltogether, Xiaoxiao and the other two probably don\u2019t owe more than 30,000,000\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the youthful-looking Patriarch Nine heard how many spirit stones were involved, he stared in shock, then looked deeply at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung friend, you really are very magnanimous. In the future, you\u2019ll surely be incredibly rich.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too kind, really,\u201d said Meng Hao clearing his throat, and backing up. \u201cSince Ji Xiaoxiao and the other two aren\u2019t here, they can\u2019t return what they owe personally and it doesn\u2019t count as them settling the debt.\u201d As far as he was concerned, these people from the Ji Clan were a bunch of lunatics. Who would possibly offer to pay back so many spirit stones? If he owed so many spirit stones to someone, he sure wouldn\u2019t pay them back, even if he were beaten to death!</p><br/><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to be hasty. How about this\u2026 you people get back to what you were doing. My dad asked me to help out around the house, so I\u2019ll head home now\u2026.\u201d By this point he was outside the main gate. However, just as he was about to leave, a bag of holding flew out and landed in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cInside that bag are all the spirit stones owed to you from the people here. As of now, they have no Karma connected to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a booming sound as the Ji Clan\u2019s main gate slammed shut.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao chuckled bitterly. The promissory notes in his bag of holding instantly turned to ash. Luckily\u2026 there were still three remaining, the ones belonging to Ji Xiaoxiao and the others. Since they weren\u2019t here, they wouldn\u2019t be able to resolve their Karma.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had his money, but was actually a bit depressed. Of course, what he didn\u2019t know was that his matter of collecting his debts had actually shaken the entire Eastern Lands. Countless gazes were being cast in his direction at that very moment.</p><br/><p>He looked at the Ji Clan\u2019s main gate, then recalled the iron hoops in his bag of holding. He hesitated for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge, who cares about all that crap he said about Karma!? I\u2019m keeping the iron hoops!\u201d With that, he turned, clasped hands to the surrounding cultivators, then turned into a beam of prismatic light that shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>He moved with such speed that in the blink of an eye, no trace of him remained. He reappeared far off in the distance, in the sky above the Eastern Lands. He sent some divine sense out to make sure that no one was watching him, and then his expression darkened.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, his eyes flickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that in the future, I should get more people to write promissory notes. Getting them to personally write the notes\u2026 is Karma\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. Perhaps these promissory notes will be of some use in the future!\u201d Eyes glittering, Meng hao was just about to allow the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion to guide him to the Daoist rite temple when suddenly, he stopped in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly\u2026 I still owe money to some people too\u2026. I owe Steward Zhou three pieces of silver\u2026.\u201d When he considered the matter, something about it didn\u2019t seem right.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut when went looking for him before, Steward Zhou was already dead. Should I go find his descendants? Agh! That damned Patriarch Reliance has the State of Zhao on his back. And he left the lands of South Heaven! How\u2026 how am I supposed to settle that Karma!\u201d After a moment, he smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head, he sighed, then sent some divine sense into the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion. Following its guidance, he headed off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Several days later, Meng Hao appeared at the edge of a boundless mountain range in the depths of the Eastern Lands. He then vanished as he entered the mountains. As he proceeded along, he saw no signs of life. He passed many treacherous locations, and faced quite a few dangers.</p><br/><p>As he traveled further into the mountains, the air up above became restricted, and eruptions of black mist would occur frequently. Despite Meng Hao\u2019s incredibly powerful fleshly body, he could still be injured by that black mist, which filled his heart with trepidation after it happened a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem like restrictive spells,\u201d he thought. \u201cCould it be that somebody buried something here? Whatever they are, they\u2019re incredibly dangerous!\u201d After some careful examination, Meng Hao was certain that there were items buried beneath the ground that would explode if stepped on.</p><br/><p>There were also naturally occurring restrictive spells which, if he got caught in their explosions, would certainly cause his cultivation base to drop.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the Immortal Ancient Dao Medallion was very effective in avoiding both the restrictive spells and the objects buried underground. Using the medallion\u2019s guidance, he was able to proceed onward for several days with no incident. Finally, he found himself on a narrow path which cut deep through the mountains in such a way that he could only see a sliver of the sky up above. This path also was laced with the buried, explosive objects. Thankfully, by means of the medallion, and utmost caution, he was able to proceed along the path for some time without incident. Three times, eruptions occurred, but in the end, he finally found himself\u2026 in front of a run-down old temple.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Masaki</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

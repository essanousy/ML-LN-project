Many seemed to be at a loss, unsure of exactly what had happened. But now, they all knew that Meng Hao was not someone to provoke.</p><br/><p>Even though they didn\u2019t know exactly what had happened, Meng Hao\u2019s trembling first customer did. His heart pounding madly, he slapped his bag of holding and produced six Spirit Stones, which he respectfully handed over. He regretted having hesitated in front of the Pill Cultivation Workshop in the past. By fretting over his Spirit Stones at that time, he\u2019d ended up with no medicine. And now, he didn\u2019t have any Spirit Stones to go buy anything for himself.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao accepted the Spirit Stones, produced a Blood Coagulation pill and Skeletal Relaxation Pill, and gave them to the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks for your patronage,\u201d he said with a wide smile. \u201cCome back again soon.\u201d Once again, he looked weak and feeble. But to the Cultivator standing in front of him, he was a vicious beast in sheep\u2019s clothing. Trembling, the man made his exit.</p><br/><p>As he left, Meng Hao decided not to return to his spot on the rock. He grabbed the Pill Cultivation Workshop Outlet banner and began to stroll about the Public Zone. He stopped next to two battling disciples, sticking the banner into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, it seems you\u2019re injured,\u201d he said, stepping forward. \u201cYou also seem somewhat listless. You don\u2019t seem to be in the right state to be fighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two disciples stared at him in amazement. Having just seen him knock someone out, they hesitated, and at the same time, both backed up a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI happen to have some Spirit Refreshment Pills from the Pill Cultivation Workshop. Take one, and you will be completely reinvigorated, your victory guaranteed. Since today is our opening day of business, it only costs one Spirit Stone. How convenient!\u201d Meng Hao continued to walk forward, his face filled with sincerity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already have some medicinal pills,\u201d said the man he had been giving his sales pitch to. He slapped his grab of holding, and a Spirit Refreshment Pill appeared, which he popped into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Meng Hao sighed. He had watched his first customer for some time before determining that he had no medicinal pills. With a light cough, he looked at the second man standing in front of him. The man gave a cold harrumph, then produced his own medicinal pill and swallowed it, sighing inwardly.</p><br/><p>But Meng Hao wasn\u2019t disheartened. He circled back to the boulder, continuing to watch the two of them. As time passed, they seemed to be looking worse and worse off. Soon, it was clear they were out of medicinal pills, and the critical juncture in the fight had arrived. Victory and defeat would be decided.</p><br/><p>His spirits risen again, Meng Hao hefted the banner and approached them again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, the moment of life or death has arrived. You don\u2019t have any medicinal pills left, but don\u2019t worry, I have some right here.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this critical juncture, buy one of my Soul Congealing Pills. It will restore your energy in a flash, and even recover your spiritual energy. Brothers, you\u2019re not buying a medicinal pill, you\u2019re buying spiritual energy. Aiyo, you\u2019re injured!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s words distracted the Cultivators. A flying sword hit one of them in the arm, sending out a fountain of blood. He retreated backward with a scream.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was even faster than him, following and continuing his speech, looked as weak and scholarly as ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, now is the time. You\u2019re bleeding profusely. Quick, buy a Blood Coagulation Pill. If you don\u2019t, the danger is just too great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d the man\u2019s opponent roared at Meng Hao. He charged his injured opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a pill,\u201d said the injured Cultivator, his face pale. Retreating several paces, he gritted his teeth and pulled out a Spirit Stone. A Blood Coagulation Pill shot from Meng Hao\u2019s hand onto the wound on the man\u2019s arm. The blood flow began to slow. He focused his attention, then leaped back into the fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, Brother, it seems you\u2019re out of medicinal pills. Look, I have plenty. Now that your opponent bought one, he\u2019s bursting with energy. But you\u2019re injured. Why don\u2019t you buy a Blood Coagulation pill?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, you got slashed again. You must be really tired. Take it slow, and don\u2019t be discouraged. Brother, I still have a Skeletal Relaxation Pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne Spirit Stone for one pill. You should buy pills quickly. The sages said, Spirit Stones have a price, but a life is priceless.\u201d Meng Hao slowly circled them. Sure enough, they were out of medicinal pills, and soon, they began buying. Feeling pressure from each other, they bought quite a few. The battle grew more serious. Their fighting today was more intense than four or five normal battles.</p><br/><p>Originally, it had been a fairly simple fight, but with the Pill Cultivation Workshop Outlet here, things were complicated. With dangerous fighting, comes injury. The two cannot be separated.</p><br/><p>Flop. Flop. The two men had finally exhausted every scrap of energy. They dropped to the ground, unconscious, Spirit Stones spent and medicinal pills eaten up. Even their magical items were destroyed in the battle, seemingly together along with their wits. How tragic.</p><br/><p>As far as Meng Hao was concerned, he had saved their lives. Or at least one life. Hefting his banner, he once again strolled around the plateau, and once again found two Cultivators locked in devastating combat. From the look of it, even if they had healing medicine, it was gone by now. Eyes glistening, he stood the banner up next to the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, your complexions seem bad, and you\u2019ve received some serious injuries. But fear not, I have medicinal pills. One Spirit Stone buys one pill; your recovery is guaranteed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you aren\u2019t saying anything? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t trust me? Just now another disciple bought some of my pills. The result for his opponent was death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shortly, each of the men bought a pill, then again, and again, until they had no more Spirit Stones left. After much bitter battling, they ended their fight in a tie, with nothing to show for it except empty bags of holding.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao shook his head, picked up the banner and found a new place to do business.</p><br/><p>By the time the sun set, Meng Hao had been everywhere in the Public Zone, selling medicinal pills. In the end, wherever he went, the battling would instantly cease, and the participants would leave. Eventually, Meng Hao stared out over an empty Public Zone. Contentedly patting his bag of holding, he left.</p><br/><p>It was late at night when he arrived at the Immortal\u2019s Cave. He sat down cross-legged and excitedly began to take inventory of his spoils.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two\u2026\u201d He grew more and more excited as he counted. \u201cAltogether I have fifty-three. I\u2019m rich. This method is much faster than robbing people. It\u2019s also much safer. No need for killing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have many medicinal pills left, so tomorrow I\u2019ll go to the Pill Cultivation Workshop and buy some more. If I want the business to do well, I should buy out all of this month\u2019s healing medicines. If I don\u2019t have enough Spirit Stones, I\u2019ll just buy as much as I can. The scarcer the pills, the easier they\u2019ll be to sell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao opened the bag of holding he had taken from the unconscious Cultivator. Inside were a few Spirit Stones, two Spirit Condensation Pills, and a pink-colored medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>He held the pill up and examined it. He recognized it as one of the Pill Cultivation Workshop\u2019s Cosmetic Cultivation Pills, an expensive pill. It was worth about ten Spirit Condensation Pills, and could be considered one of the most expensive products available.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pill is designed to maintain one\u2019s physical appearance. It would be a waste for me to use it on myself.\u201d He figured the previous owner must have been trying to ingratiate himself to a female disciple. Not thinking any more on the subject, he put the pill into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>As he was looking down contentedly at all the Spirit Stones and medicinal pills, the main door of the Immortal\u2019s Cave suddenly creaked and began to open. It happened so quickly, Meng Hao had no time to gather up all his spoils.</p><br/><p>A woman entered, surrounded by a halo of moonlight. She was beautiful, but cold and expressionless. She wore a long silver robe that made it seem as if she had donned the moon itself.</p><br/><p>It was none other than the Reliance Inner Sect\u2019s Elder Sister Xu.</p><br/><p>As she entered the Immortal\u2019s Cave, moonlight fell onto the Spirit Stones and medicinal pills which lay in front of Meng Hao. A sliver of astonishment suddenly cut through her cold demeanor.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Elder Sister Xu,\u201d said Meng Hao, scrambling to his feet. His right hand swept up the Spirit Stones and medicinal pills. He stood there, looking embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Elder Sister Xu didn\u2019t say anything. She just looked at Meng Hao, nodded, then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Look surprised, Meng Hao followed after her.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Sister Xu, you took the trouble to come here, why not stay a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cI\u2019ll be going into secluded meditation starting tomorrow, and I just wanted to check in on you.\u201d She looked him over, then walked out of the cave.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao felt embarrassed, regretting having not collected up the Spirit Stones more quickly. In that case, he would have looked a bit worse off, and perhaps Elder Sister Xu would have been willing to help him out some more.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he felt a bit of warmth in his heart. Elder Sister Xu appeared cold and indifferent, but she had come here to see him, which meant she remembered him. His heart thumping, he slapped his bag of holding and produced the pink-colored medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to thank you, Elder Sister Xu. I saved up quite a bit of Spirit Condensation Pills so that I could trade them for this Cosmetic Cultivation Pill. Please accept it. In my eyes, only you are worthy of such a pill. From the moment I entered the sect, I\u2019ve had a dream, that you would stay young forever, and be eternally beautiful.\u201d Without so much as a wink, he solemnly and respectfully held out the pill.</p><br/><p>Elder Sister Xu stopped walking and looked back at him. She glanced silently at the pill in his hand, then accepted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though Spirit Condensation Pills are common in the sect, they are only effective up to the fifth level of Qi Condensation. We Cultivators place much importance on our Cultivation base. We live in the world of Cultivation, a place where life and death hang in the balance. You can\u2019t be like this in the future. You may be intelligent, but you need to work more on your cultivation.\u201d This was the first time Meng Hao had heard Elder Sister Xu speak so much. As she spoke, he nodded respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as Elder Sister Xu likes it, I\u2019m willing to trade for it,\u201d he said, lowering his head and blinking. He looked a bit shy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pill\u2026 I\u2019ll accept it this time, but next time don\u2019t trade your pills like this.\u201d She put the pill away, hesitated for a moment, then pulled out a pink-colored jade pendant which she handed to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a magical item,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to protect yourself.\u201d She began to walk down the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Elder Sister Xu,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cWould you allow me to accompany you while you walk? I haven\u2019t seen you for so long, and I have some questions regarding Cultivation that I hope you can clear up for me.\u201d He knew that this was an important opportunity. This was the only person he had to rely on, so he needed to get close to her. If he could walk with her through the Outer Sect and be seen by others, perhaps fewer people would be willing to mess with him in the future.</p><br/><p>Elder Sister Xu hesitated. She was an indifferent person, and usually didn\u2019t say much. She had never spent time with male sect members, and it felt a bit strange to have Meng Hao standing there next to her. She was about to refuse, but after he finished speaking, she thought bashfully of the Cosmetic Cultivation Pill he had given her, and she nodded quietly.</p><br/><p>The moon shone down gently on the two of them as they walked.</p><br/><p>Just then, at the peak of the North Mountain, a tall old man stood up, clad in a gray robe. As he looked down on the scene, a look of admiration appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent. This pup Meng Hao isn\u2019t bad at all. He truly grasps the correct interpretation of the Reliance Sect. He knows how to find someone to rely on. And he also knows that if he protects his relationship with that person, then he will always have someone to rely on.\u201d This was the same old man who had expressed admiration for Meng Hao on Pill Distribution day. The more he learned about Meng Hao, the more he liked him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

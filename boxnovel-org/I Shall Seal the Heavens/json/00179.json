Immediately, Zhou Shanyue\u2019s expression darkened. He flicked his sleeve and began to move toward Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo take responsibility is simple,\u201d he said as he strode forward. \u201cI want both of his eyes. Let\u2019s see if you dare to try to kill me. If you do, you have my respect. But how will you explain that to your Master, my father?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as always. He watched calmly as the scene unfolded. In front of him, Chen Fan gazed coldly at the approaching Zhou Shanyue. He lifted his right hand, and the flying dagger immediately began to glow.</p><br/><p>Everything seemed ready to dissolve into chaos. Zhou Shanyue proceeded forward, a savage expression covering his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you would dare to attack me over an outsider!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo you, he\u2019s an outsider, but to me, he\u2019s a Junior Brother.\u201d Chen Fan waved his hand, and the flying dagger shot toward Zhou Shanyue.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shanyue\u2019s hair stood on end, and he suddenly stopped moving. The black dagger had come to a stop right in front of his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me, Zhou Shanyue,\u201d Chen Fan said softly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was just about to take a step forward when the Pseudo Core stage Cultivator suddenly said, \u201cJust what do you two think you're doing?! Zhou Shanyue, stand down! Chen Fan, if this is your Junior Brother from your former Sect, then you\u2019ll need to vouch for him. You will be responsible for all his future mistakes.\u201d The words obviously contained a threat. While it seemed on the surface that he was trying to smooth over the situation, he was actually making a small matter into a bigger one.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was quite experienced, so obviously he understood what was being said. He laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy affairs have nothing to do with my Elder Brother,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take your words back voluntarily, your excellency, then I\u2019ll be forced to make you take them back.\u201d His voice was ice cold. When the middle-aged man heard them, his eyes grew icy and he stared back at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan, of course, had never imagined that Meng Hao would dare to speak. Without another word, he flashed an incantation sign, and the flying dagger re-appeared at his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Fan, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t try to give you some face. Your Junior Brother here needs to be taught a lesson.\u201d With a grim smile, the middle-aged man flicked his sleeve and began to move toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever. His Cultivation base had four Dao Pillars. He could contend with the late Foundation Establishment stage and could even stand up to Dao Children with Flawless Foundations. There was no need to even mention this middle-aged man who clearly had a Cracked Foundation at best.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could slay him with ease.</p><br/><p>Granted, the man was a fellow Disciple of Elder Brother Chen. However, Meng Hao couldn\u2019t allow people to level threats against him that could affect Elder Brother Chen later. That was why he had tried to separate himself from Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Solitary Sword Sect disciples watched on with cold smiles, eyeing Meng Hao with looks of disdain. They obviously thought Meng Hao was being arrogant and conceited to think he could stand up to someone who had completed the great circle of Foundation Establishment.</p><br/><p>Various thoughts ran through the minds of the surrounding disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never imagined Elder Brother Chen would make friends with someone who so easily overestimates himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s relying on Elder Brother Chen\u2019s presence, like a fox exploiting the might of a tiger.\u201d [1. The idiom of the fox and the tiger is a very common Chinese expression which means to bully others by flaunting ones powerful connections]</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sinister smile appeared on Zhou Shanyue\u2019s face. He moved backward a few paces, contentedly watching the commotion.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked as calm as ever as the middle-aged man raced forward. A slight smile appeared on his face, and he was about to step forward, when Chen Fan held his arm in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Li, my Junior Brother is young and insensible. Please give me some more face, and don't take offense. Let\u2019s just drop the matter.\u201d Having said this, he clasped Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder and gazed at him warmly. \u201cListen to Elder Brother,\u201d he said. When the four words entered Meng Hao\u2019s ears, they were filled with a gentle warmth that he hadn\u2019t experienced in a very long time. He looked into Chen Fan\u2019s eyes and then nodded.</p><br/><p>The man named Li stopped in his tracks, glaring coldly at Meng Hao for a moment, and then looking back at Chen Fan. Slowly, his face relaxed. A long moment passed, and then he said, \u201cYou need to help your Junior Brother learn not stop overestimating himself. If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll end up a mutilated corpse sooner or later.\u201d He flicked his sleeve and began to leave. Zhou Shanyue smiled mockingly and followed, along with the other Solitary Sword Disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you up ahead,\u201d came the voice of Li. \u201cYou have the time it takes an incense stick to burn to catch up with your Junior Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they disappeared into the distance, Meng Hao looked hesitantly at Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother, I\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to say anything,\u201d said Chen Fan, his face covered with a wide smile. He embraced him warmly again.</p><br/><p>Laughing happily, Chen Fan looked Meng Hao over, eyes filled with excitement because of their reunion. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up big and strong, I see! Haha! You\u2019re not the little scholar you used to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a voice as earnest as it had always been, he grabbed Meng Hao\u2019s arm and said, \u201cCan you believe it? Here we are, fellow Brothers who\u2019ve run into each other yet again in in the Southern Domain. We have to celebrate! Come come, tell your Elder Brother what you\u2019ve been up to these past years. A while back, I heard that the State of Zhao disappeared! Ai\u2026.\u201d He didn\u2019t even give Meng Hao a chance to respond.</p><br/><p>His personality had always been like this. He talked and talked, and before long, enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn. The entire time, Meng Hao didn\u2019t have a chance to even say a single sentence. It was just like it had been back in the Reliance Sect.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan was definitely long-winded, but even were he more so, Meng Hao wouldn\u2019t mind. Meng Hao\u2019s heart filled with warmth as he realized that everything Chen Fan was saying was out of concern for him. He was considerate, excited, and happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fatty Li Fugui, do you remember him? He used to follow you around all the time. Well, he\u2019s a pretty important person in the Golden Frost Sect now. Last time I went with Master to pay a visit to the Golden Frost Sect, I saw him swaggering around. He\u2019s definitely a darling of the Sect. If anyone dared to mess with him, a crowd of Golden Frost Sect disciples would instantly rush to help him\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Sister Xu is in sore straits, though. The only thing I could do was ask some people I know in the Black Sieve Sect to watch out for her. She\u2019s been stuck at the ninth level of Qi Condensation for years now. She needs a Foundation Establishment Pill. In the past years, I\u2019ve performed some meritorious services for the Sect. I think it won\u2019t be long before I can get a Foundation Establishment Pill from Master to send to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, and then there\u2019s Wang Tengfei\u2026. You\u2019d best not provoke him again, he has an impressive amount of power backing him. Oh, right. You wouldn\u2019t believe the latest gossip. Rumor has it that his fiancee, Chu Yuyan from the Violet Fate Sect, is intimately involved with some stranger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news is out, and all the Sects have heard about it. There was an eyewitness who saw Chu Yuyan wearing the clothing of some other man. There was obviously something shady going on\u2026. Who do you think that guy could be? Whoever he is, I sure admire him. He was able to steal Chu Yuyan right from under Wang Tengfei\u2019s nose\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao wasn\u2019t able to get a word in edgewise. When the topic of Chu Yuyan came up, a strange expression suddenly appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he thought, \u201cthat Zhou Daya fellow did exactly as I predicted and immediately began to spread rumors\u2026.\u201d He gave a dry cough, not admitting to anything. Instead, he said, \u201cWow, that guy really is amazing. I hope I have a chance to meet him some day and maybe be friends.\u201d His face was covered with an expression of admiration similar to Chen Fan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>About this time, the clear sound of a sword could be heard ringing out in the air. Meng Hao looked up to see a Solitary Sword Sect disciple off in the distance, clearly urging them to hurry up.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage in the break in Chen Fan\u2019s dialogue, Meng Hao scratched his head and said, \u201cElder Brother, maybe you should\u2026.\u201d Before he could finish, he was submerged by more words from Chen Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother, have you found a suitable beloved yet?\u201d he said suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao stared in shock. Chen Fan\u2019s question seemed to have come completely out of the blue. Before he could respond, Chen Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I understand. You\u2019re still hung up on Elder Sister Xu. Junior Brother, listen to me carefully. There are a lot of female Cultivators in the Southern Domain, but there are four who are considered to be the most dazzling.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Yuyan is one of them, but you might as well forget about her. She belongs to Wang Tengfei and that other mysterious guy. However, the other three are really a match for your good looks and Cultivation base.\u201d Chen Fan\u2019s eyes shined brightly as he looked at Meng Hao. He sounded almost like a match-maker.</p><br/><p>This topic completely exceeded Meng Hao\u2019s powers of prediction. He stared blankly at Elder Brother Chen. How could he have imagined that after all these years, Elder Brother Chen would suddenly have taken up this new interest? Meng Hao cleared his throat a few times. \u201cElder Brother, I\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so shy! Look, your Elder Brother has a lot of experience. There may be some things you don\u2019t understand about this kind of thing, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of everything. There\u2019s still plenty of time, plenty of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 plenty of time, plenty of time\u2026.\u201d Beads of sweat broke out on Meng Hao\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you come with me to the Solitary Sword Sect. When we get there, the two of us can have a proper reunion.\u201d Not even giving Meng Hao a chance to refuse, Chen Fan grabbed him and made to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother, this\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to your Elder Brother, okay? Besides, pretty soon one of the three great Clans, the Song Clan, is going to have a big get-together. They\u2019ve invited Chosen and Dao Children from all over the Southern Domain. I\u2019m going, so why don\u2019t you come along? It will be a good chance to meet some of the current generation of Chosen from the Southern Domain. You just stick with me, and I\u2019ll arrange everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe State of Zhao is gone, and the Reliance Sect is no more. Throughout all these years, what I\u2019ve worried about most is you! A few years ago, I sent someone with a message to find you, but by that time the State of Zhao had disappeared, and I feared that you had been killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not bring that up. Little Junior Brother, even now, what concerns me most is still you.\u201d He looked at Meng Hao earnestly. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own, without a Sect! That won\u2019t do. You listen to your Elder Brother, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s heart filled with warmth that spread out throughout his whole body. Unable to make himself refuse Chen Fan, he slowly nodded his head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m Meng Hao!\u201d said the young man. \u201cThe number one ruler in South Heaven!\u201d His aura scintillated prismatically, and his words caused everything to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber one ruler! Do you know what that means!? It means that in all the lands of South Heaven, nobody dares to provoke me!\u201d The young man lifted his chin, and an arrogant expression covered his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, give him some compensation,\u201d said the \u2018Zhixiang.\u2019 \u201cMy husband is the number one most powerful expert in the lands of South Heaven, with the exception of some of those old-timers. He\u2019s at the peak of all South Heaven, and even ended the great continental war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your trap!\u201d said the young man, glaring and swishing his sleeve. \u201cWhen men talk, the women should stand quietly off to the side!\u201d He glared coldly at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao says what he means and means what he says! Considering that this is your first offense, I\u2019ll let you off with your life, just this one time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wore an odd expression as he looked at this copy of himself talking. Then he looked over at \u2018Zhixiang,\u2019 and smiled. He really couldn\u2019t think of anyone other than the parrot and the meat jelly who could pull off such a mistake-ridden scam.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumably, you\u2019ve heard of my illustrious name,\u201d the young man continued coldly. \u201cAlright, forget it. I\u2019m not going to make things any harder for you. Just hand over your bag of holding, and I\u2019ll allow you to use material goods as your form of apology!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare to resist, then you will be buried here this very day!\u201d Once again, his aura burst out explosively, transforming into a tempest that swept across the land. Anyone who sensed such an aura would immediately feel incredible distress. It was as if some amorphous volcano were rumbling, and if one attempted to fight back against it, it would erupt, and one would instantly be killed.</p><br/><p>The remnants of the spell formations outside of the Immortal\u2019s cave were now completely destroyed. Sand and pebbles raged into a sandstorm; mountains collapsed and fissures covered the surface of the land. The intense aura caused a riot of colors to flash through the sky. Even Meng Hao couldn\u2019t stop his eyes from widening.</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t absolutely sure that the two fellows in front of him were the meat jelly and the parrot, if he wasn\u2019t completely familiar with the two dunces, then he would surely be thoroughly intimidated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, how do you know this is my first offense?\u201d said Meng Hao with an enigmatic smile.</p><br/><p>The young man gaped, as did \u2018Zhixiang.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d roared the young man. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this ISN\u2019T your first offense!? This is ridiculous!!\u201d He waved his sleeve once again, causing the ground to quake and mountains to collapse as his aura surged up. He looked as if he was just about to smash Meng Hao into oblivion, but then forcibly restrained himself.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s current manner caused the bird-like man\u2019s heart to begin to pound. Suddenly, he had a bad feeling. After exchanging a glance with the \u2018Zhixiang,\u2019 he snorted coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently, you still don\u2019t understand Meng Hao! Do you know who my dad is? He\u2019s Fang Xiufeng!\u201d Inwardly, the bird-like man was quite pleased with himself for assuming a role that was essentially the most powerful in all of South Heaven. In recent days, after assuming the visage of Meng Hao, he had learned about Fang Xiufeng from some other members of the Fang Clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cScared yet?\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat, then blinked somewhat bashfully. \u201cAre you really Meng Hao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Meng Hao, would never change my surname OR my given name!\u201d the young man said proudly. \u201cOf course I\u2019m Meng Hao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao shook his head. \u201cI heard that Meng Hao can stomp his foot down so hard that the ground shatters. Can you do that? I don\u2019t really believe that you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe!?\u201d raged the young man, glaring at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d replied Meng Hao decisively.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! You actually don\u2019t believe!\u201d Howling, the young man stamped his foot onto the ground. Shockingly, the Immortal\u2019s cave collapsed, the ground quaked and a huge fissure spread out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what about that? Believe me now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just one single fissure,\u201d Meng Hao said with disdain. \u201cI\u2019m talking about shattering the earth and making a huge crater. Meng Hao can do that, what about you? Ah, forget about it. I know you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAGGGHHHH! You\u2019re really pissing me off! You really don\u2019t believe!? Dammit! Alright, pay attention. Watch and see whether Lord Fif\u2014 er, Meng Hao can do it or not!!\u201d The young man\u2019s eyes were completely bloodshot. There was nothing he hated more than people disbelieving him, nothing dismayed him more than a provocation. He suddenly flew up into the air, then slammed back down into the ground, instantly causing a huge hole to appear.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he looked at the ground in front of him, and then compared it to the vegetation off in the distance.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the young man flew out pompously from within the hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve me now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not deep enough,\u201d sighed Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The young man flew into a rage. His body flickered as he once again slammed down into the hole. A huge boom echoed out, and the land quaked. It almost seemed as if the hole would extend all the way down to the center of the planet; in fact, subterranean fire even shot up out of the hole, along with the young man. He glared at Meng Hao; from the look in his eye, if Meng Hao refused to believe him, he was willing to tear a hole all the way through the lands of South Heaven.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao coughed lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fine, I\u2019m scared. I have a total of ten bags of holding, how many do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll ten!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree! I want three!\u201d cried \u2018Zhixiang,\u2019 whose eyes glittered brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoron! We want ten!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the moron!\u201d the big man roared back. \u201cThree is the biggest number! We want three!\u201d It seemed like a fight was about to break out as \u2018Zhixiang\u2019 glared at the young man. \u201cYou idiot, three bags of holding is a lot! Y-y-you, you want ten? How many is ten? Is it bigger than three, huh?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou IDIOT!\u201d howled the young man. \u201cOf course ten is more than three! Three is nothing! We want ten!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The big man stared in shock.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sighed, and decided to switch conversation partners.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, Miss Fellow Daoist, for some reason, I get the feeling that this husband of yours is acting a bit too much like a bully. No matter how you look at him, he definitely seems to be a bully. Bullies like that should really be converted. I really feel sorry for you.\u201d To any other cultivator, these words would be incredibly childish and essentially wouldn\u2019t have convinced anyone. It was so obvious that he wanted to stir up dissension that he might as well just have told them to fight each other directly.</p><br/><p>Of course, the big man and the young man didn\u2019t pick up on anything strange at all\u2026.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of the big man. Once he heard Meng Hao say the word \u201cbully\u201d a few times, his eyes went wide and filled with a vicious gleam.</p><br/><p>\u201cBully? Dammit! That\u2019s exactly what you are! You can\u2019t do this! You\u2019re immoral! You are far too shameless! I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to convert you!\u201d Howling, the big man pounded toward the young man.</p><br/><p>The young man nervously shot backward, letting out an equally enraged shout. However\u2026 he was slightly quicker on the pickup, and suddenly turned to look at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on! Ol\u2019 Third, wait! Something seems off here\u2026. We can\u2019t start fighting amongst ourselves. Something fishy is going on. Something\u2019s not right. This guy just said a few random sentences, and suddenly we\u2019re fighting!\u201d Murmuring to himself, the young man looked closely at Meng Hao, and only seemed to grow more surprised.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was smiling the same as before as he stood there. He looked at the expression on the young man\u2019s face, and couldn\u2019t help but muse that the parrot actually wasn\u2019t that stupid after all, and had finally picked up on the clues.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that the young man suddenly cried out, \u201cI\u2019ve figured out his identity!! He saw through the flaws in our scam! He used only a few words to get us to fight each other. He\u2019s obviously\u2026 Patriarch Reliance!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man let out a roar of rage, and the big man began to tremble. A popping sound could be heard as Zhixiang disappeared, and the big man reappeared. He gasped, and staggered backward several paces.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Patriarch Reliance!?!?\u201d blubbered the big man. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me! He forced me to change forms! He\u2019s the one who changed into Meng Hao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face darkened. No longer in the mood for fooling around, he gave a cold snort and then removed the bamboo hat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two morons open your eyes wide and see exactly who I am!\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant the bamboo hat left his head, his aura changed completely, and his appearance became clear to the young man and the big man. When they saw Meng Hao\u2019s face, the big man let out a shriek, and a pop could be heard as he transformed into the meat jelly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d he cried, flying away at top speed. \u201cIt\u2019s Meng Hao! He\u2019s caught up to us! Finished! We\u2019re finished! We\u2019re dead for sure. DEAD! It\u2019s all your fault! YOUR fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man shivered and let out a piercing shriek. A pop could be heard as he transformed back into a colorful parrot, within whose claws was gripped a black feather. His wings began to flap furiously as he apparently prepared to use all the power he had left in his body to make his getaway.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! How could you possibly show up here!? This is impossible! How could we run into YOU!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything was in complete chaos. The parrot and the meat jelly shrieked and tried to flee at top speed. As soon as they attempted to make their escape, the land in the area distorted and returned to how it looked before. There was no fissure in the ground, no hole, no Immortal\u2019s cave, not even any fearsome restrictive spells.</p><br/><p>There had never been an Immortal\u2019s cave in the area, only a valley. Everything had been an illusion, a very realistic illusion.</p><br/><p>The source of the entire illusion was the black feather that the parrot gripped in its talons. The feather gave off a bizarre, flickering glow, a power that would influence the area around it and create illusions.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao watched as the parrot and meat jelly attempted to flee. He made no move to pursue them, but instead stood there and coldly said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you three breaths of time to get back here. Whoever returns first will be exempt from punishment. The other will receive double punishment for abandoning me in my moment of crisis that year.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as his voice rang out, the meat jelly and the parrot came to a stop in midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d thought the parrot, \u201cthat meat jelly has a completely one-track mind. That idiot will definitely be fooled by this. That means that the safest thing is for Lord Fifth to be fooled first!\u201d Immediately, he turned around and shot toward Meng Hao as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>The meat jelly trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat parrot is completely crafty. He was the cause of all of this! He was the one who incited me to flee in the first place. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll take his punishment for him!\u201d Almost in the same instant that the parrot turned around, the air surrounding the meat jelly began to crackle with lightning. He employed all the power he could muster to shoot back toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI surrender!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge! I also surrender!\u201d</p><br/><p>The parrot and the meat jelly shot back toward Meng Hao urgently. Meng Hao gave a cold snort and suddenly lifted his right hand up into the air, within which appeared the copper mirror. The parrot squawked, transforming into a beam of light that shot into the mirror.</p><br/><p>As for the black feather, it floated down into Meng Hao\u2019s hand. The meat jelly was trembling as it began to cry out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, Lord Third has missed you to death! It was that damned parrot who dragged me with him when he left that year! It\u2019s his fault, master! Let\u2019s convert him together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao slapped out with his right hand, hitting the top of the meat jelly\u2019s head. A boom could be heard as it shrank down into a tiny ball that Meng Hao grabbed in his hand then tossed down toward the ground. The ground trembled as a huge crater appeared. The meat jelly let out a miserable shriek as it bounced up and Meng Hao grabbed it again. As he proceeded forward, he bounced the meat jelly down again and again, causing it to let out continuous screeches.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit faking,\u201d said Meng Hao, causing the meat jelly\u2019s screams to instantly turn into entreaties.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

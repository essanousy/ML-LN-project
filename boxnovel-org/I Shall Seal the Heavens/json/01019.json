Before losing the flying dagger, he actually hadn\u2019t cared about it very much. But now that it wasn't his anymore, countless memories about it suddenly flooded into his mind.</p><br/><p>Every memory that surfaced filled his heart with pain.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao pretended not to hear as he lifted his hand and waved his finger a few more times, employing the Seventh Hex. Patriarch Reliance\u2019s scalp went numb as Meng Hao then switched to the Sixth Hex.</p><br/><p>Glittering light could be seen as numerous magical symbols appeared on Patriarch Reliance\u2019s body. Next, another magical symbol appeared on his forehead, a symbol which was different than Meng Hao\u2019s own Sixth Hex.</p><br/><p>When Meng Hao saw it, he suddenly understood everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAha! Somebody else already used the Sixth Hex on you!</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I guess I\u2019ll try out the Fifth Hex!\u201d Looking very excited, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand; shockingly, a tiny rift appeared in his palm. When Patriarch Reliance saw it, he was nearly scared out of his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMENG HAO!!!\u201d he howled miserably.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d howled Patriarch Reliance. \u201cJust what do you think you\u2019re going to do!? You\u2019re pushing things TOO FAR!!\u201d His body trembled violently, and he seemed to be on the verge of going mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear there\u2019s nobody who bullies people worse than you! Unlucky? I've got enough bad luck for eight lifetimes! I was bullied by the League of Demon Sealers back in the day, and now I\u2019m getting bullied by you!</p><br/><p>\u201cI ran all the way to Planet East Victory to hide from you, you know!? You think that was easy, huh? You think it was a walk in the park!?!?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing!? You already stole my treasured dagger! W-what!? What are you doing? Come on, tell me! Do you know how old I am?! I'm your Patriarch, remember!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao scratched his head, starting to feel a bit awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, how about this,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cIf you take me to the Nine Seas God World, I\u2019ll let you go for the time being. Then you\u2019ll have another chance to hide from me.\u201d He still happened to have the jade slip given to him during the Three Great Daoist Societies\u2019 trial by fire, the one that was supposed to take him to the Nine Seas God World. Unfortunately, Fang Shoudao had somehow found out about that, and had managed to negate the jade slip, making it useless.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance suddenly quieted down. After a moment of thought, he bitterly nodded his head. Of course, inwardly, he felt quite pleased, and was even laughing coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little bastard is still a bit inexperienced. I\u2019m adept at scheming and have deep foresight, so how could I possibly acquiesce to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Outwardly, he sighed and allowed Meng Hao to stand on him as he headed toward the Ninth Sea. After flying for a short time, however, Meng Hao lifted his right hand and caused a Fifth Hex rift to appear in his palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch,\u201d he asked with an enigmatic smile, \u201care you trying to take me into the Ruins of Immortality?\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance suddenly trembled, and his heart filled with rage. However, when he thought about Meng Hao\u2019s restrictive spells, he once again began to bemoan his plight to himself as he immediately changed directions to skirt the Ruins of Immortality.</p><br/><p>Based on his current speed, it wouldn't take very long for him to get Meng Hao to the Ninth Sea.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao beamed at Patriarch Reliance as he slapped his bag of holding, causing the parrot to fly out. The meat jelly was attached to its foot as usual, and the jingling of a bell could be heard when the two of them appeared.</p><br/><p>As soon as the parrot flew out, it looked Patriarch Reliance up and down, then blinked and squawked, \u201cEee? What a big turtle! So strange! How come he seems so familiar?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it's you! I remember now! You're that big ol\u2019 turtle from the Milky Way Sea!!\u201d The parrot was now very excited. It flew out next to Patriarch Reliance\u2019s head and said, \u201cYou know, I was always very curious about what you ate to get so big! You\u2019re huge! Come come, tell Lord Fifth, and you\u2019ll get a reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Not wanting to be outdone, the meat jelly bellowed, \u201cHey, Lord Third has rewards too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stood on Patriarch Reliance\u2019s head, completely ignoring the parrot and the meat jelly as they harassed Patriarch Reliance. With the two of them dogging the turtle, Meng Hao wasn\u2019t the least bit worried about any tricks he might attempt to pull.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that he turned back to look at the State of Zhao. A look of reminiscence appeared on his face as he took a step forward and then vanished. When he reappeared, he was on a mountain peak somewhere in the State of Zhao.</p><br/><p>The mountain looked different than the way he remembered it. It had been moved and been transformed throughout the years, but it was still the same mountain that he remembered... Mount Daqing.</p><br/><p>He stood there, recalling the past. He was currently standing in the same location he had been when he first stepped into the cultivation world, when he had met Xu Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMount Daqing....\u201d he whispered with a sigh. As he looked down the mountain, he noticed that the river that had been there once was now nowhere to be seen. He turned his head again and saw that Yunjie County had also disappeared; it would never again exist.</p><br/><p>The only thing left was this mountain, and the memories of Meng Hao's that it contained.</p><br/><p>After standing there quietly for a long, long time, he stepped out off the mountain. As he floated there, he could see that same cave from long ago, which still existed on the side of the mountain.</p><br/><p>After another long moment, he sighed and turned. Instead of leaving the State of Zhao, he went to the North Sea. Despite the vast changes to the lands, which left the entire State of Zhao different than before, this lake was still here, just as it had been.</p><br/><p>The water was calm and mirror-like, and when Meng Hao looked at it, he recalled all the events which had occurred in connection with the lake. Eventually, he caught sight of an actual boat out on the water. It was an old vessel, and an old man could be seen at the till, who looked at Meng Hao as he steered the boat toward the shore.</p><br/><p>A pot of alcohol was being warmed inside the boat, and a moment later, a beautiful young woman stuck her head out of the cabin and looked over at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember my name?\u201d she asked with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuyiding Tri-Rain,\u201d he replied, smiling. As he stepped forward onto the boat, the old man smiled and bowed at the waist, then continued to steer the boat out across the water. The young woman sat across from Meng Hao, lifted up the pot of alcohol, and poured a cup. [1. The North Sea lake and Guyiding Tri-rain were introduced in book 1. Meng Hao was helped by the lake in his advancement through the Qi Condensation level, which happened in chapter 44. It brought him back to life after he was defeated in battle by Ding Xin of the Violet Fate. That battle started in chapter 65. He eventually met Guyiding Tri-rain in chapter 89, and it was what she told him that helped him deal with Patriarch Reliance in chapter 95.]</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember what you promised me?\u201d she asked, her eyes glistening as brightly as the waters of the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cI promised that one day, I would help you become a sea,\u201d he said. Smiling, he raised his cup and then drained it.</p><br/><p>The young woman smiled radiantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to become a huge, calm sea,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be any waves or tides. I want to be peaceful. Peaceful and quiet. A sea like a mirror.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many things have you promised to do in your life?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour,\u201d he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd how many of those promises have you fulfilled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, doesn\u2019t that mean I\u2019ll have to wait a lot longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled, raised his glass again, and took another drink.</p><br/><p>Almost in the same moment that Meng Hao and Guyding Tri-Rain were reunited, something happened not too far away from where they were in the starry sky. The same ship appeared that all of the cultivators of the Ninth Mountain and Sea had been unable to detect.</p><br/><p>Two people sat on the ship, one older and one younger, who had watched as Meng Hao opened the Door of Immortality, and then his Immortal meridians. The old man was looking out into the starry sky, where he could see Meng Hao and Patriarch Reliance. At that point, his eyes shone with a strange light, as well as interest toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Next to him sat the young man, upon whose face could be seen a look of scorn.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man and a turtle,\u201d the young man said with a sneer. \u201cHow well-suited for each other. And then there\u2019s that parrot. They all match each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man is no simple man,\u201d the old man said calmly. \u201cAnd that turtle is no simple turtle. As for that parrot, well... it\u2019s not just a simple parrot either.\u201d He looked over at the young man, and he seemed somewhat disappointed, but didn't say anything further.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not simple?\u201d the young man said loftily. \u201cAlright, so he opened the maximum number of Immortal meridians, and even became the Immortal Realm Paragon. However, there are tons of people like that in our Spiritstar Realm! They might not actually be Immortals, but... Immortals are worth squat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe's a true Immortal,\u201d the old man said with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue Immortal? What a joke! Isn't this the same Paragon Immortal Realm that, years ago, innumerable almighty beings viewed with such desire? But now look at it! The only things left are nine mountains!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I wanted to kill that guy, all I would have to do is wave my hand, and he would be dead!\u201d Killing intent flickered in the young man\u2019s eyes. Apparently, he felt that killing Meng Hao would be as easy as crushing an ant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI might as well target this guy for my training\u2026. I need to kill an Immortal and bring that person\u2019s head back to the Spiritstar Realm\u2026. I imagine they\u2019ll make it into a battle trophy.\u201d The young man licked his lips. [2. A note about the word Realm: The word Realm used here is the one that refers to a \u201cworld\u201d or even \u201cdimension.\u201d It\u2019s the same word we\u2019ve seen in the term \u201cMountain and Sea Realm\u201d that has already appeared in the story. The Chinese word for the Realms of cultivation (Spirit Realm, Immortal Realm, Ancient Realm, Dao Realm) is different. In most situations the difference is clear from the context of the story.]</p><br/><p>Cold light gleamed in the old man\u2019s eyes as he looked over at the young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe's a true Immortal, not the type from this age, but rather, the type from primordial times. He embodies what Immortals truly are, the type that in ancient times, could descend to our Spiritstar Realm and cause everyone in the world to bow in worship.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, our Spiritstar Realm was nothing more than one of the 3,000 Realms below the Paragon Immortal Realm. When the Paragon Immortal Realm collapsed due to various reasons, the role that our world played was microscopic!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look down on that turtle, and think it\u2019s ordinary. But you know what? When I look at it, it frightens me!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can sense some terrifying undulations coming off of that thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd finally, about that man you so look down upon... don\u2019t tell me you can't detect that there\u2019s something about him connecting him directly to the Nine Mountains and Seas?!?!\u201d As the man spoke, his wording grew sharper and sharper. By the end, he was clearly rebuking the young man.</p><br/><p>The young man sat there quietly, his face slowly growing blue with rage. He didn't dare to backtalk, but when he lowered his head, his eyes were venomously icy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this place has crumbled down to its present level,\u201d continued the old man, \u201cyou cannot rashly provoke the people here! Actually, I never wanted to come face the dangers of this place, but since your father insisted, I brought you here for your Immortal-Killing Baptism\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was forced to agree, and here we are. If you want to try to kill that man, I won't stop you. However, your father will be able to see all the records of our journey, and cannot blame me... if you seek your own death!\u201d As his cold words rang out, the old man waved his right hand, causing a vortex to appear up ahead. Within the vortex was an image of Li Ling\u2019er, who was currently in the middle of fleeing from her wedding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl is a bit weaker, and is also an Immortal. Why don't you kill her for your Baptism?\u201d As the old man spoke, the young man looked up at Li Ling\u2019er within the vortex, and his eyes began to shine with a strange light.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, she\u2019s pretty. Master, you wouldn't mind if, before killing her, I indulged in the... services... of an Immortal, would you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man frowned and looked a bit disgusted, but didn't say anything.</p><br/><p>The young man licked his lips, and then stepped toward the vortex.</p><br/><p>Li Ling\u2019er sat cross-legged atop a flying shuttle which sped through the stars. She was also heading toward the Ninth Sea, although not to the Nine Seas God World, but rather, to find an island where she could practice cultivation.</p><br/><p>She hoped to borrow some of the power of the Ninth Sea to stabilize herself in the Immortal Realm.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t unfamiliar with the Ninth Sea, considering that she had been there on clan training on several occasions in the past. To her, this would all be a walk in the park. However, all of a sudden, the starry sky up ahead distorted, and a vortex suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>An arrogant young man stepped out of the vortex, and as soon as he looked over at her, an evil and bizarre glow could be seen in his eyes, almost as if he were a hunter looking at prey.</p><br/><p>Li Ling\u2019er\u2019s eyes instantly flickered with vigilance. She had never seen this young man before, but she could instantly sense that he was dangerous. Furthermore, the way he was looking at her didn't please her one bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Immortal beauty! Remember my name! I'm Zheng Linfa! You can call me Yi Fazi! [1. Zheng Linfa\u2019s name in Chinese is zh\u00e8ng l\u00edn f\u01ce. Zheng is a family name. Lin means \u201cforest\u201d and Fa is a character that can mean many things including \u201claw,\u201d \u201cmagic,\u201d and \u201cDharma.\u201d Yi Fazi is a somewhat strange name that appears to be some sort of nickname. y\u012b f\u01ce z\u01d0. Yi means \u201cone.\u201d Fa is the same character from his name. Zi means \u201cson\u201d or \u201cchild.\u201d It's a weird name, and I think it\u2019s some sort of name/nickname pattern made up by Er Gen. You might remember a character from earlier in the book named Yi Chenzi (small-headed guy), whose name followed a similar pattern. I think there was even another minor character with a similar name. Despite consulting with several people, searching online, etc., I couldn\u2019t find any information on the name structure, which is what leads me to believe it might be something made up by Er Gen.]</p><br/><p>\"Remember it because, very soon, I'll provide you with the most unforgettable experience of your whole life! And also... the last!\" the young man said with a smile. He stepped toward Li Ling\u2019er.</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1019: The Hunting of Li Ling\u2019er!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

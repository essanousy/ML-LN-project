There was no more violet rain, but the sky was still dark and overcast. Suddenly, bolts of lightning could be seen approaching from off in the distance.</p><br/><p>As the lighting neared, astonishingly, countless Tribulation clouds began to roil into being. More and more Tribulation clouds could be seen, which caused the Violet Sea to be whipped into a frenzy. A massive aura of death began to emanate off of it.</p><br/><p>The aura seemed as if it were preparing to fight back against the Tribulation Lightning. Instantly, an archaic madness seemed to be rising up!</p><br/><p>The Cultivators in the ten outposts that had been built up over the past years all looked up into the sky with expressions of astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that\u2026 Tribulation Lightning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me someone is transcending Tribulation? How could that be possible? Only Immortals can transcend Tribulation. How could there be someone in the great Western desert who could transcend Tribulation?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t someone transcending Tribulation. Obviously a precious treasure is appearing in the world!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such scenes played out in all of the ten outposts. However\u2026 the Tribulation Lightning over the Violet Sea was actually only detectable by the people actually in the area of the Violet Sea. Cultivators in the Black Lands seemed to be cut off and unable to detect it, even Spirit Severing Cultivators.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that in the second outpost, inside of a lofty building, a bare-chested, middle-aged man was embracing a beautiful female Cultivator. As they chatted and laughed, he occasionally caressed her body with his hands. Her coy reaction caused his desire to grow stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>Behind the man, seven old men sat cross-legged. Their eyes were closed and they did not speak, as if they didn\u2019t even notice the obscene sounds that could be heard in the room. The seven old men had incredible Cultivation bases. Four were in the mid-Nascent Soul stage, two were in the late Nascent Soul stage, and one was of the great circle!</p><br/><p>Cultivators like these were the most powerful you could find under the Spirit Severing stage. This was especially so in an age when it was not a simple thing to reach the Spirit Severing Stage; Cultivators of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage could completely rock the world.</p><br/><p>Right now, though, it was clear that these seven men were nothing more than a retinue!</p><br/><p>There was only one type of person who could make Cultivators of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage to act as a retinue. That would be\u2026 a Spirit Severing Patriarch! The middle-aged man\u2019s Cultivation base was only at the early Nascent Soul stage, not the Spirit Severing stage. That meant that this man\u2019s status was shockingly high!</p><br/><p>This man was the son of Spirit Severing Patriarch Huyan Yunming of the Heavenly Pursuit Tribe, one of the three powers of the Heavenly Court Alliance! Huyan Qing! He had left the Black Lands three months ago to go sightseeing in the ten outposts and chase after women. [1]</p><br/><p>Just as Huyan Qing was about to throw himself on the female Cultivator, a bolt of red lightning suddenly shot through the air and then headed off into the distance. Before it disappeared, an enormous, intense pressure could be felt. Instantly, the seven old men all opened their eyes. The red-robed old man of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage slowly lifted his head and looked off into the distance, frowning.</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through Huyan Qing and he suddenly looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiracle Lightning? Don\u2019t tell me some precious treasure has suddenly appeared? Or maybe some neo-demon is transforming?\u201d Huyan Qing laughed heartily. Suddenly, he leaped up into the air, holding the shocked woman in one arm as he flicked his sleeve with the other. Instantly, four black-robed bodyguards appeared bearing a luxurious sedan chair on their shoulders.</p><br/><p>Huyan Qing immediately entered the sedan chair, taking the woman with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Wu, let\u2019s go take a look, alright?\u201d His laughter mixed with the gasp of the female Cultivator as she saw the sumptuous interior of the sedan chair.</p><br/><p>The man who Huyan Qing referred to as Sir Wu was the old man of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage. He frowned and let out a quiet sigh. Slowly, he stood up and, along with the other six old men, escorted the sedan chair off.</p><br/><p>Huyan Qing\u2019s procession headed off in the direction the lightning had flown, which was of course the location where Meng Hao stood at the bottom of the sea. Currently, Meng Hao\u2019s expression was grim as he looked at the six Nascent Souls flying around the level of his head. He frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLongevity of one hundred years\u2026. Not even two hundred. Well, I\u2019m already at the peak of the late Nascent Soul stage. I guess I have to reach Spirit Severing within a hundred years!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, as for this Resurrection Lily\u2026.\u201d A cold smile suddenly twisted his lips. He had long since predicted that the Resurrection Lily would not let a crucial moment in his cultivation pass without trying to make a move.</p><br/><p>He knew that it would appear!</p><br/><p>Originally he thought it would attempt to possess him when the Heavenly Tribulation hit. However, apparently it thought right now was the best opportunity.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you to appear right now is actually quite convenient! If Heavenly Tribulation really does come, you could cause me quite a bit of frustration.\u201d Smiling coldly, he sat down cross-legged. Ignoring the Resurrection Lily\u2019s explosive rise, he lifted his hand and pointed at one of the Nascent Souls.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the Metal Nascent Soul floated down. Its face was covered with a cold smile just like Meng Hao\u2019s as it sank down into the top of his head. It sank down to appear in the empty space in his dantian region that his Gold Core had previously occupied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll give you a chance to\u2026 have a full on fight!\u201d As Meng Hao closed his eyes, majestic Cultivation base power exploded out from the Metal Nascent Soul to crush down onto the Resurrection Lily.</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Lily seemed to go mad and it let out a soundless roar. Shockingly, directly behind Meng Hao appeared the image of a blindingly bright four-colored Resurrection Lily, swaying back and forth ferociously.</p><br/><p>It was in this moment that the Resurrection Lily seized control of Meng Hao\u2019s legs. Meng Hao lost all feeling in them as the struggle for control over his body erupted. The feeling quickly spread into his arms.</p><br/><p>The four-colored Resurrection Lily swayed back and forth in a very bizarre fashion. It seemed as if it had been preparing for many years to make this counterattack against Meng Hao. When it made its move, it would attack with complete ruthlessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to give you some credit,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. \u201cYou\u2019re much better this time than you were before.\u201d After all this time, he was very familiar with the Resurrection Lily, and knew that it was sentient.</p><br/><p>Even as he spoke, the Wood Nascent Soul began to emanate a green light as it sank into the top of Meng Hao\u2019s head. It quickly reached his dantian region, whereupon Meng Hao unhesitatingly superimposed it over the Metal Nascent Soul. The two\u2026 combined into one!</p><br/><p>As soon as the two Nascent Souls combined into one, a roaring sound filled Meng Hao\u2019s mind. He instantly felt his Cultivation base\u2026 rising up rapidly!!</p><br/><p>He was still in the late Nascent Soul stage. Despite not having made a breakthrough, he could sense that his battle prowess\u2026. had exploded upward by double or more!</p><br/><p>At the moment, Meng Hao wasn\u2019t surprised. That was because\u2026 this was the power of a Perfect Nascent Soul, a power that placed him above anyone else in the same stage!</p><br/><p>However, in unison with his sudden increase in battle prowess, Meng Hao could tell that the corrosive effect on his longevity, which previously was limited to a multiple of six, was now even greater.</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Lily let out another soundless roar as its struggling increased in intensity. Whereas before, it had occupied a position of incredible superiority, it was now forced to defend relentlessly against Meng Hao. It did not want to allow Meng Hao to retake the parts of his body that it had already possessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is merely a combination of two Nascent Souls\u2026.\u201d said Meng Hao, his eyes glittering. Suddenly, the Water Nascent Soul floated down, emanating a red glow as it sank into the top of his head. Moments later it appeared in his dantian region where it superimposed over the Metal and Wood Nascent Souls. They fused together, three Nascent Souls combining into one.</p><br/><p>BOOOMMM!!!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could clearly sense his battle prowess climbing up with incredible intensity from the foundation of the early combination of two Nascent Souls.</p><br/><p>Originally, he had possessed the power equivalent to only a single Nascent Soul. As of this moment, though, his power was equivalent to four peak late stage Nascent Souls! In addition, the wasting away of his longevity was also increased.</p><br/><p>This was not an increase in Cultivation base, but rather, battle prowess. It was natural strength, arisen from the ability to use spiritual power. This increase could be likened to water in a bottle. The bottle might not get bigger, but more water could be forced inside, creating a pressure that exceeded anything normal!</p><br/><p>The Resurrection Lily was emitting a piercing howl. The sound of it could not be heard by any outsider, only Meng Hao, who could hear it quite clearly. The Resurrection Lily was completely incapable of standing up to the power of Meng Hao\u2019s three combined elements. It instantly lost control of Meng Hao\u2019s arms, and was forced to retreat back to its position within Meng Hao\u2019s possessed legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to expend much effort to suppress you,\u201d said Meng Hao coolly. \u201cAfter all, this is a direct conflict, and you aren\u2019t even close to being a match for me! What makes you think you\u2019re qualified to even TRY to possess me!?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are me, but I\u2026 am not you!\u201d A sea of flames erupted from the Fire Nascent Soul as it floated down and merged into his body. It then appeared in his dantian region, where it overlapped and then combined with the Metal, Wood, and Water Nascent Souls.</p><br/><p>Shocking rumbling sounds caused Meng Hao\u2019s entire body to shake. Blue veins popped up all over as blood rushed through them at high speed. His body suddenly began to expand. It appeared as if he were taller. Although he was still slender, it seemed as if every bit of his flesh and blood was virtually bursting with terrifying power.</p><br/><p>His battle prowess\u2026 doubled once again!!</p><br/><p>In this moment, he now possessed the same power as eight Nascent Souls at the peak of the late stage. The power of four combined elements exploded out, causing the Resurrection Lily to writhe and let out a miserable shriek. It was easily pushed back once again by suppressive power, losing control over Meng Hao\u2019s legs and being forced into his most remote extremities.</p><br/><p>However, even in the moment in which it retreated back as far as it could, an aura rose up from the Resurrection Lily that caused Meng Hao\u2019s pupils to constrict.</p><br/><p>The aura grew more and more powerful, and even seemed to contain some remnants of the One Color Soul Procurement Pill. Suddenly, the four-colored Resurrection Lily which Meng Hao had suppressed to the limit began to glow\u2026 and then develop\u2026</p><br/><p>A fifth color!!</p><br/><p>When the fifth color appeared, Meng Hao\u2019s mind and heart trembled. But then, his eyes glowed with pleasant surprise. He knew that this Resurrection Lily was incomplete, and could never grow to the point where it could bloom with seven colors and reach Immortal Ascension. Three colors was its limit. It had acquired four colors by means of a miracle. But now\u2026 it actually developed a fifth color. [1. The Resurrection Lily got its fourth color in chapter 205]</p><br/><p>This fifth color obviously had something to do with Meng Hao\u2019s Nascent Soul concocting and the One Color Soul Procurement Pill, as well as his place in the realm of Perfection. Because of all of these different things, the Resurrection Lily was suddenly able to make a meteoric rise.</p><br/><p>When the fifth flower petal appeared on the Resurrection Lily, it let out a fierce howl and then erupted out from its position of retreat. It expanded out, clearly wanting to take control of Meng Hao\u2019s entire body in possession. It wanted to control Meng Hao and make him a true host that it could control!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could feel the madness of the Resurrection Lily, and it caused him to smile. He wanted it to grow more powerful, because he had long since decided to use this Resurrection Lily at the critical moment when his time came in the future to reach Immortal Ascension!</p><br/><p>Even as the Resurrection Lily exploded out with power, Meng Hao lifted his head up. The Earth Nascent Soul suddenly erupted with shocking coldness. It merged in through Meng Hao\u2019s forehead, appearing moments later in his dantian region. Five elements overlapped. Five elements\u2026 combined!</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 524: Five Colored Resurrection Lily!</strong></p><br/><p></p><ol><li><span id=\"footnote-1\">Huyan Yunming\u2019s name in Chinese is  h\u016b y\u00e1n y\u00fan m\u00edng.

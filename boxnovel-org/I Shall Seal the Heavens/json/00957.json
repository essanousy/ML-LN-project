In the instant in which she slammed into the door, the various clans and sects throughout the Ninth Mountain and Sea could sense a sudden change in the Heavens.</p><br/><p>The change was not drastic; it was merely a slight strengthening in the Immortal qi of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. However, the change was like slight ripples on a glassy surface of water, and was detectable by many.</p><br/><p>It was most obvious in the areas around the Door of Immortality in the Ninth Sea. There, the Immortal qi surged as a great Dao descended. Rumbling filled the air, Tribulation Lightning crackled, and mists churned.</p><br/><p>Fan Dong\u2019er was surrounded by Tribulation Lightning as she slammed into the Door of Immortality. Her eyes were filled with determination, and her heart was filled with one thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, I absolutely must surpass you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan Dong\u2019er was the second person in this generation after Pill Demon to attack the Door of Immortality. At the same time, the other Chosen who were in secluded meditation were preparing to emerge and attempt to break through to the true Immortal Realm. They could sense the change in the Immortal qi, but they ignored it. Eyes shining with determination, they continued with their secluded meditation.</p><br/><p>Zhao Yifan currently sat cross-legged in a secret chamber in the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe age of true Immortal Ascension has arrived,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe Three Great Daoist Sects, the Four Great Clans, the Five Holy Lands, the Three Churches and Six Sects\u2026 have been building up power and resources for years, all for the Chosen who will become true Immortals.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey all plan to use their collected resources and dammed-up cultivation to surge forth into the true Immortal Realm. It will be like the saying \u2018The bird is silent, but its first song amazes all men!\u2019\u201d Zhao Yifan\u2019s eyes suddenly opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpening 70 meridians is average. 80 meridians qualifies one to be Chosen. Opening 90 meridians\u2026 makes you the blazing sun of a generation!</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Mu\u2026 I wonder if you will be able to enter this age of true Immortality!?\u201d Zhao Yifan\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly. He had long since recovered from his injuries, as well as from the psychological blow he had suffered. However, he knew that deep within his heart, a shadow lurked, weighing down on him. It had become something like an inner Devil.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao, in his guise as Fang Mu, had become Zhao Yifan\u2019s inner Devil!</p><br/><p>It was with his true identity of Meng Hao that he had become Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s inner Devil!</p><br/><p>Similarly, all of the other Chosen he had encountered in the Ninth Mountain and Sea had inner Devils because of him!</p><br/><p>On Planet East Victory, in the Fang Clan\u2019s ancestral mansion, Fang Wei was trembling. His life force aura occasionally glittered brilliantly, and occasionally went dim. Sometimes his features twisted savagely, while at other times he wore a smile. Strange ripples undulated off of him as he absorbed Immortal qi from the nine withered old men who surrounded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Hao\u2026 true Immortality is upon me. If I fail, then there will no longer be a Fang Wei under the Heavens. However, if I succeed\u2026 then the instant I become a true Immortal, I will cut you down and sever this inner Devil of mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>On Planet North Reed, in the restricted area in the Li Clan, there was a lotus pond. The pond waters were clear, and fish could be seen swimming to and fro. Birdsongs filled the air, along with the fragrance of flowers. It was like a miniature utopia. Li Ling\u2019er sat there cross-legged atop a lotus. Her skin was clear and delicate, and slightly flushed. She wore a simple, plain robe, but it still managed to accentuate her exquisite and alluring body.</p><br/><p>She was also about to break through to the true Immortal Realm!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Wang Mu, Song Luodan, Taiyang Zi, Sun Hai, and many others were in their respective sects and clans, all preparing to break through to the true Immortal Realm.</p><br/><p>As all of these people made their breakthroughs, Meng Hao\u2019s image floated in their minds. Meng Hao\u2026 had become the inner Devil of an entire generation of Chosen.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a young man sat cross-legged on an asteroid floating in the starry sky of the Ninth Mountain and Sea. He wore a black robe, and had long white hair. His features were handsome, and at the same time, ancient.</p><br/><p>Immortal qi swirled around him, and shockingly, he held an Immortality Illumination vine in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Wang Clan\u2026 Wang Mu is the blazing sun, and I have been forgotten. That doesn\u2019t matter. The only thing I need is this Immortality Illumination Vine.\u201d The young man lifted the Immortality Illumination Vine above his head and looked off into space.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, I very much look forward to the day when you and I can meet again\u2026.\u201d This young man was none other than Wang Tengfei!</p><br/><p>At around this time, Wang Youcai, Fatty, Cheng Fan, and all of Meng Hao\u2019s other companions from Planet South Heaven who had scattered out to the various other sects, were all being informed by Senior members of their respective organizations about the matter of true Immortality. All of them were looking up into the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder where Meng Hao is right now\u2026.\u201d Fatty murmured, sounding a bit depressed.</p><br/><p>In the Kunlun Society, Chu Yuyan quietly sat there cross-legged. No Immortal qi swirled around her, but she wasn\u2019t anxious. She had a whole thousand years after true Immortal destiny appeared in which she could achieve her own true Immortal Ascension.</p><br/><p>Although she couldn\u2019t keep up with the first wave, she was confident that she would be able to reach true Immortality in those thousand years.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe age of True Immortality is here\u2026.\u201d murmured Pill Demon, who stood on a nearby mountain boulder. He looked up into the stars.</p><br/><p>At the same moment, another person spoke those same words.</p><br/><p>It was an old man who stood there on Planet South Heaven, in a mountain in the Eastern Lands. He looked up into the Heavens and muttered the exact same sentence.</p><br/><p>That man\u2026 was Shui Dongliu.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was unaware of the stir that had been caused in the Ninth Mountain and Sea due to Fan Dong\u2019er\u2019s Door of Immortality. He continued to sit cross-legged in front of the stone stele in the Ancient Burial Ground, accepting the legacy of the Fifth Hex.</p><br/><p>His aura was incredibly weak, and the flame of his life force seemed to be on the verge of being extinguished. The 100,000 rifts around him were trembling slightly, their cycles of opening and closing becoming more rapid. The Ancient Burial Ground was starting to look even more bizarre than usual.</p><br/><p>Gradually, mist appeared on the ground; it grew thicker as it spread out through the ancestral land, into all of the regions and areas.</p><br/><p>The mist also collected in the Ancient Burial Ground, and was especially thick in the area around Meng Hao. It covered the terracotta soldier, making it invisible even to divine sense.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s figure began to grow blurry.</p><br/><p>Fang Daohong was extremely frightened. He worried that if Meng Hao died, then because of the strange hexing magic, he would also die.</p><br/><p>As he continued to grow more and more frightened, a beam of prismatic light appeared off in the distance. It was another of the black-robed men, who shot in his general direction. Initially, his speed was not particularly fast, but at about thirty thousand meters away, the man seemed to catch sight of something that caused him to accelerate explosively.</p><br/><p>Fang Daohong\u2019s eyes flickered as he turned to look at the man in the beam of light. He shot forward with incredible speed, coming to a stop about three hundred meters away. The man\u2019s face was grim as he looked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Daohong, we\u2019re all in this together, if one of us hogs everything for himself, it will be difficult to explain to the others.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes glittered as he looked further into the Ancient Burial Ground. He saw Meng Hao sitting cross-legged in meditation, mostly covered by mists. He didn\u2019t notice the terracotta soldier, which was now completely enveloped by the mists.</p><br/><p>His eyes sparkled with avarice, then he looked back at Fang Daohong and smiled insincerely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to go in there, I won\u2019t stop you,\u201d Fang Daohong said loftily. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s no need to play with words.\u201d He snorted coldly, acting as he would under normal circumstances.</p><br/><p>The other black-robed man\u2019s eyes flickered as he turned from Fang Daohong to look at Meng Hao. Inwardly, he was a bit hesitant. However, Meng Hao\u2019s current state made it seem like he was on the verge of death; the man was unable to see that he was accepting a legacy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, never mind then. Since you\u2019re waiting patiently, Elder Daohong, then I\u2019ll just wait with you.\u201d With that, he smiled and then sat down cross-legged.</p><br/><p>Fang Daohong showed no reaction whatsoever to this. Inwardly, though, he breathed a sigh of relief. His life was now under Meng Hao\u2019s control, and even if he appeared to be on the verge of dying, Fang Daohong wasn\u2019t about to take any risks. In fact, he was even more nervous than Meng Hao would be; he feared that Meng Hao\u2019s death would result in his own soul dispersing.</p><br/><p>After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, Meng Hao trembled. Blood oozed out of his mouth, and only a tiny spark remained of his flame of life force. His body was now stiff, and he looked as pale as a corpse.</p><br/><p>The rifts around him flickered rapidly as they opened and closed. They were like 100,000 eyes blinking, and left Fang Daohong and the other black-robed man feeling incredibly shocked.</p><br/><p>One of them was nervous. The other one waited in anticipation.</p><br/><p>Around this time, two more beams of light sped along, apparently having detected Meng Hao\u2019s abnormal state. They shot forward with explosive speed until they appeared at the border of the Ancient Burial Ground, where they turned into two black-robed men.</p><br/><p>As soon as they appeared, Fang Daohong\u2019s eyes narrowed. One of the men didn\u2019t pause at all, but rather, instantly shot into the Ancient Burial Ground. Taking advantage of a moment when the rifts were closed, he shot forward about three hundred meters.</p><br/><p>Fang Daohong\u2019s heart began to thump, and the black-robed man who had arrived earlier frowned. After a moment, he also waited until the rifts were closed and then stepped forward into the Ancient Burial Ground.</p><br/><p>The third black-robed man also flickered forward, advancing toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cFang Hao has a valuable treasure! Let\u2019s kill him and get the treasure. We can decide what to do with it afterward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent plan!\u201d After coming to an agreement, the three men waited until the 100,000 rifts closed again, and then advanced at top speed.</p><br/><p>Fang Daohong watched in silence, coldly eyeing the three men as they proceeded into the Ancient Burial Ground. Finally, he decided to join them, although he moved slowly, ensuring that he was bringing up the rear.</p><br/><p>Four men walked in a line, heading ever closer to Meng Hao in the center of the Ancient Burial Ground.</p><br/><p>Enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, in which time the 100,000 rifts opened and closed. Eventually, the two fastest men reached a position about six hundred meters from Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Another tremor ran through Meng Hao at that point, but instead of just a trickle of blood oozing out, Meng Hao coughed up a huge mouthful of blood, and all color drained out of his face. At that point, the flame of his life force actually winked out.</p><br/><p>In that moment, the rifts in the area all shuddered and closed, leaving a clear path all the way to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>With the exception of Fang Daohong, who was still extremely anxious and feared that he was about to die, the black-robed men\u2019s eyes all glowed with greed. They had been acting very cautiously before, but that seemed to be forgotten as they exploded with speed. Rumbling filled the air as they closed in on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>However, when the two black-robed men in the lead were only about thirty meters away, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes suddenly snapped open. They were bloodshot, and his gaze was as sharp as a blade, filled with naked savagery.</p><br/><p>An indescribably terrifying aura suddenly exploded out from Meng Hao. In that instant, all of the closed rifts in the area suddenly opened simultaneously.</p><br/><p>It was like 100,000 eyes had instantly opened and were looking at the four men!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

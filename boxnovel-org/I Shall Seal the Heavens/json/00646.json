Everyone on the island, including the Cultivators of the Footloose Sect, could hear him clearly.</p><br/><p>Their faces all flickered with various emotions. The people near the battlefield didn\u2019t dare to get too close. Their expressions were that of shock, and they were panting.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao? Who\u2019s that? It sounds like he\u2019s really important in the Footloose Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of person would the Patriarch risk his life to protect? He must be the hope of the whole Footloose Sect! He can\u2019t die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao? I remember! He was an Inner Sect disciple of the Reliance Sect! The Patriarch was right! He\u2019s the highest ranking member of our Sect next to the Patriarch!\u201d The astonished Cultivators immediately committed Patriarch Reliance\u2019s words to heart, engraving them there to remember always.</p><br/><p>Actually, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s words were filled with such realistic emotion that even he was starting to believe them. Tears appeared in his eyes as he roared out. It was at this point that the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch stopped in mid-air, his eyes wide with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you chasing him?\u201d said Patriarch Reliance, blinking. He was now far larger than the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, and had inserted himself between him and Meng Hao. He glared angrily. \u201cKill me, and then you can pass!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance was now fully immersed in the game. To him, it was actually quite fun, and when he spoke, his voice burst with incredible power.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith me here, nobody can hurt Meng Hao!\u201d roared Patriarch Reliance. Of course, inwardly, he was laughing. He wanted the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch to strike him down as quickly as possible, and then go take care of the little bastard. Then he himself would finally be freed.</p><br/><p>However, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of chasing Meng Hao. From his perspective, there was no way for Meng Hao to truly escape; he would catch him sooner or later. However, the Demon beast in front of him was something quite rare.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was rare enough that the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch couldn\u2019t possibly let it go!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an incredible, loyal Demon beast,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIn all my life, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it!\u201d The admiration in his eyes grew stronger as he looked at Patriarch Reliance, nodding and smiling. \u201cFor a Demon beast like this to follow that child is a real pity. Demon turtle, I am the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. Are you willing to be my follower? If so, then from now on, you will be the Divine Beast Dao Protector of the Wang Clan!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day I achieve Immortal Ascension, I will bring you with me into the Heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was just about to press down on the good luck charm when he heard the words of the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. He stopped in place and looked back. When he saw the scene, and especially the trembling Patriarch Reliance, he wanted to laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>He knew Patriarch Reliance, and that he most valued his freedom. In order to get rid of Meng Hao, Patriarch Reliance might be able to forget about some other matters, but as for his freedom\u2026 talking about that was one good way to really piss him off!</p><br/><p>\u201cI never imagined it would play out this way,\u201d thought Meng Hao. \u201cBut I like it. Come on, be a bit more realistic, you old turtle. Keep up the act, I want to see more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance stared with wide eyes for a moment, and then his heart began to pound. He felt like he was about to explode; madness suddenly surged through his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say? What did you call me?\u201d He almost couldn\u2019t believe that someone would try to turn him into a guard beast. Actually, this was the second time such a humiliation had occurred to him since he grew up.</p><br/><p>The first time had been at the hands of the League of Demon Sealers.</p><br/><p>To Patriarch Reliance, the level of irritation this caused him exceeded anything else in the world. His body began to tremble and distort, and it was only because of the little bit of rationality left that he was able to suppress his rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pleased, little Demon turtle?\u201d said the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, his face sinking. He had offered this Demon turtle a rare, moving opportunity. Normally speaking, considering his temper, he would have just instantly killed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge! YOU\u2019RE the Demon turtle!\u201d roared Patriarch Reliance. \u201cEveryone in your whole Wang Clan are all Demon turtles, and you\u2019re the bastard son of a turtle! Do you really dare to try to make me your security guard!?!?!\u201d Moments later, though, he inwardly urged himself to just hold on a little bit longer. All he had to do was hold on, and then great good fortune would come his way.</p><br/><p>By this point, though, his body had grown incredibly blurry. Furthermore, his real body was actually trembling some, causing huge waves to surge out on the sea, along with echoing rumbling sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s beyond your control,\u201d said the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, his voice cool. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing, good. If you\u2019re not willing, it doesn\u2019t matter. When I make a decision, nobody can change it. I\u2019ll put some restrictive spells on you, and then from now on, you\u2019ll be the Demon turtle of my Wang Clan!\u201d Apparently, he felt his own words to be the will of Heaven, like laws and statutes that couldn\u2019t be broken.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was going wild with joy, and almost started laughing out loud. He knew that currently, he could leave at any time he wished. Besides, if Patriarch Reliance couldn\u2019t endure through all this, then Meng Hao didn\u2019t mind facing a bit of danger just to be able to see that happen.</p><br/><p>As the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch spoke, he raised his right hand and performed an incantation. Instantly, thousands of restrictive spell symbols appeared in mid-air. They circulated around in the area to form a huge net, which then shot toward the illusory, turtle-form Patriarch Reliance.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance\u2019s body was blurry, but it was still possible to see how furious he was. His panting sounded like explosions, and his fury\u2026 finally reached the point of detonation!</p><br/><p>His eyes were wide; earlier, he had done everything he could to hold back his rage. But now, he couldn\u2019t suppress even a tiny bit of it. In the blink of an eye\u2026 his fury exploded!</p><br/><p>Thunderous booming sounds echoed out in all directions as Patriarch Reliance lifted his head up and let out an unprecedented howl of rage!</p><br/><p>\u201cAAARRGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!\u201d In this moment, he didn\u2019t care about Meng Hao or the Demon Sealing Sect. All he cared about was the towering rage he felt from being offended in such a way.</p><br/><p>Such overt humiliation made him think back to how he had felt being restricted by the League of Demon Sealers. It was like an old wound had been ripped open. Patriarch Reliance\u2019s rage filled his mind, and he roared again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Dammit\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe League of Demon Sealers is one thing, but you, tiny child, you actually dare to humiliate the Patriarch!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Reliance was so immersed in his rage that he completely forgot about the act from before. His eyes were bright red, and the entirety of Saint\u2019s Island was shaking violently. The land quaked, as if some enormous creature were waking up beneath it.</p><br/><p>The surrounding seawater was covered with massive, roaring waves, as if the sea in the area was about to explode.</p><br/><p>Far beneath Saint\u2019s Island, deep in the blackness of the sea, something like two oil lamps suddenly appeared. They were bloodshot, and filled with madness, the madness instigated by old wounds being ripped open. It was a madness stemming from humiliation.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Huge fissures ripped open in the land. The sky grew dark, wild colors flashed about, and the sea raged. All of these sudden changes caused the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch\u2019s face to fall.</p><br/><p>However, before he could even make a single move, an aura exploded up from deep within the sea. The aura was filled with intense rage, and as soon as it appeared, it caused even the air to be shredded. It seemed as if Saint\u2019s Island were being ripped out from the very world.</p><br/><p>As soon as the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch sensed the aura, his face completely filled with shock. He immediately took a deep breath and then flew up into the air, his face pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cImmortal!!\u201d he said, his voice faint.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the aura of an Immortal!!</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic Qi like an Immortal. This is the will of a Demon Immortal!\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep, growling voice could suddenly be heard from within the ground, causing the earth to shake and mountains to tremble. \u201cYou actually dare to call the Patriarch a Demon turtle? You actually dare try to make me your security guard!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice came up from the ground and from within the sea. The seawater churned and seethed and began to spin around Saint\u2019s Island until it transformed into a huge vortex.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually dare to try to put restrictive spells on me! Are you\u2026 worthy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM!!</p><br/><p>The sea exploded up, causing water to shower about in all directions. A huge force seemed to shoot up into the sky, and at the same time, a gargantuan head became visible within the sheets of water. It stretched out to blot out the entire sky. Its shadow was so huge that it could obstruct both the sun and the moon. It covered over everything!</p><br/><p>It was the colossal head of a vicious turtle, its skin covered with wrinkles. It was pitch black and terrifying, and when it opened its mouth, sharp, yellow teeth could be seen. And then there were the eyes, which seemed blurry at first, but then clearly radiated intense fury and rage.</p><br/><p>This was\u2026 the head of Patriarch Reliance\u2019s real body!!</p><br/><p>An indescribable energy pulsed out from Patriarch Reliance. His aura emanated out, causing all living things to tremble with fear. Up in mid-air, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch slowly forced himself to turn around. Then he saw the indescribably gigantic head filling the entire sky.</p><br/><p>He gaped, and his mind filled with a roaring sound. His eyes went wide, filled with an expression of astonished disbelief.</p><br/><p>He suddenly understood why his opponent could so frivolously waste its essence. It was because, its essence\u2026 was incredibly, astonishingly vast\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d stammered the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, his scalp going numb. For years, he had swept across Planet South Heaven, but he had never seen a shocking, terrifying Demon beast like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want the Patriarch to be your security guard?\u201d raged Patriarch Reliance. The sound of his voice was like thunder, filled with madness. Countless mountains on Saint\u2019s Island collapsed, and huge waves rolled out across the sea.</p><br/><p>The Wang Clan Patriarch staggered backward several paces. Patriarch Reliance\u2019s roar just now caused him to cough up a huge mouthful of blood. His face was pale white.</p><br/><p>Panting, he thought back to what he had said about making his opponent a guard. Then he took a deep breath. Obviously, he had absolutely no qualifications whatsoever to try to make a Demon Immortal act as a guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, please calm your anger,\u201d he said quickly, continuing to back up. \u201cThis is all just a big misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisunderstanding my flipping ass!\u201d roared Patriarch Reliance. The echo of his roar sounded back and forth, causing the sea itself to roar, making it sound like there were countless Patriarch Reliances all roaring at the same time. But then he said, \u201cAllow the Patriarch to bestow you with some good fortune!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the second time that Meng Hao had seen Patriarch Reliance\u2019s real body. It was as shocking now as it had been before. Suddenly, he thought back to how he had vented his spleen on Patriarch Reliance in the Demon Immortal Pagoda, and he felt a little scared. But then he remembered that he could restrain Patriarch Reliance with the Demon Sealing Scripture, and he felt a bit calmer.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Meng Hao heard the words \u2018good fortune,\u2019 and his eyes began to shine brightly. He quickly began to back up; he knew that now was the time for him to make his exit.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Tommy Tea, Brett Flowers, Beau Greene, Fabian M\u00fcller, and Stefica Hoff</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

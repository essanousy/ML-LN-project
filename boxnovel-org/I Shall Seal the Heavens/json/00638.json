Those ten or more Footloose Sect Honor Guards are all figures who could shake the entire area with the stomp of a foot. And they all\u2026 actually owe a favor to the Zhang Clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old Zhang Clan Patriarch was only at the early Core Formation stage. How could he get these people from the Footloose Sect to owe him a favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was abuzz, and the Zhang Clan were standing there wide-eyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas the Patriarch\u2026 really so illustrious back in the day?\u201d thought Zhang Wenfang. She looked a bit dazed. She had never heard such a matter spoken of back in the Clan. In her memory, before the Patriarch died, although he\u2019d had a few friends, few were the sincere type. Besides, he had been dead for so long that any friendly sentiments had long since faded away.</p><br/><p>Were that not the case, the Clan wouldn\u2019t have been forced into the dead end they had been, with no choice but to give up their island and come to this place.</p><br/><p>However, what was happening right now was very real, causing Zhang Wenfang to grow even more confused.</p><br/><p>Intermittent gasps could be heard coming from the crowds in line, and their faces were filled with disbelief and astonishment. All eyes in the area were completely fixed on the members of the Zhang Clan.</p><br/><p>Although most of them dared not allow their envy and jealousy to show on their faces, such feelings filled their hearts.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of the Xu Clan, whose faces were pale white, and whose hearts had seized with terror. How could they ever have imagined that the people they had just looked down upon and even shamed, the down and out Zhang Clan, could have such a glorious past?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder little sis cut ties with the Clan to marry into the Zhang Clan,\u201d thought the man from the Xu Clan. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand back then, but now\u2026.\u201d Having gained this new understanding, he suddenly felt a bit different.</p><br/><p>As for the other Outer Sea Clans who had conflicts with the Zhang Clan, they were now scared witless and panting heavily. Not only were their hearts filled with fear regarding what might happen later, they were also inundated with intense animosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the Zhang Clan has such incredible connections\u2026. Why didn\u2019t they say something earlier? Nobody in the Outer Sea would have dared to pick on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Wenfang subconsciously glanced at some of her fellow Clan Members. What they all saw was mutual shock regarding what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be because of me?\u201d thought Meng Hao. He couldn\u2019t help but think this, and as he did, his eyes glittered. He looked at the Honor Guards from the Footloose Sect, and although it was impossible to tell what they were thinking, his eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDescendants of our benefactor, please accept our salute!\u201d With that the Footloose Sect Honor Guards excitedly clasped hands and began to bow. There were even a few of the elderly members who had tears streaming down their faces. The joy they felt seemed beyond description.</p><br/><p>The Zhang Clan members were overwhelmed by the unexpected show of favor, and even tried to shrink back. Zhang Wenfang had no idea what she should say. However, her heart filled with joy that she simply couldn\u2019t suppress. It was like the saying \u201cwhen the bitterness ends, the sweetness begins.\u201d Tears began to roll down her face.</p><br/><p>From the day she had married into the Clan until now, she had never experienced anything like this. The proud and elated feeling and the looks on the faces of her Clan caused the excitement in her heart to be equal to that of the Footloose Sect members in front of her.</p><br/><p>The ten Honor Guards all began to speak one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes this child wish to join the Footloose Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat need is there to wait in line? We\u2019ve been waiting for the descendant of a benefactor to come join the Sect! We can accept you immediately! Inner Sect disciple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! He\u2019s an Inner Sect disciple!\u201d</p><br/><p>They reached their decision very quickly.</p><br/><p>The scene caused all the other Outer Sea Clans who were waiting in line to be filled with envy. Any Clan would wish their child to be treated in such a way. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be invited into the Clan, as opposed to have to pay respects to enter?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the palace of Saint\u2019s Island, Patriarch Reliance\u2019s face was covered with a complacent grin. He stood up and began to stroll back and forth, giving Guyiding Tri\u2019rain no choice but to watch on helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Patriarch is the smartest yet again,\u201d he said. \u201cHahaha! Now the little bastard has no reason whatsoever to stay behind. Get out of here immediately, kid! Screw off with no delay!\u201d As Patriarch Reliance thought about how proud he was of himself, he began to laugh heartily.</p><br/><p>However, in the midst of his laughing, his face suddenly fell, and he sent his Divine Sense out one more time.</p><br/><p>Even as the Honor Guard members were excitedly discussing their decision to accept Nan\u2019er as an Inner Sect disciple, a cold voice like that of a thunderclap suddenly filled the Footloose Sect. The voice immediately caused everyone\u2019s hearts to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the commotion!?\u201d The cold voice which echoed out from the mountains belonged to that of an old man. \u201cAccepting new disciples is a great matter within the Sect, and yet you people are here causing a racket! What a travesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the grim-faced old man appeared, the ripples of a Nascent Soul Cultivation base emanated out. Everyone immediately began incredibly nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s Lord of the Third Valley!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Great Valley Lord came personally! Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s also friends with the Zhang Clan?\u201d The crowds in the line, as well as the other Footloose Sect disciples who were not affected by Patriarch Reliance\u2019s Divine Sense, were all making the same guesses inwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you all are old friends with this Clan,\u201d the old man said coolly, \u201cthe Sect still has its rules, and those rules won\u2019t change.\u201d His expression was not one of anger, but power. His words instantly shook everyone present.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Footloose Sect,\u201d he continued, \u201cthere is nothing more important than rules. Anyone who wishes to join the Sect must do so according to the rules.\u201d His ice-cold gaze fell onto the members of the Zhang Clan. \u201cAll of you, go back to your original position in line. After enough time passes, you will naturally reach this position.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, the Cultivators from the other Clans in line felt roused. They had felt that what was happening was unfair, but didn\u2019t dare to give voice to such thoughts. Now that they saw a Valley Lord of the Footloose Sect administering justice, they felt that the rumors about the Sect were true; they really did strictly adhere to Sect rules.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wenfang\u2019s face was pale white. She immediately bowed her head and voiced compliance. The feeling caused by joy being reversed into the opposite filled her with complete shame. However, she feared causing problems for the Footloose Sect Honor Guards who were friends of the Clan, so she immediately acquiesced, grabbing Nan\u2019er, who was trembling with fear, and began to make her way back to the end of the line with her other fellow Clan members.</p><br/><p>The Xu Clan immediately went wild with joy when they saw this. They said nothing, but the looks of ridicule and disdain in their eyes were impossible to cover up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the lot of you,\u201d continued the old man, his eyes cold, \u201cyou\u2019re Honor Guard members of the Footloose Sect. Your actions just now were completely beyond the bounds of propriety! You will all be punished by being confined to your quarters for three months!\u201d His words rang out, filled with an incredible feeling of might and dominance.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as the old man spoke the words, he suddenly heard a furious voice echoing in his own ear: \u201cI\u2019ll punish your ass!\u201d</p><br/><p>The raging voice was like thunder, although no outsider could hear it, only the old man. As soon as the powerful sound echoed about in his head, his face fell.</p><br/><p>Naturally, he knew exactly who it was who was speaking to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of this was by the order of the Patriarch!\u201d raged Patriarch Reliance, sounding flustered. \u201cFudge! You completely ruined my big plan! I\u2019ll skin you alive!\u201d He seemed truly enraged.</p><br/><p>Just when the goal he had worked so hard to reach was about to be accomplished, a bit of interference ruined everything. Of course, Patriarch Reliance was scared. He was scared that Meng Hao would figure out that something was going on. He was so furious that he wanted to slap this old man to death immediately.</p><br/><p>When he sensed the Patriarch\u2019s rage and killing intent, the Lord of the Third Valley instantly began to shake. Suddenly, he looked up at the Zhang Clan retreating toward the end of the line, and his mind became very clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he cried, immediately hurrying forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you people from the Zhang Clan?\u201d he then asked, his voice filled with excitement. Teardrops could be seen forming in the corners of his eyes. His voice caused the other Outer Sea Clan members in line to instantly gape in shock. They simply couldn\u2019t wrap their minds about what was happening\u2026.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t the only astonished ones. The surrounding Footloose Sect disciples all had blank expressions on their faces. The events of the day were simply\u2026 too strange for them to understand.</p><br/><p>As for the Zhang Clan members, they stopped in their tracks, then turned to look at the old man who was scurrying over.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wenfang looked at him and hesitated for a moment before quietly responding, \u201cSenior\u2026. We\u2026 we are the Zhang Clan from the Outer Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is the Zhang Clan after all!!\u201d said the old man. He stamped his foot, causing the nearby mountain peaks to rumble, and the ground to quake.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all my mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cEarlier I was inside, and when I sensed that something big was going on, I came out. However, I didn\u2019t recognize you! Aiya! I have only myself to blame!\u201d With that the old man laughed emotionally. From his expression, he seemed to be thinking about past times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget how your Zhang Clan Patriarch showed me such kindness that year. He even saved my life six times! If it weren\u2019t for him, I would not be alive today. The descendant of an old friend is here. Ah, the descendant of an old friend is here.\u201d He sighed again as his words echoed about. Everyone was instantly stunned.</p><br/><p>That was most true of the Xu Clan, who watched on with wide eyes, breathing heavily, their minds trembling. They truly could never have imagined that the Zhang Clan would have such deep relationships, to the extent that one of the nine Valley Lords of the Footloose Sect owed them a great favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that his descendant has come to the Footloose Sect, even if we have to bend the rules a bit, I will assume all the responsibility,\u201d said the old man resolutely. \u201cI will not allow a descendant of the Zhang Clan to suffer any shame here!\u201d His gaze swept about, and all of the Outer Sea Clan members had no choice other than to bow their heads. Inwardly, they were completely shaken.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes narrowed, and a slight smile had appeared on his face. Although he could sense no familiar aura, considering his past experiences, how could he not see through the bizarreness of the goings on?</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he thought. \u201cAs far as I can recall, there\u2019s only one old bastard who likes to handle things in such an unreliable fashion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Wenfang was currently trembling. The joy and surprise that had come her way was almost too much to handle. Currently, her blankness and confusion were almost at the pinnacle. She was just about to say something when suddenly, the Third Valley Lord took a few steps forward and then picked Nan\u2019er up into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey look alike!\u201d he said. \u201cThey really look completely alike! A single glance at this child and I can\u2019t help but think of the Zhang Clan Patriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cChild, are you willing to accept me as your Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment, most nervous of all was Patriarch Reliance, who panted in his palace as he watched the scene down below. He was dying to hear Nan\u2019er voicing his acceptance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and agree, child!\u201d he murmured. \u201cCome on, hurry up! I beg you, just agree\u2026. The Patriarch promises you, if you agree, then from now on, I will watch over you in the Reliance Sect, er, no, I mean the Footloose Sect!\u201d However, he didn\u2019t dare to do anything to obvious, lest Meng Hao sense something amiss.</p><br/><p>Nan\u2019er was extremely nervous, and even scared. His face was pale, and without even thinking about it, he turned to look back at his mother, and then for some reason, Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Had he not looked at Meng Hao, then Meng Hao wouldn\u2019t have inserted himself into the matter. However, considering how helpless the child looked in his inability to make a decision, Meng Hao couldn\u2019t help but smile and then casually say, \u201cNo need to rush into things. Considering the child\u2019s latent talent, I think he should have a bit better standing in the Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Patriarch Reliance heard this, blood sprayed out of his mouth like a geyser. He lifted his head back and let out a howl of indignation.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Roberto Baltazar, Nick Mundt, and Donald Watkins</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

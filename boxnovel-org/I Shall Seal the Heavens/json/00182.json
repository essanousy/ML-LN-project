Meng Hao opened his eyes, then immediately closed them again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a good friend! In the past several lives, I\u2019ve only had myself to talk to. I never realized how boring it is to talk to myself\u2026 And I could never figure out why everyone hates me so much. They even call me Ultimate Vexation\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! I haven\u2019t had a discussion like this the entire time I\u2019ve been in the Solitary Sword Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome come, now that we\u2019ve finished talking about the noon sunshine, let\u2019s talk a bit about the afternoon\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Late morning\u2026. Sunlight filtered into the house. Meng Hao opened his eyes and stared blankly at Chen Fan and the meat jelly. He sighed and continued to meditate.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you, I\u2019m sick of afternoons. I remember the afternoon of one year when I\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right! I\u2019m the same way. But the only thing I can do during that time is to grind my teeth\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>More hours passed, and soon it was afternoon. Meng Hao opened his eyes a few times, but all he could do was laugh bitterly and close them again.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan and the meat jelly had talked through the entire night, all the way through the morning. One man, one bird, seemingly inexhaustible and, in fact, in high spirits.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao couldn\u2019t help but admire Elder Brother Chen. It seemed he really was a perfect match for the meat jelly.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sat quietly. He wanted to stand up, but was worried that Chen Fan and the meat jelly would drag him into their conversation. He took a breath and then closed his eyes, pretending that he couldn\u2019t hear anything that they were saying.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the sun began to set\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like sunset the best. Every time I gaze at the setting sun, I think of that time one year when I was just a tiny meat jelly, I\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSunset is immeasurably wonderful. You know, you really don\u2019t know how difficult it is to practice Cultivation. Oh, that reminds me, throughout the years, I\u2019ve actually collected a thousand different stories about the sunset. I really want to tell you all of them. Come come. I\u2019ll start with the first one\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sun had set, and evening passed. Soon it was night again. One man, one bird, chattering away endlessly for a day and a night. They talked on, seemingly not the least bit tired. When midnight came, it finally seemed that Chen Fan wasn\u2019t able to keep going.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm, why don\u2019t we rest a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! I don\u2019t get many chances to have such a lovely discussion. We still haven\u2019t talked about the meaning of life yet. Ah, the meaning of life. What a beautiful whatchamacallit flower [1. In this passage, he starts to erroneously quote a Chinese expression, but then kind of gives up in the middle]. Oh, right. I forgot. Before we talk about the meaning of life, we need to talk about moonlight\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 Alright. Actually, I have over three thousand stories about the moonlight\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? I have some stories too! Actually, I have ten thousand. You go first, and then me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was almost on the verge of collapse. His eyes were bloodshot, and he panted as he forced himself to calm down and return to meditation.</p><br/><p>The night passed slowly. Outside, everything was quiet. But within the room, one man and one bird had reached the pinnacle of their conversation. Early morning light once again made its way into the house. Chen Fan\u2019s face was a bit wan, and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s rest a bit\u2026 I\u2026 I have some plans today\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! I\u2019m not finished yet. We still haven\u2019t talked about the meaning of life. Now that I\u2019m finished with my ten thousand stories about the moonlight, we can continue our discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Morning passed, and soon it was noontime, then another sunset. Chen Fan\u2019s expression was dull as he stared at the parrot and its unceasing torrent of words. A look of admiration slowly grew in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that we have built up the conversation properly, we can finally discuss the meaning of life. Eee\u2026? It\u2019s dark outside. I just realized that when we talked about sunset, there were thirty thousand stories I forgot to mention. That won\u2019t do! I don\u2019t get chances like this very often. I need to tell you those stories\u2026.\u201d The meat jelly cleared its throat a few times, and then began speaking again.</p><br/><p>A few hours passed, until finally Chen Fan\u2019s patience and long-windedness were run out. \u201cI\u2026 I really do have some plans\u2026.\u201d said Chen Fan, standing up suddenly.</p><br/><p>His body swayed back and forth a bit, and then he took a few steps back, his face drained of blood. Meng Hao opened his eyes and looked admiringly at Chen Fan. He had just chatted nonstop for two days and two nights\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother, I actually have some plans, so I\u2019m going to take off. Um\u2026 I\u2019ll come back for you in a few days\u2026.\u201d His face was pale and he looked dizzy. As of now, he didn\u2019t look at the meat jelly with admiration, but rather, fear.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d always thought of himself as someone who could talk, but now he realized how wrong he was. There existed a bird that could surpass even him! Without waiting for Meng Hao to respond, Chen Fan opened the door and fled.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother,\u201d Meng Hao called after him, \u201cI think you have an affinity with this talking Spirit parrot, why don\u2019t you take it with you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Fan suddenly staggered, and his face twisted. Without an instant of hesitation, his body transformed into a beam of light that disappeared into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a good fellow,\u201d said the meat jelly parrot, sighing with emotion. \u201cI really like this Elder Brother Chen of yours. I haven\u2019t met someone in years who could carry on such a long conversation with me. Eee? We never discussed the meaning of life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s scalp suddenly began to grow numb. To be able to provoke such a reaction from Elder Brother Chen showed how truly powerful this meat jelly was. Such power was rarely seen in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad I couldn\u2019t finish,\u201d said the meat jelly discontentedly. \u201cI was just starting to get excited. Now it\u2019s all over?\u201d Chattering away, it flew up onto Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you chat a bit with me, I\u2019m feeling a bit lonely\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face went pale, and he took a deep breath. He forced a wry smile onto his face, and his mind spun, trying to come up with an idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think perhaps you forgot someone,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Who? Who? Who did I forget? How could I forget somebody?\u201d Given a chance to have a conversation, the meat jelly would definitely seize it immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou forgot about the old man in the mask!\u201d said Meng Hao hurriedly. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t turned him back from the path of wickedness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? Right! That old man isn\u2019t too bad, actually. But you\u2019re right. I need to go have a talk with him.\u201d Face shining with anticipation, the meat jelly parrot flashed, instantly disappearing into Meng Hao\u2019s bag of the Cosmos.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could just barely hear the sound of the Li Clan Patriarch\u2019s sad, shrill cry when the meat jelly entered the mask. He had never heard such a cry come from the man before.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao let out a long sigh and sat down on the ground, laughing bitterly. He looked at the moonlight outside and sighed again, wondering about what his life would be like in the coming days. Having the meat jelly with him constantly was a frightening thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be a way to control it. That damned meat jelly\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao gritted his teeth, and his eyes glittered brightly. \u201cIts old enemy\u2026 the copper mirror\u2026 the parrot\u2026.\u201d His eyes glittered even more brightly when he thought about reaching Core Formation. His anticipation soared to new heights.</p><br/><p>Three days flashed by, during which time Chen Fan never returned. Obviously, he was so frightened of Meng Hao\u2019s meat jelly that he didn\u2019t dare to come back. If he did, the meat jelly parrot might draw him into another conversation.</p><br/><p>It was on the fourth day that he cautiously made his way back. He opened the door to the room, then immediately retreated several steps. When he saw that there was no parrot on Meng Hao\u2019s shoulder, he glanced around the room and then let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao could only give him a wry smile. What else could he say?</p><br/><p>Chen Fan stood nervously outside the room. \u201cThat\u2026. Little Junior Brother, it\u2026 it\u2019s gone?\u201d He looked very nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty much\u2026.\u201d replied Meng Hao, standing up and walking out.</p><br/><p>Chen Fan let out a long sigh and looked at Meng Hao with a forced smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Junior Brother, that parrot of yours is\u2026 Wow, what a bird. I truly admire it. Well, no need to talk about it, really. There are only a few more days until the Song Clan\u2019s banquet. I\u2019ve already arranged everything. When it comes time, we can teleport directly there. Today, why don\u2019t you let me show you around the Solitary Sword Sect? After all, when we come back from the Song Clan, this will be your Sect, so you should get to know it.\u201d He grabbed Meng Hao\u2019s sleeve and pulled him out to the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever, but in his mind appeared an image of the map of the Southern Domain. The Song Clan was located relatively close to the Violet Fate Sect. As for the Solitary Sword Sect, Meng Hao thought about it a lot during the past days and had finally reached a conclusion. He decided that he would not take advantage of Chen Fan\u2019s offer to join the Solitary Sword Sect.</p><br/><p>He still wanted to figure out some way to disguise himself and join the Violet Fate Sect. He would learn Violet Qi from the East as well as alchemy. And he would also figure out a way to get Grandmaster Pill Demon to dispel his poison.</p><br/><p>As for the Solitary Sword Sect, Meng Hao didn\u2019t believe that Chen Fan\u2019s master would be able to help him get rid of the poison. He needed the help of someone, not of the Nascent Soul stage, but the Spirit Severing stage!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was certain of this. However, Chen Fan was so warm and welcoming, he didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate to tell him directly. Regarding the Song Clan, Meng Hao very much wanted to go see it; however, because of his concerns regarding the Black Sieve Sect, he was still hesitating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to figure out a way to get in touch with Han Bei\u2026.\u201d he thought. \u201cShe should be able to tell me what ended up happening with the Black Sieve Sect.\u201d He rubbed his bag of holding, and a cold smile touched his lips. There inside was a piece of jade which he could use to keep Han Bei in her place.</p><br/><p>He followed Chen Fan around the Solitary Sword Sect. Buildings lined the meandering paths, and streams flowed here and there. The whole place looked both imposing and tasteful.</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted as they walked, and soon it was noontime. Eventually, they reached a large circular structure which was filled with hundreds of energetic Solitary Sword Sect disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Battle Arena,\u201d explained Chen Fan, \u201cwhere Solitary Sword Sect disciples can fight each other. You can injure, but not kill. There are strict punishments for anyone who breaks the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at it and was about to walk away when suddenly, his brow furrowed. A sinister voice suddenly rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuests can fight in the Battle Arena to exchange techniques with our Sect disciples. I, Li, shall enter the arena. I would like to invite this outsider guest\u2026 to duel with me if he dares!\u201d It was none other the middle-aged man named Li. A hypocritical smile covered his face as he strolled out from the crowd, staring mockingly at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you hide behind your Elder Brother again? Can you even make a single attack, you good-for-nothing loser? If you don\u2019t dare to fight, then you\u2019d better hope you don\u2019t have to face me again in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes came to rest on Meng Hao and Chen Fan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The sea spread out to eventually cover the south as well. It stopped outside Blackgate Fort. At this point, it was truly a boundless sea.</p><br/><p>Blackgate Fort was eventually submerged by the water. Ten thousand years later, after the seawater vanished, a new land would be revealed.</p><br/><p>That would be the true end of the Western Desert Apocalypse. The seawaters would disappear, and the Western Desert would once again appear.</p><br/><p>Perhaps by that time, the land would be unfamiliar to the Western Desert Cultivators residing in the Black Lands. However, there would definitely be people who would go to search for the roots of their Tribes from ten thousand years before.</p><br/><p>Right now, Blackgate Fort\u2019s gate was closing, signifying an official end to the migration\u2026.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s laughter rang out as he gained enlightenment regarding Karma. He saw the Karma threads. By casting out the fishing line, he could control the treasure just like a member of the Ji Clan. To Meng Hao, this was an extra, unexpected benefit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Karma has been with me all along\u2026.\u201d He shot through the air, the parrot perched on his shoulder. The meat jelly was attached to the parrot\u2019s foot like always. One man, one parrot, and one meat jelly shot through the downpour of violet rain. They were surrounded by the power of extermination. Spiritual energy was completely cut off.</p><br/><p>After parting ways with the Golden Crow Clan, Meng Hao chose not to enter the Black Lands. He made a different choice. He would stay behind within the Violet Rain Apocalypse in order to form his Water-type totem.</p><br/><p>As for the blood totem, that was not Meng Hao\u2019s choice of totems. He would place himself within the Violet Rain Apocalypse in order to to gain enlightenment and understand the true meaning of the Violet Sea.</p><br/><p>As he shot through the air, his eyes suddenly glittered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve left the plains outside the Black Lands,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthe pursuit should be catching up\u2026.\u201d He suddenly stopped in mid-air, turning to look behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably being chased, not by the Nascent Soul stage, but\u2026 Spirit Severing!!\u201d His eyes glowed brightly as he looked around, and he smiled.</p><br/><p>A long moment passed before his gaze came to be fixed at a spot not too far off.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will most likely be Spirit Severing. After my display back at Blackgate Fort, no ordinary Nascent Soul Cultivator would be willing to try to interfere with me.\u201d As Meng Hao thought about the Spirit Severing stage, his eyes suddenly filled with a burning passion.</p><br/><p>Spirit Severing\u2026 was an indescribably powerful stage!</p><br/><p>It was something that Cultivators sought after with passion secondary only to Immortal Ascension!</p><br/><p>The mysteries of Spirit Severing had nothing to do with variations in divine abilities, but rather the manifestation of the Domain. Each of the three Severings were an instance of the use of the Domain.</p><br/><p>Only within the Spirit Severing stage was it possible to have the qualification to call one\u2019s cultivation\u2026 a Dao!</p><br/><p>In the cultivation of the Spirit Severing stage, medicinal pills were secondary. The most important thing was\u2026 enlightenment regarding the Domain.</p><br/><p>Every Spirit Severing Patriarch had a different Domain. Based on their different experiences in life, the Dao of the Domain chosen by the Cultivator transformed into a blade of Severing. The first Severing was the early stage, the second Severing was the mid, the third Severing was the late!</p><br/><p>Each of these Severings would cause the Cultivation base to rise to a new realm. When all three Severings were completed, the great circle of Spirit Severing was complete. After that, there was only one path to follow\u2026 and that was Dao Seeking.</p><br/><p>The reason why it was called Dao Seeking was that the body of the Cultivator contained a Dao. Within the three Severings of the Spirit Severing stage, one\u2019s Dao was discovered, then questions arose\u2026. Once the Dao was solidified, then one was qualified for Immortal Ascension.</p><br/><p>Unless\u2026 doubts arose during Dao Seeking. Then the Dao vanished and the body perished. Everything became emptiness.</p><br/><p>There is a saying that once enlightened, one can die happy. That is how one could describe the Dao Seeking stage. Once enlightenment was gained, and one\u2019s own Dao was solidified, then one could smile even in death.</p><br/><p>Spirit Severing, Dao Seeking, Immortal Ascension!</p><br/><p>Those were the ultimate pursuits of the Cultivators in the great lands of South Heaven. Three stages, each one of which could lead to death. However, when the final goal of Immortal Ascension was reached, the Cultivator would then be qualified to leave South Heaven and travel among the stars. There, one\u2019s personal Dao could become even more strong, and blossom like a resplendent flower!</p><br/><p>When such a beautiful flower blossomed, one could die laughing at the Heavens, having lived a life not in vain!</p><br/><p>That was the path of Immortal Ascension!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s path. Xu Qing\u2019s path. Chu Yuyan\u2019s path. Chen Fan, Fatty and all the others all were treading such a path\u2026.</p><br/><p>Objectively speaking, though, whether you looked at the Western Desert or the Southern Domain, Dao Seeking experts were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns\u2026. Even Spirit Severing experts were not common. Generally speaking, even great Tribes in the Western Desert would have only one Spirit Severing Patriarch, which was the reason why they could sustain their legacies throughout the years and become truly powerful.</p><br/><p>It was similar in the Southern Domain. Spirit Severing experts were not common. Furthermore, the majority\u2026 remained within the First Severing. Those who reached the Second were less common and as for the Third\u2026 they were even rarer.</p><br/><p>That was because\u2026 each Severing could be fatal. Lack of success\u2026 meant certain death. In fact, many Cultivators who became Spirit Severing Patriarchs\u2026 chose not to continue on with further Severings.</p><br/><p>Failure\u2026 meant death!</p><br/><p>The power of the Spirit Severing stage lay in the Domain. It could influence divine abilities, could change the laws of nature, could accomplish whatever the heart desired. From the perspective of Nascent Soul Cultivators, it could do things that seemed impossible.</p><br/><p>Take for example Patriarch Reliance. The fact that he could carry away the State of Zhao with him had something to do with this Cultivation base. However, that action was actually a manifestation of Spirit Severing!</p><br/><p>Another example was the Patriarch of the Frigid Snow Clan. Of his own power, he could shake everything in the area. However, once his Cultivation base fell, it instigated an attack.</p><br/><p>If one wished to enter the Spirit Severing Stage, the initial step was the first Severing, which could not be avoided.</p><br/><p>It was an enormous obstacle that had to be passed by any Cultivator who wished to proceed beyond the Nascent Soul stage. In fact, it was an obstacle that many Nascent Soul Cultivators could not pass. Because of that, they ended up staying within the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage until their longevity expired, whereupon they became skeletons and returned to the dust.</p><br/><p>If one could not live past one thousand years, and could not defy the heavens, how could one be of the Spirit Severing stage?</p><br/><p>The longevity of the Nascent Soul stage was roughly one thousand years. Even with the use of shocking medicinal pills that could increase longevity, it was impossible to exceed one thousand years of life. That was one of the laws of Heaven and Earth. One thousand years was the absolute limit to the longevity of a Cultivator.</p><br/><p>However, with the First Severing of Spirit Severing, five hundred to a thousand years of longevity could be hewn out. As to exactly how much, that depended on the person as well as the Domain\u2026. In any case, the longevity would definitely exceed one thousand years!</p><br/><p>Passing beyond one thousand was a defiance of the Heavens!</p><br/><p>That was why reaching Spirit Severing was so difficult. It was difficult\u2026 to an ultimate degree!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath, taking the stubborness and desire that shone in his eyes and concealing it deep within his heart. He would continue down this path to Immortal Ascension\u2026 in a way that had never been done before. That was the determination in Meng Hao\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The Five-Colored Nascent Soul was only the first step!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked out into the air, but could only see the downpour of violet rain. Everything was deserted, with no one visible except for him. Meng Hao was quiet for a long moment, ten breaths of time to be exact. Suddenly, a translucent figure slowly began to appear in mid-air several thousand meters in front of Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>As the figure became visible, a strange, invisible power seemed to affect the violet rain in the area. It was pushed aside, ensuring that not even a single drop landed on the figure.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever, as if nothing out of the ordinary was going on. However, it was at this moment that the parrot opened its eyes wide. All of the multicolored feathers on its body stood on end. The meat jelly bell on its foot began to tremble, causing tinkling bell sounds to ring out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, Spirit Severing!!\u201d said the parrot, gaping. It was impossible to tell exactly what it was thinking. It looked down ruthlessly at the meat jelly bell and said, \u201cShut up! Quit shaking! Your shaking is really annoying Lord Fifth!\u201d In response, the meat jelly\u2019s shaking grew even more intense.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was the same as ever. He had long since predicted that after the Crow Divinity Tribe entered the Black Lands and handed over the Demon Spirit, the fact that there was a second Demon Spirit would quickly be discovered.</p><br/><p>Considering that the Heavenly Court Alliance wanted Demon Spirits, it was possible that other great Tribes with Spirit Severing Patriarchs would grow greedy. That meant there was a high possibility that they\u2026 would try to catch and kill him.</p><br/><p>Such circumstances would have been even more difficult to avoid if he had entered the Black Lands himself. Furthermore, it would have implicated the Crow Divinity Tribe. His only option was to leave\u2026. Even leaving, though, would likely result in people coming after him.</p><br/><p>However, it now had nothing to do with the Crow Divinity Tribe. The scene of Meng Hao leaving Blackgate Fort had been witnessed by too many people. From that moment on, it was tantamount to Meng Hao severing his Karma with the Crow Divinity Tribe.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d asked the transparent figure, slowly opening its eyes. The opening of its eyes caused everything in the vicinity to suddenly change. It was as if some indescribable, invisible force of law had enveloped the entire area. The figure did not open its mouth to speak. Instead, its voice resonated in Meng Hao\u2019s mind like thunder.</p><br/><p>An intense aura caused Meng Hao to feel as if he were about to suffocate. A mere thought on the part of this figure caused the violet rain in the area to stop moving. It paused, motionless in mid-air. The sight of the drops of water floating there motionless in midair was truly shocking.</p><br/><p>This was something that no Nascent Soul Cultivator could do. This was not a divine ability, but rather but a command of laws. This was\u2026 a Domain!</p><br/><p>Only Spirit Severing experts were possessed with Domain!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he looked at the translucent figure. \u201cSo, I have been pursued, not by a Nascent Soul Cultivator, but someone of the Spirit Severing stage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHand over that Demon Spirit,\u201d said the translucent figure, staring at Meng Hao. \u201cThen you can be on your way.\u201d Its expression was one of neither happiness nor anger. It continued to stand there, its mouth closed but its voice echoing in Meng Hao\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on a second!\u201d squawked the parrot. It suddenly flew up into the air. At the same time, the meat jelly bell on its foot continued to chatter.</p><br/><p>Flapping its wings rapidly, the parrot continued, \u201cHeh heh. Look, big brother. Lord Fifth is not on the same side as this kid. Aiya. Now that I think about it, my beloved concubine is back at home waiting for me. See you later!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother,\u201d gushed the meat jelly, \u201cLord Third is not on the same side as this kid\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s expression was unsightly as he glared at the parrot and meat jelly. \u201cThat is the Demon Spirit!\u201d he suddenly said, pointing at the parrot.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the semi-transparent figure looked over at the parrot.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, we\u2019re on the same side, bitch! You, you, you\u2026.\u201d The parrot began trembling, having been instantly sent into a fluster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is wrong,\u201d howled the meat jelly. \u201cThis is immoral! This is going to provoke Heavenly Tribulation. You\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

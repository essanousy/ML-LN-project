The business district was the four streets that surrounded the Lei Tian platform. Each street was wide and long, so massive that you couldn\u2019t finish strolling around one street within a day. Business district was a well-known place where all sorts of people gathered.</p><br/><p>Right now, You XiaoMo was standing at the beginning of South Street.</p><br/><p>South Street had a long established history, its architecture structural changed everyday. Compared to the other cities You XiaoMo had travelled to, this place\u2019s architecture was completely different. Not only did they bring an ancient aspect such as carved balustrades and jade steps (t/n: the typical structure of wealthy chinese ancient building), which were very splendorous and majestic, but they also had added a drop of modern ambience in between.</p><br/><p>Even with such fascinating architectural design, the fact was that since South Street was extremely large, one couldn\u2019t see the end.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue took them to a magic pill shop located on the South Street. Although it was not the largest shop here, it was the place that offered the most reasonable prices. Qingshuang Pavilion was the name of the shop. Besides selling magic pills, they also offered buying them. Liu Yue had heard about the good reputation of this shop. A lot of outsiders and travellers also came here to make a deal.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue also told You XiaoMo about how he used to receive low rank level 3 magic pills from them as rewards for bringing guests in.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, You XiaoMo\u2019s expression lit up. He quickly pulled Liu Yue toward him, \u201d Liu Yue, let\u2019s say if you pretend to introduce us to Qingshuang Pavilion, and since we are going to spend a lot, will they give you rewards after?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue didn\u2019t even flinch, \u201cPossibly, but the amount depends on how big the transaction with the guest. If it is a good deal, then there is a possibility they will reward me with a low grade level 4 herb, or a low grade level 4 magic pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately remembered the two missing types of herbs for the Golden Sand pill recipe. \u201cGood, well then, later you should tell the people of Qingshuang Pavilion that you introduced us here, act like you don\u2019t really know us, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Liu Yue understands.\u201d Liu Yue immediately figured out You XiaoMo\u2019s intention. Although he was a little surprised, since in his eyes, young master You didn\u2019t seem like one who was lacking in magic herbs, but since young master had said so, then he would obey.</p><br/><p>And so, Liu Yue very proficiently took them to the Qingshuang Pavillon. Coincidentally, the shop manager happened to be there as well. Since Liu Yue had introduced them to several guests in the past, the manager remembered him.</p><br/><p>The manager saw Liu Yue bringing two people in, guessed that he meant to introduce new guests to them, so he silently looked and judged their clothes, and apparently these two new guests were not some common folk. He knew today he might be able to pull in some good deals, so he quickly switched to his unique profiteer smile and came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager Li, I bring you two new guests.\u201d Liu Yue came over to Manager Li\u2019s side, revealed a flattering smile like he was the person on the bottom of the social pyramid. He was the type of person that had to cater others to have a better life. Besides, to fulfil his young master\u2019s wish, only by doing so would the manager not be able to see through the act.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk ok, you go to the lounge and wait there.\u201d Manager Li waved the hand to shoo him away, his eyes fell on Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo\u2019s figure, he immediately put on a respectful attitude. \u201cSir, may I know what magic pill you want to buy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qingshuang Pavillon mostly sold magic pills, while they only had a few magic herbs, but it didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t have any in possession. Since Qingshuang Pavilion was not their only property, they also had a branch shop selling magic herbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you also collect magic pills?\u201d You XiaoMo looked at the interior design of the Qingshuang Pavilion and judged.</p><br/><p>Manager Li was stunned for a moment, he then carefully looked at You XiaoMo again, now that he realized it, this little boy was a mage, but he didn\u2019t know his level.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, Qingshuang Pavilion does also collect magic pills, but we won\u2019t buy low grade magic pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Qingshuang Pavilion had a strict policy, usually they only took large transaction deals, and their mages could refine low grade magic pills. This was why they only collected mid grade or high grade magic pills, limited to the pill level.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took out a jade bottle of magic pills from his magic bags, \u201cI know you don\u2019t buy low grade pills, Liu Yue has told us about this, what I want to sell are high grade types, level 3 and 4 ones. So, care to make a deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li was petrified. He then stared at the bottle in You XiaoMo\u2019s hand. After a careful observation, they were indeed high grade magic pills. Through the transparency of the jade bottle he could see the color of the pills was very pure. Who would expect this boy could give him such a grand surprise.</p><br/><p>High grade magic pills cannot compare to the mid and low grade ones. Regardless of the level, all high grade pills will never lack on the market ground, not like low grade pills, only some small shops would buy them.</p><br/><p>Manager Li saw You XiaoMo take out a bottle of level 3 pills and a bottle of level 4 pills, and on top of all, every single one of them was high grade. Naturally, he was overjoyed, and quickly nodded, \u201cWe will! We will! Of course we will buy them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li quickly took them to the back. Since the hall had all kinds of people there, a little precaution is always better, because even though level 3 and 4 pills were less valuable than level 5 and above, high grade pills is a different story.</p><br/><p>Stepping inside, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t worry about Manager Li\u2019s greed would awake, because having Ling Xiao beside him reassured him a lot. You XiaoMo directly gave the jade bottle to him, \u201cYou can check them to your liking, if you accept them, we will discuss the price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li took the bottles, and said he wanted to have the Qingshuang\u2019s mage check them, because he himself was not a mage.</p><br/><p>After a while, the curtain was lifted and came in a girl wearing pink clothes with an engaging aura.</p><br/><p>Seeing the girl, manager Li was in a cheerful mood, \u201cMiss Qing Qi, I have to trouble you with some more magic pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pink clothes lady had bright and limpid autumn waters eyes (t/n:a way to describe a beatiful soft and clear eyes, like in Memoir of Geisha, how author described the mc\u2019s eyes), a beautiful feature \u2018like flower like jade\u2019 ( t/n: it means beautiful) that gave off a very tranquil temperament. Hearing Manager Li\u2019s word, the beautiful face showed a \u201d beatiful girl from a humble family\u201d expression while she gave a faint smile, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Manager Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment You XiaoMo saw her, the image of \u201csoft girl\u201d came straight into his mind. At long last, he finally managed to meet another normal typical woman, but You XiaoMo had lost interest in soft girl.</p><br/><p>(Ra\u2019s note: well he\u2019s all out for Ling Xiao\u2019s hard dick now.)</p><br/><p>But with a glance, You XiaoMo immediately recognized this girl was a level 5 mage, her age probably somewhere around 20. A level 5 mage at this age, clearly her natural endowment shouldn\u2019t be low. You XiaoMo didn\u2019t expect his first time at the business district he would end up encountering a young level 5 mage, a female to boot.</p><br/><p>Yan city is really a crouching tiger, hidden dragon ( T/n: hidden talent) region.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Qing Qiu, may I know your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Qiu stood in front of them, even though her voice was soft, it gave a very rare benevolent vibe.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy surname is You, pardon Miss Qing for examining the magic pills inside the bottles.\u201d You XiaoMo once again took out the jade bottles inside his magic bags. He didn\u2019t introduce Ling Xiao though, after all they came here for business, not making friends.</p><br/><p>Qing Qiu didn\u2019t ask back, she picked up the jade bottle You XiaoMo had placed on the table, her eyes couldn\u2019t help but reveal a trace of surprise. They were all high grade magic pills. She carefully looked at them, then she talked to Manager Li, \u201cManager Li, they are all genuine high grade magic pills, level 3 have 20 pills, level 4 have 30.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li gave a squinty eyed smile, \u201d Sorry for troubling miss Qing Qiu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Qiu faintly smiled, \u201cNot really, it is my obligation.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that she didn\u2019t bother their discussion anymore, she put down the bottle and went away, but before she left she also secretly stole a glance at You XiaoMo, if she was not wrong, this You fella was also a level 4 mage. He was so young and already had such high achievements, looked like they would meet again in the future.</p><br/><p>After she had left, You XiaoMo finally mentioned about the price with Manager Li.</p><br/><p>Because You XiaoMo was in lack of money, he didn\u2019t intentionally give a high price, and Manager Li didn\u2019t disregard You XiaoMo\u2019s young age and falsely gave a wrong price.</p><br/><p>Just like Liu Yue had said, they offered a fair price. One level 3 pill is 80 crystal coin, one level 4 pill is 200 crystal coin.</p><br/><p>Level 4 prices compared to level 3 was more than double, which was something You XiaoMo had estimated. He remembered before when he was at the Danxin shop, a single mid grade herb already cost 20000 gold coins, and since the mid grade was already expensive, don\u2019t mention the high grade ones.</p><br/><p>Fifty magic pills, You XiaoMo sold for 14000 crystal coins, he once again deeply appreciated the fact being a mage was a very profiteering career, moreover, he only needed to pay for the herb seeds.</p><br/><p>The two of them left the Qingshuang Pavilion, and not long after, Liu Yue also came out.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately went up, \u201cSo? Did you get the Stone herbs seeds and Ichthyosaurs herbs seeds?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue said, \u201cManager Li said only the Qingcao Court would have them, so he told me to go there to receive the reward, and he also sent the message to the manager of Qingcao Court.\u201d Although he was really curious about why young master only needed the seeds and not the full grown herbs, but he didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick quick, go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Li was a man of his word, not only haf he asked Manager Zhou to reward Liu Yue with the Stone herb seeds and Ichthyosaurs herb seeds, he was also willing to give him more seeds of different types. Liu Yue took the opportunity and asked for some more. Since Liu Yue only needed a few seeds, and Manager Zhou appreciated the fact he had helped them getting big customers, and not to mention, such few seeds were not worth much money, so he gave Liu Yue a very generous award.</p><br/><p>After he got the seeds, Liu Yue quickly ran to You XiaoMo to win his young master\u2019s favor.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was really surprised, because Liu Yue was very clever, knowing that he may not need the common level 4 seeds, so he specifically chose those uncommon ones, and indeed there were several seeds he didn\u2019t have.</p><br/><p>Before the sun started setting, they arrived back at the inn.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>t/n:  ( beautiful girl from a humble family ) is a saying to describe a beautiful girl who charming but not wicked, brightful and not cold, a lively, smart and cute personality.</p><br/><p>t/n: soft girl ( ) is an internet slang, to describe the girl with gentle big eyes, tender voice, soft waist, with a gentle personality, considerate and have an innocent aura. Deprived from the japanese term Moe girl, and a cosplay video with the same title \u201d soft girl\u201d in which portrayed a girl with the exact description.</p><br/><p>t/n: Ichthyosaur () , or literal translated as Fish dragon in chinese ( or fish lizard in greek). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosaur</p><br/><p>Ra note: basically this his how people classify a magic pill:</p><br/><p>Rank: within a level, a pill can be classified into low \u2013 mid \u2013 high rank, to compare the usefulness of the pill, the higher the rank, the more efficient it have.</p><br/><p>Grade: classified into low \u2013 mid \u2013 high grade, which indicated the pill\u2019s quality. The quality is affected by the quality of the herb, and of course, by how you refining it. A carefully crafted pills (high grade ) obviously would be more valuable.</p><br/><p>While herb is much simpler, depend on its quality , it can be either low \u2013 mid \u2013 high grade/quality.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

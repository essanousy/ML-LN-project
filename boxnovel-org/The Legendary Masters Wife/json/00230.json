This event soon spread among the Mage Association. If the previous thing that happened at the hall made You XiaoMo\u2019s name spread, then today\u2019s event really made his name become famous.</p><br/><p>The tutors who were astonished at You XiaoMo the genius eighteen year old before, and were even threatened that they wouldn\u2019t accept such person as their student, were running to come to the second assessment, even before it started. They wanted to know what kind of person is he, to even be able to compete with Teng ZiXin.</p><br/><p>There were two parts of the assessment. The second one would begin an hour later, so everyone could do anything they wanted during this free hour. But they had to be back to continue the assessment in an hour. If they were late, they would be deemed as giving up the assessment on their own. You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao didn\u2019t leave the main hall. Instead, they looked for a place to sit and rest there.</p><br/><p>The main hall has chairs for people to sit down and rest, but not that many. After the end of the first assessment, many people ran to sit at that place. Since You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao have gained Ning Jing-daoshi\u2019s favor, she got two seats for them.</p><br/><p>Although some mages passed the first round assessment, since distillation consumed a lot of their soul power, if they immediately began the second assessment, they might not be able to carry on the burden. So this one hour rest was for them to restore their soul power.</p><br/><p>Of course, not everyone needed a break, for example the genius Teng Zi Xin. The distillation round didn\u2019t take much of her soul power.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t pay attention to the curious glances that were thrown at him. The assessment time could be said to be neither long nor short, and it was almost noon now, so it\u2019s time for him to eat. He took a few spirit fruits that were famous for being sweet and tasty.</p><br/><p>He bought spirit fruits when he went out before. At that time he thought that they were tasty, so he bought a stockpile of it, so when he was hungry but too inconvenient to go out and eat, he could just eat the spirit fruits. Under the gazes of many eyes, he handed over the spirit fruit to Ling Xiao. It wasn\u2019t the first time Ling Xiao took You XiaoMo\u2019s thing, so he took it calmly.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang came over, surprised and asked, \u201cBrother You, you came to take the exams, yet still could bring spirit fruit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Spirit fruit wasn\u2019t a precious or rare thing, you could buy it at many places, but it was his first time looking at a person who came to take exams and still prepare for lunch. Usually, people would be too nervous that they lost their appetite. He looked too relaxed to be able to do that.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo took a bite from the spirit fruit, he heard his sentence and explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not like that, I bought these a few months ago and I still haven\u2019t finished eating them yet. Ah, Gao-dage, do you want to eat it too?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he took it from inside the magic bag\u2026 actually, he took the spirit fruit from his space and then handed it to him. Gao yang lowered his head and look at the spirit fruit that he held, it smelled really sweet. He originally wanted to refuse, but he couldn\u2019t help but stretch out his hand and take it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo became happy, and took another for Ning Jing-daoshi.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing was quite surprised that the spirit fruits didn\u2019t lose its moisture even when he put it inside the magic bag for that long, but she didn\u2019t think too much about it. She just guessed that he might put it inside of some kind of jade box, and took it while saying her thanks.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, don\u2019t need to thank him. Both of them helped him, so it was how it ought to be.</p><br/><p>Just then, a familiar voice suddenly rang from behind, \u201cWa, I want to eat spirit fruit too\u201d.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned his head, and saw BaiLi XiaoYu was looking at his half-eaten spirit fruit drooling, with a helpless Tong YueXu on his side. Tong YueXu pulled BaiLi XiaoYu, who became gluttonous while looking at You XiaoMo and his group eating spirit fruit. With his status, he could obviously eat so many delicious things, but the problem is, BaiLi XiaoYu was a glutton, so when he saw other people eating, he could easily be bought off to eat the same thing.</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu looked at You XiaoMo and cupped his own hand in front of his chest, and modestly said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo twitched up one corner of his mouth and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not disturbing us.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just stared at BaiLi XiaoYu, this guy was really rude, but he never met one like him before, such a straightforward person, and looked so pure. And then he took out two spirit fruits.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu didn\u2019t wait anymore and took it, and then gave the other to Tong YueXu, \u201cYueXu-ge, he is a good person, you should eat it too.\u201d After he said that, he immediately took a bite of his own and made a munching sound.</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu was dumbfounded, and finally became helpless, and said apologetically to You XiaoMo, \u201cXiaoYu is this kind of person, I hope Brother You could forgive him.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved his hand repeatedly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s fine like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I haven\u2019t congratulate Brother You on winning the first place in the first round assessment\u201d.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo became embarrassed, he never got a first place in his previous life.</p><br/><p>When he heard their conversation, BaiLi XiaoYu also joined, and said happily, \u201cGetting first place, and this time you have to beat Teng ZiXin. She\u2019ll lose her face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like her?\u201d When he heard this, You XiaoMo asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like.\u201d BaiLi XiaoYu shook his head without hesitation like a rattle drum, \u201cShe\u2019s so annoying, and she looked down on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yong YueXu shook his head and explained, \u201cThree months ago, Teng ZiXin came back with her master from a journey, and when she ran into XiaoYu, she said that she had been holding a grudge for ten years now, but actually both of them have been hating each other for a long time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like that, but\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Teng ZiXin\u2019s direction. Actually, he didn\u2019t like her either, although he hasn\u2019t spoken with her yet, she gave off a bad feeling, even though he couldn\u2019t explain it very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo, can I call You XiaoMo? You can call me XiaoYu too.\u201d BaiLi XiaoYu suddenly came in front of You XiaoMo, and asked with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was lost in thought and taken aback, but quickly composed himself again and said, \u201cYou can.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu immediately grinned, made a very happy face, and shouted twice, \u201cXiaoMo, XiaoMo, from now on we are friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when You XiaoMo was about to reply, he heard Ling Xiao\u2019s voice ring out in his ear.\u201cXiao Momo, both of you are a little bit similar.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was neither too loud nor too quiet, so a few people near them heard this, and looked at their side.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s eyes that looked so pure, and asked him in a low voice, \u201cWhere do we look similar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao tried to hold back his laugh, \u201cWhen laughing, you guys look silly.\u201d He already lived for so long that he could see BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s true nature, that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t stop them from becoming friends.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw that both of them making the same reaction, Tong YueXu had to suppress his laughter so hard.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu pulled You XiaoMo\u2019s clothes, \u201cXiaoMo, who is this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo put his hand on him, \u201cYou can just pretend that he doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu said, \u201cBut I can\u2019t pretend that he doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu said seriously, \u201cHe just said that I looked as silly as you when I laughed, I\u2019m not a fool at all, and other people always say that I\u2019m cute, so how can I look like you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>You don\u2019t have to be that sarcastic!</p><br/><p>The people who watched the scene almost want to laugh out loud, these guys are so funny.</p><br/><p>Time flew quickly when they were joking around. Along with a clear bell sound, Elder Guan Yong who was gone had come back and announced that the second assessment is about to begin, so the examinees have to gather in front.</p><br/><p>The second round assessment has less people than the first one, so in order to not waste any time, they put dozens of platforms for refining pills at once so that the examinees could take the test together.</p><br/><p>Because he could choose whichever platform that he wanted, after You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao heard the announcement, he chose the usual spot: the corner.</p><br/><p>But not long after he chose his spot, a purple figure immediately picked the platform next to him. You XiaoMo was startled when he found out that the person was unexpectedly Teng ZiXin. When she saw him looking at her, Teng ZiXin looked at him nonchalantly, removing the hair on her cheek with her two fingers, and smiling softly with a hint of interest, \u201cYou XiaoMo, show me your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if you want to know my strength, you don\u2019t have to purposely move to my side, you know?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought, without saying a word while he moved his gaze from her.</p><br/><p>Not far away from his place, BaiLi XiaoYu actually wanted to pick a platform beside You XiaoMo, but he didn\u2019t expect that Teng ZiXin would beat him to do that. She really made his teeth itch (t/n: it\u2019s used when you really hate a certain person that it makes you want to bite them).</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu had to comfort him, and let him choose the platform in front of You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>The magic herbs used for the assessment were provided by the association. Because they have to refine a level four magic pill to pass, the association wouldn\u2019t provide different magic herbs to suit each people. Therefore, even though Teng ZiXin is currently a level five mage, she still got the same test material as other people. So for her, this round\u2019s assessment was as easy as drinking water.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>T/N:Dage () = big brother, eldest brother.

His first reaction is to look in all four directions. Only after making sure that there is no one around does he let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao puts his hand on his forehead and drawls, \u201cLittle brother, your face is very red. It can\u2019t be that you\u2019ve caught a fever <i>ba</i>. Do you want Elder brother me to help you lower your temperature?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face is bright red. He immediately flings away his hand. You\u2019re the one with the fever, your whole family have fevers!</p><br/><p>He has no idea that in some way, it can be said that he is also a member of Ling Xiao\u2019s whole family.</p><br/><p>Although Ling Xiao very much wants to eat tofu a few more times, he knows that now is not the time. Tofu <i>ma</i>, naturally it\u2019s best to eat to ones heart\u2019s content. But of course, stealing a few pieces here and there is also not bad.</p><br/><p>It takes half a day before You XiaoMo realizes that he has been fooled again by Ling Xiao. Luckily he has long ago tempered his heart into that of copper skin and steel bones. Therefore \u2026\u2026. this time he doesn\u2019t make a fuss. But what should be made clear should still be made clear.</p><br/><p>So, You XiaoMo nudges Ling Xiao, \u201cIn the end, what is that ability of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao strokes his chin, not answering his question immediately, as if he is having some difficulty.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks with uncertainty, \u201cYou can\u2019t say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glances at him, his expression full of amusement, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t say. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m not sure if I want to tell you now or continue whetting your appetite <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is speechless. This guy is purposely saying these words to irk him right?</p><br/><p>Definitely, certainly, absolutely!</p><br/><p>He can\u2019t go one day without playing with him <i>ba</i>? The more he thinks, the angrier he gets. You XiaoMo simply throws down these words, \u201cDo whatever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then turns around and walks off, as if saying \u2018I\u2019m going to give you the silent treatment.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao deftly pulls him back and secures him in his arms, \u201cOk <i>ba</i>, Ok <i>ba</i>. Since you are asking me so pitifully, I\u2019ll let you know ok.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, You XiaoMo\u2019s ears perk up instantly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lowers his head and bites his ear. Before saying anything, You XiaoMo already yells out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to speak, just speak <i>ma</i>. Why bite my ear?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo holds his ear. He can still feel the dampness and wonders if the ear is one of his sensitive points?</p><br/><p>Of course he knows. Ling Xiao laughs *ha ha* as he looks at him, \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t tease you anymore. Time to get serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pushes him an arm length away, \u201cYou stand there and say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao spreads his hands out helplessly. Looks like he can\u2019t eat him anymore since he is so on guard against him. He continues speaking after a pause, \u201cThe reality is, I\u2019m not eating their corpses. To put it correctly, it should be sucking up their soul. Then I recover their memories from their souls. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why does the body disappear?\u201d</p><br/><p>This is the point he is most concerned about.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t disappear. I just threw it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is stunned for a moment, quickly asking, \u201cThrow where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao says, \u201cRubbish heap.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201d \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You think my eyes are just for display?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shakes his finger, \u201cNot the rubbish heap you are thinking of. The one I\u2019m speaking of is the rubbish heap that\u2019s a spatial black hole.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks, \u201cWhat is this spatial black hole?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, he saw it with his own eyes. That thing was really a black hole but it seem to come from his hand. Since it is an ability of his, does that mean the black hole exists in his hand?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulls him along and speaks as they walk, \u201cThe spatial black hole is a peculiar dimension. Inside are immeasurable spatial forces. Even an Emperor level fighter would be torn into pieces in a second. Anyway, you will soon understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bluntly speaking, it is a place to get rid of incriminating evidence.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo subconsciously ponders this point. If this thing was placed on 21st century Earth, it would be an unbeatable killing cheat. Of course, in Long Xiang continent, the land of killing people and silencing witnesses, it is the essential medicine for daily life and travel. If you put the person you want to kill inside it, it would no longer exist in this world. Even if some interested party wants to investigate, they probably won\u2019t be able to find any web of the spider or trace of horses\u2019 hooves.</p><br/><p>But, what level does one have to be to be able to open the black hole whenever they want?</p><br/><p>Until now, You XiaoMo still hasn\u2019t discovered that Ling Xiao is actually not human. Or one can say that he has actually figured out long ago that Ling Xiao is not human. It\u2019s just that his level of understanding is not the same, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I should have said, I have already told you. There are no other questions <i>ba</i>. Next I\u2019ll bring you to a good place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulls his hand and walks off, looking very mysterious.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opens his mouth wanting to ask but thinking that he will soon see it anyway, he bears with it.</p><br/><p>As for Da Piqiu, he has long been neglected into a dark corner by the two people. However, it is still very happy, bounding to its feet, following after them, his tail wagging cheerfully.</p><br/><p>After a while, You XiaoMo realizes that the road they are on is very familiar. So familiar that he recalls certain stones that still have Da Piqiu\u2019s bloody paw prints, like a cluster of flowers. Da Piqiu also purposefully runs over to admire his own paw prints making him unable to bear it any longer, kicking it until it flies away.</p><br/><p>This <b>number two</b>, what\u2019s there to be in awe of in ones own paw prints? If you want to admire, you should admire him <i>ah</i>!!</p><br/><p>*<b>Ke ke</b>*, You XiaoMo follows Ling Xiao into the cave of the golden black leopard they discovered earlier. After just a few steps, that black leopard runs out. Its eyes are turning round and round while flashing brightly as it prostates extremely piously before Ling Xiao as if it is submitting itself to the stronger one or maybe for some other reason.</p><br/><p>Witnessing this scene, You XiaoMo can already guess what happened.</p><br/><p>No wonder this black leopard didn\u2019t really attack Ling Xiao before. No wonder it could accurately dodge Elder Wang\u2019s attack. On top of that, it seemed to be so familiar with their plan. Looks like it was all due to Ling Xiao\u2019s devious plan.</p><br/><p>Looks like he had already colluded with the black leopard when he first entered.</p><br/><p>Walking in a few steps further, You XiaoMo discovers a stalk of fiery red magic herb.</p><br/><p>The magic herb is standing still in a small corner of the cave, giving off a thick fragrance. The whole cave seems to be filled with this fragrance.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo can\u2019t help taking in a deep breath, his eyes open wide.</p><br/><p>This stalk of magic herb is simply not a level six magic herb. He can feel the waves from the magic herb. It is higher than a level six magic herb by one level. Although he can\u2019t name this stalk of magic herb, it is clearly a level seven magic herb.</p><br/><p>This is the first time he sees a level six magic beast guarding a stalk of level seven magic herb!</p><br/><p>However, what surprises him is that Ling Xiao didn\u2019t dig out this stalk of magic herb. He thought that Ling Xiao was bluffing Elder Wang and the rest when he said he didn\u2019t get to dig out the magic herb. Looks like he really didn\u2019t dig it out.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glances at his expression. The corner of his lips rises slightly, \u201cLittle brother, do you know what is this stalk of level seven magic herb?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gulps, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying something like this, it must be something big.</p><br/><p>A brilliant smile appears on Ling Xiao\u2019s face as he lifts up the hair by his ear, \u201cShapeshifting herb, have you heard of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s jaw drops open in shock. Although he isn\u2019t very familiar with level seven magic herbs, it\u2019s impossible that he hasn\u2019t heard of the much celebrated shapeshifting herb, because to magic beasts, the shapeshifting herb is the thing they dream about. With this magic herb, they can assume human form.</p><br/><p>No matter if it\u2019s low level or mid-level or even high level magic beasts, the first aim they have from the moment of birth is to cultivate to achieve the ability to shapeshift. Most of the time, the ability to shapeshift is their number one priority.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s because the cultivation speed of a magic beast that can shapeshift is faster than that of one that can\u2019t.</p><br/><p>As everyone knows, the ability of a magic beast to assume human form early on signifies that its level is high. As with the Blue-blooded wolf, there is a restriction of level eight and above. If it\u2019s not fated, they can\u2019t even dream of shapeshifting to cultivate to a higher level their whole life. Therefore, for them, the shapeshifting herb is something they must have even if it means risking their lives.</p><br/><p>Of course there are certain magic beasts with noble bloodlines. They can assume human form from birth. To put it in human terms, these type of magic beasts are equivalent to an emperor\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>However, this type of noble magic beasts are extremely rare. Even in Long Xiao continent, an emperor class magic beast has never appeared before.</p><br/><p>Some say that when the emperor appears, ten thousand beasts will fall silent!</p><br/><p>If this class of emperor magic beast really exists, probably all the magic beasts in Long Xiao continent will have to obey them.</p><br/><p>Going back to the point, the shapeshifting herb is able to break through the bloodline restriction of magic beasts. It\u2019s another way for them to have the chance to break free from the restraints of their bloodline, to achieve an even higher level.</p><br/><p>No wonder this golden black leopard is guarding this stalk of shapeshifting herb to the death, guarding it no matter what the cost. The allure of the shapeshifting herb is just too great for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, this shapeshifting herb doesn\u2019t seem to be mature.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gulps strongly, an immature magic herb means there is still a chance it may drop seeds.</p><br/><p>This stalk of shapeshifting herb, although completely fiery red, is certainly not an ultimate red. He has seen the record of the shapeshifting herb on the magic beast scroll. The deeper the color means that the shapeshifting herb is slowly getting more mature. Only when it turns the deepest red will it be really mature. Clearly the shapeshifting herb is still a ways away from maturity right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, let\u2019s dig it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao says.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was waiting for those words. Without further ado, You XiaoMo takes out a little spade from his dimension.</p><br/><p>The golden eyes of the black leopard lying submissively on the ground suddenly reveals a very human-like extremely begrudging look.</p><br/><p>At that time, when it inadvertently discovered this stalk of shapeshifting herb, the wild joy that sprang up in his heart cannot be described. And then, in order to protect the shapeshifting herb, he endlessly defeated those magic beasts that were drawn to the shapeshifting herb. A few times he was even teetering on the brink of death but survived by holding on to a singular thought, successfully defending the shapeshifting herb. And yet, it will soon have to hand it over on a silver platter.</p><br/><p>The black leopard is extremely unwilling but faced with the tremendous pressure emanating from the bloodline of this man in front of him, he has no choice but to submit. This kind of helpless feeling suddenly leaves it feeling miserable.</p><br/><p>Discovering his state of mind, Ling Xiao\u2019s lips lift up, \u201cThe shapeshifting herb won\u2019t be your contribution in vain. Of course you will receive the benefits later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, the golden eyes of the black leopard light up instantly.</p><br/><p>Although the man doesn\u2019t say the exact benefits, noble magic beasts loathe to lie, especially this man in front of him. His level is possibly higher than it ever imagined.</p><br/><p>Such a grand person is promising him good things. Of course he won\u2019t go back on his words, so it immediately feels relieved.</p><br/><p>Because the shapeshifting herb is a level seven herb, You XiaoMo digs with utmost care to ensure that it remains intact. He takes almost half an hour before he is successful in digging up the shapeshifting herb completely, including the roots buried below. He then quickly transplants the shapeshifting herb into his dimension.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he is done, Ling Xiao calls him over. He gestures to the black leopard next to him and says, \u201cLittle brother, bond with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes light up immediately, but as if having thought of something, he says rather awkwardly, \u201cElder brother Ling, I want to bond this black leopard to Second brother or Fifth brother. Can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao has long understood how his heart works, but he still shakes his head, \u201cYou can\u2019t. Lei Ju and the others have seen this black leopard. It\u2019s hard to guarantee that they won\u2019t recognize it. If you want to find magic beasts for them, we\u2019ll look for others.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo feels that it\u2019s very reasonable so he agrees. Only then does he walk over to bond with the black leopard.</p><br/><p>Because of Ling Xiao, the black leopard doesn\u2019t resist, forming a bond with You XiaoMo very quickly, becoming You XiaoMo\u2019s second bonded magic beast. And so Da Piqiu finally gets a companion. It has a look of enthusiastic welcome as it very quickly runs over cheerfully to engage it in lively conversation \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p><b>Notes:</b></p><br/><p>Eat tofu \u2013 take advantage/flirt</p><br/><p>Number two \u2013 stupid fella</p><br/><p>*ke ke* \u2013 *ahem*</p><br/><p>___________________________</p><br/>\n</div>"}

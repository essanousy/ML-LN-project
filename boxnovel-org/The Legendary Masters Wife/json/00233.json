The aura inside the space is very thick, so it\u2019s very suitable for them to practice. Besides, even if they go out, they have nothing to do. They figured they might as well just stay inside the space.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had given them tasks to do, so, after a few discussions, they decided to rotate the tasks. They used ten days as a standard cycle. After ten days, another person would take over. When You XiaoMo arrived, it was PiQiu who was on duty.</p><br/><p>PiQiu looked exactly the same as a few months ago, he didn\u2019t have any changes at all; neither his height nor his weight. When one looked at his fat, one would instantly know that he got enough nutrition.</p><br/><p>PiQiu was watering the magic herbs using magic water, when he saw You XiaoMo walk over, he immediately threw the water away and ran towards him. \u201cMaster, did you finally come to see me?\u201d PiQiu asked happily with his two big round eyes. Looking at his expression, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t tell him the truth, so he said, \u201cYes, I came to see you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he had just finished saying that sentence, there was a \u2018pfftt\u2019 sound coming from the direction of the lake. It was followed by a mocking voice, \u201cEither you are just plain stupid, or you don\u2019t want to admit it. There\u2019s no way master would especially come here just to see you. He obviously is just about to take out a new magic herb seed, that\u2019s the reason he came.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who said that was Xiao Hei, his appearance looked so cool, but unfortunately he talks a lot, and his words were especially poisonous. He really made people\u2019s <strong>teeth become itchy (hate to the point of wanting to bite the other person)</strong> just by listening to him. You XiaoMo already heard his sarcastic tone many times, so he had already gotten used to it. Besides, he knew, even though Xiao Hei has a sharp tongue, he actually has a gentle heart. Of course his gentle side was only towards them, to outsiders, his statement was usually only how he would treat them.<strong>(Yuan\u2019s note: Xiao Hei is the epitome of tsundere *cough cough*)</strong></p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, is what Xiao Hei just said true?\u201d PiQiu looked at You XiaoMo anxiously.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo almost got a cold sweat on his face, so he immediately took out food from his magic bag. It was mutton that Ling Xiao preserved before. \u201cPiQiu, eat this meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu was already drooling when he smelled the meat, after that he immediately grabbed it and ran straight into the corner. Xiao Hei, who saw this, said \u2018a good for nothing glutton\u2019 coldly.</p><br/><p>Although PiQiu was small, he is one hundred percent a glutton, especially for meat. Not to mention this mutton\u2019s meat effect, even an ordinary demon beast\u2019s meat would make him drool with envy. So everytime he saw him act like this, Xiao Hei would call him names.</p><br/><p>PiQiu didn\u2019t care. As long as he had meat, he wouldn\u2019t mind being abused with a hundred or a thousand sentences.</p><br/><p>After he dealt with PiQiu, You XiaoMo took a wooden basin from the blockhouse, and scooped out some magic water from the lake. He then put in all the magic herb seeds that Liu Yue gave him. The seeds were multicolored, just like the multicolored stones that You XiaoMo had in a fish tank in his previous life.</p><br/><p>Talking about stones, he admired himself for his talent. Back then he had nothing in his rented room, he especially went to the market one day to buy some multicolored stones to pretty up his room. However, since he couldn\u2019t afford fish, he had only bought the stones.</p><br/><p>The seeds that Qingcao Court gave weren\u2019t really plump, some of them were even already dehydrated and shriveled, almost as if they had already been abandoned. If they continued to be like this, they wouldn\u2019t grow up well, so he had to puff them up for one night until the seeds could absorb all the magic water. This was so that he didn\u2019t have to take special care of them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had already experimented with it before. He had sowed some seeds that were about to die, and it grew up so badly that he had to use a lot of energy to correct it. After he finished digging it up, You XiaoMo went to find SheQiu and the others. These days, they all took human form and sat in meditation positions at the lakeside to practice. In just a few months, they all had already leveled up one to two stars. They leveled up much faster compared when they were practicing at the Paradise Realm. After they received such a benefit, they all refused to go out.</p><br/><p>After he saw them, You XiaoMo went to the dipper herb field. At first, he thought that the Dipper Stink Bugs were still in the middle of their metamorphosis process, because when he checked the information about Dipper Stink Bugs later, it said that the third metamorphosis would take a very long time. For some it would take up to half a year, while some even needed a year. But, it seemed like his only needed two months, because they were already playing tag with each other in the magic herb fields, having a good time.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo examined them and made sure that they didn\u2019t have any problems, and realized that there wasn\u2019t any difference from after their metamorphosis. Their sizes and colors were still the same as before, and here he thought that there would at least be some difference.</p><br/><p>After PiQiu finished his meat, he ran to You XiaoMo with his two short legs and drum-like belly. You XiaoMo immediately gave him a task to sprinkle the seeds from inside the wooden basin in the magic herb field tomorrow. PiQiu patted his own meaty chest and ensured him that he will certainly complete this task.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hei, who was at the lakeside, casually threw out a bomb, just like usual, \u201cThe blockhead who only knows how to eat, and the idiot who deceives his own family to count their gold coins.\u201d (lying to others to do the job to make profit)</p><br/><p>PiQiu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Xiao Hei, you\u2019re too conceited! You don\u2019t feel good if you don\u2019t insult other people for a day, do you?!</em></p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wiped off the blood he had vomited from Xiao Hei\u2019s words. He coaxed PiQiu well before he left, promising that the next time he would reward him with 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) of meat, which clearly shot straight into PiQiu\u2019s heart, making him immediately throw all XiaoHei\u2019s words behind him.</p><br/><p>PiQiu, \u201cMaster, don\u2019t worry, I will work super hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>XiaoHei, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had wanted to take a bath in the space at first, but Ling Xiao had forbidden him from doing so, because the Qiu team was inside there. Ling Xiao said that only he can see You XiaoMo\u2019s body, so he took away his right to bathe inside the space. You XiaoMo had once put on a boycott, but it was suppressed ruthlessly, even his <strong>chrysthanthemum</strong>nearly got picked. Since then, You XiaoMo never dared to take a bath inside the space again, unless it was absolutely essential.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo got out of the space, he had yet to react and Ling Xiao, who was standing beside the screen, looked at him with a \u201ctender\u201d face and waved his hand at You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo subconsciously walked over, as he took a step, he suddenly discovered there seemed to be something behind the screen.</p><br/><p><em>Steam?</em></p><br/><p>You XiaoMo widened his 2.0 vision eyes, like an X-ray piercing through the screen. He could vaguely see a large bathtub that could hold three to four people, filled with hot water. The steam earlier was coming from the tub.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo silently took a step back, thinking something, very brutal ah. After what happened last time, You XiaoMo moved away from the bathtub. He couldn\u2019t help but think about that obscene scene of that night they took a bath together.</p><br/><p>The thing called \u201d help him bathe\u201d, when someone really did all three options, You XiaoMo felt he really had lost big time.</p><br/><p>Seeing him want to flee, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t immediately stop him, he just smiled, a very tender smile, but it immediately gave You XiaoMo a chill up his spine, his body suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gently said, \u201cXiao Momo, I\u2019ll give you two choices. Either come here and take a bath, and I will be gentle with you tonight. Or we can take a bath tomorrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI choose the latter.\u201d You XiaoMo didn\u2019t wait for him to finish and chose the second option without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Look at this! It had become his conditioned reflex! But after rethinking again, You XiaoMo felt that the latter choice seemed even more extreme than the first.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really sure?\u201d Ling Xiao expression changed, first he looked at You XiaoMo with weird eyes, then he suddenly exposed a very immoral smile while asking You XiaoMo again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2026was uncertain. <em>This expression, why did it look so dangerous ah!</em></p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallowed his saliva, \u201cThat \u2026. what did you say about the second option? I didn\u2019t hear it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao brightly smiled, wickedly looking at him. \u201cThe second choice is that we will do it tomorrow, but\u2026 I won\u2019t promise I will hold myself back tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo,\u201d\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He swore to god, after this he definitely needed to give up on his halfass listening habit.</p><br/><p>In the future, every word Ling Xiao said, he must listen to them loud and clear, or else he could easily fall into a trap.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a deep breath. He wouldn\u2019t stupidly ask for a third choice, because with Ling Xiao\u2019s IQ, he would definitely come up with a more vulgar and shameless method. Since You XiaoMo had experienced it two times, he realized if he still repeated this lowly mistake then he was definitely a dumbass.</p><br/><p>But, the second option, he certainly wouldn\u2019t choose it. They had to leave for the academy the day after tomorrow, and how could he forget about Ling Xiao\u2019s stamina.</p><br/><p>This man was not only savage in action, but his endurance was also top notch. Every time he would always do it more than twice. In the end, only You XiaoMo was the one to suffer. Which means he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave the bed the next day, so\u2026You XiaoMo could only choose the first choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome!\u201d Ling Xiao once again waved at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitated a little bit, dawdled, then came forward while bargaining, \u201cPromise you will be gentle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cAs long as you obey, I will be gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201cAs long as you treat me gentle, I will obey.\u201d Since his head was on the table anyway, and running would still result in death, he might as well have a clean death. Worse case scenario, he might have to stay on the toilet longer than normal.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t say a word. He just stared at You XiaoMo for awhile, before he seemingly, unwillingly gave a nod.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What\u2026what was with the reluctant expression? Don\u2019t tell me he really was trying to fool me?</em></p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was obviously only ten steps away from Ling Xiao, yet he took nearly five whole minutes until he stopped walking, which really tickled someone\u2019s patience. Ling Xiao then came over, picked him up and threw him into the tub to let the night begin. Which, he thought later, he should have done right from the start!</p><br/><p><b>chrysanthemum</b><strong>: Ahem. If you do not know this term. I shall explain. In Chinese culture, due to the way a chrysanthemum blooms, many people have referenced that it looks similar to the asshole. Which, is why, ExR often uses the term \u201c<b>chrysanthemum milk tea\u201d in many of our lewd, vulgar, uncultured jokes. If you can\u2019t handle our jokes, you are free to not read them. Or, maybe you should go read a Honey Q manga and see exactly how tame our jokes and comments are compared to others.

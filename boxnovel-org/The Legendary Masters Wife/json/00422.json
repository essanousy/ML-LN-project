Ling Xiao really didn\u2019t even twitch his eyebrow at all and he could not help but be puzzled. Even You XiaoMo himself felt that it was inconceivable for this sort of unexpected mishap to occur, how come he didn\u2019t have any reaction?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao noticed his hesitance, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave a forced laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that this incident was very dramatic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave him a deep look, \u201cWhat\u2019s so surprising about it? Whatever dramatic things that happen to you would all become ordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, You XiaoMo told him that he needed to go to the XiaoYao Institute in the afternoon to take the third assessment, so he only had two hours of free time now. They headed directly back to their hotel due to the time constraint.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo originally wanted to stick together with Ling Xiao to take a nap, but who would have thought that just as he thought about Yin Ge and the rest in the morning, the people that Xiong Xiao sent arrived and brought along news of Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan at the same time.</p><br/><p>It turned out that Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan were no longer in the Southern Continent. Not long after they returned to the Tong Tian Continent, they were called back by Yin Ge\u2019s father, the Nine-Headed Serpent King.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge probably wanted to get the help of his father\u2019s strength to rescue Feng ChiYun, so he responded to his father\u2019s summon and returned to Xi Jing. Unexpectedly he was instead confined by his father, who did not let him go to rescue Feng ChiYun.t/n: Xi Jing, literally means Western Border.As for this, the most important point was that Yin Ge made a miscalculation.</p><br/><p>The members of the Nine-Headed Serpent King\u2019s clan was even less than the Four Divine Ancient Beasts Clan. They did not number more than three even with the addition of Yin Ge. Thus for the clan of the Nine-Headed Serpent King, reproduction was the most important thing.</p><br/><p>How could the Nine-Headed Serpent King let Yin Ge court his death under this sort of circumstances?</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Blood Clan was a huge monster. No matter how formidable the Nine-Headed Serpent King Clan was, they could not become enemies with the Vermillion Blood Clan. One careless mistake and the members of their clan would drop by one again. Moreover, Feng ChiYun was also a man.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his son actually cared about a man so much, the Nine-Headed Serpent King who was fully aware of his son\u2019s innate character, detected an unusual smell and immediately rejected Yin Ge\u2019s request. At the same time, he was afraid that Yin Ge would go and provoke the Vermillion Blood Clan, so he put Yin Ge into confinement.</p><br/><p>This was the genuine drama!</p><br/><p>Never did You XiaoMo think that this sort of incident would happen on Yin Ge\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>It looked like now, the first thing he would have to do for him to rescue Feng ChiYun was to escape from his father and to become stronger, as it would be difficult to rescue Feng ChiYun with his current strength. Furthermore, Feng ChiYun could not be rescued in a short time.</p><br/><p>As for Zhan YuXuan, he was currently thinking of a way to free Yin Ge since he had not been confined by the Nine-Headed Serpent King. Zhan YuXuan learnt that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were looking for them, thus he let Xiong Xiao\u2019s men notify You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao to not worry about them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sympathized with Yin Ge, but he could understand the Nine-Headed Serpent King\u2019s way of thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Zhan YuXuan said not to worry about this, we don\u2019t need to gather any information about them after this. Next you should just be at ease and wait for the third assessment. There should only be three assessments for the XiaoYao Institute\u2019s evaluation right?\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded, \u201cThere are only three assessments, but the first two were really too easy. I think the really difficult one should be the third assessment. This assessment would probably eliminate more than seventy to eighty percent of the people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventy to eighty percent? I think that it\u2019s more than that!\u201d Ling Xiao touched his smooth and clean chin, as he profoundly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You XiaoMo was somewhat curious upon seeing him smile so deviously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third assessment could very possibly have some other trick, otherwise it is practically impossible to depend on this assessment to directly eliminate so many people, unless there\u2019s an assessment within the assessment.\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pondered over it for a while but still did not understand.</p><br/><p>Two hours passed in a flash while they filled their stomachs and took a short nap.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao arrived early at the XiaoYao Institute. This time, they saw Tan Ze who was waiting outside for them before they went in. Tan Ze happily walked over upon seeing them.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow You, you\u2019ve finally arrived. I was just waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaiting for me, why?\u201d You XiaoMo asked in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Tan Ze explained, \u201cIt\u2019s like this, XiaoYao Institute decided to separate you and several others from the rest to conduct the third assessment, so the elders asked me to bring you over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded in understanding, he looked at Ling Xiao and suddenly inquired, \u201cCan I ask whether I can bring others in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Ze suddenly felt awkward.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo saw his expression, \u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d Then he frowned.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Tan Ze gritted his teeth, but still nodded in acquiescence, \u201cAlright then, but you can\u2019t converse loudly. Otherwise you\u2019ll be chased out.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was delighted, \u201cRest assured, he will definitely shut his mouth tightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The location of the third assessment was not at where yesterday\u2019s second assessment was conducted. Tan Ze led them for quite a distance until the signs of human habitation became more and more sparse, only then he stopped in front of a black colored building.</p><br/><p>There were two people guarding the entrance of the building. Tan Ze greeted the two before bringing them in.</p><br/><p>Just as they walked in, You XiaoMo saw the group of people from yesterday. Not a single one was missing, including that thirty-something year old uncle who was last. He embarrassedly discovered that he seemed to be the last to arrive.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere instantly became very subtle after he arrived.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze indistinctly landed on him and the probing gazes gave You XiaoMo the feeling of having the color of his panties seen through, though he only had boxers.</p><br/><p>This shy and embarrassing thinking nearly made his choke to death on his own saliva.</p><br/><p>Tan Ze let them wait here before he left.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo calmly ignored those gazes as he pulled Ling Xiao over to a corner, \u201cThat guy in black with a cool and hip look is Jiu Ye. Yesterday, his result was a fifth grade. His was the highest other than mine. Opposite him, the young man who has two deep dimples when smiling is Qiao WuShuang\u2019s cousin, Qiao WuXing, with a rainbowed fourth grade\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDimple?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze immediately fell onto Qiao WuXing\u2019s face. There were really two dimples.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo enthusiastically bubbled, \u201cDon\u2019t you also feel that his dimples are very special?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not unusual for a man to have dimples, but it was his first time seeing such deep dimples on a man\u2019s face. The most unusual thing was that the other party also loved to smile.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes as he watched him, then he suddenly stretched out his hand and pinched You XiaoMo\u2019s cheek, \u201cDon\u2019t you also have dimples on your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swatted his hand away and resentfully said, \u201cThat\u2019s different, and you can completely ignore mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo decided not to speak about Qiao WuXing\u2019s dimples anymore, so as to avoid Ling Xiao teasing his body again. In his heart, men with dimples would not be very masculine.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao leaned toward him and suddenly let out a hint of an indistinct joy in calamity and delight in the disaster of others, \u201cIt\u2019s honestly different, but your dimples still look better.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo calmly pulled his hand down and grinned at him, \u201cThanks for the compliment. The assessment is starting soon, don\u2019t talk anymore. I even promised Tan Ze before we entered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled back at him in reply, \u201cThe one who promised him is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo choked and silently swallowed back the blood in his throat. He decided, before the third assessment ended, he did not intend to speak with Ling Xiao anymore.</p><br/><p>After a while, Yan Hui suddenly walked over and the one who followed him was that uncle. The two walked to him. Yan Hui in particular greeted him very naturally, as if he had established a revolutionary friendship with You XiaoMo yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow You, is this the friend you mentioned yesterday?\u201d Yan Hui curiously eyed Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Did he tell him about Ling Xiao yesterday?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was astonished. Soon after, he thought that it may have been possible that he overheard the conversation between An Qiao and him and it not find it odd anymore. \u201cYes!\u201d With that, his gaze shifted to the uncle, what are you doing over here, am I very familiar with you ma?</p><br/><p>The uncle was slightly nervous, \u201cI am Cheng XiangRong. I\u2019ve already heard what happened yesterday. You\u2019re really awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did he have feeling of being struck by lightning?</p><br/><p>Before him was an uncle was looking at him with an expression of worship. That gaze, that little gaze\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly calmed down and seriously stated, \u201cYou\u2019re also very awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>The uncle broke into a simple and honest smile.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, Elder Qing\u2019s appearance saved his heart which had already been charred by lightning. You XiaoMo had never been so impatient to be the first person to pass the assessment before.</p><br/><p>There were nineteen people participating in the third assessment including himself. Eight of them were the group of people that You XiaoMo had seen yesterday. He didn\u2019t recognize the rest, but they seemed to be people from the Beast Transfiguration Guild.</p><br/><p>Once Elder Qing appeared, he explained the content of the third assessment to everyone. In the end, it really was as Ling Xiao had guessed. The third assessment actually was not just a single assessment; instead it consisted of two assessments. The first assessment was related to soul perception, and could be abbreviated to \u2013 guessing a riddle!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

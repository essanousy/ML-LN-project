As everyone held their breaths, watching this scene, some people noticed something abnormal about You XiaoMo\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>He suddenly bared his teeth, as if he was gritting his teeth, and he seemed to be a little discontent.</p><br/><p>It looked like he had lost!</p><br/><p>This idea flashed through many people\u2019s minds. However, this was also something that couldn\u2019t be helped. The Thundercloud Pill was a level ten high grade magic pill, but You XiaoMo\u2019s own cultivation level was only at the mid grade. Not only did he want to jump to a higher level by challenging, but he also needed to make the quality of the magic pill better than Teacher Wu\u2019s. These were two big mountains that weighed down his shoulders, and there was no way he could succeed on the first try.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Is he really going to fail?\u201d Tian Xin said, disappointed.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui shook his head and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say it wasn\u2019t possible? It\u2019s still too difficult at XiaoHa\u2019s level of strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin suddenly patted her cheeks forcefully. \u201cNo matter, there\u2019s still one more chance. With the experience of failing the first time, the second time should be a bit better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said he\u2019s going to fail?\u201d At that moment, a familiar, indifferent voice suddenly sounded from next to them.</p><br/><p>They looked behind them to discover that it was Ling Xiao who spoke. It was as if he hadn\u2019t noticed their gazes at all, and the corners of his mouth curved upwards a bit lazily with a hint of carelessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so certain?\u201d Tian Xin plucked up the courage to ask.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced sideways at her and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>In reality, there was already no need for him to answer. You XiaoMo had already given the answer himself, and after eight hours, it had finally concluded. The only thing was that his situation was different from Teacher Wu\u2019s situation. You XiaoMo\u2019s magic pill hadn\u2019t flown out from the cauldron, and the Heavenly Cauldron was still calm and quiet, with no reaction whatsoever.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, he actually failed.\u201d Yan Hui opened his eyes wide. If this kind of situation couldn\u2019t be considered failing, then why hadn\u2019t the magic pill flown out?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the truth or not?\u201d Tian Xin yelled forlornly.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cHow could that be possible? Do you guys not know why the cauldrons ranked in the top ten are famous?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them looked simultaneously at him, uncertain.</p><br/><p>\u201cCauldrons ranked in the top ten all have Restrictive Barrier, and they can prevent the magic pills from flying out when they\u2019re created. This is the biggest difference between the Heavenly Cauldron and Teacher Wu\u2019s Purple Cauldron.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin looked downwards. Just then, You XiaoMo took out a magic pill from the cauldron that was the same color from Teacher Wu\u2019s. The color of the magic pill was impressively close to that of the high grade, and it was about the same as Teacher Wu\u2019s Thundercloud Pill.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the crowd flew into an uproar.</p><br/><p>Not only did You XiaoMo succeed in one try, it was also the exact same as Wu\u2019s. Without borrowing the use of outside objects, he had succeeded in jumping to a higher level and had refined a Thundercloud Pill whose quality was close to high grade.</p><br/><p>Looking at the color, even the judge couldn\u2019t determine who was the winner and who was the loser. Both had their own strong points.</p><br/><p>Teacher Wu burst out laughing. Now he was truly beginning to understand why two great masters regarded You XiaoMo in a special light. This youth\u2019s potential was extremely high, and it was true that he could already surpass a seven color soul while only possessing six colors.</p><br/><p>Teacher Wu walked before You XiaoMo. \u201cWhen this old man was your age, I could not reach the degree that you are at now. This challenge will be considered your win.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cupped his hands and bowed respectfully. \u201cMany thanks, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I never thought that you would have the Heavenly Cauldron, which is ranked seventh. Your luck is truly amazing.\u201d Teacher Wu\u2019s gaze landed onto the Heavenly Cauldron, and his tone carried an obvious trace of admiration.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could only laugh dryly.</p><br/><p>Teacher Wu waved his hand. \u201cThe competition is already over, you can go back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo handed the magic pill to him. \u201cTeacher, this magic pill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA medium grade magic herb isn\u2019t worth many Spirit Gems.\u201d After finishing this sentence, Teacher Wu turned and left, implying that You XiaoMo could take this magic pill himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo retrieved the Heavenly Cauldron and immediately ran over to Ling Xiao, who was sitting in the crowd.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing and the rest of them each congratulated him.</p><br/><p>From tomorrow onwards, You XiaoMo could move to the 70th floor and up. After succeeding at challenging the special rules, the highest floor he could move to was the 90th floor. The rest of the ten floors remaining could only be reached by fighting upwards step by step through the upcoming Challenge Matches. However, from the 90th floor upwards were all some powerful, uncommon monsters, and it was impossible to climb leisurely upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, there\u2019s something else I have to tell you.\u201d After separating, Qiao WuXing suddenly called out to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You XiaoMo looked back.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing said, \u201cThere\u2019s a division in how Giganticus keeps track of your aggregate score. Originally, for the Challenge Matches on the 70th floor and above, every time you win a match you can earn two points, but if you lose, you\u2019ll likewise lose two points.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly calculated. By the time he moved to the 90th floor, every three months he could compete in six matches. If he won all six matches, he could gain twelve points. Thinking like this, he began to greatly anticipate the arrival of the Challenge Matches, because right now he didn\u2019t have a single point on his tallies.</p><br/><p>However, this was also what the situation demanded.</p><br/><p>For most people, having a Challenge Match once every three months was still too long of an gap.</p><br/><p>The Meditation room and the Beast Transfiguration room weren\u2019t the same. When one entered the Beast Transfiguration room, they could still temporarily memorize everything they saw so they could cultivate after they came out. But with one point, one could only stay in the Meditation room for three days, which wasn\u2019t enough time at all.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing and the rest had also only figured this out after they had gone up.</p><br/><p>After returning to their room, You XiaoMo gave the Thundercloud Pill to Ling Xiao as an interest payment.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even blink before directly chewing up the Thundercloud Pill and swallowing it, as if he were eating a jellybean.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was already used to seeing things like this. Magic pills below the rainbow level were already of no more use to him at all, so he decided to utilize the rest of his spare time to quickly raise his own cultivation level.</p><br/><p>Early the next morning, the two of them left XiaoYao Institute again to search for housing.</p><br/><p>After not very long, he would have to move to the 90th floor, so Ling Xiao would also have to move out. However, living in a hotel wasted too many Spirit Gems, as a nicer room would cost five to six Spirit Gems a day. Moreover, they didn\u2019t know how long they would stay in this place, so, acting as a good, hard-working and thrifty wife, You XiaoMo decided to rent a room for Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The room couldn\u2019t be too far from XiaoYao Institute, and it would be best if it wasn\u2019t more than two- to three-thousand meters away.</p><br/><p>They made a circle through the area around XiaoYao Institute following these requirements. The residential district had a few places, but after they asked around a bit, they learned that although the rooms in the Central City were close, they were so expensive that it was like living in Huaxia\u2019s capital, and the land was extremely expensive.</p><br/><p>There were many students in XiaoYao Institute who were also an important source of customers for many shops, so there were several shopping streets nearby, thereby increasing the price of housing in the area immensely.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked all around before finally discovering that the price of living near the shopping streets was between 40,000 to 50,000 Spirit Gems, and that was only for one month. A whole year would cost several hundred thousand Spirit Gems. Some people couldn\u2019t even make several hundred thousand Spirit Gems in an entire year.</p><br/><p>The houses in the residential district were fairly cheap, but if they were to rent it, it would still cost about two- to three-thousand Spirit Gems a month.</p><br/><p>In the end, the conclusion that You XiaoMo reached was this: it was still better to go live in a hotel. Even if they asked for the best room, it still wouldn\u2019t be more than a thousand Spirit Gems a month.</p><br/><p>After running around here and there, they were back at square one in the end.</p><br/><p>In one of the first-class rooms in the hotel, You XiaoMo slumped on the table, sighing heavily. His mood already couldn\u2019t be described anymore using the word \u2018dispirited.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, who hadn\u2019t really spoken from beginning to end, said something, \u201cWife, you outdo my understanding of you every time, and what\u2019s more, every time it gets deeper and deeper. But each time, you actually make me pleasantly surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>People must grow when they encounter setbacks. He was an unbeatable diamond, and he couldn\u2019t be defeated by a small setback like this, You XiaoMo quickly comforted himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we\u2019ve already determined that we should live in a hotel, why didn\u2019t you let me pay for a month in advance just now? Do you not like this hotel?\u201d You XiaoMo remembered how Ling Xiao had only allowed him to pay for a day\u2019s worth of rent before going up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause after this, there\u2019s some business I have to go take care of.\u201d Ling Xiao picked up the teapot and poured himself a cup of tea before gracefully drinking it. Every time You XiaoMo saw this, he felt that this movement didn\u2019t suit him at all, but if he liked it there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat business?\u201d You XiaoMo was confused. During this time, they had resolved many things together, and the only business left to resolve was the matter about the Cang Alliance, but that was coming up too.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cI still must find out the truth about the Dragon Clan bloodline in me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said carefully, \u201cBut didn\u2019t you say that uncle, your father\u2019s trust aide, also probably didn\u2019t know about this? Or else he would\u2019ve told you long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was only a hypothesis, plus I have a different guess in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat guess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you after I confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 you actually wanted to say \u2018I won\u2019t tell you\u2019 just then, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so smart at a time like this, you\u2019ll only hurt yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d But your expression told me bright and clear that that\u2019s exactly what you were thinking. Do I have a loose tongue? You XiaoMo thought angrily.</p><br/><p>After several seconds passed, You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao and said resolutely, \u201cI want to go with you.\u201d There was no intention of asking for permission in this sentence. What he meant was he had already decided on going.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen Piqiu and the rest, and I don\u2019t even know how they\u2019re doing over there with your close uncle, so I want to go and see them too. Also, even if I move to the 70th floor right now I can\u2019t really do anything. I have no points, so I can\u2019t enter the Beast Transmigration room or the Meditation room. Lastly\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo lowered his head and looked shyly at his fingers. \u201cIf you leave for a month again, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see you for a whole month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said calmly, \u201cSpeak the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly responded, \u201cYou squander money too easily, if I don\u2019t go with you, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll spend all of my Spirit Gems again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao knocked him on the head, as the last note of his sentence lifted upwards. \u201cI squander money too easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo covered his head. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d This time, he was determined to remain unmoved for a hundred years.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026you don\u2019t squander money.\u201d Ah, a hundred years passes so fast!</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll let you come with me this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the opportunity that he had used his self-respect in exchange for!</p><br/><p>After leaving the hotel, the two of them walked slowly along the road. Half of the sun had already sunk below the horizon, and everyone\u2019s face was glowing because of the flaming red sunset reflecting on them. They weren\u2019t in any hurry to return to XiaoYao Institute.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoHa!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was about to say something to Ling Xiao when he suddenly heard a voice call out from behind him. It was a little familiar, but probably because it was too far away, he couldn\u2019t remember whose voice it was for a while until the owner of the voice ran in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Cheng?\u201d You XiaoMo looked, surprised, at this person. He had quite a deep impression of Wu Cheng, and whenever he saw him he remembered that incident where hostility turned into friendship. Otherwise, there would be one more person named Wu Cheng among the people who hated him every day.</p><br/><p>Wu Cheng glanced quickly at Ling Xiao before explaining, \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for you this whole time, but you left Zhong Tian. I only heard today that you had returned, so I told my men to keep an eye out for your whereabouts. When I heard that you were here I ran over.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was very curious as for why he was looking for him, because from what he remembered he had only crossed paths with him that one time, and afterwards had never seen him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy were you searching for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to thank you two.\u201d Wu Cheng went straight to the point and said, \u201cYou two made bids for something at an auction in Samsara Tower before, and at that time there was a fatty who competed with you two. If it weren\u2019t for this, my father wouldn\u2019t have have been able to pull down one of the managers at ShuangYu Hotel, so I wanted to personally come and give thanks to you two. This time, I owe you two a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was confused as he listened. A fatty from Samsara Tower? He could only remember that the fellow had a body full of fat, but he had already forgotten what he looked like. However, it seemed that it had been a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came over just to tell me about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, if Wu Cheng had never said anything, he would have never known about this, and he wouldn\u2019t have owed You XiaoMo a favor. But if he thought closely about it, he could guess that using a favor in exchange for some friendly relations was truly very profitable.</p><br/><p>As for how to use this favor, You XiaoMo pondered over it for a day before finally coming up with a good idea. It was something that he had lacked the courage to do for a long time now, so Wu Cheng would definitely be a good choice.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Ra: Final conclusion:\u201cSomeone\u201d is a real spendthrift while the other is a total chicken when in front of his husband &gt;_&gt; They are born for each other</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Otherwise, how could he take one step and end up in another world?</p><br/><p>Knowing that he couldn\u2019t understand them, the dark-skinned man still pulled him over enthusiastically, saying a long string of words to his companions that You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t understand. However, You XiaoMo could tell that they didn\u2019t mean any harm</p><br/><p>Then, You XiaoMo left with their group.</p><br/><p>Not long later, You XiaoMo realized that he had gotten things wrong. This wasn\u2019t Egypt, it was just that their language was similar. They weren\u2019t black people either, just very, very tan from walking in the desert for prolonged periods of time.</p><br/><p>These people weren\u2019t normal mortals. You XiaoMo could sense a very slight pulse of energy from them, something only practitioners had. However, their cultivation base hadn\u2019t even reached the lowest level of Man yet.</p><br/><p>Their group walked on and on through the desert. During this time, there wasn\u2019t even a hint of another person or any greenery whatsoever. They had stopped to rest once, and rehydrate themselves, before continuing in the same direction. They didn\u2019t offer You XiaoMo any water, but he didn\u2019t ask for any either.</p><br/><p>He had thought that they would manage to walk out of the desert just like that, but then a group of sand bandits jumped out at them.</p><br/><p>It was a very sudden attack, and You XiaoMo didn\u2019t even know where they had come from. Was it possible that he simply didn\u2019t notice?</p><br/><p>Obviously not, what with his cultivation base!</p><br/><p>The sand bandits were a group of men on camels, swords in hand. Due to staying in the desert for prolonged periods of time, they were also extremely tan, but their eyes were bright, greedily staring at the group, approaching with malicious smiles.</p><br/><p>The men of the group seemed to be on guard against these people and they all drew clubs from under the camels, running up to meet the bandits. The women and children huddled together in fear, trembling.</p><br/><p>Then the first person fell, bleeding out\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo began to become suspicious. This was an illusion, right? But then, when the second, then third person fell, he couldn\u2019t stay idle any longer. Who cares if it was an illusion? Thus, he acted.</p><br/><p>The scary and powerful bandits were dealt with almost instantly by You XiaoMo. You XiaoMo didn\u2019t kill them, but he incapacitated their cultivation and movement.</p><br/><p>This scene had all the men and women\u2019s eyes wide, expressions incredulous. Then, when they looked at You XiaoMo, their expressions were no longer friendly, but fearful and even somewhat hateful.</p><br/><p>There was only fear, no gratitude at being saved.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, originally wanting to try and communicate with them, was stunned. What sort of reaction was this? He had saved them, after all, was there a need to look at him that way?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t take it to heart. They were just mirages anyways.</p><br/><p>Soon enough though, he experienced constant ostracization. It was clear that they were trying to anger him, like they were testing the degree of his patience.</p><br/><p>So You XiaoMo decided against following them. It didn\u2019t take him long to walk out of the desert alone, and what appeared in front of him was a swath of magnificent buildings, stretching out seemingly forever.</p><br/><p>This illusion really was quite the hard worker, even creating cities for him. But how was he to leave?</p><br/><p>When he walked into the city, he was practically smacked in the face by the dense ambient spiritual energy. He had noticed a while ago that the spiritual energy in this illusion was particularly dense, but the people of the desert didn\u2019t seem to know how to use it, so their cultivation levels were incredibly low.</p><br/><p>A year later.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo appeared in a dirty little alleyway. He was wearing the same attire as the locals, large swaths of fabric wrapped around him, like a mummy.</p><br/><p>Any normal person would\u2019ve probably developed hateful, antisocial thoughts about taking revenge on society and the world at large after all he had been through. After he had entered the city, everything seemed to pass like he was in a fantasy world.</p><br/><p>The people he had saved in the desert seemed to have reported him to the city\u2019s leader. That day, barely within an hour of settling down in a local tavern, he had been surrounded. Originally, he had wanted to teach them a lesson, but then he suddenly realized that there was someone with an even higher cultivation base than he in this world, sticking to the shadows and sabotaging him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know who it was, but the other seemed to be able to accurately predict where he was and where he would go. Within half an hour of arriving in a new place, a bunch of heavily armed people would come running, trying to catch him, forcing him to constantly have to flee and find a new place to stay. Generally, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in one place for over half an hour before having to move.</p><br/><p>Was this really an illusionary world?</p><br/><p>Heaven\u2019s sake, he was going crazy!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo noticed that this world didn\u2019t seem to have any inconsistencies, which meant that he couldn\u2019t break the illusion, so he might be trapped in the illusion forever.</p><br/><p>Normally, illusions would be a trial of emotions, temptations and inner demons. At first, that was what he had thought this was, but then he realized that there was too little that was wrong with this world. It was just like a real world, and he had really been forced to his limit.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wondered to himself despairingly, when will this end?</p><br/><p>That was when the black shadow that was hiding under his feet, waiting for an opportunity, took his absent mindedness as a chance to enter his body. In the next moment, it appeared in his mind\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 I\u2019ve finally gotten a chance. I\u2019ve been waiting a year for this moment, and now it\u2019s finally come! Huh? It seems that my luck isn\u2019t bad, a Rainbow Grade four Mage. What a prize\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sharp, excited voice that erupted in his head in that moment could be described with five words: extremely unpleasant to the ears. It was a hundred times worse than nails on chalkboard. He didn\u2019t know how to describe it; it was like a sound wave attack.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grasped his head in pain, and then he felt that dark shadow attack his soul. Fuck! One\u2019s soul was no joke. He could clearly feel the pain of his soul being assaulted. If this was an illusion, he\u2019ll write his name backwards from now on!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo began to counterattack. Did that thing think it was free to do as it wished by being in his body?</p><br/><p>If it was outside, then he might be worried. He had already realized that this dark shadow was the mysterious person that was stronger than him in this world. Well, at least this saved You XiaoMo the trouble of seeking the other out.</p><br/><p>The battle between souls was the crudest form of combat. Whoever had more power would win!</p><br/><p>That dark shadow let out a scream. \u201cImpossible! Your soul, you\u2019re just a Grade Four mage, how come your soul is so solid?\u201d It was practically tangible.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sneered. Afraid? Good. He knew why, but there was no way he was telling.</p><br/><p>The black shadow tried to run. Right now, it knew that it couldn\u2019t match up to You XiaoMo. Such a powerful soul could only be matched by a legendary Grade Seven mage.</p><br/><p>However, the dark shadow was one step too late. There was no way You XiaoMo was going to let the other escape from inside his body. You XiaoMo trapped the other inside, slowly eroding away at the other\u2019s soul. This guy was a mage as well, and a Grade Five mage, too. His screaming didn\u2019t stop, but he couldn\u2019t defend against the constant expenditure, his soul slowly thinning. One more strike and his soul would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. Let me go and I\u2019ll tell you a secret. You probably want to know if this is an illusion or not, right?\u201d the dark shadow begged. Id he didn\u2019t say something, then he would die. Completely, and utterly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stopped his attacks, but not because of the other\u2019s words. He sneered, \u201cYou think I need you to tell me? Do you think I\u2019m an idiot that hasn\u2019t realized that this isn\u2019t an illusion yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark shadow hurriedly said, \u201cI know you have a lot of questions. I can answer them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then, talk. What the hell is the TongTian Palace doing?\u201d You XiaoMo got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>The dark shadow swallowed. \u201cThis is reality, you already know that. In fact, this is the second exam. Not only you, but everyone else is experiencing the same thing. The basis of soul power is the soul, which means that the soul is extremely important, so this exam tests your soul. If you had failed, I would\u2019ve transported you out anyways. Originally, you shouldn\u2019t know any of this. Once we tell you, then you fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo chuckled. \u201cSo you mean that I\u2019ve failed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark shadow\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cIf you let me go, I can promise to not tell anyone and let you pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t very professional of you, is it?\u201d You XiaoMo spoke meaningfully.</p><br/><p>The dark shadow gave a strained laugh. \u201cI really did underestimate your strength. Even I\u2019m not a match for your strength. I think I\u2019m probably the only one who\u2019s been beaten so badly by a examee, to the point of begging. I just hope you won\u2019t tell anyone about this after you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled. \u201cNo worries, I won\u2019t tell anyone. After all, killing a member of the TongTian Palace isn\u2019t anything honorable. If anyone finds out, then I\u2019ll be in trouble, wouldn\u2019t you say, you liar?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark shadow startled.</p><br/><p>And then, a thick layer of killing intent enveloped him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

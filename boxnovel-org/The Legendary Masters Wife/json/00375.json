This was precisely what made him even more displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Master. Ling Xiao\u2019s always like this. Just ignore him.\u201d You XiaoMo hurried to appease him, afraid that the old man would take out his anger on him. That would really be terrible.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian was unaffected by his appeasement and threw something at him angrily. \u201cTake this,\u201d he said in a harsh tone.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurried to catch it and found that the old man had thrown him a jade drive and it looked different from the information jade drives he had purchased before at Xian Ji Lou. This one was red. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cMaster, what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not have eyes to look for yourself?\u201d Duan QiTian harrumphed.</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s eye twitched. He knew that he would be the one paying for Ling Xiao\u2019s taunting. Of course he knew this was a jade drive; he was asking about what it contained.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo decided to avoid angering the old man further, and respectfully asked, \u201cMaster, why are you giving me this jade drive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not from me,\u201d Duan QiTian said unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot from you, Master? Then who?\u201d You XiaoMo asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was a decision made after I discussed things with Hei Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was confused. \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian explained, \u201cAs your man said, the reason DaoXin Academy was able to obtain the Elemental Essence is doubtlessly because of you two. So, to thank you, and repay you for the thirty percent of spirit gems you didn\u2019t receive, I discussed things with Hei Tian and we decided to give you this jade drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this reminder, You XiaoMo suddenly remembered.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t ended up getting back their thirty percent of spirit gems. Though one of Qiu Ran\u2019s helpers had been killed by the Great Elder, the spirit gems weren\u2019t on him, but on that guy called MuShen.</p><br/><p>He had completely forgotten about this because he had been too busy worrying over Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s inside this jade drive?\u201d You XiaoMo looked at the jade drive. If the great elder and Duan QiTian had decided to use this to compensate them, then it wouldn\u2019t just be anything.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian said, \u201cThis jade drive isn\u2019t a normal jade drive, it\u2019s a kind of sealed jade drive. Sealed jade drives aren\u2019t common, but usually, any jade drive with a seal on it will contain something extremely valuable. Hei Tian and I have already tried, but even with our combined strength, we can\u2019t break the seal on the jade drive, so one thing is certain: the person who placed the seal is a level eleven or twelve mage.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sucked in a breath of air.</p><br/><p>The value of something belonging to a Divine or Sacred level powerhouse would probably be comparable to the Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Master, what you\u2019re saying is that neither you or the great elder know what\u2019s in it, only that it\u2019s very valuable information?\u201d</p><br/><p>Discomfort flashed across Duan QiTian\u2019s face, but he still puffed up his chest and said in a confident manner, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched. Can\u2019t believe you actually have the face to say that.</p><br/><p>But if it was a seal made by a Sacred level powerhouse, not even Ling Xiao would be able to break it. Then wouldn\u2019t this jade drive become a mountain of gold that he could only look at but not use?</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, Master, why are you certain it\u2019s a mage?\u201d You XiaoMo asked in curiosity. This was something he had wanted to ask before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause this jade drive was something I and Hei Tian had found in a cavern storage that had existed for at least a hundred thousand years. There was mostly magic herbs and magic pills in there and some scrolls detailing techniques relating to the soul. The owner of the cavern was rather obviously a mage,\u201d Duan QiTian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d Ling Xiao, who had been silent until then, suddenly said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately put the jade drive away without hesitation. Ling Xiao was always right.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian was even more displeased. It hadn\u2019t been easy, taking in this youngest disciple of his and now the said disciple listened to another more than him. It felt like his disciple had been stolen.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d You XiaoMo was met with the sight of the old man making an expression that said \u2018I\u2019m displeased, comfort me\u2019 at him when he looked up. His heart stuttered, what the old man going crazy for now? But he couldn\u2019t say that out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out for moment.\u201d After that, he didn\u2019t even wait for an agreement and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out for a moment. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d You XiaoMo said to Ling Xiao before following the old man outside.</p><br/><p>The old man was waiting for him outside the house and, seeing him, cursed, \u201cToo fucking slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo automatically filtered this out. \u201cMaster, is there anything you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian contemplated on what to say for a while. \u201cDid you complete the dual cultivation book I gave you last time with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flushed. \u201cYes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian then said, \u201cWere you on top or was he?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian didn\u2019t need a response to know the answer, and his face paled a little more. \u201cUseless. You\u2019re a man, don\u2019t you know how to top?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master, do you think I haven\u2019t thought of trying before? But it\u2019s too hard, your student\u2019s combat strength is too low.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but criticize himself internally, remembering how Ling Xiao had given him a chance back then but he had chickened out of topping Ling Xiao. But he wouldn\u2019t tell the old man that even on pain of death.</p><br/><p>Seeing how he refused to talk, Duan QiTian had a sort of rage that one felt when their children didn\u2019t live up to expectations. He took out a bottle and said angrily, \u201cTake this.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took it, shrinking a little. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian huffed. \u201cThis is a pill that I created called the Heart Bewitchment Pill. If you give him this pill, I can promise you that you\u2019ll be able make your wish come true. You only have one chance, so treasure it. I\u2019ll be taking my leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then he really did leave.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared dumbly at the Heart Bewitchment Pill in his hand. In reality, he didn\u2019t have any wishes about that. Plus, if he really did give this to Ling Xiao to eat, he had a feeling that he\u2019d be the one in trouble in the end. Better not do anything reckless.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo carefully put the Heart Bewitchment Pill away. He decided to hide this pill. Ling Xiao couldn\u2019t know about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d Ling Xiao suddenly spoke into his ear.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo jumped in fright and turned to see Ling Xiao behind him. Who knew how long he had been there. \u201cYou you you\u2026 why did you come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat, can I not come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave a strained smile. \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao huffed and turned to go back inside.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly followed after him.</p><br/><p>That was when Ling Xiao suddenly turned, his expression hinting at amusement as he mocking said, \u201cBy the way, remember to tell me when you\u2019re going to use that Heart Bewitchment Pill. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They were overheard, as expected.</p><br/><p>The two returned to their room and Ling Xiao stretched out his palm at him. \u201cLet me see that jade drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave it over without hesitation. He really wanted to know if Ling Xiao could break the seal over it. If he could, they could know the contents immediately.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rolled the jade drive between his thumb and index finger for a while and then said, under You XiaoMo\u2019s expectant gaze, \u201cYour master wasn\u2019t lying. There are several powerful seals on this jade drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeveral?\u201d You XiaoMo asked in shock. He had thought there was only one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, several seals. However, individually, these seals aren\u2019t very strong, but if you place them together, they\u2019ll create a very powerful seal. This seal is extremely hard to break because if you go wrong at any point, the jade drive will immediately turn to dust. I\u2019m guessing that the owner of the jade drive is quite possibly a level twelve mage,\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s way too harsh. What if we can never break it?\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s treasure hunting spirit was shattered in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Ling Xiao said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Seeing how he seemed to have a plan, You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou thought of something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cBefore today, it\u2019d be impossible, but it\u2019s different now. Once I digest Chen QingEr and the others\u2019 cultivation base, I\u2019ll be able to break it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo understood. So it had something to do with cultivation level. \u201cHow long will that take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave a conservative estimate. \u201cThree months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat long!\u201d You XiaoMo exclaimed. Before this, he had thought Ling Xiao was good to go, but suddenly remembered that. \u201cWhat is that Sacrificial Blood Rite, anyways?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret technique of the Qilin clan. Don\u2019t worry. I wouldn\u2019t use it if I couldn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s because Chen QingEr and her companions have very high cultivation levels. The higher the level, the harder to absorb. It\u2019s trickier to transduce it, that\u2019s all. Nothing unusual,\u201d Knowing that he was worried, Ling Xiao comforted him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought for a while and before confirming he wasn\u2019t lying.</p><br/><p>After that day, they began to prepare to leave for the higher plane. The plane was in a different dimension, so they had a lot to prepare, such as a Trans-Dimensional Tunnel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

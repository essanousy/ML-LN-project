Elder brother and Second brother were decided a long time ago. So there are only three remaining spots. Two of them are disciples from Earth peak\u2019s other Elders. The person chosen for the last spot is someone You XiaoMo did not expect. It\u2019s Sixth brother, Mao Can.</p><br/><p>After that, after asking around, he finds out why it is.</p><br/><p>At first, to appear fair, Kong Wen only gave each Elder one spot. Because if he gives an extra spot to either of them, the other one won\u2019t be happy. So Kong Wen simply gives that spot to Zhao Zhen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhen has been in charge of the Hall of Enchanted Herbs for many years. His contribution to Earth peak is also quite significant. Giving him the spot is only right. After hearing this, the two Elders no longer make a fuss.</p><br/><p>But this was only decided by Kong Wen and company the day before. Zhao DaZhou also only found out about it yesterday.</p><br/><p>As for why You XiaoMo knows that Zhao DaZhou doesn\u2019t know, it\u2019s because last night Zhao DaZhou came looking for him. Knowing that his dad has a spot, the first one he thinks of is him. He indicated that he can ask his dad to give the spot to him.</p><br/><p>Regarding this, You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. He really doesn\u2019t understand why Zhao DaZhou is so eager to give the spot to him. But he really can\u2019t accept it. Put aside that Ling Xiao already secured a spot for him. If Uncle Zhao really gives the spot to him, Kong Wen is bound to get offended. He can\u2019t be part of that.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo can\u2019t help asking, \u201cFifth brother, why do you insist on giving me the spot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou is momentarily taken aback. Without any warning, his face turns red. It\u2019s a while before he mumbles softly, \u201cIsn\u2019t there a saying that one should not let one\u2019s own fertile waters flow into the fields of others? That \u2026\u2026. actually I also have my reasons.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is stunned. He simply never thought that this could be the reason. But hearing the words he adds on at the end, he knows that this Fifth brother is being awkward again. Can it be that he is afraid that he would object?</p><br/><p>\u201cFine <i>ba</i>, what is your reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>He relents and asks.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou rolls his eyes here and there while saying, \u201cYou also know that my dad has always been worried about my safety. If I can form a bond with a magic beast, the old man would be able to stop worrying. So, I was thinking, if you chance upon a magic beast in the Paradise realm, maybe you can help me get one to the best of your ability <i>bei</i>. Whatever level is not important to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finishes speaking, his eyes start to be evasive.</p><br/><p>At first, this wasn\u2019t his intention. He purely had a stroke of inspiration making up an excuse for You XiaoMo. But what he said is not entirely an excuse. In reality, he really does want a magic beast.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that once he finishes speaking, he himself starts to feel embarrassed so he added that the level doesn\u2019t matter. What he doesn\u2019t know is that his words sparks an idea in You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>In the end, You XiaoMo still doesn\u2019t accept his good intentions. He doesn\u2019t want to make it difficult for Uncle Zhao. Seeing his resolve, Zhao DaZhou doesn\u2019t say anything anymore.</p><br/><p>That night, after sending off Zhao DaZhou, You XiaoMo starts to pack his things.</p><br/><p>Although Ling Xiao said that he would move in with him a few days ago, he didn\u2019t carry it out immediately. You XiaoMo can also roughly guess the reason why. He must be too busy. But this suits him just fine.</p><br/><p>But not long after Zhao DaZhou leaves, Ling Xiao also came to see him. The reason is precisely to talk about the opening of the Paradise realm. He told him that he already made the necessary preparations. He asked him to pack up his things and then go to the foot of Earth peak this afternoon and wait for him. When the time comes, he would go pick him up.</p><br/><p>Because the opening of the Paradise realm is close at hand, in order to arrive beforehand, TianXin sect and the other sects would set out two days before. So the date to set out is set for this afternoon. They would most probably arrive the morning after tomorrow, if nothing unexpected happens.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo is making his preparations, other people are also making theirs.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hears that the one leading the Earth peak disciples this time is Kong Wen. But because Kong Wen is a level eight mage with half a foot inside the level nine domain, he is also subject to the restrictions, like for martial artists.</p><br/><p>Speaking about Paradise realm\u2019s restrictions for mages, You XiaoMo only found out about it after asking Ling Xiao. Before, he only knows that the Paradise realm has entry restrictions for martial artists. The universal restriction is Star level and below. So Celestial level and above are all banned from entering. But the restriction is also similarly effective against mages.</p><br/><p>Mages are the same as martial artists. Divided into twelve levels. Star level corresponds to a level six mage. Kong Wen is a level eight mage so he can\u2019t enter. Hence, he can only bring the disciples until outside Paradise realm.</p><br/><p>This is undoubtedly good news to You XiaoMo. Because he doesn\u2019t want to bump into Kong Wen inside the Paradise realm. If that happens, it would be very awkward for him.</p><br/><p>After that, You XiaoMo calmly waits for the time to set out. But he is worried that he would miss it so he doesn\u2019t dare to refine magic pills. Because once he starts to refine magic pills, he would easily lose sense of time. He doesn\u2019t want most of the group to have left before he realizes that he himself has been left behind.</p><br/><p>But he clearly forgot one thing. If he can\u2019t find him, Ling Xiao would certainly come up to look for him.</p><br/><p>There is still half an hour to go. It\u2019s time for the people to assemble.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opens the room door. It\u2019s very quiet all around. After making sure there is no one around, he tiptoes away quietly.</p><br/><p>Not long before, Brother Yang came to find him. At that time he wanted to ask him to go together to join in the fun. But he was refused by You XiaoMo because he wants to go to the foot of the mountain to wait for Ling Xiao. But he doesn\u2019t want others to know so he can only do it in secret. Yang Yi also doesn\u2019t think much about it. Seeing that he doesn\u2019t want to go, he leaves with the other disciples.</p><br/><p>The foot of Earth peak is not far away, approximately a five minute walk.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo has only been waiting for two minutes before Ling Xiao appears behind him. He almost punched him in shock. Actually, he really wants to do it but after considering the consequences, he restrains himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, you\u2019re so punctual.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hugs his waist from behind and buries his head in his neck. He rubs his face on him as his voice is rather languid.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolls his eyes at him. I\u2019m not you. Do you think everyone is like you?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, are we going straight or are we going to join everyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks. The everyone else he is talking about is obviously the Warrior division and the mage division. The combat ability of mages is very weak. So they would definitely set out together with the Warrior division.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I made an excuse to let them go set out without waiting for me. After that, \u2018Junior brother Zhou\u2019 and I will make our way there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao says. This is what he told You XiaoMo he would do beforehand. As long as you strike first to gain the advantage, when the time comes, even if Tang Fan objects to him bringing You XiaoMo in with him, it would be too late.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knows that the \u201cJunior brother Zhou\u2019 he speaks of is himself. Although it has all been arranged, he still feels that it is not quite right. He can\u2019t help from feeling troubled, saying, \u201cIs it fine to do it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao knows what he is referring to. He laughs, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Zhou Peng himself agreed. Furthermore I already agreed to find a magic beast with high combat ability for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Peng is actually quite a good person. No matter what he says, he would agree without hesitation although he is curious as to why he wants to treat You XiaoMo so well. But, the moment he hears that he wants to bring You XiaoMo to the Paradise realm, he immediately gave him his spot. Although his loyalty is to Lin Xiao, and not him, but because he is loyal to Lin Xiao, he doesn\u2019t mind helping him increase his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Tang Fan, I\u2019ve already figured out how to deal with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s lips curve up in a gentle smile mixed with a hint of evil. That hint of evil wipes away the assuring look from his face, leaving him looking even more dangerous.</p><br/><p>He knows that Tang Fan would definitely object to him bringing You XiaoMo into the Paradise realm. It may even cause him to dislike him. But so what. He has already found the person he wants to find. By the time the matter with Paradise realm is over, he may have already brought You XiaoMo away with him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao speaks as if he has a well thought out plan so You XiaoMo pouts a few times wordlessly.</p><br/><p>A while later, the both of them reach the foot of TianXin sect. Tang Fan already set out with the whole group of people.</p><br/><p>All the larger winged birds were already taken away by them. Only the smaller ones are left. Most of them can only seat three. Ling Xiao asks Steward Li to give them a winged bird that can seat three. In no time, the winged bird carrying them soars up to the skies.</p><br/><p>Steward Li on the ground shows a puzzled look. The Grand Master clearly told him that it would be the third generation disciples Lin Xiao and Zhou Peng. How did it change to Lin Xiao and Earth peak\u2019s You XiaoMo?</p><br/><p>Steward Li can\u2019t make any sense of it after thinking it over a hundred times. Too bad no one gives him the answer.</p><br/><p>The speed of the winged bird is very fast. The swift figure weaves through the clouds. Only a vast expanse of whiteness lies in front of them as the wind whistles past their ears.</p><br/><p>Luckily it\u2019s not winter. Otherwise, the ice cold wind whipping past his face would be very painful. But You XiaoMo is still not too used to the speed of the winged birds. Every time he takes one, he has to cover his face. With his half-closed eyes he looks over at Ling Xiao beside him with jealousy, envy, and hate.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao is elegantly yet languidly leaning back on the chair with his long and slender legs hanging over the front seat. His laidback appearance really makes a certain person jealous.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally understands why he chose a winged bird that can seat three. Looks like this is the reason. How hateful. He also wants to do that!</p><br/><p>As if sensing the resentment coming from a certain someone, Ling Xiao tilts his head to look at You XiaoMo. He points to the empty space in his arms, raising the corner of lips while saying, \u201cLittle brother, do you want to sit here?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo imagines for a moment how it would look like if he sits there. His face immediately turns red. Wouldn\u2019t that mean he would be straddling Ling Xiao? He glares at him in anger and shame, tearing his head open, \u201cDon\u2019t want!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally don\u2019t want? My arms are very comfortable <i>oh</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao persists, getting up halfway to lean towards his ear. His ambiguous breath teasing his sensitive earlobe. Then he looks with satisfaction as his ears turn bright red and spreads to his cheeks and neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I don\u2019t want means I don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is shamed to anger, pushing him away.</p><br/><p>After being pushed away, Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t insist. Instead he smiles like a cat that caught a fish and leans back on the chair. He says leisurely, \u201cLittle brother, I know you are very shy. It\u2019s alright. My arms are forever open wide for you. You can throw yourselves in my arms any time you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo bares his teeth with lips drawn. He won\u2019t ever throw himself in his arms of his own accord.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao seems to be able to understand the look in his eyes. But he only smiles without saying anything. There is nothing absolute in this word. As the saying goes, where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way <i>ah</i>!</p><br/><p>As a result, the minute night falls, You XiaoMo shrinks into Ling Xiao\u2019s arms of his own accord. It can\u2019t be helped, this person is rather afraid of the cold. Although there are clothes in his magic bag, the thin flimsy things are simply unable to ward off the cold air of the night. It\u2019s not as effective as Ling Xiao, this magnificent wall of flesh.</p><br/><p>As for Ling Xiao, this is his long awaited moment. He confidently hugs the person as if it is his right. Saying that it\u2019s to keep him warm, he rubs him once over all over his body, not forgetting his little brother. Or it should be said, paying most attention to the little brother. As a result, You XiaoMo passes the night feeling hot and bothered, seriously overheated.</p><br/><p>The next day, he wakes up in Ling Xiao\u2019s arms. His first reaction is to hit him. When he covers his chest, he uses the opportunity to run into his dimension to take a bath.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t take off his clothes when he played with him last night because he was afraid that he would catch a cold from the cold air. As a result, he released inside his clothes. When he woke up this morning, his whole body was feeling uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>The second night, Ling Xiao is still planning on using the same old trick. But You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t give him the chance because he realizes that what he did last night was stupid. Clearly he can hide inside his dimension and not subject himself to this kind of torture. He only has to make sure he doesn\u2019t use his soul to move his dimension and he would be able to come back out on the winged bird.</p><br/><p>So, Ling Xiao spends a very desolate night all alone with the <b>*se se*</b> rustling wind.</p><br/><p>The next day, You XiaoMo comes out to see Ling Xiao beaming at him. That handsome face shows no sign of resentment from being left in the cold. Instead, there is an unfathomable hint of excitement. Rays of light are coming out of the eyes looking at him making his scalp feel numb. He thinks of a ravenous wolf that has caught sight of its prey. Why is it so terrifying!</p><br/><p>Then, as his heart is seized with terror and trembling in fear, the winged bird reaches its destination.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

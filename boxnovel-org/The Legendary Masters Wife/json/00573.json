You XiaoMo wanted to go work on the magic herb field, so there was nothing Ling Xiao could say to that.</p><br/><p>The transcendent level magic herb seed that they had just received couldn\u2019t be left there like low or mid-grade magic herbs, nor could it be reaped any faster if it was planted earlier, especially the Heart Flower Herb. Just scraping together some fertilizer to cover it wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t that he had no confidence in himself, but it was more so that he could take precautions.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Manager Li found Manager Zhang very quickly.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, Manager Zhang had also been searching for Manager Li the entire time to discuss Su Lang.</p><br/><p>After all, he was the one who introduced Su Lang to the pinnacle section, but then Manager Li went and sold the magic herb that Su Lang had preordered to someone else for a higher price. Wasn\u2019t that just slapping his face?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Manager Zhang had already heard about how Manager Li sold that magic herb for an exorbitant thirty million spirit gems. Just from the commission alone, Manager Li would earn almost a million spirit gems, never mind the reward from the Magic Herb Hall.</p><br/><p>Since Manager Li earned almost twenty million spirit gems for the Magic Herb Hall, the higher ups decided to reward him with a million spirit gems. This was an amount that Manager Zhang couldn\u2019t even earn by working an entire year, so it was impossible for him not to be jealous. Seeing that Manager Li himself came to find him, he just happened to also have something to ask him.</p><br/><p>Manager Li had long since guessed that Manager Zhang wouldn\u2019t tell him so easily, and that he would bring up the matter about the Heart Flower Herb. Therefore, he pretended to be \u2018touched by emotion\u2019 and \u2018willing to act reasonably,\u2019 before bringing up the Magic Herb Hall again as a shield. Finally, he expressed that he would personally go and clear things up with Su Lang before fishing Su Lang\u2019s address out from him.</p><br/><p>How would Manager Zhang know his true motives? Furthermore, he also wouldn\u2019t dare to actually offend Manager Li.</p><br/><p>In the Magic Herb Hall, there were different tiers of managers too. The higher the tier, the more important the magic herbs that they were responsible for were. Even if they really did start arguing, the higher ups would favor Manager Li, whose status was higher than his. Plus, he had provided a generous contribution to the Magic Herb Hall not too long ago, so Manager Zhang could only suffer this loss.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Manager Li personally went to the inn that You XiaoMo was staying in.</p><br/><p>Not even a minute later, Manager Li left the inn, completely satisfied.</p><br/><p>The middle of the night, when nobody was whispering anymore, was the perfect time for spies to eavesdrop.</p><br/><p>A manor located halfway up the mountain next to the town was currently brightly lit. A wide expanse of magic herbs grew around the manor, with one particular high level magic herb serving as the majority. Restriction seals covered the area around the manor, preventing people from casually entering and stealing things.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo called out his two Golden Winged Insects and told them to gnaw a hole in the restriction seal. Afterwards, he secretly slipped inside with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Inside the manor\u2019s courtyard.</p><br/><p>Ever since Da Shixiong rescued Su Lang the day before, Su Lang was strictly prohibited from entering and leaving the manor on his own. He wasn\u2019t afraid that Su Lang would go find those two people to get revenge, but he was afraid that You XiaoMo was still in WuShan Town.</p><br/><p>Su Lang was someone who liked to have fun, and so he couldn\u2019t bear it anymore after just one night, arguing from morning to night with his Da Shixiong. Sincee there were restriction seals, his passage token was taken away by his Da Shixiong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Hui, tell me truthfully. What can I do to get you to return the token to me?\u201d Su Lang barged into Yan Hui\u2019s room after kicking down his door.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui was Su Lang\u2019s Da Shixiong. Back then, he acted under orders and participated in XiaoYao Institution\u2019s new student orientation because of Ling Xiao. You XiaoMo could be considered an additional part of it, but at the beginning he hadn\u2019t known that Ling Xiao was his target. It was only when shifu sent over more information that he found out, telling him to keep an eye on them both.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao often weren\u2019t in XiaoYao Institution. Every time, they came back for a little bit before leaving again, and he basically had no way of encountering the two of them for a long time, so he had never been able to complete the task that shifu had assigned him.</p><br/><p>Recently, because You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had a falling out with the Vermillion Blood Clan, the likelihood that the two of them would return to XiaoYao Institution wasn\u2019t very high. Moreover, the situation right now was a little tense, and it was essentially impossible for him to pry the information he needed out of You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao\u2019s mouths.</p><br/><p>Since things had already come to this point, shifu finally let him return and wait for further orders. Right now, a lot of people were looking for the two of them, and his shifu wasn\u2019t an exception. But because they had used the teleportation talisman when nobody was there, nobody knew where exactly they had been transported to.</p><br/><p>In the room, Yan Hui glanced at the two door panels that had been kicked down, and he rubbed his temples. \u201cSu Lang, you\u2019ve already kicked down my door twice from yesterday till today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you return the token to me, I promise I won\u2019t come to bother you again.\u201d Su Lang said without a single trace of shame. How much could two broken fan doors be worth?</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d Yan Hui refused without even thinking about it. \u201cBefore shifu sends the information over, you can only stay in the manor. When the time comes, I\u2019ll relay the matter back to shifu and ask him to make the final decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBah!\u201d Su Lang spat and said, annoyed, \u201cIn the end, you just think I\u2019m an eyesore. Yan Hui, let me tell you, if you still don\u2019t return the token to me, I\u2019ll make you pay for it, and then we can see if shifu will trust you or if he\u2019ll trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui was a little surprised by how certain he sounded, and he said, astonished, \u201cWhy do you think shifu side with you?\u201d He knew that shifu was fond of Su Lang, but he was also someone who made a clear distinction between his public and private life.</p><br/><p>At this, Su Lang\u2019s expression suddenly became pleased. \u201cDo you know why I wanted to buy that Heart Flower Herb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Yan Hui responded.</p><br/><p>Su Lang placed his hands on his waist. \u201cBecause I\u2019m preparing to give it to shifu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cWith shifu\u2019s skill, how hard is it to find a Heart Flower Herb? Plus, shifu isn\u2019t a mage, what use is there in giving this magic herb to shifu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, shifu isn\u2019t a mage, but there are quite a few people at his side who know how to refine pills. I heard that Lady Zuma has been collecting level twelve magic herbs recently, one of which includes the Heart Flower Herb. Lady Zuma is one of shifu\u2019s trusted subordinates, so I can offer the magic herb to shifu and let him give it to Lady Zuma.\u201d Su Lang was very proud of his own plan. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the magic herb had been stolen away by someone else, he would\u2019ve already gotten it by now.</p><br/><p>Zuma was the holy maiden from the previous generation of the Guma Tribe. Her cultivation base was even higher than the current Guma Tribe\u2019s holy maiden\u2019s, but ever since she had been relieved of her position, very few people saw her.</p><br/><p>A sly look flashed across Yan Hui\u2019s eyes when he heard this, and he laughed lightly. \u201cXiao shidi indeed has a good plan. Relying on shifu\u2019s power so that shifu will know how talented you are, while simultaneously allowing Lady Zuma to have a good impression of you. Amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, or else do you think I\u2019m an idiot? If I only depend on shifu\u2019s doting, sooner or later I\u2019ll destroy myself. Since shifu won\u2019t give me any responsibilities, then I\u2019ll come up with a way to make shifu notice me.\u201d Su Lang was indeed an impulsive person, but it also wasn\u2019t as if he had no brain.</p><br/><p>After finishing speaking, Su Lang walked over to Yan Hui and smiled cheerfully. \u201cSay, Da Shixiong, if shifu knew that you stopped me from going to recover the Heart Flower Herb, and was deceived by someone to the point that I didn\u2019t even dare to go out and regain some face, what would shifu think? Would he punish you, or punish me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui\u2019s eyelids lowered, and the ice cold look in his eyes was covered slightly. After a while, he said, \u201cShidi, even if you want to regain your face, you have to have the ability to do so. Or else, if you lose face, I\u2019m afraid shifu will be even more angry. I trust that you also know shifu\u2019s temper, he hates useless and worthless people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Lang\u2019s momentum was derailed by him, and he was very unhappy. He slapped the table. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for you suddenly forcibly dragging me back, it\u2019s still uncertain who would\u2019ve won or lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overestimating yourself!\u201d Yan Hui sneered coldly. \u201cHis level of strength is clearly above ours. If I didn\u2019t drag you away in time, there\u2019s no way you would be standing here now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, I\u2019m only twenty-five years old this year, and I\u2019m already a Grade One Rainbow Level mage. Back then, shifu once said that I was TongTian Continent\u2019s number one genius, how can a genius lose to a nameless nobody?\u201d Su Lang said arrogantly. Even though he had only just broken through not long ago, he had always been very proud of himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell me why he wanted to buy the Heart Flower Herb? Level twelve magic herbs are only needed when refining pills. If he wasn\u2019t going to refine pills, what\u2019s the point of buying the magic herb?\u201d Yan Hui responded unhurriedly.</p><br/><p>Su Lang was unable to answer.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui said, \u201cThe Heart Flower Herb\u2019s level is even higher than what you would usually buy. That person\u2019s strength must be above Grade Two. If you actually started fighting him, there\u2019s no way you would have been able to defeat him. Moreover, that person didn\u2019t seem to be very old, so your \u2018TongTian\u2019s number one genius\u2019 probably has to give up its seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Hui!\u201d The more he listened, the angrier Su Lang got, and he broke the table in his fury.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui laughed, and the slightly stiff muscles in his face suddenly relaxed. He smiled and placated him, \u201cShidi, what\u2019s the use of being so angry. I\u2019m only making a conjecture, there really aren\u2019t that many people who are more gifted than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said that there weren\u2019t that many, but that didn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t any. This was especially since he knew someone who had become a Grade One Rainbow Level mage before Su Lang. He heard that he was already Grade Two now.</p><br/><p>Su Lang didn\u2019t take the bait. \u201cFrom what I see, you\u2019re just jealous and envious of my natural talent, because when you advanced to the Grade One Rainbow Level, you were already almost seventy years old. Now you\u2019re nearly one hundred years old, and yet you\u2019re only Grade Two Rainbow Level. I\u2019ll catch up to you before long, so you\u2019re afraid now. Aren\u2019t I correct?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

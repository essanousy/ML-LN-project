When they went through an area of forestry that was known to have many demon beasts, he pulled out the half dead QingZhi Snake and pushed its fangs into the back of his hand. By this point, his plan was pretty much a success.</p><br/><p>QingZhi Snakes weren\u2019t a very high level demon beast. At the very least, the level ten snakes were no threat to level eleven practitioners like them. However, it\u2019s venom was rather special. The venom of a QingZhi Snake wouldn\u2019t kill someone immediately, but it caused paralysis, and its effect was very obvious. Depending on one\u2019s constitution, it might not even take fifteen minutes for the venom to spread across the entire body. Generally, if an antidote wasn\u2019t administered within three days, the victim would die. So long as it was administered within three days, it wouldn\u2019t be fatal.</p><br/><p>That was what the man used to make Tao WenLiang believe him.</p><br/><p>Tao WenLiang grabbing his hand to check the venom was within his expectations. QingZhi Snakes were infamous for their dexterity as speed type demon beasts. It wasn\u2019t unreasonable that he would be bitten despite his cultivation base. Even Tao WenLiang with his intelligence and experience wouldn\u2019t notice anything wrong.</p><br/><p>The man dusted off the bits of grass on him, glancing at the direction Tao WenLiang and co left in with a mirthless smile. Then he turned and left, but the direction he was heading in wasn\u2019t the Qilin Clan, but a different one. His figure shot through the forestry, even faster than he had moved before.</p><br/><p>He had to hurry and inform that person before Tao WenLiang and them got there.</p><br/><p>After a few minutes, the man landed on a large tree and made a sound of confusion, gazing out at the silent forest. He had come through this forest before. It was home to a great many demon beasts, and one could often hear the sounds of them roaring. However, he hadn\u2019t heard a single one yet. Something wasn\u2019t right!</p><br/><p>The man was confused, but he was in an urgent situation right now, so he could only suppress his confusion. He poised to start running again. That was when a slash of light struck from the darkness, impacting the tree he was on and leaving a smooth, clean cut.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression changed, quickly jumping out of the way onto the ground. The massive and ancient tree fell with a tremendous rumbling, leaving just the roots.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there? Show yourself!\u201d The man whipped out his dagger and fell into a battle stance. His gaze was directed at the direction the attack had come from, his gaze sharp but also alert and unsettled at the unknown danger. This was too strange.</p><br/><p>As he spoke, a figure in white walked out from behind the tree, long dress swaying, a woman of incredible beauty. If one ignored the pressure from her aura, they might think she was a beautiful lady lost in the woods.</p><br/><p>When the man identified her, his entire face went pale, eyes wide in disbelief as he stuttered, \u201cHo-holy Maiden?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the next moment, his dagger fell onto the ground. This was because a group of people walked out from behind Zu Ma, including the ones who had just left to ambush the Alliance\u2019s people, Tao WenLiang and company.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, it became clear to the man that he had fallen for a trick.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, you were the mole. I finally caught you. Looks like I didn\u2019t plan this trap for you for nothing.\u201d Zu Ma\u2019s gaze was ice cold, fixed on the shocked man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The man forced himself to stay calm. \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t someone who participated in any of the meetings, but he was a subordinate of Dong ChengTian. Dong ChengTian was ill tempered and loved to drink. When he got drunk, his tongue would start wagging, and he wouldn\u2019t remember anything he had said or done once he sobered up.</p><br/><p>A while ago, he had used several casks of spirits, gifted by some underlings, to get a lot of useful information out of Dong ChengTian that he was planning on sneaking away to relay. He had thought he had covered his tracks well, never thinking he would be found out. He couldn\u2019t for the life of him figure out where he had slipped up.</p><br/><p>He had found it kind of strange when they were splitting up for the mission. He was under Dong ChengTian, yet the Holy Maiden had him go with Tao WenLiang. Thinking back now, it was probably because the Holy Maiden didn\u2019t want Dong ChengTian ruining things with that temper of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t kill you, then I don\u2019t deserve to be called Dong ChengTian!\u201d Dong ChengTian. who had realized that he had been used, glared venomously at the man like he wanted nothing more than to tear him asunder.</p><br/><p>The man flinched. He knew how cruel Dong ChengTian\u2019s methods were.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you were the mole,\u201d Zu Ma spoke up coldly, \u201cThis entire operation was designed to draw you out. The Alliance is attacking the Qilin Clan, yes, but not now. It\u2019s happening the day after tomorrow. I just set the time forwards and you rushed to go and report it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression twisted, turning and fleeing. He didn\u2019t bother with finding out the truth anymore. He just knew that if he fell into their hands, then it was over for him.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma sneered at his retreating figure.</p><br/><p>Before she gave the order, Dong ChengTian gave pursuit in a rage. With his sacred level strength, it would be easy to for him to catch a level eleven expert. Thus, none of the others moved. After around five minutes, a corpse fell from the sky, landing heavily in front of Zu Ma.</p><br/><p>Though the man\u2019s corpse was still whole, he was completely disfigured. His skin was gorged open across his body, revealing the flesh underneath. His face was unrecognizable, eye sockets empty. His limbs flopped, bones shattered.</p><br/><p>The people there were all cruel, merciless and cold. This wasn\u2019t enough to scare them. They merely glanced at the corpse emotionlessly. A dead person was beneath their notice.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma looked on in satisfaction. Very good. She had finally cleared away this stain.</p><br/><p>Since Lin ShaoYi was undergoing secluded cultivation, Black Spider fell to her to take care of. She wouldn\u2019t allow any accidents to happen while Black Spider was under her control, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have the face to show herself in front of ShaoYi.</p><br/><p>Everyone thought that they had dealt with the mole. They didn\u2019t know that the real mole was standing in a corner quietly watching, his young face unmoving.</p><br/><p>No one noticed at all!</p><br/><p>The \u2018day after tomorrow\u2019 Zu Ma had talked about arrived very quickly. With the mole gone, they no longer had to worry when acting. That day, apart from the clansmen of the Qilin Clan, she also sent out ninety percent of the Black Spider\u2019s people. Knowing Lin Ming\u2019s people and pathing, she concentrated their firepower on the two paths apart from the one Lin Ming had chosen.</p><br/><p>So long as they got rid of the others first, the remaining Lin Ming and company would no longer be a threat after ShaoYi came back from secluded cultivation. Even if ShaoYi didn\u2019t make it in time, she could defeat Lin Ming through an advantage in numbers. Zu Ma had planned meticulously, but didn\u2019t realize that she had fallen into Lin Ming\u2019s trap. So when Lin Ming appeared outside of the Qilin Clan with the Alliance\u2019s powerhouses, her face was one of complete disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You weren\u2019t expecting us?\u201d Lin Ming calmly gazed at Zu Ma and the Qilin Clan\u2019s clansmen behind her, including a very familiar face. However, this face couldn\u2019t affect him anymore. People who choose different paths wouldn\u2019t be able to come together, that was all he could tell himself.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma was very intelligent. When she saw a rather panicked and surprised face in the crowd, she figured out the crux of the matter.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming had known that one of her people was in the Alliance, but didn\u2019t know who it was, so he did this on purpose to lure her into a trap. In reality, he hadn\u2019t acted according to his own plans, but changed them last minute, so her people couldn\u2019t make it in time to warn her.</p><br/><p>Now with most of Black Spider\u2019s manpower elsewhere and needing to wait two to four hours before they returned, she could only rely on the Qilin Clan\u2019s experts for now. However, against Lin Ming, it would be a bit of a struggle.</p><br/><p>The gears in Zu Ma\u2019s mind began to turn furiously, but she couldn\u2019t come up with a solution. She could only hope that Lin ShaoYi would come out of secluded cultivation as soon as possible, or for Tao WenLiang and the others to realize it was a trap and immediately head back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Ming, are you really set on going against the Qilin Clan?\u201d That was when an elderly voice rang out. Though it was an inquiry, the voice held a hint of awe inspiring authority. It was clear from the voice that the owner was someone serious and strict.</p><br/><p>But this sounded like an accusation.</p><br/><p>Before Lin Ming could reply, Lin Gu, standing beside him, voiced his displeasure, \u201cLin Tian, what right do you have to say that?\u201d Lin Gu disliked Lin Tian immensely. He had respected the other solely because the other was Lin Ming\u2019s father, but now that respect had vanished completely. This man didn\u2019t even believe his own son, instead going to support his son\u2019s enemy. He really didn\u2019t know what Lin Tian was thinking, he had probably gotten brain damage from being struck by lightning or something.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, Lin Ming isn\u2019t a member of the Qilin Clan anymore. You were the ones to chase him out. Instead of believing your own son, you go and support someone who murdered his own clansmen, and wants to murder your very own grandchild. Lin Tian, you\u2019re the one with the least right to accuse Lin Ming of anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Tian\u2019s gaze grew colder and colder, landing on Lin Gu. A powerful killing intent erupted from him, directed at Lin Gu, \u201cWhat do you think you are to accuse me!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

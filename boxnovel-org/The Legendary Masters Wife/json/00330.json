He had forgotten about the double personality. Waking up this early with that kind of an expression, it had to be the second, ill-tempered personality and he had just patted him on the shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cShifu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With a snort and a face of displeasure, the old man said, \u201cI don\u2019t see you for a few months and you sure got courageous.\u201d</p><br/><p>All You XiaoMo could do was let out a dry chuckle, and only that, \u201cNo\u2026Disciple\u2019s got no guts, no matter how much guts I eat, it wouldn\u2019t work either.\u201d</p><br/><p>In anger the old man shouted, \u201cWhy are you still standing there stupidly, come and help.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a string of \u2018yes\u2019, You XiaoMo quickly followed. He wasn\u2019t about to bring up the Heavenly Soul Scripture to the second personality, who knows which one actually wanted to teach him that soul training technique.</p><br/><p>Before he knew it, four hours had passed working in and out.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked up to see the sun shining brightly and wiped the sweat from his face. It should have been time for lunch, but he was still working. He knew meeting the second personality was a bad idea.</p><br/><p>Just as he was muttering to himself, the old man\u2019s voice came suddenly from the Pill Refining Room.\u201cDumbass, what are you standing around for? Get over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked over compliantly. The old man\u2019s just being crazy again, this was not the time to rub him in the wrong way, or else he would drive him out.</p><br/><p>As he arrived in Pill Refining room, the old man was not refining pills or distilling herbs but rather drinking tea. Speaking of the tea room, You XiaoMo really had to roast him. The second personality liked tea more than the first! They say tea is good for self-cultivation, but he felt the opposite, the more he drank the worse the temper.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo. Asked, \u201cShifu, what do you need me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man shot him a look of disdain, \u201cDidn\u2019t we get your roommate to tell you yesterday? Do you not bring your ears outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>With happiness, You XiaoMo\u2019s ears excluded all the displeasing content of that sentence. The old man was finally going to teach him the Heavenly Soul Scripture. His four hours had not been wasted.</p><br/><p>Excitedly You XiaoMo asked, \u201cShifu, when will we be start?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man snorted and looked at him, \u201cHalf a year and you have gotten a level higher, an okay speed. What soul training manual are you using right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo went blank for a second, shit, he couldn\u2019t say he was practicing the Heavenly Soul Scripture.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he wasn\u2019t getting a response, the old man narrowed his eyes, a hint of light flashing in them, \u201cWhat? You can\u2019t say?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly replied, \u201cNo, my current soul training manual is a manual called I Ching, a low grade high level manual.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the manual he had gotten from the Paradise Realm, although he had never used it, he had briefly scanned through it. If the old man asked more, he could recall a few lines.</p><br/><p>However, the old man didn\u2019t continue, instead he let out a snort and tsundere like, \u201cThe manual is okay, but as my disciple, that\u2019s not good enough. If people knew my disciple was using a low grade manual, that would put shame to my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes sparked with that, he was waiting for this. Quickly teach me that soul training technique.</p><br/><p>As expected, the old man continued, \u201cI have a better soul training manual, take it and learn from it. Don\u2019t let anyone know, especially your da shixiong Qiu Ran. You understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d You XiaoMo immediately nodded, but stopped half way through, \u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why couldn\u2019t da shixiong know about this? Didn\u2019t he learn the Heavenly Soul Scripture too? Of course, he didn\u2019t dare ask that out loud since it would take a while to explain how he knew.</p><br/><p>The old man didn\u2019t see his confusion and threw him a jade drive, \u201cThe content of that manual is all in this jade drive. Go through it quickly and destroy it afterwards.\u201d</p><br/><p>While You XiaoMo was holding the jade drive, he felt an unexplainable feeling. After he finished talking, the old man got up and left, leaving him in the tea room. You XiaoMo stood still staring at the jade drive. It wasn\u2019t until half a hour later did his conscious leave the drive and he took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>This was an soul training manual called Buddha\u2019s Willow Standard.</p><br/><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t the Heavenly Soul Scripture, he assumed that the old man was going to give him a mid grade or high grade high level manual, but not a low grade transcendent level soul training manual.</p><br/><p>Although he was not originally from this word, living here for a few years had taught him how rare transcendent level manuals were. It was the equivalent to an Elemental Essence in value, but the old man just tossed it over like it was nothing. You XiaoMo felt touched.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the Heavenly Soul Scripture, but it was still a huge surprise.</p><br/><p>No wonder he couldn\u2019t let Qiu Ran know, if he knew that theri Shifu had a better manual, but didn\u2019t teach him, he might have other thoughts. He didn\u2019t know what happened between them for them to be so cautious of each other, but he was on the side of his Shifu.</p><br/><p>After reading the manual in the jade drive multiple times and remembering everything by heart, he followed the orders of the old man and destroyed it. When he walked out, the old man was standing in front of a bookshelf, facing away fiddling with something.</p><br/><p>Once he walked closer he heard him talking. \u201cDid you remember everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI memorized it, the jade drive has been destroyed too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, from now on train from that manual. If you don\u2019t understand anything, figure it out yourself and don\u2019t ask me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Shouldn\u2019t you say, ask away?</p><br/><p>The old man seemed to realize his phrasing was a little odd. He let out a cough and explained, \u201cYour shifu didn\u2019t learn that manual, so you have to figure everything out yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you learn this?\u201d You XiaoMo asked carefully.</p><br/><p>The old man wasn\u2019t going to hide anything about the topic, but he did look awkward. That was so out of character that You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes widened and he stared blankly.</p><br/><p>The old man went from embarrassment to anger and screamed, \u201cWhat are you looking at? This is a dual cultivation manual! How is an old man like me a good fit!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo \u201c\u2026\u201d Dual, dual cultivation manual? Don\u2019t think he was illiterate. He knew very well what these words meant.</p><br/><p>Ah, the reason he wasn\u2019t allowed to ask was this\u2026dual cultivation, he couldn\u2019t help but imagine the old man soul training with the Buddha\u2019s Willow Standard, two old men\u2026</p><br/><p>My god it was horrid!</p><br/><p>With this You XiaoMo could only stutter out, \u201cShi shi shi\u2026shifu, if this is a dual cultivation manual, w-w-why did you give it to me\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man flushed red with embarrassment and anger, giving him a look, \u201cDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t realize you and that roommate of yours are in that kind of a relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face turned red. Although he wasn\u2019t hiding it, being told out loud was still awkward. Especially because it was his Shifu.</p><br/><p>The old man calmed down his tone, \u201cAlthough, this manual doesn\u2019t have to be dual, you can do it alone, but this will have a lesser effect. If you really don\u2019t want to, then just train solo. Anyways, just get out if you\u2019re done.\u201d With that he shooed him away.</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo was walking away, his head was still in shambles. An elder knew about him and Ling Xiao\u2019s relationship and gave them a dual soul training manual, it still felt unreal. In his mind, if people didn\u2019t disprove of the relationship that was enough.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stood still and turned around to look at the pill refinery.</p><br/><p>Although dual cultivation was embarrassing, he did it often with Ling Xiao, so it wasn\u2019t anything he couldn\u2019t accept. Better yet, he was in a rush to get stronger, so this was welcomed.</p><br/><p>By the time he got back to his room, Ling Xiao was already there.</p><br/><p>When he saw You XiaoMo\u2019s face, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo fiddled around for bit before hesitantly telling him about the dual soul training manual. But just after he finished, he regretted it as Ling Xiao\u2019s expression was very peculiar.</p><br/><p>He swore he saw pink bubbles floating around Ling Xiao and that grin was as evil as evil got. He couldn\u2019t help but feel an evil chill as if he dug himself into a hole. From now on, Ling Xiao would have an excuse to get him into bed whenever he wanted.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao put his hands around You XiaoMo\u2019s waist and tugged him inside with a bright smile, \u201cXiaoMo, come, let us get inside. Tell me everything about the manual and we\u2019ll explore it together\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

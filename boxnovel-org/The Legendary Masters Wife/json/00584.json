He searched through the man in black\u2019s body but only found one magic bag and there wasn\u2019t much in it either. Nothing to identify him whatsoever.</p><br/><p>But, it was because of this that You XiaoMo was sure the man attacked him because there was something below the canyon. He was probably also a professional assassin, so something like them were the only ones who would hide their identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling for goods is only something a bandit would do.\u201d It was at this moment that a voice with a slight evilness to it appeared. Although it wasn\u2019t directed at anyone in particular, You XiaoMo knew that they were cursing him.</p><br/><p>The reason was no other than the fact that the voice belonged to Mo Xue, the woman who wouldn\u2019t go away. You XiaoMo took the magic bag and destroyed the body, then looked thoughtfully at Mo Xue.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue knew that she shouldn\u2019t provoke him but she couldn\u2019t help it. Someone she once looked down upon was now above her. Now the one to look up became her and she couldn\u2019t take it. Seeing that You XiaoMo looked over, she subconsciously raised her chin, in stubborn defiance.</p><br/><p>A flash of displeasure towards Mo Xue appeared in Xie Jun\u2019s eyes as he pulled her back, \u201cXue-er, don\u2019t provoke him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xue could understand what Xie Jun was implying and wanted to follow his words but her usual pride kept her from lowering her head. Instead, she said, \u201cXie-dage, we are a group, why are we afraid of one person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Jun carefully made sure to not show his impatience and continued, \u201cDon\u2019t forget he still has a comrade. Not only that, if we were to really fight him, we would pay a harsh price for i. After that, the Dong Yu Bandits would surely set their eyes on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXie-dage, why are you arguing for them and dissing yourself. From what I can tell, his comrade isn\u2019t even here, otherwise, they would have surely appeared by now.\u201d Mo Xue knew that Xie Jun was right but she just didn\u2019t want to give up so easily.</p><br/><p>Xie Jun chuckled, but deep down he wanted to kill her. If she wasn\u2019t still worth something, he would have left her to die a long time ago. Did she seriously think being the Guma Tribe Leader\u2019s daughter made her invincible?</p><br/><p>This was Dong Yu, not her tribe, her status would only scare the weaklings.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t long after Mo Xue\u2019s talk that Ling Xiao appeared. His slender figure appeared elegantly beside You XiaoMo, without a warning. Ling Xiao didn\u2019t see the man in black\u2019s vanished corpse, but he could tell that a major fight had happened. Looking at Mo Xue\u2019s group in the distance, he asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if I should kill them.\u201d You XiaoMo said. He didn\u2019t lower his voice for this, rather he purposefully said it loudly, so that Mo Xue\u2019s group could hear him. Just like he thought, the expression on their faces changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d Ling Xiao asked without batting an eye.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head, \u201cAh, actually I just want to kill this one person, her mouth is so annoying. The things that come out is hard on the ears, but I don\u2019t want to dirty my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gently chuckled, \u201cIf you want her to never speak again, that\u2019s easy. If you think it\u2019ll dirty your hands, then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d You XiaoMo nodded, smiling.</p><br/><p>The couple simultaneously looked towards Mo Xue.</p><br/><p>As if she had fallen into an ice pit, feelings of fear, like the sprouts erupting after the rain, erupted one after another. It was only now, that she started to regret provoking them for her pride. In fear, she held on tightly to Xie Jun\u2019s arm, with half of her body hiding behind him. \u201cXie-dage, help, help me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Jun froze. If he stood up for Mo Xue with the current circumstances, then he was as good as dead. But, it was also an opportunity to completely capture her heart. As he debated, the scale soon tilted towards his fear of death. If he died then what would be the point of capturing her heart? With her heartlessness, she would probably forget him soon after.</p><br/><p>But, now he needed to prevent Mo Fei from seeing this side of him. At this moment, he had already changed to focus on Mo Fei instead, but he would soon be rid of his worries.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue, who had originally been latched onto him made a scream of terror and shoved him away. Her whole body was tossing and turning on the ground. Her hands gripped tightly at her neck and as her mouth opened, she spit out fire.</p><br/><p>Soon, she was unable to scream, as if her throat had been burned. One half of her face caught on fire as well, making it eerily hideous. She kept rolling on the floor because of the pain and her fingernails broke due to the pressure, but that pain was nothing in comparison.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis!\u201d Mo Fei screamed as she was about to rush over.</p><br/><p>With quick reflexes, Xie Jun caught her, \u201cDon\u2019t go there, that\u2019s not a normal flame, even you would be burned if you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Fei\u2019s body froze for a second and she didn\u2019t dare go up anymore, instead, she cried into Xie Jun\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>Somewhere in him, Niu XuYang felt a little bad for Mo Xue. If this was before they had entered Dong Yu, then he would have stopped at nothing to save her. But now, with her cynicism and her intimate actions with Xie Jun, she had worn off any love he had for her.</p><br/><p>Now, he was eerily calm watching everything unfold.</p><br/><p>The strange flame burned Mo Xue\u2019s throat and half of her face. The scars moved as if there were worms on her face and it was red like a soldering iron. No one dared to go up to her and seeing the ugliness of her face, everyone shifted their gaze away in disgust.</p><br/><p>Xie Jun hesitated for a second before pulling out a magic pill for Mo Xue to eat. She was still the daughter of the Guma Tribe\u2019s leader, after all.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, both Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo were gone. With Ling Xiao\u2019s power, he could easily have Mo Xue taste her own medicine with a flick of a finger.</p><br/><p>As for Guma Tribe\u2019s possible revenge, that wasn\u2019t a consideration of theirs. After all, the Guma Tribe were close with the Vermillion Blood Clan, there was no way they wouldn\u2019t be on opposite sides.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t get to see Mo Xue\u2019s sad state since they quickly left, but with Ling Xiao\u2019s usual tendencies, he could already see Mo Xue\u2019s misery.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, now can you tell me what happened? Who were you fighting with and for what?\u201d Until they couldn\u2019t see Xie Jun anymore did Ling Xiao asked once again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly re-accounted the ambush and his suspicion that the right eye was below the grand canyon, but he was only thirty percent sure.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao searched all the way over, and of course, he hadn\u2019t seen anything suspicious along the way. They could be certain that the white tiger\u2019s right eye was not here. It was either on the other side or below them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to go down now?\u201d Ling Xiao confirmed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought about it for a second and shook his head, \u201cLet\u2019s do it another day.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were still other people around searching for the right eye. It was better the less people knew about it and Ling Xiao\u2019s wounds hadn\u2019t healed yet, so before he was sure of the strength of the people below, he wasn\u2019t going to take chances. As for whether or not he acted rashly, which might alert the enemy, with the corpse burned, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t oppose it.</p><br/><p>The two took another look at the canyon before leaving for Dong Yu. With them, Xie Jun\u2019s group had also left due to the severity of Mo Xue\u2019s injuries. Due to her position, everyone agreed to leave early for the town.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t long after You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao returned that Xie Jun\u2019s group arrived too. Mo Xue\u2019s three man group didn\u2019t stay in the same place as them but Xie Jun\u2019s exploration team did. It was closer to Dong Yu, thus, when they returned to town, they headed there. They caused a big commotion and many people peaked out their heads to take a look.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was curious too and purposefully opened the window to get a closer look.</p><br/><p>But because of that, Xie Jun, who was carrying Mo Xue, arrived in front of him. Seeing him, his whole body froze and his hurried footsteps came to a halt.</p><br/><p>The people behind him pulled their emergency breaks too. Just as they were about to speak, they saw You XiaoMo leaning against the window with a devious smile. Everyone of them froze like a zombie and Mo Fei even hid behind Niu XuYang.</p><br/><p>This was what you call ape shit!</p><br/><p>But, they were able to meet twice in Dong Yu, which was a much bigger place, it was actually not that much of a surprise that they would meet up here in town. Maybe they were just fated to meet each other.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved, smiling, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Jun was the first to react. If he left now, that would appear too deliberate, so he could only clench his teeth and continue walking. If they let them off the hook before, they probably wouldn\u2019t do anything now.</p><br/><p>Mo Fei wanted to follow him but she was afraid of becoming like her sister, so she just glued herself to Niu XuYang. Using him to block You XiaoMo\u2019s vision so that even if something happened, it would happen to Niu XuYang first.</p><br/><p>Seeing them run away as if they had seen a ghost, You XiaoMo laughed whole heartily.</p><br/><p>It was the first time he had seen someone so afraid of him. Before, it was only him being afraid, now it was the other way around. As they say, what comes around goes around.</p><br/><p>Congratulations! (to him)</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was thinking that, he was knocked on the head as Ling Xiao\u2019s voice came from within, \u201cWhat are you standing around there stupidly for? Get your ass in here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah! Ling Xiao was so annoying!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

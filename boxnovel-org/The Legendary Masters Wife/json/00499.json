Tears spilled from his eyes as he cried like he had experience a great loss, but he knew that they were the tears of joy and relief. This weight had finally fallen from his shoulders.</p><br/><p>After he finished crying, Wen Gong\u2019s attitude had gone through a startling transformation; he was even smiling.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t stay for long, soon bidding the other goodbye and leaving the Southern Continent with Ling Xiao and their three little followers.</p><br/><p>The day after they left the Southern Continent, You ZhenTian personally came to Xing Luo City with a mysterious person. The two entered the City Master\u2019s estate and left terrified people in their wake.</p><br/><p>Xing Luo City\u2019s City Master wasn\u2019t very heavily injured, and upon being informed that the family head had personally come, he came out to welcome the other, trembling. You ZhenTian wasn\u2019t in a good mood, so, naturally, wouldn\u2019t play nice with him.</p><br/><p>In the main hall \u2014</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian sat in the throne, with people kneeling all across the floor in front of him. It was completely silent. Suddenly, he smashed his teacup on the ground in front of the City Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Shan, I gave you the honor of hosting the the selection trial, but you ended up creating such a mess for me? Do you want to be fired?\u201d</p><br/><p>More than half of the treasury\u2019s contents had been stolen, including the rewards for the selection trial, and even the dragon\u2019s blood had been taken. If they held the selection trial without a prize, the Vermillion Blood Clan would lose even more face. No wonder You ZhenTian was so mad. These problems had cropped up one after the other. Clearly, someone was trying to piss off the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>The City Master didn\u2019t dare back away, but in front of You ZhenTian, he didn\u2019t even dare to raise his head. Hearing this, he hurriedly explained, \u201cFamily Head, please listen to Wu Shan explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian harrumphed.</p><br/><p>Sitting next to him, the mystery person who was clearly of a similar status suddenly gripped his hand. An elegant and airy voice drifted out from under the black cloak, \u201cThen let\u2019s hear his explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian surprisingly didn\u2019t erupt, and the anger on his face even faded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suspect that the people who stole the dragon\u2019s blood and caused chaos in YuXian City are one and the same, and they\u2019re also a sacred level powerhouse\u2026.\u201d The City Master of Xing Luo City began to recount everything that had occurred that day in great detail, even the Golden Winged Insects.</p><br/><p>He knew that if the old Family Head knew that their opponent was a sacred level expert, then he wouldn\u2019t be blamed as much, because the difference between divine level and sacred level wasn\u2019t something easily made up for.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian grew solemn. Sacred level again.</p><br/><p>After investigating for these last few days, he was certain that the people who had freed the prisoners from the forbidden area, and the people who had taken Feng ChiYun were one and the same. However, they didn\u2019t have any leads, so he knew that one of them was the inheritor of the pocket dimension he was looking for.</p><br/><p>As for that sacred level powerhouse that had appeared out of nowhere, could it be that he was the one that had defeated Mu Shen and You TianNan on the LongXiang Continent?</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian couldn\u2019t help but doubt this, because on the LongXiang Continent, that person had only been Divine level, how could it be possible for him to breakthrough to Sacred level in just a year? Even if he had something to do with the Qilin Clan and Demon Phoenix Clan, he still shouldn\u2019t be able to advance so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear wife, can you sense the position of the dragon\u2019s blood?\u201d You ZhenTian felt that there were too many uncertainties. He couldn\u2019t digest this all and come up with a decision immediately, so he threw it to the back of his mind for now and turned to look at the person next to him.</p><br/><p>As he addressed his wife, everyone in the room was shocked.</p><br/><p>This lady generally didn\u2019t show herself in public, keeping hidden. No one had expected that she\u2019d come to Xing Luo City this time. It was probably because she heard about the dragon\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Lady Yin, shook her head daintily. \u201cThat person has left. I cannot sense it.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was when a guard of the estate rushed inside, but he was stopped at the door by a housecarl of the main family.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard delivered his message to the housecarl and the housecarl walked inside. \u201cReporting. Family Head, Jiang Liu of the YinYang Valley wishes to see you. He says he has some very important information for you and is outside right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Liu of the YinYang Valley?\u201d You ZhenTian didn\u2019t recognize this name.</p><br/><p>The City Master of Xing Luo City hurriedly explained. \u201cFamily head, Jiang Liu is a set candidate of the selection trial, but a few days ago, he got into an argument with someone on the streets and his eyes were destroyed. Right now, he is still recovering.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian\u2019s expression did not waver. \u201cWho is it that dared attack someone from the YinYang Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt appears that it was someone Jiang Liu was familiar with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, let him in, let\u2019s see what he has to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, the housecarl escorted the man inside.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu\u2019s state was much better now, but because his eyes were too frightening, so he was wearing an elegant mask that covered half his face. It was much better than if he didn\u2019t wear it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu calmly walked up to You ZhenTian and spoke only after kneeling. \u201cJiang Liu pays respects to the family head.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the difference in their power was still significant and Jiang Liu began to tremble under You ZhenTian\u2019s gaze. There was a small pause before the other spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Liu, hm? I hear that you have something to tell me. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu calmly said. \u201cFamily head, this is something that concerns those two people. It\u2019s very important information, so the fewer people know, the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian scrutinized the other for a few seconds. Jiang Liu, to him, was someone not even worth mentioning and wouldn\u2019t dare lie. So he had everyone else, including the City Master of Xing Luo City, leave and wait for them. In the end, all that was left in the hall was him, his wife and Jiang Liu.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu swallowed thickly, saying weakly, \u201cReporting. Family head, what Jiang Liu wants to say has something to do with You XiaoMo. I believe that the people who sneaked into the City Master\u2019s estate was You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cWhy do you believe so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu could feel the intensity of the old family head\u2019s presence. It was almost like a mountain was pressing down on his shoulders. He didn\u2019t dare draw this out further, immediately explaining all his analysis.</p><br/><p>The more he said, the more convinced You ZhenTian was.</p><br/><p>After coming to TongTian Continent, Jiang Liu might\u2019ve stayed primarily within the YinYang Valley, but he didn\u2019t let that limit his sights. He knew what had been happening across the TongTian Continent. In addition, he was the most familiar with You XiaoMo, so he could guess from what little leads there were.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian stood, looking down at him. \u201cWhat he said is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu lowered himself. \u201cI can\u2019t be a hundred percent certain, but the probability is high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, You ZhenTian dismissed Jiang Liu, telling him that if his guess was correct, then he\u2019d be greatly rewarded. Jiang Liu left, suppressing the excitement in his heart. With such a promise from the old family head, the flaws his body had could definitely be patched up.</p><br/><p>However, one thing he didn\u2019t realize was that while the problems with his soul could be solved, his eyes would never be restored, unless he was reincarnated.</p><br/><p>\u203b\u203b\u203b</p><br/><p>Though Ling Xiao had agreed to let Hua Gu and company follow them, he didn\u2019t mean for them to travel together, but for the three to go to The Evil Cult. The Evil Cult\u2019s name was The Evil Cult, the group that his father had left to him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo really wanted to diss this name. The Evil Cult, didn\u2019t they know that evil never wins against good? If they were ever defeated in the future, it was all the fault of this name.</p><br/><p>After Hua Gu and company left, the two of them didn\u2019t immediately return to ZhongTian.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took You XiaoMo to a forest with no hints of human life. The place was crawling with high level demon beasts, and the enraged roaring of demon beasts could occasionally be heard.</p><br/><p>After searching for almost fifteen minutes, they landed on a sharp peak.</p><br/><p>They were surrounded by a dense canopy and undergrowth of greenery, so even if someone flew overhead, they probably wouldn\u2019t see them.</p><br/><p>After confirming that there was no one around, Ling Xiao set You XiaoMo down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t we going to go back? What are we doing here?\u201d You XiaoMo asked, unable to hold his curiosity at bay any longer. He looked down the steep sloping sides of the mountain. They were at a terrifying height.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took out the dragon\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo peeked over. \u201cIs there something wrong with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stroked his chin. \u201cI feel that this is a little weird. It\u2019s almost like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost like what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost like it\u2019s trying to lure me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLure how?\u201d You XiaoMo was confused. A drop of blood purposefully luring someone? Bullshit, it wasn\u2019t like Ling Xiao was a vampire.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao calmly said, \u201cLike you lying naked in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Darling, where has your integrity gone? Let me go and pick it up for you.</p><br/><p>Though this was strange, it really was luring him in. As Ling Xiao opened the lid, the feeling he had been getting intensified. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he had honed his discipline and self-control, then probably would have caved already.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao poured the dragon\u2019s blood onto his palm. The crimson liquid rolled around on his palm as if it had a life of its own. Before Ling Xiao could even move, the blood suddenly sunk into his palm and disappeared.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was startled and grabbed his hand. \u201cHow come it vanished?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he raised his head, he saw that Ling Xiao\u2019s face had returned to its true form and a flush had spread across the other\u2019s cheeks, expression twisting a little. He hurriedly pushed You XiaoMo aside, crossing his legs as he sat down. He closed his eyes, not saying a word.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

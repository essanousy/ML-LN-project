Two words were written strongly above that opening \u2013 Gravity Mountain!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cI hear that the stone that the Gravity Room is made of was discovered here and then it was dug out into a Gravity training area. If that\u2019s true, then who knows how big this Gravity Mountain really is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao turned his head and said, \u201cThe rules seem to be written at the entrance. Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two walked over and, on the right side of the cavern entrance, there were, indeed, words carved there.</p><br/><p>Since there were many people reading the rules, a sea of people surrounded them. You XiaoMo could only see the word \u201crules\u201d when he stood up on his tiptoes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lowered his head and spoke into his ear with a smile, \u201cDo you need me to lift you up?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It would be so humiliating in front of all these people!</p><br/><p>It was a good thing that the rules weren\u2019t too long-winded and those at the front quickly finished looking over them, turning to walk into the Gravity Mountain. It finally came to You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao\u2019s turn.</p><br/><p>The first rule, you are not allowed to attack anyone else in the Gravity Mountain. If you were caught, you would be immediately expelled. It was very strict, so even if you met your father\u2019s murderer, you could only control yourself.</p><br/><p>The second, there is no fee to use the Gravity Mountain, so you can stay inside for as long as you want without worrying about points. However, to record your information there, you needed to swipe your card against a special instrument. Of course, you could choose not to since it wasn\u2019t required to enter.</p><br/><p>The third wasn\u2019t a rule, but a warning. It said that the Gravity Mountain\u2019s pressure increased as you went further in, so don\u2019t delude yourself and think you can make it so far in one go.</p><br/><p>After reading, the two went in with the crowd.</p><br/><p>The dark space was lit up brightly by tens of shining pearls.</p><br/><p>It was an extremely spacious area, like a football field, with a gathering of over two hundred people. As soon as the two walked in, they were assaulted by the racket of hundred of people talking at once, like the yelling in a marketplace. It wasn\u2019t until ten doors on the far wall opened that the noise quietened.</p><br/><p>There were always a lot of people, so to avoid everyone crowding at the door, the school had made ten small doors. Every hour, each door could let 5 people in at once, so they weren\u2019t really very small.</p><br/><p>When it came to Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo, the elder next to the door spoke up and asked, \u201cWould you like to buy Transport Stones?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused for a moment. He knew what transport stones were, of course. He had thought that the school had finally decided on being generous and letting people train here for free, but he hadn\u2019t thought there would be this.</p><br/><p>After a moment of hesitation, You XiaoMo asked, \u201cHow many points is a transport stone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The elder answered, \u201cFive points.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved his hand and turned to enter the Gravity Mountain without bothering to consider it, saying, \u201cThen never mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Five points wasn\u2019t much, but transport stones wouldn\u2019t necessarily be needed. Plus, if one had a transport stone, they would have an easy way out and wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve the best possible effects with their training.</p><br/><p>The elder didn\u2019t reply, watching You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao walk inside. Smart people wouldn\u2019t buy these stones, that was the truth.</p><br/><p>Upon stepping inside, You XiaoMo felt a light pressure push against his body.</p><br/><p>This pressure wasn\u2019t the same as the pressure inside the Gravity Room, only having a third of its strength. He could still walk, though he was slower, about a third of his usual walking speed.</p><br/><p>Looking across, the other people were the same as him. Only Ling Xiao seemed completely unaffected, walking at the same speed as usual.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cWe can go a little further inside. The pressure here isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked over the crowd in front of them. Everyone was walking further inside, but upon reaching a certain distance, their speed suddenly fell again, making them even slower than snails. He looked to the black floor. Thanks to the lighting, he could clearly see that there was a yellow line drawn there.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cThis is probably the first zone of the Gravity Mountain. If we walk another two hundred meters, we\u2019ll reach the second.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frowned a little. \u201cThe Gravity Mountain is separated into zones? How many are there in total?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao: \u201cLet\u2019s go check.\u201d</p><br/><p>To keep pace with You XiaoMo, Ling Xiao slowed down. So, to outsiders, Ling Xiao seemed to be the same as everyone else.</p><br/><p>Two hundred meters wasn\u2019t much, but by the time You XiaoMo had arrived at the boundary between the first and second zones, his forehead was peppered with sweat.</p><br/><p>You really couldn\u2019t underestimate this Gravity Mountain. Even training long term in the weakest first zone would probably make you as dexterous as a swallow, and improve your speed by leaps and bounds as well.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, who had been watching him, raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tugged on Ling Xiao\u2019s sleeve and said in excitement, \u201cLing Xiao, I\u2019ve had an idea. Next time, we don\u2019t need to go to your pocket dimension for speed training anymore. This is a good training area for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao immediately realized what this was about. Though he might\u2019ve come up with this idea to avoid Thunder Flame Leopard\u2019s lightning, it didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a good idea. Ling Xiao nodded in agreement. \u201cWe can try it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo made a victory sign with his hand, in his mind.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao then continued, \u201cIf the effects aren\u2019t good though, we\u2019ll continue to train in the pocket dimension.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cOk.\u201d He definitely wouldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><br/><p>After dealing with that persisting worry, You XiaoMo felt like his body had suddenly become much lighter and stepped over the yellow line with spirits high. A stronger pressure immediately pushed down against his body.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held his breath. It was, as expected, increasing by each zone. The pressure felt in the second zone was twice the first, but he could still move, though his speed had fallen again. It seemed like the third zone should have the same pressure as the one they had first experienced in the competition.</p><br/><p>The two continued on towards the third zone. When the pressure from the third zone came down on him, You XiaoMo was surprised. It didn\u2019t feel the same.</p><br/><p>When he had first entered the Gravity Room, he had been completely unable to move because of the pressure. However, he seemed to still have enough strength for movement and then some this time. His body was lighter than before. He informed Ling Xiao of this strange situation.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rolled his eyes. \u201cOf course there would be a difference. It\u2019s been months since the competition and during this time, not only has your cultivation level grown, but you\u2019ve trained in the pocket dimension, too. If your physical constitution doesn\u2019t improve even with that, then you might as well as go and kill yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was sweating in embarrassment upon hearing those words. He had forgotten that improving one\u2019s cultivation level would also improve their constitution. In addition, he had been struck by thunder shocks several times, and his strength had improved in many ways. A difference was to be expected.</p><br/><p>After walking several steps, You XiaoMo could feel the sweat running down his back.</p><br/><p>His braced his hands on his knees, panting uncontrollably. Looking towards the yellow line 300 meters away, he steeled himself to continue. He swore he would get to the fourth zone today.</p><br/><p>As he swore to himself silently, Ling Xiao suddenly gripped his shoulder.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned his head to look at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cJust train in the third zone for today.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao then asked him, \u201cAre you here to train or to test your limits?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201cUm\u2026 To train.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cThe current you won\u2019t even be able to move if you entered the fourth zone. Gravity Mountain never existed for students to use to test their limits. What you need to do now is to get yourself to the point where you can run in the third zone. Once you\u2019re able to run and jump as normal, you can challenge the fourth zone.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought about it carefully. His suggestion was very reasonable.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao then said, \u201cAlso, as you train, you can use your Soul Force to help you. That way, you can train your physical ability while also refining your control of your soul force.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded rapidly. If it wasn\u2019t for Ling Xiao, he would\u2019ve never thought of that.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately drew out his soul force, carefully spreading it over his body. As expected, he felt much lighter. Seeing Ling Xiao still standing there, he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me, you can go check it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t go and check it out. I\u2019ll be seen.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Spiritual one star powerhouse walking to the far end of Gravity Mountain? There must be something strange about him!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo understood what he was trying to say. \u201cHow about you go back first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cEven if I go back I\u2019ll have nothing to do. I\u2019ll just stay and watch you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pursed his lips. That would be so embarrassing! But since Ling Xiao had made a decision, he didn\u2019t say anything against it. \u201cDo what you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>So, he began to focus on training.</p><br/><p>His first goal was to get himself running. Even with the help of his Soul Force, he could only walk slowly. Every step of his took three to four seconds. He probably wouldn\u2019t be able to get to the point of walking at normal speed today.</p><br/><p>When the sun was setting, You XiaoMo was carried out by Ling Xiao, soaked in sweat.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Once he slapped it\u2019s butt did it calm down.</p><br/><p>The two Golden Winged Insects laughed with glee.</p><br/><p>In response, the Metal Swallowing Beast rolled its eyes and thought, I\u2019m not going to play with you guys anymore.</p><br/><p>Carrying the Metal Swallowing Beast, You XiaoMo went inside the wooden cabin and took out a wood bucket. He diluted the bucket of Spiritual Water and moved it in front of the magic herb field, then proceed to sit beside it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo placed the Metal Swallowing Beast on his lap and immediately the two Golden Winged Insects landed on his head, with the intention of making a home there. You XiaoMo\u2019s body stiffened up for a moment and tried his best to ignore their presence, good thing was that they were relatively well-behaved.</p><br/><p>The two bugs and one beast stared at their master, what was he trying to do?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a deep breath and closed his eyes. During the last few months, he had used up too many magic herbs, almost all of the ones he had picked with Ling Xiao had been used by him. Thus, he was going to take the time he had now to harvest all of the matured magic herbs.</p><br/><p>However, this time he didn\u2019t plan on doing it himself. Last time, because Ling Xiao was there, working together was much more fun, but this time he was by himself, thus he was going to use a simpler and quicker method.</p><br/><p>Time drifted away soundlessly\u2026</p><br/><p>The Metal Swallowing Beast looked up with its tiny head and it\u2019s perfectly round eyes stared at its master with ignorance.</p><br/><p>Suddenly something moved in the magic herbs field, and the small beast\u2019s ears moved. Its head turned towards the direction of the field and its deep blue eyes reflected a scene of wonder.</p><br/><p>In a patch of vivid greenery, a flourishing field of magic herbs, stalks of swaying magic herbs, as if given life, automatically rose from the soft soil. As if lead by an invisible thread, the magics herbs flew by themselves towards the bucket filled with Spiritual Water. One by one, repeating till the bucket was completely filled by magic herbs.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opened his eyes and his tense back finally relaxed, at the same time he breathed a sigh of relief as it wasn\u2019t something he didn\u2019t do often, he was a bit tired.</p><br/><p>After he placed the Metal Swallowing Beast back on his shoulder he rose and brushed off all of the dirt and grass, ready for the second round.</p><br/><p>At this moment the Metal Swallowing Beast jumped off his shoulder and with its four tiny, short legs it ran towards the direction of the wooden cabin. Just as You XiaoMo was confused about its action, it came dragging a sieve that was even bigger than it. After it threw the sieve by its master\u2019s feet, it went running back to get more.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the Golden Winged Insects, as if refusing to lose, flew over as well.</p><br/><p>However, because their mouths were too small, after a while of trying they weren\u2019t even able to pick up one. The two were not discouraged and kept fighting.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo promptly called them over, \u201cOkay, this is enough, you don\u2019t need to get more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, You XiaoMo washed all of the magic herbs in the bucket before placing them in the sieve and placed them back on the counter in the wooden cabin. Then began his second round of work.</p><br/><p>Thus, after about two hours later, You XiaoMo was finally able to organize more than half of the magic herbs. At a much faster speed than with Ling Xiao too.</p><br/><p>When he was finished with everything, You XiaoMo calculated the time, realizing that it was about to be morning, he prepared to leave the room. That was when his pants were suddenly bitten by the Metal Swallowing Beast. It looked as if it wanted to go out with him as it wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hugged him close, \u201cXiao Jin, be a good boy and stay here. Once I\u2019m finished with everything I\u2019ll let you guys out.\u201dT/n: Metal Swallowing =TunJin, so Momo called him Xiao Jin, aka little Metal.</p><br/><p>The Metal Swallowing Beast let out a cry and unwillingly let go.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled as he patted his little head and then moved to his own head, attempting to get down the two Golden Winged Insects, but to his surprise, there was nothing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo searched around but still didn\u2019t see them, so he thought that they left to play on their own and thus he didn\u2019t think much of it. But when he turned around, the Metal Swallowing Beast was gone too. It was probably still a kid at heart and couldn\u2019t wait to run around and play.</p><br/><p>When he got out of the dimension and took a look around the room, he realized that Ling Xiao still wasn\u2019t back yet. Just as he was about to leave, something moved around his chest area.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted his shirt to see and became speechless.</p><br/><p>As it turned out, the three that disappeared were all hidden within his shirt and he actually didn\u2019t realize.</p><br/><p>With a dark expression You XiaoMo dragged them out one by one, \u201cGood for you, you guys actually dared to play tricks in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Golden Winged Insects, relying on their tiny stature, flew to the bed and climbed in. From the outside there was nothing out of place.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the Metal Swallowing Beast copied them and climbed in, however due to its size, the bed sheet instantly heaved up a little bump.</p><br/><p>Doing something wrong and now you\u2019re running away?</p><br/><p>Without hesitation You XiaoMo lifted up the bedsheets and the two insects and one beast were once again exposed in front of him, frantically crawling around.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to scold them for their actions, the Metal Swallowing Beast suddenly flipped to it\u2019s side, exposing its smooth belly. It was\u2026playing dead?</p><br/><p>Following the same \u2018monkey see monkey do\u2019 principal, the Golden Winged Insects also exposed their bellies. In the spirit of playing dead authentically, none of its sixteen legs moved an inch.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was angered to the point of laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t think you can get away by playing dead. I told you that I couldn\u2019t let you out this time, no matter how \u2018dead\u2019 you are, you\u2019re still going back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither the Metal Swallowing Beast or the Golden Winged Insects moved, truly a case of professionalism.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo reached out to the closest insect and just as he was about to touch it, its legs abruptly moved. Heh, lets see how long you can last.</p><br/><p>That was when the door was pushed opened from the outside.</p><br/><p>Subconsciously You XiaoMo retreated his hand. What he didn\u2019t see was that the tense legs of the Golden Winged Insects suddenly relaxed, in celebration of getting off the hook this time.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave them a warning glance, I\u2019m letting you get away for now.</p><br/><p>The one who came back was of course, Ling Xiao. When You XiaoMo walked out, he was seated over there, drinking water.</p><br/><p>After eyeing him from top to bottom, making sure nothing happened, You XiaoMo then proceeded to ask, \u201cSo, how did it go, did you find out which day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second day in the morning, there will be a lot of people accompanying him. However, it doesn\u2019t seem like the old guy is going to arrive immediately to the celebration.\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t keep him guessing this time and told him the answer straight out. By the looks of it, it didn\u2019t seem easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what about Feng ChiYun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Well that sure was a quick and concise answer!</p><br/><p>But, if the time was set on the second day then that means they had three days\u2019 worth of time. However, to prevent the old head going and leaving, they needed some time on the road.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly thought of another important question and couldn\u2019t help but be hesitant.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at him and said, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, mincing his words, said slowly, \u201cUm, about, about the father who left my mom, did you find out anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sneered, \u201cHe isn\u2019t even your real father, what are you paying attention to him for? Not only that, you knew that he left \u2018your\u2019 mom and \u2018you\u2019 behind, unless you actually want to get him back?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head in response, \u201cFor the better or for worse, at least in name he is my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, then what\u2019s your dad called?\u201d Ling Xiao stopped arguing and simply asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d You XiaoMo became instantly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>With a laughing scold Ling Xiao said, \u201cStupid, if you don\u2019t even know the name, how are you going to find him?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt as if a lighting struck him on a clear sky, suddenly he was charred completely. When he first gone to the Peach Blossom Village to find his \u2018lost\u2019 father, he had actually missed something this critical. As he recalled, all the villagers seemed to refer to his dad as \u2018that man\u2019. Now he only knew that his dad\u2019s last name was \u2018You\u2019, but all of the main family of the Vermillion Blood Clan was named \u2018You\u2019, there was no way to tell which one his dad was.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go with the flow.\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t feel much for his dad. Although, it was very likely that he left to protect his wife and child, but that was also an act of irresponsibility. For a woman, for her loving husband to suddenly disappear, that would be as if the sky had fallen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what if it doesn\u2019t go with the flow.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had a similar thought to Ling Xiao, but since he occupied their body, he felt he might as well try to find it\u2019s original father.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it was not fated to be, you can just assume he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, such an irresponsible thing to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is something more irresponsible, want to hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026no thanks.\u201d Hearing that, he knew it was nothing good. No point trying to choke himself with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>No, it\u2019s not \u2018too bad\u2019 at all!</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long before the Vermillion Blood City started to wake from its slumber as the streets once again filled up with noise. Once Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan arrived, You XiaoMo told them what information Ling Xiao had gathered. After some discussion, they decided to take action tomorrow night, when the sky was dark, and the moon was dim. The optimal time for committing a crime.</p><br/><p>Then, they split up to play, being a true tourist. You XiaoMo brought Ling Xiao along and ate all of the gourmet dishes of the Vermillion Blood City, however, he simply tasted a bit of each. That was because it was way too expensive, pure robbery.</p><br/><p>The currency for merchandise in the Vermillion Blood City was Spirit Gems, although some places shared the same currency, here, even a bowl of noodles cost five Spirit Gems.</p><br/><p>At first, You XiaoMo thought it wasn\u2019t a normal noodle, however, once he ate, he realized that the cost was at most a few gold coins. The amount of spirit gems gained from a bowl of noodles was close to pure profit.</p><br/><p>Profiteers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

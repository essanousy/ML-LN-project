You XiaoMo originally wanted to see the pirates of this world, but his hopes were dashed.</p><br/><p>The merchant ship reached the shore, and the crew began to unload the ship.</p><br/><p>Whale Island\u2019s port was three or four times bigger than River Town\u2019s port. There were also more merchant ships in the port, and it was extremely lively. Indeed, it was exactly what the old man had said: Whale Island\u2019s situation was much better than River Town\u2019s.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao weren\u2019t in any hurry to get off the ship, but Yang Ding and the rest fled rapidly off the boat as soon as it neared shore. Ever since You XiaoMo had punished them, they didn\u2019t dare to create any more trouble, and every time they saw You XiaoMo on the ship, they grew extremely nervous. In the end, they simply hid in their rooms and didn\u2019t dare to come out.</p><br/><p>A third of the cargo had just been unloaded when the captain came up and told them to get off, saying that there was someone looking for them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned his head and looked at Ling Xiao. He had spoken correctly again; it seemed that the old man from River Town indeed had some connections. Now there was no need for them to go search on their own, as he had already arranged it for them.</p><br/><p>After disembarking, they saw who had come to find them, and they discovered that it was a young person whose facial features still seemed slightly childlike. Unexpectedly, the young person\u2019s original form was that of the Tortoise Clan.</p><br/><p>The youth took the initiative and indicated that he had come to find them, as the old man had said.</p><br/><p>Although the youth wasn\u2019t from the Mystic Tortoise Clan, nor was he a Psychic Black Turtle, it seemed that his rank wasn\u2019t low in the Tortoise Clan either. Moreover, he was very familiar with the people on Whale Island, and people continuously greeted him along the way.</p><br/><p>The youth wasn\u2019t a calm person, and he very quickly began to start asking them questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard Old Long say that you guys came to Living Waters River Boundary because you were entrusted by the Tortoise Clan. Could I ask what the name of the person who entrusted you is?\u201d Old Long was the old man, and his original body was that of a dragon turtle.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had long since guessed that he would ask about this. The Psychic Black Turtle most likely already knew of how Mo Jing had been attacked while bringing back the baby turtle. All in all, the baby turtle was the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s descendant, and its status and position were both not ordinary. The Black Turtle Clan\u2019s people were probably extremely worried that it hadn\u2019t come back for so long.</p><br/><p>But this was still too fishy, so even though they knew that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao most likely had something to do with Mo Jing and the baby turtle, they still didn\u2019t dare to just rashly take them to the Black Turtle Clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no harm in telling you.\u201d You XiaoMo asked for Ling Xiao\u2019s opinion using his eyes before he said, \u201cHis name is Mo Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing, You XiaoMo caught a flash of excitement across the youth\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Up to this point, they could basically confirm that the old man and the youth were actually both the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s scouts, or else they couldn\u2019t have known about Mo Jing\u2019s situation with their status.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t plan on instantly handing over the baby turtle to the youth.</p><br/><p>The youth deliberated for a while. \u201cDid the man called Mo Jing only tell you guys to deliver a few messages to the Black Turtle Clan? There was nothing else besides this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. What else do you think there is?\u201d You XiaoMo innocently blinked. He really knew nothing at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, nothing, nothing. I was just asking casually.\u201d The youth nodded hastily while releasing a breath of air at the same time. He just knew that it was impossible. The Young Master was so important, so how could Mo Jing just hand it over to two strangers, but Old Long had insisted on him asking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, don\u2019t get offended, but I have a small pet that\u2019s the same race as you.\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly laughed before fishing out the baby turtle from his robe. \u201cSee, it\u2019s this baby turtle. Isn\u2019t it cute?\u201d</p><br/><p>The baby turtle crawled slowly across his hand, and its claws hung gently over his fingers. Its strength was very light, so it felt as if it was tickling him. This movement indicated that it was extremely happy.</p><br/><p>The moment the youth heard \u2018baby turtle,\u2019 his eyes grew wide, but when he saw the baby turtle on You XiaoMo\u2019s hand, he calmed down again.</p><br/><p>Young Master was a Psychic Black Turtle, and their shells had a pattern across them. This baby turtle didn\u2019t have any, and it seemed that it was just an ordinary baby turtle. He glanced at it once and then lost interest.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed secretly to himself. Now he could confirm even more that the youth knew about the baby turtle.</p><br/><p>As for why the pattern on the baby turtle\u2019s seal disappeared, it was actually very simple. It was because he covered it with paint that was the same color.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, You XiaoMo boldly let the baby turtle stand on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>The youth didn\u2019t even notice anymore, but You XiaoMo could imagine how upset he would be once he learned of the truth.</p><br/><p>The youth was also from the Dragon Turtle Clan. He was called Hai Chu, and though he looked shy, he was actually a very talkative person. He had a somewhat good opinion of You XiaoMo, so he willingly explained Whale Island\u2019s situation to him along the way.</p><br/><p>Whale Island was a middle tier island in Living Waters River Boundary. It served as a transfer point among the various islands. For example, there were some islands that would bring the goods that they were selling to Whale Island before transferring them to other islands that needed it via Whale Island. That was why it was so lively.</p><br/><p>Hai Chu brought them to an inn to stay at.</p><br/><p>Sea beasts didn\u2019t really put much emphasis on living spaces, so the buildings were as simple and crude as they were in River Town. But with one glance they could tell that the buildings were very sturdy and practical.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease feel free to stay here at the inn. I\u2019ve already sent a message informing the others that you are seeking the Black Turtle Clan, and before long someone should come to clear up the situation with you two.\u201d Hai Chu sent them to their room.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded and said, \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t take too long. We can\u2019t stay here for very long.\u201d He still didn\u2019t know what had happened outside, so he wanted to hurry and go back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, Young Master can be at ease.\u201dHai Chu left after finishing speaking.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo walked in the room and saw the big bed, he couldn\u2019t resist sighing. It was a wooden platform bed again. It seemed that he would have to start preparing some cotton-padded quilts from now on, or else when he was being done by Ling Xiao on the bed, it would take off several layers of skin. It was so hard that it was truly uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo placed the baby turtle on the table. The Metal Swallowing Beast and the Golden Winged Insect also both ran out. CatQiu was taken away by PiQiu and the rest, so there were only a few small demon beasts at his side who couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t know how to change shapes.</p><br/><p>The Golden Winged Insect liked to stand on the baby turtle\u2019s shell quite a bit, and sometimes it would even flap its wings as if it were driving the baby turtle.</p><br/><p>The Metal Swallowing Beast was the worst. Since the baby turtle moved extremely slowly, the Metal Swallowing Beast would often push the baby turtle back to its original position after it had crawled a small distance and force it to crawl all over again, and it took great pleasure in this. Afterwards, the baby turtle would get angry and turn around in search of You XiaoMo for comfort.</p><br/><p>Every time You XiaoMo would scold them, but then they would just do it again.</p><br/><p>The baby turtle crawled slowly back to You XiaoMo\u2019s hand and started to crawl up along his fingers with an \u2018I won\u2019t play with you\u2019 attitude.</p><br/><p>Since the Metal Swallowing Beast and the Golden Winged Insect had just been scolded, they had no choice but to play by themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo next we should just wait for the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s people to come find us?\u201d You XiaoMo poured a cup of hot tea for Ling Xiao. The tea was provided by the inn, and the room had been prepared well in advance by Hai Chu. It was clear that this was planned beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm.\u201d Ling Xiao replied sparingly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but pet the baby turtle. \u201cAt that time, we\u2019ll have to return the baby turtle to them.\u201d Although the baby turtle looked a little endearingly silly, it was still much more trouble than the Metal Swallowing Beast or the Golden Winged Insect.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew that if he replied that he did, Ling Xiao\u2019s next statement would be something like \u2018then just let it stay by your side\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll catch you a new one\u2019.</p><br/><p>Their relationship with the QiLin Clan wasn\u2019t that good in the first place, and if they added on the Psychic Black Turtle, then that wouldn\u2019t be very fun.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought a bit. \u201cNah, never mind. I don\u2019t want to be a nanny.\u201d</p><br/><p>The baby turtle was born not too long ago, and You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know how the Black Turtle Clan took care of its younglings. During this entire time, he had been feeding it spirit fruit, and if he had ruined the baby turtle, then he was screwed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUp to you,\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>After that they settled down in the inn. Hai Chu came to see them once and said that he had finally gotten in touch with the Black Turtle Clan. He told them that they would get there in three days before asking them to wait patiently.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was so bored that he took his adorkable crew and Ling Xiao out to shop around Whale Island. Along the way he bought quite a bit of Whale Island\u2019s and the surrounding islands\u2019 special goods, including both practical and impractical items. Several were also the adorkable crew\u2019s toys.</p><br/><p>After strolling through two streets, You XiaoMo pulled Ling Xiao into a teahouse.</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper of the teahouse happily served them a pot of hot tea. You XiaoMo poured a cup of tea before picking it up and walking to the door. He handed it to a young man who was pretending to look around, and he said with a smile, \u201cIt must\u2019ve been hard to follow us this whole time. I invite you to drink a cup of tea!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a dumbfounded look on the young man\u2019s face, and after he recovered, he instantly ran off awkwardly.</p><br/><p>He was the person that Hai Chu had sent to keep an eye on them. First, it was because he was still a little suspicious of their motives, and second, he was afraid that they would just leave like this.</p><br/><p>The young man had even believed that his tailing skill was pretty good.</p><br/><p>But what he didn\u2019t know was that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had already discovered his existence since the moment they walked out of the inn. It was only that they paid no attention to him and pretended as if he wasn\u2019t there at all.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo drank the tea in one gulp before returning to Ling Xiao. He chuckled. \u201cThat fellow\u2019s mental fortitude really sucks. All I did was invite him to drink a cup of tea, it wasn\u2019t like I was going to eat him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t eat him anyway.\u201d Ling Xiao splashed cold water on him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouted and ignored him. He lifted the cup and fed the baby turtle some tea, and the Metal Swallowing Beast also came over to join the fun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After that, they were led to a hidden stone-walled room to open the box.</p><br/><p>As they say, \u2018don\u2019t show off your riches\u2019, thus to prevent some customers from being noticed by those with malicious intent, the Samsara Tower would not open these items in public. The process was that the Samsara Tower would make an estimate of the worth of the items in Spirit Gems first, then they would select the one with the highest price. Of course, that number would not be announced publicly either.</p><br/><p>Once the group entered the hidden room, the elder who had examined You XiaoMo\u2019s magic pills was already inside. This time, he was responsible for the estimation as well.</p><br/><p>The one in charge placed the talisman and the box onto the stone desk in front of the elder.</p><br/><p>The elder opened the box to take out six cards and especially picked out one to place on the side, then started to give his assessments for the remaining five cards.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the appraisal. The elder placed the cards in his hands down and took the one he had initially placed on the side. Then he said, \u201cThe final bidder of the Dimensional talisman is You XiaoHa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept it!\u201d It was at this point the fatso suddenly cried out.</p><br/><p>The elderly replied calmly, \u201cWhat do you not accept?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fat kid said, \u201cThe price I gave was close to fifteen million Spirit Gems, how could this person be higher than mine?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a shift in his expression the elder said, \u201cHe gave one high grade level ten magic pill. Not only that, it\u2019s quality and condition was far beyond that of an ordinary level ten magic pill. At such, the base price would be fifteen million and the market price could be as high as twenty. Why couldn\u2019t it be higher than you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatso felt his face flushed red, but the elder in front of him was from the Samsara Tower, and behind the tower was the shadow of the Mage Guild. No matter how arrogant he could be, he didn\u2019t dare run wild here, however he was unwilling to let them take it just like that.</p><br/><p>He had to get the Dimensional talisman since it was a present for his father. It was only with his father\u2019s protection that he had his status today, thus he needed to please him once in a while.</p><br/><p>Like a cornered beast, he desperately tried to find a fault, \u201cElder, you have not seen his magic pill, how can you know that his magic pill is that good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause that young master just let this elderly one assess his magic pill. Is this answer satisfactory, or are you saying that you doubt my reputation?\u201d The elder said with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Su, don\u2019t misunderstand, that wasn\u2019t what young master Zhang meant.\u201d The sycophant quickly jumped out to explain, scared that he would get angry but also so that the young master had an excuse.</p><br/><p>Elder Su said nothing and instead gave the Dimensional talisman to You XiaoMo, \u201cThis is yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo put the Dimensional talisman away in his magic bag and politely excused himself as well as Ling Xiao out of the hidden room. Just as they were at the gate of the Samsara Tower however, behind him appeared a cold shout.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around, it was the fatso carrying a body of fat meat with his sycophant following suit. The two stopped in front of them and the fatso took a quick glance at him and said with disdain, \u201cHow many Spirit Gems do you want to hand over that Dimensional talisman?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s gaze paused for a second before replying with a smile, \u201cIf you can give me thirty million Spirit Gems then I would hand it over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly the fatso\u2019s expression changed, \u201cYou dare mock me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled as his wiggled his finger, \u201cWrong, I\u2019m not mocking you, I\u2019m toying with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it. Do you know who I am?\u201d The fatso was instantaneously angered to the point that his triple chin started to shake, along with an expression of \u2018you are so dead\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I know, aren\u2019t you young master Zhang of the ShuangYu Hotel? A similar status to Wu Cheng.\u201d You XiaoMo calmly nodded, with them having a conversation that loudly before, it would be difficult to not know.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know Wu Cheng?\u201d The fatso\u2019s anger dimmed a moment and his gaze contained a sliver of puzzlement. He hated Wu Cheng since his father always compared him with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty familiar with him.\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the fatso\u2019s expression changed to one of \u2018up to no good\u2019 and smiled sinisterly, \u201cI see, you\u2019re a friend of Wu Cheng. I changed my mind, leave the Dimensional talisman and offer me ten million Spirit Gems. Since you know of my identity, it\u2019s better if you behave otherwise I\u2019ll make it difficult for you to even live in the Central City.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sized him up and then looked around him, other than the sycophant, there wasn\u2019t anyone else.</p><br/><p>Where did the fatso get this confidence that with an Imperial one-star level he could threaten them? It was the first time he encountered something like this, you learn something new every day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no Dimensional talisman, there is no spirit gems, I just have my two fists. Do you want one or both?\u201d You XiaoMo asked with a devious smile.</p><br/><p>With a livid roar the fatso shouted, \u201cBeat him for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sycophant didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>The fatso angrily turned around to only find that the sycophant was shaking with an expression of fear. \u201cDid you not hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Zhang, they, their power is stronger than ours\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the sycophant wasn\u2019t strong either and couldn\u2019t see You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao\u2019s level, but if they dare speak in a cocky tone after hearing of young master\u2019s title then they must have background too. Or their strength was far beyond theirs. \u201cAn-And I feel like I heard their names before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash.\u201d The fatso kicked him and said, while pointing at You XiaoMo, \u201cSo what if his level is above ours, I don\u2019t think they dare offend the ShuangYu Hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared with both eyes on the finger that wasn\u2019t too far from his nose. His feet felt itchier than his hand, and then he couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer\u2026</p><br/><p>Young master Zhang, who was at least a hundred kg, went flying like a withered flower petal, spitting spit the whole way along. Scaring everyone away as they hid somewhere safe since it was gross. Thus the scene suddenly became chaotic.</p><br/><p>Young master Zhang was like a big pile of pork, all the fat from his body fell onto the ground and he was stuck, unable to get up. The sycophant was so scared that he fell to the ground. After beating him up, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao left feeling refreshed and energetic. The fatso was from the ShuangYu Hotel, maybe Wu Cheng would even thank them for it later.</p><br/><p>Just fifteen minutes after they left, manager Zhang, who had heard of his son being beaten to the point of being unable to get up, hurried quickly to the scene and brought his people. The anger in him flared up when he saw the terrible condition his son was in.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao-er, tell your dad, who dared have the guts to do something like this to you? Your dad will definitely make them pay for it.\u201d Manager Zhang knew what kind of a guy his son was, however, regardless of his flaws, he was his flesh and blood. To be beaten in the Central City, clearly someone wasn\u2019t giving him face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy! You must avenge your son.\u201d The fatso grabbed onto his dad\u2019s legs with a face full of tears, \u201cThe two went way too far, even knowing that I was your son they still dared to hurt me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d Manager Zhang wanted to pull him up but as if suddenly remembering something, his hands stopped midair and unnaturally pulled back. The fatso didn\u2019t realize.</p><br/><p>The fatso complained, \u201cToday I was going to buy you a Dimensional talisman from the Samsara Tower because I heard that, under critical situations, it could be another life, thus I wanted to buy it for you. However, I wasn\u2019t able to win against them, and I politely asked them to sell it to me and explained the situation. But, not only did they not sell it to me, they insulted me and attacked me first. Dad, you have to avenge your son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Zhang was so angered that his fingers started shaking, how dare they bully his son so brazenly. Even he knew that his son\u2019s words were not to be fully believed, but the fact that he wanted to buy him a Dimensional talisman should be true.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what they are called? Dad will definitely avenge you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatso wiped the blood and tears from his face, then with a sinister tone said, \u201cThere were two of them, one tall and the other one short, but I only know the short one\u2019s name, his is called You XiaoHa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoHa?\u201d Manager Zhang frowned and thought about it, why did this name sound so familiar, as if he had heard of it before? Then, a flash of lighting appeared in his brain and the manager was dumbfounded. He\u2026He, could he be the young man who had beaten the One Eyed Scarface?</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d The fatso looked at his dad confusedly.</p><br/><p>Manager Zhang suddenly grabbed his shoulder forcefully, \u201cZhao-er, are you sure that he was called You XiaoHa and the man beside him, was he tall and very handsome?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatso looked at him, scared and said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust tell me!\u201d Manager Zhang yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s called You XiaoHa. Dad, if you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask Elder Su on the second floor of the Samsara Tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fatso didn\u2019t understand why his dad who, a moment ago, was so normal suddenly changed face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, all you do is bring me trouble.\u201d With that Manager Zhang gave a slap to his forehead, unable to restrain his anger. Then, without further care of this stupid son, he hurried away. If that man, because of his son, transferred that anger to the ShuangYu Hotel then he didn\u2019t need to be the manager anymore.</p><br/><p>The fatso was slapped stupid by his father and sat on the ground without a reaction.</p><br/><p>Behind him, the sycophant, had a flash of understanding as he saw the scene unfold and, in a place, away from sight, he pulled out his Transmitter stone. Then, he went back to being the normal servant-like attitude, pretentiously supporting the fatso up.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Wu Cheng walked out of his room with a full blown smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

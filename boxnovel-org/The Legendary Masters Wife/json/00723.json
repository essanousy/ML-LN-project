Since the negotiations were set tomorrow, the two spent the day at home. Mother You wasn\u2019t feeling well, so they didn\u2019t go anywhere.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had Ling Xiao game with him for the entire afternoon. Apart from the first time when Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t familiar with the controls, he KO\u2019d You XiaoMo every single time.</p><br/><p>Unwilling to accept that he would lose to someone from ancient times, You XiaoMo made Ling Xiao play with him again and again, practically forgetting that they were here as bodyguards. If Johnson got wind of this, he\u2019d probably try and skin them.</p><br/><p>But the You family members didn\u2019t say anything. Butler Tan brought them fruits and snacks, smiling amiably and telling him to play as much as he wanted. When You Lu and You Bo returned, they heard a scream from the living room.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not that smart, why don\u2019t you let me win? This is already the forty-fifth time. You\u2019ve only been playing for one afternoon, how come you already play like a pro? I\u2019m not playing anymore.\u201d You XiaoMo tossed the controller to the side. His passion had been eroded away by forty-five rounds of failure.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied lazily, \u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just too smart.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised and shoved his bare foot against Ling Xiao\u2019s leg. Ling Xiao grabbed his ankle and yanked upwards, immediately eliciting a yelp of surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d That was when they heard a harsh admonishment, startling You XiaoMo. He tried to retract his foot, but Ling Xiao held it tight. He turned his head to see You Bo with an expression of rage on his face and immediately felt awkward and guilty. He hurriedly motioned for Ling Xiao to let go of his foot, but the other pretended he couldn\u2019t see.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao scrutinised the other. \u201cIs there anything you want, Young Master You Bo?\u201d</p><br/><p>You Bo scowled. \u201cAre you here to protect my parents or play around? Your behavior has me suspecting that White Shark is just a mere pretty name and their members don\u2019t know how to be professional.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. White Shark\u2019s members don\u2019t know how to be professional. Of course, that doesn\u2019t include us.\u201d Ling Xiao smiled, meeting the other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could practically hear the air crackling with electricity. How did it come to a face off between these two beautiful men?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Bo!\u201d That was when You Lu came over. As the eldest brother, his demeanor was impeccable. The only one who could keep You Bo under control in the family was him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother! They\u2026\u201d You Bo lowered his voice.</p><br/><p>You Lu cut him off, calmly speaking, \u201cSo long as they can protect father and mother, and make sure they\u2019re unharmed, they can do whatever they want. Leave them be.\u201d</p><br/><p>You Bo was still disgruntled, but he didn\u2019t say anything else, listening to his brother. In reality, he wasn\u2019t sure why he acted so rashly. For some reason, the two\u2019s intimacy pissed him off.</p><br/><p>In the end, the dinner at the You Family once again ended amidst You XiaoMo\u2019s subconscious PDA with Ling Xiao. Watching it made You Bo\u2019s teeth itch. For some reason he felt that they were doing it on purpose and You XiaoMo reminded him all too much of his deceased second brother.</p><br/><p>At ten in the evening, You Bo came to You Lu\u2019s study.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, what do you think about this? You know what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You Lu paused in flipping through his files, his gaze landing on the other\u2019s face. \u201cHis demeanor truly does resemble You XiaoMo, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou suspect that they\u2019re up to something?\u201d You Bo was smart and immediately understood what the other meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. I can\u2019t tell right now, but considering the You Family\u2019s position, it\u2019s not impossible that someone will be targeting us from the shadows. The only thing we can be certain of is that they have nothing to do with the Li Family, so they shouldn\u2019t be too much of a threat to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>You Bo was silent for a moment. Then he raised his head, gaze determined, and said, \u201cBrother, XiaoMo is special in my heart. I don\u2019t want someone to be here imitating him ten years after his death. If he has ulterior motives for trying to get close to us, I won\u2019t show mercy. If the time comes, I hope you won\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You Lu lowered his eyelids slowly, face expressionless. \u201cWhy would you think I would stop you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You Bo was stunned for a moment and then started laughing. \u201cBrother, it\u2019s only now that I\u2019ve realized that You XiaoMo was right. You really are a mensao*!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the two brothers were over here discussing their feelings, You XiaoMo felt like he was being buffeted by the wind. He hadn\u2019t thought that You Lu and You Bo would miss him so. He had always thought that the two of them thought of him as no more than an interesting toy, merely sad at the lost amusement. It was only now that he knew that You Bo was rather awkward with expressing himself. As for You Lu, he really was a mensao. He often hid what he truly thought in his heart and was difficult to read.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thoughts do you have about your younger brother\u2019s confession of love?\u201d Ling Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed dopily. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard You Bo say I\u2019m special to him. In the past all he ever did was bully me. I thought he disliked me. I should have known that with You Bo\u2019s personality, he wouldn\u2019t express his love normally. But there is one thing I don\u2019t like though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe always calls You Lu big brother, but never calls me that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe because you\u2019re special to him, so he treats you differently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026?\u201d You XiaoMo looked over at him in excitement, but he cut himself off upon seeing the terrifying smile on Ling Xiao\u2019s face. He felt that he had to explain himself. \u201cAbout that\u2026 all I have for them is brotherly love, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so anxious. I trust you.\u201d Ling Xiao stroked his face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo secretly didn\u2019t believe him. When he was about to explain himself further, he noticed something and suddenly looked towards the softly swaying curtains.</p><br/><p>At the same time, six dark shadows flipped into the gardens of the mansion, their movements making it clear that they were no normal people. Two of them alighted on the roof with a flip, rapidly heading towards Father and Mother You\u2019s room. They soon arrived right above the room and nodded to each other, about to jump down, when a voice came from behind them, startling them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two sure are enthusiastic, taking a walk at this time of night!\u201d You XiaoMo gazed at the two\u2019s panicked faces cheerfully.</p><br/><p>The two exchanged a look, charging without a word, sending blows with their fists and feet. However, they didn\u2019t know that their actions were futile.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo easily took care of then and prevented them from committing suicide as well. He brought them to the garden where the four others had already been taken care of by Ling Xiao. They hadn\u2019t had the chance to commit suicide either, all still in a state of bewilderment. They had been caught before they even had a chance to resist. The gap in their strength was clear to see, but they hadn\u2019t heard anything about there being such experts in the You Mansion before this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho sent you? Answer honestly or we\u2019ll just search your memories,\u201d You XiaoMo immediately threatened. Perhaps this was impossible in the mortal world, but they were all cultivators. Who knows what others were capable of?</p><br/><p>The one who was clearly the leader rasped, \u201cI know you\u2019re members of White Shark sent by the government as bodyguards, but instead of working for the country, why don\u2019t you just join us? Pills, skill scrolls, cultivation methods, we can give you anything you want, so long as you work for us, you\u2019ll be well compensated.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flicked his forehead and the leader went flying back with a scream, slamming into the wall. It created a huge noise, but the mansion remained silent, as if no one had heard. He said, \u201cI want you to answer my question. Cut the crap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t tell you. Kill us if you dare.\u201d One of the black cloaked men said before biting his tongue. The five of them collapsed. Even if they weren\u2019t dead, they wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with their tongues bitten off.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked forth, mouth twitching into a slight smile. \u201cPersonally, I prefer to get memories from corpses. The living are too troublesome. They keep screaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader\u2019s eyes widened, his last impression being that of the man\u2019s devil like face.</p><br/><p>The six corpses disappeared and the You Family was silent once more, as if no one had ever trespassed. No one noticed anything wrong. The second day the four members of the You Family got up early.</p><br/><p>Today was the day of the negotiations.</p><br/><p>That morning, You XiaoMo smiled dopily at You Lu and You Bo, causing the two to scowl. He didn\u2019t know, but after he found out the two\u2019s feelings for him, a strange feeling rose in his heart at the sight of the two. However, this feeling disappeared when Ling Xiao cuffed him around the head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, it\u2019s time to go!\u201d</p><br/><p>TN: mensao refers to a person who\u2019s composed, stoic, cold and cruel, or stuffy and boring on the outside, but actually passionate, warm, or (depending on context) a pervert on the inside. They generally don\u2019t express their emotions, or the fact that they have emotions at all, but surprise people with their actions, and sometimes words, that belly their care, warmth and passion. Usually called Kuudere in Japanese.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

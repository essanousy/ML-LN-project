Enthusiastic hawking of wares was heard from both sides of the streets and a dazzling line-up was displayed in the stalls, so much so that there were customers frequently hovering in front of the stalls.</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing introduced the affair in Tian Xiang City while he brought them to the DuanMu Clan\u2019s property.</p><br/><p>Although the general headquarters of the forces in Bei Dong were not in Tian Xiang City, each of the forces would more or less have some properties there. The open strife and covert maneuverings of every major force had long ceased to be a secret.</p><br/><p>They stopped in front of an inn after an hour.</p><br/><p>The inn was the property of the DuanMu Clan. The shopkeeper recognized DuanMu Qing and quickly arranged a private room for them on the second level. He had even prepared a table full of good wine and good food.</p><br/><p>Before dismissing the shopkeeper, DuanMu Qing directed him to arrange three rooms for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo rooms are enough.\u201d Ling Xiao indifferently interrupted.</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing was stunned and after recovering he said, \u201cMy benefactors, there\u2019s no need to worry. There are still many empty rooms in this inn and there\u2019s absolutely no problem with reserving three rooms.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper standing at the side nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao silently shot a glance at them.</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing shivered and hurriedly corrected, \u201cThen two rooms are enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dao Yun looked at You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao. He naturally would not assume that one of them would want to sleep in the same room as him. It was only a little unexpected that their relationship was actually so close for them to sleep in the same room.</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing left for a while and after coming back he revealed, \u201cMy three benefactors, I have already asked someone to tell my father of the situation. In addition, I have also asked my father to inquire about the Dimensional Teleportation. I believe that it will not take long before we get an answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, they did not have to jump through so many hoops if they wanted to use the Dimensional Teleportation. Unfortunately, the powers controlling the Dimensional Teleportation recently temporarily closed the transportation. They had to have some connections if they wanted to immediately leave Bei Dong.</p><br/><p>Dao Yun nodded to express his understanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that the qualifying tournament was in two months? Then they shouldn\u2019t be in such a hurry to prepare right? Why does it look as if there is going to be some lively thing occurring in Tian Xiang City?\u201d You XiaoMo asked as he stuffed food into his mouth.</p><br/><p>He had seen several people wearing the same attire while walking on the street before, looking similar to guards. Tian Xiang City had so many powers that it was not necessary for guards to patrol, instead this could be said to be useless.</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing replied, \u201cWhat you\u2019re talking about should be related to the auction three days later. Speaking of which, Sir Benefactor\u2019s luck is quite good. Tian Xiang City holds a large-scale auction every few years, and the host of the auction is not any of the powers in Bei Dong, rather they are the Southern Continent\u2019s Cang Alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s heart thumped, \u201cWhy would this Cang Alliance run all the way to Bei Dong to host an auction?\u201d</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing was not at all surprised by his question and simply explained, \u201cSir Benefactor may not know, but the reach of the Cang Alliance is not only limited to the Southern Continent but they practically cover the entire Tong Tian Continent. This is an exaggeration of course, but you would definitely be able to see Cang Alliance\u2019s shadow in any place with a lot of talents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Cang Alliance seldom holds an auction. Every time they hold one, the goods in the auction are sure to be some type of quality goods. This time, Bei Dong has managed to be the place where the Cang Alliance\u2019s auction will be. Naturally, there would be many people arriving after hearing the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo still look forward to auctions, and immediately looked at Ling Xiao in excitement, \u201cShall we go take a look too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his shining eyes, Ling Xiao knew he would say as such and laughed, \u201cThen let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing quickly interjected, \u201cSir Benefactor, actually not just anyone can attend the auction held by the Cang Alliance. Compared to other auctions, the Cang Alliance has stricter restrictions on who can attend their auction.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was disappointed right from the start upon hearing this.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked, \u201cWhat are the requirements to attend?\u201d</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing explained, \u201cThe Cang Alliance would issue a black invitation card a month before the auction is held. You would be able to attend once you acquire a black invitation card. One card can bring in three people to the auction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how would we be able to get a black invitation card?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Benefactor, please rest assured. It\u2019s easy to get the Cang Alliance\u2019s black invitation cards with the influence of my DuanMu Clan. I will put in an order now, it should be sent over after two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, DuanMu Qing proceeded to explain some things regarding the auction to them. Only after the sun had set did he leave. You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao returned to their rooms once he left. Dao Yun was embarrassed to follow after them, so he also returned to his own room.</p><br/><p>The two finally had some time to themselves.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately threw himself onto the bed. The room that DuanMu Qing arranged for them was the biggest and best in the inn. The bed was also very big and three people would have no problem sleeping on it.</p><br/><p>After rolling about two rounds on the bed, You XiaoMo lay stomach-down on the bed as he looked at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you let Dao Yun follow us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took off his outer robe and hung it on the screen to the side in passing. Then walked to the bed and sat down, and he asked, \u201cOther than being good at stealing, do you know what other things thieves are good at?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo touched his chin to create an appearance of him pondering over it, \u201cIs it agility?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shook his head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not agility. It\u2019s information. Since Dao Yun\u2019s master has a particular love for rare treasured objects, he would definitely gather information about it from all over. In all probability, he should know information that not many know about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d You XiaoMo half-comprehended as he nodded, then he suddenly reacted, \u201cYou want to get information from his master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Contrary to expectations, Ling Xiao denied this, \u201cThat Thief God is not as dumb as Dao Yun. It would be as difficult as ascending to heaven to get information from him. However, even though we can\u2019t ask, Dao Yun will be able to.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly saw the light. So Ling Xiao planned to make a move through Dao Yun, no wonder\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what kind of information do you want to inquire about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember that Wood Elemental Essence that we acquired in the Boundless Sea?\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I remember. You said that the Elemental Essence has other uses, so you kept it.\u201d You XiaoMo immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Elemental Essence can be divided into different types based on the five phases of Chinese philosophy. They are classified into Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In the inherited memory of the Ancient Demon Phoenix Clan, as long as the five phases of Elemental Essence are gathered, one would be able to breakthrough the shackles of a Sacred Realm cultivation base with the support of the power of the five phases of Elemental Essence, however\u2026\u201d Ling Xiao hesitated to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2019However\u2019 what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the inherited memory, none of the former generations of Ancient Demon Phoenixes were able to collect all five phases of Elemental Essence, so this is only a legend. I also do not know if we will be able to find the remaining four phases of Metal, Water, Fire and Earth Elemental Essences.\u201d Be that as it may, but Ling Xiao still wanted to take a gamble, so he kept that Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s take it slowly, since we still have time. When the time comes, I can also help you sound out Dao Yun.\u201d You XiaoMo crawled up and hugged Ling Xiao\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly glanced at him and commented, \u201cI think it\u2019s better if I do it by myself ba.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. He dared to guarantee that this sentence of Ling Xiao\u2019s was definitely a disparaging remark against his IQ, although it was much more restrained now compared to the past. Should he rejoice about this or not?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, isn\u2019t the Cang Alliance one of the top information brokers? Can\u2019t we buy information from them? If the Cang Alliance is really as powerful as what DuanMu Qing said, it may be possible that they have information regarding this.\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly thought of this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no use.\u201d Ling Xiao answered, \u201cIt is possible that Cang Alliance may know this, but they will not easily sell such important information to others. However, we can find out information about the Vermillion Blood Clan from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover there\u2019s still Yin Ge. We don\u2019t know where he and Zhan YuXuan ended up. Could they have appeared somewhere other than Bei Dong?\u201d You XiaoMo worried that they may have missed them.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cNo, Bei Dong is the area where the veil between the realms is the weakest in the Tong Tian Continent. So most who want to establish a Trans-Dimensional tunnel can\u2019t help but choose Bei Dong. Although we were a little off the exit at that time, but they should still be somewhere in Bei Dong. We\u2019ll meet them sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought over it for a while before he understood.</p><br/><p>Previously, he had always felt it was a little weird.</p><br/><p>So it turned out that was why Dao Yun would actually appear in their spatial pathway \u2013 everyone\u2019s exit was at Bei Dong.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s sleep. We\u2019ll head out tomorrow for another look.\u201d Ling Xiao embraced You XiaoMo and immediately lay down. They had too many things to do, even a short time was also precious now.</p><br/><p>This night was a rare case where Ling Xiao did not torment You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>The two slept until dawn. The pounding of footsteps on the stairs never stopped. Not long later, Dao Yun\u2019s clear and loud voice drifted in from outside the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow You, are you awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was immediately roused. Although he was woken up early by the noises, his quality of sleep last night was quite good and he woke up full of energy.</p><br/><p>Dao Yun had already occupied a table on the first floor. He was already below when You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao came down. The table he got was by the window, and one could both clearly see the crowd on the street and the people walking in from the entranceway from the table.</p><br/><p>About an hour later, DuanMu Qing finally hurried over with a person.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

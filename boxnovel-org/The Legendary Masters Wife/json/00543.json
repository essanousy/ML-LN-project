The primary target of their irritation was Hei Xiong, who had given the order.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong wasn\u2019t happy either. This thing clearly had nothing to do with him, yet he had to face the consequences. He was also getting more and more dissatisfied with Xing Qi and Gao Yin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t find them by tomorrow, I\u2019ll give the order to open up the city in the evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong had his underlings call for Xing Qi and Gao Yin, greeting them with this order. After being defeated by that man in front of so many people that time, his reputation had been ruined. Then with the added oil of the order to close the city, he might not be able to keep his position if the fire continued to burn.</p><br/><p>Plus, ZiRan City was already overcrowded and he received daily reports of fights breaking out in different areas of the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Xiong, don\u2019t forget that these orders came from above.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xing Qi, one arm gone, immediately narrowed his eyes. He was unsurprised at Hei Xiong growing temper.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong\u2019s gaze landed on the remains of Xing Qi\u2019s arm, sneering, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that one\u2019s order then I wouldn\u2019t have even cooperated with you in the first place. The city has already been closed for seven days and I\u2019ve done my part. It\u2019s your own faults that you can\u2019t find them. Face the consequences yourself. I\u2019m not humoring you any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong and Xing Qi were different.</p><br/><p>He had cut his own arm off back then, so after ingesting a Bone Growth Pill, he grew back a new one, but Xing Qi\u2019s arm couldn\u2019t grow back, not unless he got a prosthetic.</p><br/><p>After knowing that Xing Qi\u2019s arm had been burned off, Hei Xiong\u2019s first thought was Ling Xiao, but he didn\u2019t say anything about it because he knew that even if he spoke out, the three of them combined wouldn\u2019t even be able to take that guy on.</p><br/><p>After managing to escape relatively unscathed last time, he didn\u2019t want to get on Ling Xiao\u2019s bad side again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Xiong!\u201d Xing Qi suddenly stood, rage burning in his eyes as he glared at Hei Xiong.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong wasn\u2019t afraid of the two of them. They all worked for the same agenda; it wasn\u2019t like they would kill him. Plus, this had nothing to do with him anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have the time to argue with me, why don\u2019t you try and figure out how to find your man before tomorrow evening instead?\u201d Hei Xiong left Xing Qi\u2019s room, throwing those words behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Xing Qi slammed his palm again the table, shattering it.</p><br/><p>Gao Yin scowled. \u201cIt seems like Hei Xiong is being serious, but I feel like he\u2019s hiding something from us. It seems like he\u2019s afraid that Mo Jing\u2019s comrades will come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xing Qi\u2019s expression chilled. \u201cCould it be that Mo Jing leaked the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do now? Just us two can\u2019t find a hidden Mo Jing. Will we really have to stand and watch the city gates open again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s probably so.\u201d Xing Qi wore a dark, icy expression.</p><br/><p>The next day, the news of the city being opened once more spread like wildfire. The dark atmosphere that had clouded over the city finally began to disperse and people stopped endlessly complaining. Those who had urgent business outside of the city quickly packed, prepared to leave the city as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>People didn\u2019t care if the news was true or not and many people were restless, gathering at the city gates. It became so crowded in the nearby streets that it was impossible to move.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could see an endless flow of people heading towards the gates from his open window. If this continued, that area would become overcrowded.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we wait until the gates are open to leave or should we just brute force our way through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Jing said contemplatively, \u201cIf we wait for the gates to open, then Xing Qi and the other two will definitely go to guard the gates personally and act if they see anyone suspicious. Though with Fellow Ling\u2019s strength there\u2019s no need for worry, we can\u2019t be certain that they won\u2019t have other helpers. That would be very troublesome if it\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are actually a few good point about brute forcing our way through. The guards in the city aren\u2019t all that strong and we\u2019ll be out of ZiRan City by the time Xing Qi and the others arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his chin, nodding. What a smart idea!</p><br/><p>However, this was the first time he had heard of someone who refused to walk the easy path and chose to brute force their way through instead.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rose, slowly walking towards the door and stopping in front of it. His handsome face twisted to reveal a malicious smile before he said in a mild tone, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no time like the present to brute force our way through!\u201d</p><br/><p>In this time, where everyone was anxious to get through the city gates.</p><br/><p>A time where people were crowded in anticipation. A time where no one would expect someone to brute force their way out rather than wait for a gate that was about to open.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo truly felt that their actions would definitely cause a huge impact and send everything into absolute turmoil. The gates would probably be squeezed open.</p><br/><p>The burning sun rose to the middle of the sky. The blinding sunlight was like embers, raining down on the people crowded at the city gates, adding oil to the fires that burned in their hearts.</p><br/><p>This was a place even more noisy than a market.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally realized that, though he had thought that marketplaces were the most dangerous weapon, there were worse things out there. One might not be able to imagine it, but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t impossible.</p><br/><p>ZiRan City had two gates, one in the south and one in the north.</p><br/><p>Though the South gate was the city entrance, there were plenty of people who wanted to leave through the South gate, too, and, naturally, the North gate wouldn\u2019t have any less traffic, only more.</p><br/><p>To assure the order and peace in the city, both gates had many guards, to keep watch. However, Xing Qi and company all thought that Mo Jing would want to leave through the North gate because it led to Living Waters River Boundary. Thus, there were more guards there.</p><br/><p>This was convenient for them.</p><br/><p>The guards had made a buffer with railings with a ten meter diameter around the South gate. In the buffer zone, if anyone entered apart from the guards, then, they\u2019d immediately be arrested.</p><br/><p>A few people hadn\u2019t believed this and purposefully walked inside. They ended up getting taken away by the guards and after that no one dared try again.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone thought this, a white robed young man walked steadily into the buffer zone under everyone\u2019s gazes.</p><br/><p>Gazes converged on him like lasers, and the hottest ones came from the fifteen guards, their gazes baring a hint of killing intent, fixed on the young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop right there! Come closer and don\u2019t blame me for what I do!\u201d The head of the guards walked forwards, his spear raised and pointed at the young man emotionlessly as he gave his warning.</p><br/><p>The young man seemed to not have heard, his footsteps not stopping.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the guard didn\u2019t bother wasting his breath and swung his spear, prepared to send an attack with a shout.</p><br/><p>That was when the young man moved.</p><br/><p>He suddenly dashed right in front of the guard as an aura more intense than the guards\u2019 erupted from him. The guard\u2019s face went pale at once.</p><br/><p>Though he was the captain, he was only an five star Emperor level, strill far from Divine level.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just him who was shocked. Those who were prepared to watch the young man get taken away by the guards were also shocked. This weak-looking young man was actually this strong? That was too unfair\u2026</p><br/><p>The guard didn\u2019t dare face the young man alone, hurriedly calling out, \u201cEveryone, together\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even finish his sentence when the young man\u2019s figure flashed in front of him and kicked him to the side. The other guards didn\u2019t even have the time to react.</p><br/><p>By the time they did, a sliver of terrifying killing intent shot over from afar.</p><br/><p>When the crowd looked over, they were immediately bathed in red light. An arrow with a red flame shining like the sun shot forwards with withering speed. It was in front of them in the blink of an eye and hit the gates in the next moment.</p><br/><p>With a huge explosion, the arrow destroyed the gates entirely and those who were close were caught up in the blast. Some people were hit by the debris, jumping.</p><br/><p>The young man that had kicked the guard had long since disappeared.</p><br/><p>By the time the smoke cleared, the closed gates had become a huge hole about eleven or twelve meters wide. Even the city walls had been hit. The guards had the most injured and dead, lying amongst the rubble and moaning in pain.</p><br/><p>The entire area seemed to go silent for a while.</p><br/><p>Then, like a tightly wound string breaking, a thunderous roar rose from the crowd and they charged like crazy out of the city.</p><br/><p>They all fought to get out of there first like swarming ants.</p><br/><p>Some people even trampled over the bodies of the guards. The entire situation was even more chaotic than a marketplace, screaming, cursing, and wild laughter.</p><br/><p>Though the gates were said to be opened in the evening, no one knew if it was true or not. If they could leave now, why wait?</p><br/><p>Everyone seemed to have lost their minds, until a furious roar sounded from the skies, \u201cMo Jing you bastard! Get out here!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They then saw five of Wu Cheng\u2019s fighters falling to the ground with pale expressions on their faces. Each one of them grabbed their heads and slammed them to the ground as if they had all been triggered by something. Soon, a puddle of blood appeared.</p><br/><p>Wu Cheng was stunned. When he recovered, his eyes landed on You XiaoMo who was leaning on Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder and cast him a murderous look. Was there any panic on the latter\u2019s face? Nope. Instead, his grinning face was exceptionally an eyesore.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You XiaoMo shrank his head back.</p><br/><p>Of course, Wu Cheng didn\u2019t buy his words. In fact, his expression seemed to show otherwise, being even more angered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys have guts. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re students of XiaoYao Institute. You dared to toy with me, so don\u2019t even think of leaving here tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was very curious. Where did he get all that confidence from? He was but a mere seven star Imperial practitioner and he was more haughty than him!</p><br/><p>In a tone that expressed his laziness to speak more, Ling Xiao\u2019s voice rang in his ears, \u201cThis place has two Emperor level powerhouses. They may most likely be the people he\u2019s relying on.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scanned the surrounding but he didn\u2019t find anyone suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what do we do now? Looks like he really wants to leave us. If we don\u2019t knock him down now, he definitely won\u2019t just let the matter rest. But his men are also in the casino. If they attack\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll just kill them.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately shut up. What a good idea. As if! This casino looked like it had quite some background. If they killed them, there might even be people knocking on their doors for revenge that night. And not to forget, they were staying upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo contemplated before speaking.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The sound of a heavy object hitting the ground and overturned tables cut him off.</p><br/><p>When he turned to look again, one of the main people involved had collapsed into a heap. His face was pale and he had vomited blood, completing the look that said \u2018I\u2019m dying\u2019.</p><br/><p>Two figures flew out from the corners and swiftly appeared before Wu Cheng. They hurriedly helped him up and when they saw his injuries, their expressions slightly changed. Their eyes turned a lot darker.</p><br/><p>Although young master Wu brought this trouble upon himself, attacking him without a second word clearly meant that they didn\u2019t even acknowledge them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you, young master Wu?\u201d The old man frowned as he looked at Wu Cheng\u2019s face which was alternating between green and white.</p><br/><p>Wu Cheng was already on the verge of exploding from anger. He had never in his life experienced such humiliation. His father was one of the ones in-charge of ShuangYu casino and while it looked like an ordinary casino on the surface, it was in fact a large force in Central City. For as long as he remembered spending his days of gallivanting around the city and doing as he pleased, this was the first time someone dared to treat him like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want them dead! Rip their corpses apart with five horses! Never mind about XiaoYao Institute. They haven\u2019t officially become their students so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if we kill them.\u201d Wu Cheng\u2019s rage had already reached an extreme, so much so that he managed to calm down a bit.</p><br/><p>Seeing as how thing had played out, the old man slightly sucked in a breath then he focused his attention in You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao. He couldn\u2019t help his surprised expression. He could tell the youth was a level nine Mage but not the man. He couldn\u2019t see through him.</p><br/><p>Another elder also took notice of this point. He originally intended to take him down but now he dared not act rashly. In retrospect, the man moved so quickly they didn\u2019t even have time to react. It was safe to conclude that his power was above theirs.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys staring at? Do something now!\u201d Wu Cheng didn\u2019t understand what they were thinking. Seeing as they just stood there and did nothing, he got mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Wu, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want to attack. That guy\u2019s power level is above us. Even if the both of us joined hands we may not exactly win.\u201d The elder laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>They wanted to reach a compromise and settle things peacefully, but young master Wu had already said publicly that he wanted to avenge his buddy.</p><br/><p>Wu Cheng\u2019s face flashed green and white. A powerhouse stronger than the two elders\u2026 he could only be a high level Emperor or a Divine level powerhouse. If it was the former, than it was still alright since the ShuangYu casino had Divine level powerhouses to take care of him. However, if it was the latter, then it would be troublesome. They couldn\u2019t afford to offend him.</p><br/><p>As the son of the casino manager, Wu Cheng had seen all kinds of people. He might be bossy and domineering but he wasn\u2019t blind. Had AnQiao not told him that there were only two people who weren\u2019t that strong, he wouldn\u2019t have messed with random powerhouses for his sake. Seeing as he received the wrong information, he couldn\u2019t help but be miffed and blamed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis seems like a misunderstanding. How about we stop here, what do the two of you think?\u201d The elder noticed young master Wu\u2019s attitude had softened and he knew that Wu Cheng had already let today\u2019s event go. This was the part he admired about Wu Cheng. He knew when to let go.</p><br/><p>The surrounding started to buzz with whispers. This was the first time they saw Wu Cheng get beaten and instead of retaliating he offered the olive branch.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the fist was the way to go!</p><br/><p>Thinking that they would have a \u2018vicious battle\u2019, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t expect it would end like that. He wasn\u2019t an unreasonable person. If they could have one less enemy, the better. Furthermore, there wasn\u2019t any animosity between him and Wu Cheng. It was pointless and not worth it to become enemies because of the other man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen so be it.\u201d Just as they were about to leave, You XiaoMo suddenly took out a jade bottle with a snow-white magic pill and threw it to Wu Cheng. \u201cThis is for internal injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Cheng accepted it dazedly and when he saw the magic pill rolling around in the bottle, his expression became weird.</p><br/><p>In his daze, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had already left.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Wu, this is a level nine Mortal pill?\u201d The elder spoke in a slightly excited voice.</p><br/><p>Wu Cheng acknowledged with a complicated look on his face.</p><br/><p>The Mortal Pill was evolved from the Bone Growth Pill, the latter being a level six magic pill which allowed one to grow out new limbs. The Mortal Pill worked on the same basis but at a more advanced level. It could heal both internal and external injuries. As long as the head of the person wasn\u2019t blown off, he could recover from any injury no matter how serious it was. It also didn\u2019t have any effect on one\u2019s power, and if the opportunity could even have a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>This was good stuff! Not every level nine Mage could refine it and it was extremely demanding on the Mage.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Wu, judging the quality of this magic pill, it seems like a high grade magic pill. Looks like that person really wants to bury the hatchet and reconcile.\u201d The other elder sighed as he said this.</p><br/><p>At his mention, Wu Cheng only realised that point. The price of a high grade magic pill was not something that a middle grade or low grade could compare. Saving this thing for future use would definitely be his life saving straw.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Wu, this Mortal Pill\u2026\u201d The elder looked like he wanted to say something but paused when he looked at the magic pill in his hand.</p><br/><p>Wu Cheng immediately brought it close to himself and glared, \u201cWhat? It\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elder choked. Wu Cheng had a conflicted expression on his face and now it changed so quickly. However, judging from Wu Cheng\u2019s expression that he saw, after this incident he probably wouldn\u2019t offend that brat anymore.</p><br/><p>Although they lost one contact that allowed them to establish connections with the Mage Guild, they couldn\u2019t let that brat who was up to no good lead their young master astray. Their young master was still good in nature.</p><br/><p>The two elders exchanged looks with one another. They didn\u2019t think they could benefit from their misfortunes. Maybe the youth You XiaoHa was really young master Wu\u2019s lucky star, who knew.</p><br/><p>While they were feeling all sentimental, You XiaoMo was secretly laughing.</p><br/><p>He purposely gave him the Mortal Pill because he could tell that a person who was willing to immediately stand up for his bullied buddy probably wasn\u2019t a heinous person. Furthermore, even though he came across as furious throughout the confrontation, there were still traces of reasonable thought in his eyes.</p><br/><p>This kind of person definitely wasn\u2019t the idiot AnQiao was, so he used the magic pill to rattle his state of mind. The next time they met, he probably wouldn\u2019t treat them with any hostility.</p><br/><p>And last but not least was AnQiao. If he discovered his best friend actually thought well of them, how would he be feeling?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao found You XiaoMo laughing stupidly from time to time and he knew he was itching to get teased. He quickened his pace to return to their room and threw You XiaoMo on the bed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolled toward the inner side of the bed and climbed back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you do\u2026\u201d He raised his head to ask, only to see Ling Xiao stripping his clothes off. He then quickly crawled back to the inner side of the bed.</p><br/><p>While he didn\u2019t finish his sentence, Ling Xiao still raised his eyes to look at him with his eyes dark.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo understood the painful message behind that look that made his balls hurt\u2014 I want to sleep with you! That\u2019s why knowing the other party too well wasn\u2019t always a good thing. He honestly didn\u2019t know which fragile nerve he hit. Please tell me, I\u2019ll change alright?</p><br/><p>A shirtless Ling Xiao walked over towards him and dragged him out by the foot. He had You XiaoMo pressed under him and just as he was about to protest, Ling Xiao held his chin slightly forcefully in his hand and sealed his lips.</p><br/><p>The soft and tender You XiaoMo wanted to protest that it hurt.</p><br/><p>He could only moan into the kiss as he felt his body was touched all over. A pair of pervy hands roamed across his body and tore his clothes open, easily making him more naked than Ling Xiao. Before he could even react, both his legs were lifted onto Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulders. Without even doing foreplay, You XiaoMo could feel his lower half being stretched open as a hot, stiff cock buried itself completely in him. You XiaoMo fumed and he kept slapping Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder. It was going to be the death of him!</p><br/><p>And so, the bed started to creak as it rocked\u2026 composing a melody that mourned for that person on the bed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

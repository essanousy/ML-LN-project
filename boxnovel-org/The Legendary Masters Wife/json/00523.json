Normally no one was allowed to enter without his permission, if he caught someone doing so, the culprit would have to face a punishment of several years without a single magic pill.</p><br/><p>Tian Xiu was a level three rainbow mage, his strength was one of the very best among TianGou. Plus, he also held the lifeline of everyone, so very few members dared to touch his reverse scale.</p><br/><p>t/n: touch one\u2019s reverse scale = rubbing someone off, provoke.</p><br/><p>However, the Leisure pavillion was intruded by two people, one black and one white, similar to Tian Ming and Tian Hen. They were Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>After sneaking in, You XiaoMo waved his hand toward the direction of the door, the two Golden Winged Insects wittingly flew to the top of his head. He had called them because the Leisure Pavillion had a restriction barrier cast outside it\u2019s walls.</p><br/><p>With Ling Xiao\u2019s level, he could break Tian Xiu\u2019s Restriction barrier easily, but that would cause too much disturbance and would also likely expose them to TianGou\u2019s men, luckily they had the Golden Winged Insects who were experts in chewing through restriction barriers.</p><br/><p>Leisure Pavillion consisted of three parts, the living room, the Pill Refining room and the Study room in that respective order.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo directly passed the Living room and walked forward to the Pill Refining room on the left. The Pill Refining room was luxuriously furnished, with a big cauldron placed in the middle of the room. However, compared to the cauldron inside the Pill Refining room of his geezer shifu, this one was a bit smaller, but the cauldron was decorated with sparkling gems, a very opulent and fancy touch.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the master of the Pill Refining room had OCD or some sorts, because every magic pill from level one to ten were all present. As for the rainbow magic pills, there were no sight of it. It might not have been placed in the Pill Refining room, since it would attract robber.</p><br/><p>The jade cabinets on the opposite were similar looking, but were used to put magic herbs. The arrangement of the magic herbs was different from the magic pills. It might have been due to space saving, because some of those magic herbs with lesser amounts were directly combined into a bundle of magic herbs by their master, so that when that master needed to refine the pills, the person could directly use that bundle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, so awesome, I want to have a Pill Refining and study room like this some time in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was envious; he went to see the study room, and it was extremely spacious and magnificent. Except the front wall with the main door, the three other walls were all being hidden by the towering bookshelves filled with a variety of books, and they weren\u2019t specifically just related to pill refining.</p><br/><p>Leisure Pavillion was his ideal place.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want it?\u201d Ling Xiao walked over, even he felt the master of Leisure Pavillion had a good taste.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately nodded; he had been longing for one like this even in his dreams. But what could they do since even until this day, they still didn\u2019t have a fixed location. So a study room or a pill refining room was still just a dream.</p><br/><p>Even though he could make one inside his dimension, and it would be a perfectly safe spot as well, the feeling wasn\u2019t the same. It felt a bit unrealistic.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll build one for you when we find a place to settle down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we have a place like that?\u201d You XiaoMo sincerely doubted this. There were too many troubles after them, it was simply impossible for them to build their own home. Even if they did manage to, if one day the Vermillion Blood Clan came to their doorstep and blew away his Pill Refining room to pieces, he would surely die from a broken heart.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao firmly stated, \u201cThere will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at him with doubt. In fact, he felt that the Weeping Ghost Shore was a good region. With the Ghost Tomb Mountain Ranges as a natural barrier, ordinary people could never find the Weeping Ghost Shore.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you say, where would be a perfect place to settle down?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Jing.\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t even hesitate a little bit. \u201cNot only does Xi Jing have many natural barriers, many events are bound to happen in Xi Jing in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA pavilion near the water, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>t/n: using one\u2019s proximity to the powerful to obtain favor</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, can this sentence be used in that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said yes then yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked around the Pill Refining room. He didn\u2019t pay much attention to the magic pills because what the master had, he had as well. Even if he didn\u2019t have it, he still wasn\u2019t interested. The only thing that fascinated him was the transcendent level magic herbs, the master had a cabinet full of them, You XiaoMo was really jealous.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, do you think I can \u2018hold\u2019 a bit of some of those transcendent magic herbs?\u201d You XiaoMo was nearly drooling for real, he couldn\u2019t hold himself back from making the suggestion.</p><br/><p>t/n: he use the word (take, hold, seize), a word with various meaning *cough</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao went silent for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t refrain from blushing, fine, he shouldn\u2019t say those words. TianGou, after all, was built by his Uncle Gu. To take their stuff on their territory would definitely leave a bad impression if he was caught.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Xiao spoke, \u201cIs \u2018a bit\u2019 enough for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201d \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t be overthinking it. If he had to ask who had the thickest face in this world, if Ling Xiao was number two, then no one would be number one.</p><br/><p>Without getting a response from You XiaoMo, Ling Xiao still walked to the magic herb cabinet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say you wanted to take a bit?\u201d Ling Xiao turned around, he saw every muscle on You XiaoMo\u2019s face twitch, his eyes couldn\u2019t help but show a hint of mockery.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cIt was just a slip of my tongue. You already know that I have asked people to help me look for transcendent level magic herbs. I\u2019m sure I will receive some news soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished his sentence, footsteps suddenly came from outside.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao immediately took You XiaoMo to hide.</p><br/><p>The footsteps stopped right outside the Leisure Pavillion, then, a familiar voice with a slight bit of arrogance talked, \u201cTian Yuan, when will Tian Xiu come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao remembered this voice, this was the voice of one of the two that fought each other back when they rested at White Bone Town, the owner of this voice was Tian Hen.</p><br/><p>Tian Yuan jeered, \u201cTian Ming only left one scratch on you, why would you need to find Tian Xiu for a recovery magic pill? Do you really want to make a big fuss over a minor issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis small wound isn\u2019t the thing I came for.\u201d Tian Hen gave him a disdainful look.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you looking for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen suddenly went silent for a few seconds, then replied, \u201cI want to ask for a rainbow level magic pill for increasing cultivation. I want to increase my strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already leveled up last month, aren\u2019t you afraid of bad consequences that come along with reckless advancement?\u201d Tian Yuan didn\u2019t understand why was he was in such a rush to increase his power, since there was a backlash for fast advancement.</p><br/><p>Tian Hen scratched his head restlessly, the him at the present moment was a bit different than the him back at that night, he said, \u201cAlthough Tian Ming forbids me to talk, but I will say to you. A few days ago when I fought with Tian Ming, we carelessly brought our fight to White Bone Town. There we met a really powerful person. Even though that person didn\u2019t make any move on us, I can feel that person\u2019s strength is above ours, even with our powers combined we are still definitely not his opponent, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yuan pondered, \u201cFor the strength to be above you and Tian Ming, there are only those old famous coots of Xi Jing, could it be that person is one of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows, I\u2019m still in a bad mood anyway.\u201d The soul training techniques that Tian Hen practiced had quite an impact on Tian Hen\u2019s personality, causing his temperaments to change quite a bit. Sometimes he would appear grumpy, otherwise gloomy, but usually he would directly show his likes and dislikes on the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you will have to wait.\u201d Tian Yuan patted his shoulder with sympathy, \u201cTian Xiu has gone out to find transcendent level magic pill recipes. If I have to guess, he might come back next month. You shouldn\u2019t break your way in, if he knows you will be skinned alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen lowered his voice and cursed. After that, their footsteps went farther and farther away.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo appeared inside the Pill Refining room again, they had heard the conversation loud and clear, Tian Xiu must be the Leisure Pavillion\u2019s master.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will be back in a month.\u201d A fire sparkled inside You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes, he looked at Ling Xiao with excitement.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised his brow, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a problem if I borrowed this Pill Refining room for a while, right?\u201d You XiaoMo calculated. It shouldn\u2019t be an unreasonable request if he only wanted to feel the feeling of refining magic pills inside a Pill Refining room, yeah? At least not when compared to stealing magic herbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Ling Xiao casually said, \u201cBut are you willing to spend a whole month here waiting just to borrow someone else\u2019s Pill Refining room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few days is enough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you first wait here for me, I will go search for Uncle Gu to see whether he is at Weeping Ghost Shore or not, and after that I will come to pick you up.\u201d Ling Xiao made a quick decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk then!\u201d You XiaoMo had prepared himself to observe the Leisure Pavillion, \u201cOne more thing, remember to search for PiQiu and the rest as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded, then he went out through the hole the Golden Winged Insects made.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo went out of the Pill Refining room. He hadn\u2019t collected enough magic herbs to refine a rainbow level first grade magic pill, thus he was afraid that if he stayed in there, his hand would start itching and conveniently take some of the transcendent level magic herbs of the owner.</p><br/><p>And so, he decided to go to the study room.</p><br/><p>The quantity of the books inside the study room were enormous, even more than what his shifu owned, from TongTian continent\u2019s history and terrain, Xi Jing\u2019s history and demon beast\u2019s races, etc, it had whatever one wished for.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave a thought and finally decided to start with Xi Jing\u2019s history.</p><br/><p>The history of Xi Jing was actually the record of demon beast\u2019s origin and development process, starting from the ancient times. It was a really long story. Turned out, demon beasts weren\u2019t the only creatures that lived there, human beings also lived in the area back then.</p><br/><p>After the great war broke out with both sides suffering a great loss, it ended with human beings withdrawing from Xi Jing.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was so enthralled he didn\u2019t notice time had passed.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ra: My kokoro went brokoro when they mentioned they want to build their own lovenest but couldn\u2019t due to too many enemies.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

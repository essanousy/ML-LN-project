As soon as he was out, he collapsed to the ground, panting.</p><br/><p>He had used up all his soul force, almost overtaxing himself. He didn\u2019t have the strength to move even a finger anymore. He was happy about being able to break the record and even lasting over thirty minutes. As for his image, he seemed to have lost most of it.</p><br/><p>Then, someone walked in front of him. You XiaoMo raised his head, panting. It was Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao bent down to help him up. If it wasn\u2019t for the audience and You XiaoMo\u2019s disapproval of such actions, he would\u2019ve picked him up directly. Though he was often rather domineering towards his lover, he would still occasionally respect his wishes.</p><br/><p>Under Ling Xiao\u2019s support, You XiaoMo stood on shaky legs. After a beat, the entire palace rang out with applause like thunder. Amongst them, BaiLi XiaoYu and Jiang XiaoFeng clapped the hardest, as if they were the ones to claim first place.</p><br/><p>The Fifth Elder stroked his beard, nodding in satisfaction. He waited until the clapping died down before stepping forwards, smiling as he said, \u201cYou XiaoMo is first place in the second competition. Since he broke the record, we will award him six points. His total is twenty. Joint second place goes to Chai Zheng and Qing Qiu, third place is Teng ZiXin, fourth is Tong YueXu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the Fifth Elder\u2019s announcements, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t prevent the excitement from showing on his face. He had finally managed to gain a stable position in the top three. He was certain that even if he didn\u2019t manage to get a high score in the third round, he could still keep his place in the top three.</p><br/><p>This result was something many people hadn\u2019t expected. Though they knew You XiaoMo would do well, they hadn\u2019t thought he would break two records in one go. One, being Teng ZiXin\u2019s record, the other being the Gravity Room\u2019s record.</p><br/><p>The Fifth Elder continued to speak, \u201cThe third round will occur in the afternoon. The place is the arena. This round will be important as well, so I hope that everyone can attend in their best state. Alright, you\u2019re all dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the competition was over, no one was preparing to stay much longer. The third round would be in the afternoon in a few hours, so the crowd dispersed bit by bit.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo left the palace with Ling Xiao\u2019s support. When they arrived at a place with less people, Ling Xiao suddenly bent down and picked him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait,\u201d You XiaoMo nervously looked around. There were few people in this area, and he breathed a sigh of relief when he didn\u2019t see BaiLi XiaoYu or Jiang XiaoFeng.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled, eyes curving, \u201cAre you that afraid of others knowing about our relationship?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shrunk a little into himself. Though he had accepted the reality of their relationship, he was still a little awkward with the idea of letting others know.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao teased the other as he walked, \u201cNo matter if its practitioners or mages, cultivation requires a free, open spirit. Only then can you become the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Having too many worries like you do now will make it harder for you to breakthrough.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo half anxiously, half doubtingly asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t tricking me, right? Is it that serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced down at him from above, asking, \u201cYou think what I said was illogical?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though he wasn\u2019t originally from this world, he had noticed, after being here for so long, that cultivation did have something to do with the state of mind. If one had a peaceful state of mind, cultivation would be quicker.</p><br/><p>After a bit of hesitation, You XiaoMo then asked, \u201cBut even if so, what do you want me to to do about it? Go and announce to everyone that we\u2019re a couple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rubbed his chin. \u201cIf you want to, I have no objections.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately stared daggers at him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao chuckled, saying, \u201cAlright, in reality, there\u2019s no need to be so drastic. In the future, just stop introducing us as friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly went red, whispering, \u201cI, I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly lowered his head, whispering into his ear in a low tone, \u201cIf it\u2019s possible, I would prefer it if you could introduce me as your husband. What say you, my dear wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s entire face flushed, stuttering at Ling Xiao, \u201cWho, who, who\u2026who the hell are you calling your wife? Don\u2019t say nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Ling Xiao\u2019s lips twitched up. \u201cIs there another apart from you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo mumbled, \u201cBut I\u2019m a guy.\u201d How could a guy be called a wife? That was a title for women.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked him over, the hint of a smile in his gaze, saying, \u201cWhy can\u2019t a guy like you be called wife? Do you think you can manage to penetrate someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eye twitched. That one word in the last sentence was a little too explicit. How Ling Xiao managed to say things like that was beyond him and not something he could keep up with. However, this was about his pride as a man, so he couldn\u2019t back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lie down, I can also\u2026 do that to you,\u201d You XiaoMo said without much confidence. He knew that with his strength, he had no way of pinning Ling Xiao down, but he had to retort; he was a man, too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go and try it out now, and see if you can \u2018do that\u2019 to me.\u201d Ling Xiao grinned and sped up as the words left his mouth.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbfounded and didn\u2019t manage to react until Ling Xiao had walked quite a distance, hurriedly saying, \u201cWait, wait, I just finished a competition, so I\u2019m exhausted. Can we do this another day?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he wanted to top Ling Xiao under these circumstances, he didn\u2019t think he had any chance of success. But, he was unwilling to let go of this opportunity.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled gently. \u201cNope! You have to hit the steel while it\u2019s hot!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt like coughing up blood. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see the anticipation in your eyes. Then, he said in defeat, \u201cThen never mind, I don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled down at him, saying, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitated again, taking a while to mull over it. In the end, he couldn\u2019t help but ask in a compromising tone, \u201cI have a competition in the afternoon, can you really not switch a day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao felt like he was injuring himself from the effort it took to hold himself back, but eventually agreed with great reluctance. You XiaoMo almost cheered, but, knowing how Ling Xiao felt, kept his joy to himself as he planned out how he would finally get to top. He hadn\u2019t realized that imagination and reality were very different yet.</p><br/><p>After returning to their building, You XiaoMo was carried up the stairs by Ling Xiao to get rest.</p><br/><p>His soul force replenished rather quickly. Barely half an hour later and it was mostly restored.</p><br/><p>After that, he went to BaiLi XiaoYu to ask after the contents of the third round.</p><br/><p>The third round was rather violent, testing the offensive capabilities of mages. Everyone would stand in one ring and fight. The last five standing would obtain points from one to five. If Teng ZiXin, Chai Zheng and the others wanted to turn the tides, they had to work hard in this round.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, You XiaoMo and the others arrived at the arena in a timely fashion. Before the competition started, You XiaoMo was rather nervous. The third round wasn\u2019t nearly as tame as the previous rounds. It was a real fight that he had to participate in personally; he couldn\u2019t use his contracted demon beasts.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but cling to Ling Xiao and ask for comfort.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cYou only need two points to assure your place in the top three.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cThen what if I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao responded, \u201cThen you can wait for your mentor to come back and deal with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo prepared to enter the stage, Qing Qiu suddenly came to stand in front of him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo watched her cautiously. He hadn\u2019t forgotten what Jiang XiaoFeng said that morning. If it was true, he really wasn\u2019t sure how to face her. Should he just reject her directly? But she might not be into him like that. If he didn\u2019t reject her, then Ling Xiao\u2019s jealousy would be able to drown him.</p><br/><p>Qing Qiu said, \u201cTeng ZiXin and Chai Zheng are preparing to gang up on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cAnd?\u201d He had guessed as much.</p><br/><p>Qing Qiu twisted the strands of hair beside her neck, smiling. \u201cI rather like you. If I help you, can you give me a chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt nervous sweat beading. Jiang XiaoFeng was right. Qing Qiu really did like him. But, before he could answer, a burning gaze landed on him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave her an apologetic look, \u201cSorry, but I already have someone I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Qiu fell silent. \u201cThen that\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>She left as soon as she finished speaking, not bringing up the proposed cooperation. Seems like there was no chance for that anymore. She was rather emotional. Even if they couldn\u2019t be lovers, they could still be friends.</p><br/><p>Then, Tong YueXu walked over, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him with gratefulness.</p><br/><p>After entering the arena, Tong YueXu stood with him. Opposite them, stood Teng ZiXin, Chai Zheng and their followers. Qing Qiu also had quite a few helpers. The rest were loners. After two rounds of elimination, no more than fifty people were still present, but everyone had great ability.</p><br/><p>The Fifth Elder declared the competition to be in motion and tension immediately rose in the ring.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo saw TengZiXin and Chai Zheng look over at him simultaneously. Though he had managed to get good scores in the previous two rounds, the third round was equally as important, as the Fifth Elder had said, because he could be overtaken by those behind him at any time.</p><br/><p>He knew, Teng ZiXin and Chai Zheng would love nothing more than to kick him out the ring right this moment.</p><br/><p>A low ringing noise erupted from the stage along with the pulse of a strong soul force from each contestant. The invisible vortex of spiritual energy was like a dragon rising from its slumber.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

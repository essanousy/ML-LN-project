After coming out from the transfiguration room, he began to lock himself in his room to digest what he had absorbed that day.</p><br/><p>Low level beast transfiguration techniques and mid level ones had a huge difference between them. The most obvious one being the length of the contents. The low level techniques only had one sentence and although it was obscure and hard to understand, as long as one was skilled enough and familiar with it, one could easily grasp it. Where as for the mid level techniques, it had two to three sentences and every sentence was a step.</p><br/><p>One day\u2019s time was simply not enough, that was why everyone tried to forcibly memorise everything they saw at the beginning before reorganising and learning what they gathered after they exited.</p><br/><p>The Beast Transfiguration Technique that You XiaoMo chose was related to his contract demon beast. Take for example, Lan Qiu. He was the Bird of Pride so his main attribute was flight, but attributes such as attack and defence were the ones that had special attention. Flight was important but ultimately You XiaoMo felt that attack and defence were even more so. Furthermore, Lan Qiu\u2019s power was the strongest among all his contract beasts.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ran through the information in his head before he finally finalised a few of the transfiguration techniques.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t really understand why people were doing this. The contract demon beasts were already capable of self-awareness, so why were mages doing something unnecessary by controlling them? He wanted to ask since a long time ago, but he kept forgetting. Now that Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t around, he had no one to ask.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked out of the room. He heard that every floor had a place that was similar to a library and there were many books in there. With the thought in mind, You XiaoMo\u2019s mood vastly improved.</p><br/><p>He was about to round the corner when a hand suddenly covered his mouth and dragged him backwards.You XiaoMo was so shocked and just when he was about to struggle, he suddenly realised that the person holding him back had a familiar presence. Turning his head around, he saw Yan Hui\u2019s awkward face and he couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes at him, signalling him to move his hand away.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui quickly released him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his chin and asked not too nicely, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui gestured at him to not speak before he pointed at the bend ahead.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately pricked up his ears to listen. A few seconds later, he heard two voices talking to each other and he was astonished. The voices belonged to Qiao WuXing and TianXin whom he was familiar with.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianXin, I\u2019m speaking to you. Can you not hear me?\u201d Qiao WuXing grabbed her by the arm and forced her to turn around and face him.</p><br/><p>A hint of annoyance appeared on TianXin\u2019s beautiful face. Hearing this, she jerked his hand away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard what you said. You\u2019ve been nagging me so much these past two days my ears are going to start growing calluses. Brother WuXing, can you just leave me alone?\u201d She said loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeaving you alone is impossible. Before we entered XiaoYao Institution I promised Elder Shen to take good care of you. It\u2019s not up to you to tell me not to meddle in your affairs.\u201d Qiao WuXing forcefully pulled her back.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin went silent for a moment before she she said, \u201cIf both of us don\u2019t say anything, the old man wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTianXin, listen to me. Don\u2019t do meaningless things.\u201d Qiao WuXing tried to persuade her as patiently and earnestly as possible. He knew TianXin very well. At this point in time he knew he couldn\u2019t hurry her otherwise she might be driven to take desperate actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like him. How can this kind of feeling be considered a meaningless thing?\u201d Tian Xin waved her hands around angrily. She didn\u2019t believe a thing he said. She liked him and that was it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t like you back.\u201d Qiao WuXing put her down mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin glared at him furiously, \u201cYou are not him. How would you know that he doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing sighed. He didn\u2019t expect Tian Xin to be so persistent about this. However, he could understand her feelings. After all, this was the first person she developed feelings for. It was also because of this reason that all the more he had to put and end to her feelings. Otherwise when these feelings deepened, the fall would only be harder for her.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, he hardened his heart and said, \u201cBecause he already has someone he likes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at him. She only started to question him after a long time had passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible. From the moment I knew him till now, I haven\u2019t even seen a single female appear beside him. How can he have someone he likes? And also, how would you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing went silent, as if he didn\u2019t know how to answer her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t answer my questions right? I knew you were lying to me.\u201d Tian Xin laughed smugly.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing was utterly helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian Xin, some people have people they like who aren\u2019t necessarily women. It could also be \u2026 err, men.\u201d He nearly couldn\u2019t say the last word.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin stared at him incredulously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world is so large there are all sorts of things. If you think about it carefully you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not lying to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing was afraid that this might be too big a blow for her, but if he didn\u2019t put an end to things right now it would spiral out of control in the future. It would still be better to be ruthless at the start.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin bit down hard on her lower lip but said nothing.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing knew that his words finally got through to her and just as he was about to heave a sigh of relief, her following words left him at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand but I don\u2019t want to give up just like that. It isn\u2019t easy for me to like a person and I just started to like him. If I give up just because of this, I will never be satisfied.\u201d Tian Xin clenched her fist and said with a steely gaze, \u201cThat person isn\u2019t beside him right now and now\u2019s my chance. I will take this opportunity to make my way into his heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What if you don\u2019t succeed in the end?\u201d Qiao WuXing asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll give up on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing shook his head, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t try to stop her anymore. It was only way to make her give up completely.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Yan Hui cautiously looked at You XiaoMo\u2019s expression. Seeing that they already ended their conversation, You XiaoMo turned around and took his original path back, not showing any huge reaction from start to finish.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dYan Hui hurriedly caught up with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo my room.\u201d You XiaoMo replied without even turning back.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui smirked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you are going back to your room to wait for a pretty lady to drop by? How lucky, how does it feel to be liked by a pretty lady?\u201d</p><br/><p>At his words, You XiaoMo stopped walking and tilted his to the side to look at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what Qiao WuXing said just now? Compared to women, I may prefer men even more.\u201d You XiaoMo smiled before looking him up and down with his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui could feel the goosebumps forming on his arms and he waved his arms around frantically, \u201cNo, no, no, I don\u2019t swing that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo huffed. He walked into his room and turned around and said, \u201cOh yes, can I trouble you to tell everybody that I\u2019m going to go into closed-door training and will only be out about a month or so later? If there\u2019s anything they need me for, we\u2019ll talk when I\u2019m out. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui had something to add but You XiaoMo had already shut the door. His nose almost got caught by the door and he quickly rubbed his nose as if he felt pain.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong, who was next door, heard the commotion and he immediately peeked his head out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Hui, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui was about to answer when Tian Xin and Qiao WuXing returned. Seeing them standing outside You XiaoMo\u2019s room, Tian Xin jogged over to them and asked, \u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui saw the subject of their discussion approach and immediately smiled, \u201cYou\u2019ve come at the right time. I just happened to have something to announce to all of you. It\u2019s regarding You XiaoHa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tian Xin spared no time to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoHa just told me he is going to closed-door training and may only be out one plus month later. If you need him for anything, he said to discuss about it after he\u2019s out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile immediately left Tian Xin\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not lying to me, are you? How can he suddenly go into closed-door training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know? Probably because that man isn\u2019t here so he wanted to meditate in seclusion to pass time. Or maybe he wants to practise what he got from the Beast transfiguration room.\u201d Yan Hui shrugged.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin\u2019s expression started to turn dark. Unlike Tian Xin, Qiao WuXing wasn\u2019t as affected and he asked, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui gave him a stunned look before merrily saying, \u201cActually I\u2019m not too sure, but he looked like he was heading to the Book Chamber. For some reason, he suddenly turned back halfway and said he was going into closed-door training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing instantly understood what he was getting at.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother WuXing, he wouldn\u2019t have heard our conversation right?\u201d Tian Xin chewed on her lip.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe needs to pass through there to get to the Book Chamber. I think he must have heard it.\u201d Although his tone was regretful, in his heart he was silently thankful for this turn of event. It was such an obvious rejection that he doubted Tian Xin didn\u2019t get the message.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d Cheng XiangRong was left in a state of confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. Go back to your room.\u201d Tian Xin yelled at him frustratingly before stomping off to her room angrily and slammed the door.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong shook his head. As expected, it was difficult to deal with the Missy\u2019s tantrums.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s in a bad mood. I\u2019ll apologise on her behalf.\u201d Qiao WuXing said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Cheng XiangRong felt overwhelmed by the sudden apology and he immediately waved his hand to dismiss it.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing didn\u2019t say anything after that. Before he left, he took a look at You XiaoMo\u2019s tightly closed door. He didn\u2019t go to find Tian Xin either. He didn\u2019t have to persuade her anymore, now it was all up to her to sort herself out.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong was still terribly confused. He turned towards a beaming Yan Hui who looked like he was there for the drama and asked, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can say this is a story about two men and a woman, but it isn\u2019t a love triangle. Oh how fun this is, stuff like feelings are really the hardest to understand.\u201d Yan Hui smiled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

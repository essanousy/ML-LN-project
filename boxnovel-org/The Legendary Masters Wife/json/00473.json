Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have waited till the end. This old man is very curious. Sir Ling Mo, how about you take it out and let us have a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if the fire wasn\u2019t burning hot enough, the old man stroked his beard and continued to fan the flames.</p><br/><p>With that, everyone\u2019s attention concentrated on Ling Xiao. They were also curious about what kind of gift he was going to take out.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was also no shortage of people who were gloating.</p><br/><p>Any person with a discerning eye could tell that the Vermillion Blood Clan was deliberately picking on Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>He might be very powerful, but strength alone wasn\u2019t everything. Furthermore, with the Golden Silk Armor already gifted, if the grade of his present was too low he was sure to lose face. Although there were some things that were more precious than the Golden Silk Armor, there definitely wouldn\u2019t be many people who would be willing to take them out.</p><br/><p>This was definitely a trap set up for Ling Xiao. Regardless of whether he fell for it or not, the Vermillion Blood Clan would have achieved their goal of making him embarrass himself.</p><br/><p>Under everyone\u2019s gaze, Ling Xiao finally stood up.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a slightest change in expression on the man\u2019s handsome face. It was so calm that people began to find it strange. With Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes that seemed to have purple flames dancing in them focused on him, that elder felt a chill out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the man smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have \u2018seen\u2019 my gift to know that my gift is indeed very special. I originally intended to \u2018pass\u2019 it to Wei Bai after the banquet, but since you are so eager to see it, that\u2019s fine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having his own words used against him, the old man wore a slightly displeased look on his face. He forced out a smile and said, \u201cSir you must be joking, how can this old man have seen it? I\u2019m just curious about about the special gift that Sir has spoken of, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man then revealed a mysterious smile.</p><br/><p>The old man had a feeling of being seen through and his presence instantly diminished.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, You ZhenTian snorted coldly and put down the half empty cup that he drank from.</p><br/><p>The old man broke out in cold sweat.</p><br/><p>As the man walked in front of Wei Bai, he felt a few intense stares on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Bai, can I have a word with you in private? My present is very special and it cannot be \u2018seen\u2019 by others, please forgive me.\u201d The man opened his mouth to speak.</p><br/><p>Wei Bai hesitated for a moment.</p><br/><p>Fu CangQiong touched his head and smiled dotingly, \u201cGo ahead, you\u2019re probably curious about it too. Or do you want your master to help you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need!\u201d Wei Bai suddenly said coldly.</p><br/><p>After he spoke, Wei Bai stood up but because he got up too fast, his body swayed unsteadily.</p><br/><p>Just as Fu CangQiong was about to support him, Wei Bai steadied himself by supporting himself with the edge of the table.</p><br/><p>The man watched as Wei Bai started to pant after only taking a few steps. There was a hint of a smile in his eyes but he had no intention of helping him, despite having everyone\u2019s eyes following them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it alright here?\u201d Wei Bai stopped and turned to look at the man.</p><br/><p>The man nodded and his lips moved, \u201cMy gift only has a few words\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ling Xiao\u2019s word was passed on directly to Wei Bai, no one knew what he said. All they saw was Wei Bai\u2019s body suddenly shook vigorously and he soon became agitated, grabbing the man by his collar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d He asked in a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Fu CangQiong had seen his disciple giving such a strong response. He quickly walked over and wrapped him in his arms. Wei Bai seemed to have used up all his strength as he leaned on him with his full weight. Seeing as he had calmed down, Fu CangQiong asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Bai looked at the man and replied, \u201cNothing, I\u2019m very satisfied with his present. I hope you can stay back after the banquet ends, are you alright with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The man gave a faint smile that seemed to say that he had expected that to happen and went back to his seat.</p><br/><p>Although no one knew what exactly happened, it was the first time Wei Bai had expressed his like for his present. Furthermore, he even invited the other party to stay. This point alone was enough to make them burn with curiosity.</p><br/><p>In contrast, the Vermillion Blood Clan who had presented him with the Golden Silk Armor couldn\u2019t even compare with one sentence that he said. It was very obvious which party was the one losing face. The Vermillion Blood Clan tried to give him a hard time but ended up embarrassing themselves instead. That feeling must be terrible. Just look on You ZhenTian\u2019s face, it had already turned dark!</p><br/><p>When Ling Xiao returned, You XiaoMo hurriedly asked him, \u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people around immediately pricked their ears up to listen. Even those from the next table seemed to be prepared to eavesdrop.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guess.\u201d Ling Xiao said plainly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t get exasperated this time. He composed himself and thought for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it two words or three words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree words.\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately responded with an enlightened expression.</p><br/><p>The people at the next table instantly deflated. What\u2019s with the enlightened expression, he could at least have said it out! How would we know which three words are they if you don\u2019t say them!</p><br/><p>Of course, You XiaoMo wouldn\u2019t say it out loud. If he did, You ZhenTian would definitely notice it. Although he didn\u2019t know if You ZhenTian knew that name, the risk was too high.</p><br/><p>Opposite them, Lin HaoWu snorted lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeliberately making things mysterious!\u201d</p><br/><p>But no one cared about him.</p><br/><p>At the other table, Yin Ge took his seat beside Feng ChiYun as soon as he sat down. It was a very rude thing to do to just change seats as one wished at a banquet. A disciple of the Vermillion Blood Clan, who had originally intended to sit beside Feng ChiYun, had no choice but to pick another seat.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge lowered his eyes as he saw Feng ChiYun\u2019s stiff, puppet-like expression up close, suppressing the raging emotions that burst forth at that instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this friend\u2019s face so stiff and why does he not talk?\u201d Zhan YuXuan, who was separated from them by one person, glanced at Feng ChiYun and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>A disciple from the Vermillion Blood Clan looked at him arrogantly and said coldly, \u201cMy shidi doesn\u2019t like to talk to strangers. You don\u2019t have to concern yourselves over him.\u201d</p><br/><p>An opening was hard to come by and Zhan YuXuan wasn\u2019t ready to let this topic end just yet, so he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t mean any ill will but I feel that since he\u2019s already attending Wei Bai\u2019s birthday banquet, he should be happy. If he keeps up that stiff expression on his face, people who don\u2019t know him may think he\u2019s here to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t continue but it was enough for the other party to piece things together.</p><br/><p>As expected, the youth immediately became nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak such nonsense. The Cang Alliance isn\u2019t so petty, my shidi was born like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan rubbed his chin and smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not saying nonsense, take a look for yourself. Your shidi\u2019s expression is rigid and his eyes are dull and lacking in spirit. If I were to say so myself, if Wei Bai saw your shidi like this, I\u2019m afraid he wouldn\u2019t be pleased. I heard that Wei Bai has an eccentric temper. Furthermore, who wouldn\u2019t wish that everyone is happy at their own birthday banquet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth panicked at his words.</p><br/><p>As if that blow wasn\u2019t strong enough, Zhan YuXuan continued, \u201cI also heard that Wei Bai will come over later. Even if he doesn\u2019t come to our table, it could be the table beside ours and if he accidentally saw\u2026 hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The naive disciple of the Vermillion Blood Clan turned pale at his words. His mind was filled with horrific scenes of what would happen after the family head discovered that he had caused a huge trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do I do?\u201d The youth pleaded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only solution is that you take your shidi and leave first before they find out.\u201d Zhan YuXuan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the elder instructed me, I can\u2019t let him\u2026 uh, shidi to just leave their line of sight.\u201d The youth hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can leave for a short while and sneak back in just before the banquet ends. That elder of yours is busy speaking to other people, he shouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The youth gritted his teeth, he was still undecided and hesitant.</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan immediately urged him on, \u201cLook, Wei Bai\u2019s shixiong has come over. If he sees him and tells Wei Bai\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth raised his head to look and as expected, XiongXiao was walking in their direction. He didn\u2019t dare to hesitate any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my shidi outside to hide for a while. Please cover me, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment, everyone\u2019s attention was still on the main table and You XiaoMo\u2019s table so almost no one noticed the situation at their table. In addition, with Zhan YuXuan covering up for him, the youth easily left the banquet area with Feng ChiYun.</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan looked in the direction the two of them left and he picked up the wine cup to hide triumphant smile at the corner of his lips. As their statuses weren\u2019t prominent enough, it wouldn\u2019t raise any suspicion even if people at the same table heard their conversation.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge might be anxious and didn\u2019t want to wait anymore but for the plan to proceed smoothly, he could only suppress that impulse.</p><br/><p>The banquet had proceeded smoothly. Many people had used the excuse of toasting to get to the main table but WeiBai couldn\u2019t drink wine, so Fu CangQiong drank the wine for him.</p><br/><p>Although WeiBai didn\u2019t have any expression on his face, the crowd could tell that he was constantly looking in Ling Xiao\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t notice it. The dim sum that he previously ate had already been digested. The Cang Alliance\u2019s food was not bad, so unlike the others who ate just enough, he ate till his mouth was covered in oil and he almost abandoned his chopsticks to grab the food with his hands.</p><br/><p>As a result, he had the whole table of people staring at him.</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye shifted towards the side. He didn\u2019t know this person.</p><br/><p>When the banquet reached its second half, a third of the dishes on the table had already ended up in his stomach. However, there were also some that had their appetites whetted under his influence.</p><br/><p>For instance, the Qiao brothers.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><br/><p>t/n: A bit fun fact about the Four Ancient Beast Clan:</p><br/><p>Ji Feng of the Demon Phoenix Clan, the surname Ji() pronounce the same as Ji() in chicken.</p><br/><p>Lin HaoWu of QiLin Clan, his surname Lin( ) is the Lin from QiLin.</p><br/><p>=&gt; you can totally which fam they are from just by the surname XD</p><br/>\n</div>"}

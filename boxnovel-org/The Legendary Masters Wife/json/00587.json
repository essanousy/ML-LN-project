The \u2018how about\u2019 was just a courtesy, dragging the confused You XiaoMo away to \u2018watch a show\u2019 before the other could even nod in agreement.</p><br/><p>The actors of the play were Mo Xue and Mo Fei, as well as Xia Yin\u2019s two attendants.</p><br/><p>The two attendants led the two into a thick forest after leaving the town. The forest was devoid of human life; there didn\u2019t even seem to be a single demon beast here either. It really was a good place to kill and bury people.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue and Mo Fei didn\u2019t sense that there was anything wrong and Mo Fei was even cursing people out loudly, Xia Yin amongst them. This was a huge shock to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>In the inn, You XiaoMo had personally heard Mo Fei call out to Xia Yin with such a sweet tone. Now that Xia Yin was no longer of use, they immediately turned on her?</p><br/><p>Soon enough, he knew what the show Ling Xiao had brought him here to watch was.</p><br/><p>The two attendants suddenly stopped, one in front and the other behind, cutting off the two sisters\u2019 escape routes. Their gazes were chilling, as if looking at two corpses, and killing intent filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe holy maiden told you to escort us back to the tribe, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d No matter how thick-skulled Mo Fei was, this was killing intent thick enough for even her to sense.</p><br/><p>However, she probably thought that the two attendants didn\u2019t actually dare kill them and thus wasn\u2019t afraid at all. Mo Xue grasped Mo Fei tightly. She was the older one, after all, and after blow after blow, she was no longer as naive as before. She could see that the two attendants truly did want to kill them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t really dare to do anything to us,\u201d Mo Fei thought that what Mo Xue was expressing was rage.</p><br/><p>The two attendants unsheathed their swords.</p><br/><p>Mo Fei cried out in anger, \u201cDo you want to die? You dare to go against the holy maiden\u2019s orders? My father will know about this! I\u2019ll make sure he punishes her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe holy maiden\u2019s orders?\u201d Attendant Xiao Qiu sneered. \u201cThe order we received from the holy maiden was to kill you two sisters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Qiu, let\u2019s not waste our breath on them and deal with them quickly, so that nothing unexpected happens.\u201d The other attendant immediately raised her sword and stabbed towards Mo Fei with it, her strikes fatal.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, watching from a distance, felt his jaw drop in shock. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao helped him close his mouth and explained, uncaringly, \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? That holy maiden wants to kill Mo Xue and Mo Fei and then frame us. Plenty of people know that there\u2019s bad blood between the sisters and us. With them dead, the Guma Tribe would naturally suspect us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we have nothing against the holy maiden, so why is she trying to put the blame on our shoulders?\u201d You XiaoMo felt depressed. The women here were getting more and more intimidating.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that she doesn\u2019t have the best relationship with Mo Ma. The bad blood between us and Mo Xue was a chance, so the person she\u2019s really targeting isn\u2019t us, but Mo Ma.\u201d The corner of Ling Xiao\u2019s mouth curled up, his smile meaningful.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his head. \u201cHow did you know that the holy maiden wanted to kill Mo Xue and her sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said confidently, \u201cIn the inn, though she hid it well, I could clearly see that she had been wanting to kill them for a long time.It wasn\u2019t too hard to figure it out after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at him, deciding to forgo complimenting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if you knew, then you just brought me here to watch the sisters being killed?\u201d Shouldn\u2019t he consider You XiaoMo\u2019s feelings before dragging him out to watch gore? Though he was used to it by now, he preferred to avoid it if possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, you think I\u2019d let just anyone frame us?\u201d Surprisingly, Ling Xiao denied it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was shocked. \u201cYou want to save Mo Xue and her sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao cuffed him over the head. \u201cWhat the hell are you using your brain for all day? Did I say we were going to save them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you mean?\u201d You XiaoMo covered his head, feeling rather chagrined.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she wants to frame us, then why not be more direct and turn what we\u2019re framed for into a reality?\u201d A malicious grin spread across Ling Xiao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gaped.</p><br/><p>Ahead, the battle between the four ladies was coming to a close.</p><br/><p>Though Mo Xue had been injured, it had only destroyed her beauty and hadn\u2019t affected her skill. However, the sisters weren\u2019t as strong as the two attendants and soon fell to a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Seeing that they wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for much longer, Mo Xue suddenly took out an item.</p><br/><p>Seeing this item, the two attendants knew that this wasn\u2019t good. They had forgotten that Mo Xue and her sister were Mo Ma\u2019s daughters and were certain to have special tools they could use to save themselves when attacked. If they managed to escape and inform Mo Ma, then the holy maiden\u2019s plan would fail.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue grinned, her face becoming terrifying; the veil she was wearing had fallen off early into the fight. When Xiao Qiu charged over, she immediately activated the magic tool. The tool was something her father had specially made to help her flee from dangerous situations. It used spacial force to teleport the user instantly across a short distance. Before, when she had appeared in front of You XiaoMo, it had been through this treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, wait for me!\u201d Seeing her older sister activate the magic tool, Mo Fei hurried over, but was blocked by Xiao Qiu who managed to stab her thanks to this distraction.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue looked at her younger sister apologetically, silently saying sorry. One of them surviving would be better than if both of them died here. After she returned to the Guma Tribe, she would have her father avenge her younger sister. She let the spacial force that seeped out of the magic tool envelop her.</p><br/><p>The attendants cursed silently at the current situation, intending to charge over regardless, but that was when something strange occurred.</p><br/><p>The spacial force that enveloped Mo Xue suddenly began to thrash wildly, from gentle to violent, and Mo Xue took the brunt of the damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaahhhh!!!\u201d The violent spacial force cut through Mo Xue\u2019s flesh, blood gushing out. In under a minute, she had become nothing more than bits of gore and blood, the spacial force cutting through her like a hot knife through butter. Half an arm, a leg, half a head, and so on. The entire scene was horrifying.</p><br/><p>Everyone stared in shock.</p><br/><p>Mo Fei, originally angry at her sister for fleeing without her, began to retch in disgust.</p><br/><p>When the violent spacial energy disappeared, Mo Xue was completely dead. Once upon a time, she had a position that drew everyone\u2019s envy, and now she was no more than a pile of flesh and blood.</p><br/><p>After staring, dumbstruck, for five seconds, Xiao Qiu snapped out of her stupor and raised her sword, stabbing it through the retching Mo Fei. Though she had no idea what happened, she thanked the heavens that they were on the holy maiden\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>After killing Mo Fei, she covered some of her wounds and made some more on her own body, as if she had just fought to the death with someone, before heading back to the town.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had thrown up everything he had eaten that morning. He had eaten two bowls of tofu pudding that morning and the current scene really was too alike, making him sick.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took him back to the inn and, rather nastily, ordered a bowl of tofu pudding for him. From then on, whenever You XiaoMo saw tofu pudding, he\u2019d feel sick.</p><br/><p>In a different inn, Xia Yin had just received a report of what had occurred. For Mo Xue\u2019s death, even Xia Yin would\u2019ve never thought that it was Ling Xiao who had done it, simply treating it as a malfunction of the magic tool. However, to make the story of the attack more realistic, she had Xiao Qiu feign her death and become a different attendant before sending someone to report back to the Guma Tribe.</p><br/><p>Mo Ma was already tens of thousands of years old. Mo Xue and Mo Fei were his only daughters and he didn\u2019t have any sons, so despite these two ladies not being the best of people, he truly did love the twins. If he knew that they had been killed, he\u2019d be absolutely furious.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao prepared to enter Dong Yu again.</p><br/><p>This time, they carefully covered their tracks and went directly to the Black Canyon. They looked around the north side and, as expected, didn\u2019t find their target.</p><br/><p>With this, You XiaoMo was certain that the white tiger\u2019s right eye was at the bottom of the canyon.</p><br/><p>After making some preparations, the two jumped down the canyon.</p><br/><p>The canyon was over two kilometers long and two to three hundred meters wide. Due to the intense wind and miasma that was present, as well as the violent spacial energy even further down, most people couldn\u2019t possibly get down, so very few people knew how deep the canyon truly was.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was settled on Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulders. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that this place had been discovered, he actually would\u2019ve preferred to come down after Ling Xiao was fully recovered.</p><br/><p>A layer of flame surrounded them, and they plummeted like a shining star.</p><br/><p>They had fallen for around three thousand meters or so before You XiaoMo realized that they were at the bottom because the spacial force had disappeared, replaced by a wide, open world with blue skies, white clouds and a pleasant breeze. Did who did this think they were born yesterday?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that his IQ had been seriously underestimated.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, someone is down here. And they\u2019ve created such a massive illusion array to welcome us, too,\u201d Ling Xiao exclaimed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said in frustration, \u201cExactly! Do they think we\u2019re brainless? I can\u2019t believe they thought we wouldn\u2019t realize, how stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

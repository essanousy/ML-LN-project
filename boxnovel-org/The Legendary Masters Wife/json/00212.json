Due to the price climbing higher and higher, out of most people\u2019s budgets, all those left were a few patrons with thicker purses, still competing for the prize.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at the group of people participating in the auction \u2013 some people\u2019s faces were gaining a purple hue, while others spoke calmly as if the price was nowhere near their limit. Of the latter category there was an extravagantly-dressed young master holding a fan, with an expression of contempt indicating his absolute certainty at winning the auction.</p><br/><p>The young master raised the hand in which his fan was held, and said with a haughty tone: \u201cI bid fifty thousand for all five rooms.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished, he cast a smug look at his competitors.</p><br/><p>Even adding in his followers, there were still only three people in total. The young master obviously had no use for buying all five rooms; the move\u2019s sole purpose was to be provocative, with a generous dose of arrogance to boot.</p><br/><p>Traces of anger appeared on his competitors\u2019 expressions. One of them, the strongest-looking man, walked over with an air of silk hiding steel. \u201cYou brat, impatient for death, are you? Don\u2019t think you\u2019re so much better just because you have some gold coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young master didn\u2019t show a trace of panic, seemingly completely unaffected by the man\u2019s imposing aura and instead replied with more vigour than before: \u201cHmph, this young master just <i>has</i> more gold coins and just <i>is</i> so much better than you. What are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>A flash of fury passed over the man\u2019s face before he dropped all pretences and released his aura. The young master\u2019s strength looked no more than a Moon level six star; if he were to clash directly with the man\u2019s aura, then he\u2019d only be eating dust.</p><br/><p>However, the man didn\u2019t have the chance to confront the young master head-on. Behind him, a follower lashed out, exuding a more powerful and overbearing aura. A series of bangs sounded as the two auras clashed.</p><br/><p>The man backed away a few steps with an expression of horror. \u201cA Spiritual level warrior?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the words were out of his mouth, the surrounding people whipped around to look at the young master and his followers in shock. A Spiritual level warrior as a mere follower? This young master must be an important figure, most likely a disciple of some esteemed family out to gain life experience.</p><br/><p>With this realisation, the man, along with all the others, immediately showed fear on their faces as they regarded the young master.</p><br/><p>The Hei Yin Village has always had plenty of outsiders who passed through, but the Hei Marsh nearby was by far its most famous aspect. With its air pungent with poison gas and an abundance of monsters, the marsh had a danger level of above average, making it the perfect place for disciples to train. This is why, occasionally, one might see some fancily-dressed noble with a string of followers constantly on their heels.</p><br/><p>Regarding people like this, most wandering practitioners with neither background nor support from a powerful family chose to avoid them altogether.</p><br/><p>The man could only leave, bitterly spitting curses as he went.</p><br/><p>The young master didn\u2019t command his followers to pursue the retreating figure, instead choosing to stand in place, scoffing: \u201cOverconfident fool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bid sixty thousand for one room.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this, the young master immediately turned around. The only person who could have spoken was a boy that looked to be, at most, seventeen or eighteen years old, standing in front of his master.</p><br/><p>The one who spoke was You XiaoMo, and he especially made sure to cut in before Ling Xiao could do so. Ling Xiao tended to not hold back with his spending; although there was still at least ten million gold coins in his storage bag, there was no way of knowing how much of that they\u2019d need in the future. In order to save some money, You XiaoMo decided to take charge of their budget.</p><br/><p>In saying that, You XiaoMo also spoke up because he wasn\u2019t impressed with the young master\u2019s arrogance. Each room had more than two seats though, so he only needed one.</p><br/><p>The young master sneered, huffing: \u201cI bid one hundred thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sent the crowd that had accumulated around them into an uproar; as expected of a disciple of a powerful family, blowing money on such a petty matter so freely. A lot of people shook their heads, but still cast expectant looks at You XiaoMo in hopes of someone who could knock the young master down a few pegs.</p><br/><p>You motherfucker, You XiaoMo swore inwardly. He just wanted a room, was there a point to this skyrocketing price? The idea of waiting another three days didn\u2019t appeal him; time is money, after all, and who knows what unforeseen event might occur between now and then. Besides, this person is really asking for it with that attitude of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred and fifty thousand,\u201d You XiaoMo said, living up to the crowd\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>The young master\u2019s face darkened. \u201cTwo hundred thousand. If there\u2019s one thing I have, it\u2019s money. I dare you to keep bidding.\u201d With this, his two followers stood up, arms crossed, opening the floodgates to their auras.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pushed up his sleeves at once and jumped behind Ling Xiao, pointing at the perpetrators and furiously saying: \u201cLing Xiao, you\u2019re up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was terribly amused with You XiaoMo\u2019s antics. He had thought that You XiaoMo was going to release SheQiu or MaoQiu on them, but occasionally playing the role of bodyguard wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>To be honest, everyone had already noticed Ling Xiao\u2019s presence and assumed the young man to be his servant or something of the kind. However, they soon realised that this was not the case because what kind of servant calls his master by his name?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lightly glanced at the young master, stating bluntly, \u201cTwenty-one hundred thousand, bid more if you dare.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young master was furious but before he could retort, his follower pulled him back and spoke softly into one ear: \u201cYoung master, this person is a force to be reckoned with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some strong people dislike portraying themselves as being too overbearing, so most will keep a tight hold on their auras. It was still possible, however, to detect, so despite Ling Xiao\u2019s overall presentation, the two followers could still recognise his power. Furthermore, only the truly strong ones would dare to provoke them, knowing full well that they were Spiritual level warriors.</p><br/><p>The young master\u2019s complexion turned cold as he stared at Ling Xiao in surprise. There were as many experts in Long Xiao Dalu as there were clouds in the sky, and it was thus not impossible for them to run into someone stronger than them. However, he had never thought that he\u2019d have run into a wall here, and this, coupled with the fact that he was rather prideful, made it hard for him to back down.</p><br/><p>The followers knew that their young master was too proud to do anything, and decided to take matters into their own hands. One of them stepped forwards, fist clasped: \u201cApologies, our young master is too stubborn, please forgive us.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo peeked his head out from behind Ling Xiao, his gaze darting around. \u201cWe\u2019ll forgive you, seeing as you\u2019re so sincere. But\u2026 But you\u2019re not going to try and take our one room away, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his emphasis on the word \u2018one\u2019, the follower quickly replied, \u201cWe won\u2019t, you have our gratitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo let out a relieved sigh; as expected, it feels good to stop throwing money away. He turned to Ling Xiao and said bitterly: \u201cI\u2019d have thrown you out in front from the start if I knew it\u2019d be so effective. Then we wouldn\u2019t have spent a hundred and something thousand dollars on nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you complaining that I don\u2019t hold back with my spending?\u201d Ling Xiao replied, smiling.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him in disgust. \u201cYou spend too much anyway, what a barbaric world. Evidently, fists rule over civility here.\u201d He thought for a moment, then continued: \u201cNext time something like this happens, you can stand at the front and I\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young master and his two followers all had on expressions of indignation at how the two of them talked as if they were alone.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the flurry of activity at his auction has been brought to a close, the organiser immediately scrambled for someone to take You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao to their room. Soon, an enormous Firebird rose before them.</p><br/><p>Just like Ling Xiao said, a grown Firebird could reach heights of up to hundreds of meters, like a huge wall of flesh. On its back was a building not unlike an airplane cabin \u2013 a fantasy version of an airplane, in fact.</p><br/><p>Due to the quickly approaching departure time, crowds of ticket-holders started to board the Firebird. There were two aisles to this process; as ticket-holders of box rooms, they alone could enjoy one of the aisles. Compared to the other more supported one, this aisle was clearly more spacious.</p><br/><p>Walking through the door that was wide open, You XiaoMo could see the interior design of the cabin.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, in consideration of the Firebird\u2019s limits, the cabin was solely built out of light redwood. Various pretty trinkets and expensive jewellery were hung about the room, single-handedly transforming the space into an alluring one.</p><br/><p>The big cabin was split into two parts, and the first-class box rooms were situated beneath the Firebird\u2019s neck. There were ten box rooms available; the mid-to-lower-class rooms were spread out from the middle to tail of the Firebird, lower prices owing to the less ideal view.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, the time to depart had finally come. You XiaoMo, who was sitting inside his room, felt tremors in the floor beneath his feet. Looking out of the window, the Firebird had already spread out its two wings, which almost seemed longer than its body. Soon after, the ground was assaulted by a strong gust of wind, the Firebird propelling itself towards the clouds with breathtaking speed. It was a wonder how none of the occupants had felt so much as a bump.</p><br/><p>Gazing away from the window, You XiaoMo looked back to find Ling Xiao lying on the bed with his eyes closed in peaceful rest, and opted to not disturb him. He sat down on a vacant spot on the ground and took out his Enlightened Golden Cauldron from the dimension after a short break.</p><br/><p>He may be situated within the bottleneck, but that can\u2019t stop him from doing alchemy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

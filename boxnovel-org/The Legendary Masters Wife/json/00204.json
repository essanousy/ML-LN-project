Even though the sun had just set, the sunshine was still kind of harsh. He had just opened his eyes, but decided to close them again, he roughly guessed he must have been sleeping a whole day.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opened his mouth, his throat felt so dry as if it was being burnt, and no sound could come out of it.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even remember what time they ended last night, because someone yesterday, being quite \u201cgood-for-nothing\u201d, had passed out in the middle. But seriously, who can stay awake after being done non stop for four to six hours, if he found someone who could, he\u2019d give his admiration to that one.</p><br/><p>He only moved a little but You XiaoMo immediately felt like his whole skeleton was being torn apart. He could only hear the groaning sound coming out of it. The pain was so agonizing that he wanted to pass out again, but the most painful part of his body was the private part down there, half of the pain was coming from here, he could still feel the sensation of being stretched out.</p><br/><p>In addition, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t close his legs, the soreness came from them and it felt like he had run a marathon.</p><br/><p>When he thought of the image yesterday, being eaten inside out until complete exhaustion, You XiaoMo silently cursed Ling Xiao, that fucking worse than a beast man! Good or bad it was still his first time, and he even laid his hands on him.</p><br/><p>The door suddenly *creaked* out a sound as it opened.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at the man, continuing to curse him. What a meanie.</p><br/><p>The one who came in was none other than Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked over to the screen, he saw You XiaoMo had finally woken up. He chuckled and then walked to the table, pouring out a cup of tea before giving it to him. \u201cXiao-shidi, your mouth must be really dry, here, have a drink first.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at him, opening his mouth, like he would treat himself badly when his mouth is so dry.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao immediately brought the cup to his mouth, he drank like a thirsty animal gulping down the tea. Then Ling Xiao refilled the cup again, and You XiaoMo silently accepted it.</p><br/><p>When he had his third cup, Ling Xiao asked, \u201cStill want more?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head, \u201cNah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao put down the cup, then walked to his side and helped him by massaging the soreness away.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at him, did he think that being nice to him would lessen his anger? But he still comfortably accepted Ling Xiao\u2019s service. Ling Xiao\u2019s massaging skills surprised him a little, it felt so nice he nearly let out a moan, the soreness was reduced a lot, who could think that Ling Xiao also had this type of skill.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lowered his head, he blowed air into You XiaoMo\u2019s ear, \u201cXiao-shidi, feeling good?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo subconsciously wanted to nod, but suddenly he remembered he was still angry, so he let out a fake cough and said, \u201cFairly ok.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at his awkward expression, he almost laughed out loud, but he didn\u2019t expose him, his hands rubbed down You XiaoMo\u2019s shoulders, then his waist, then his butt,\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You XiaoMo angrily turned around.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was supposed to help him massage, and yet some <b>pig leg</b> was nearly placing his hands on his butt, anyone would know from his expression, he definitely has some evil intention.</p><br/><p><b>T/n: The pig is believed to be very perverted, pig leg = pervert hand, anyone who has read Journey to the West can notice Zhu Baije is a half pig man and a very pervert one. </b></p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed, \u201cI\u2019m helping you massage, <i>ah</i>.\u201d His two hands were still placed on his butt.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo strongly yelled at him, \u201cI don\u2019t need it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cHow can I let it be, my job right now is to make you comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched, just don\u2019t hurt me anymore then! This is good enough, and for the comfortable part, like he would believe this guy would be this kind. \u201cI said I don\u2019t need it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to slap Ling Xiao\u2019s hand away, but when he moved his back, he immediately cried out in pain, his expression distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, you cannot move right now, behave a little and let me help by massaging you.\u201d Ling Xiao used half of his body to press You XiaoMo down, making him unable to resist.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wanted to fight back, but he couldn\u2019t, but he was afraid that someone would do something out of place again. He gave it a quick thought and changed the subject, \u201cAbout that, what is the deal with Tang Fan and Tang Zhen anyway? And what the hell was that monster that suddenly appeared yesterday, did you destroy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Encountering You XiaoMo\u2019s long serie of questions, Ling Xiao\u2019s eyebrows did not even move a little. He knew that You XiaoMo wanted to change the topic, although it was so funny, he still answered. \u201cThis matter should go back a few hundred years ago, when Tang Fan was still not the Tian Xin Sect\u2019s grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hundreds of years ago, when Grandmaster Yu was still leading the Tian Xin Sect, the grandmaster wanted to be on his seat for the shortest amount of time possible.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster Yu was a very stunning figure, after he made his name known for two hundred years, he still hadn\u2019t took in any disciples.</p><br/><p>At that time, many people thought that he may not take in any disciples for another long period of time, and then out of nowhere, he took in, not one, but two disciples, and those two were the two brothers, Tang Fan and Tang Zhen.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster Yu, toward those two, held a very high hope, not only did he pass all the best soul training techniques to them, he even never forgot to give them any magic pills. Those with sharp eyes could clearly see that Grandmaster Yu was grooming them for the next grandmaster title, but the title was only for one, while there were two of them.</p><br/><p>Even though the word was like that, Grandmaster Yu only stayed on his seat for only two hundred years, lots of people knew that he was a very ambitious person, he certainly wouldn\u2019t abdicate that easily. That\u2019s why the next head election wouldn\u2019t happen for a very long time, maybe another two hundred years, or five hundred years, or maybe another thousand years was possible.</p><br/><p>But then came the situation, something happened to Grandmaster Yu, that was the incident Yang Yi had told You XiaoMo before.</p><br/><p>That was when the Tian Xin Sect and other forces were discussing about the upcoming tournament. When he was invited to attend the meeting, on the way back to the sect, he and some other disciples who had followed him, were sneakily attacked by demons. It seemed like those demons only targeted Grandmaster Yu, especially the demons with strong levels.</p><br/><p>After that Grandmaster Yu died; the Tian Xin Sect was in chaos for a long period of time.</p><br/><p>Some people said that the reason the demons could pull a sneak attack on Grandmaster Yu was because someone leaked out the information to them, because not many people knew about that meeting\u2019s time and place.</p><br/><p>But then some people thought that it was probably just a coincidence, because other forces had also been attacked by the demons. Although they were more fortunate, the casualties weren\u2019t that bad.</p><br/><p>Since there had been no evidence, this matter still remained unsolved.</p><br/><p>Later, in order to stabilize the Tian Xin Sect, Yuan Mo came out to help Tang Fan, but there were still some people that thought Grandmaster Yu\u2019s death seemed fishy.</p><br/><p>Then the actual truth was revealed, the real one who was working together with demons were the two brothers, Tang Fan and Tang Zhen, they were the ones who had leaked Grandmaster Yu\u2019s whereabouts.</p><br/><p>The reason: because they hated Grandmaster Yu, and also it was for their burning ambition.</p><br/><p>Grandmaster Yu indeed saw through their ability and talent, that was why he had taken them in, but he wanted those two to murder each other, the winner getting the grandmaster position.</p><br/><p>This was a very tempting condition, but unfortunately, Tang Fan and Tang Zhen were not like average brothers.</p><br/><p>Their parents had both died when they were young, so the two brothers had lived dependent on each other for more than ten years. Their affection towards each other was deeper than normal, that is why Tang Zhen gave up on the grandmaster seat, so that his brother could smoothly take over it.</p><br/><p>Precisely because of this, those two had conspired a plan to murder Grandmaster Yu. Probably because they had suffered a lot of hardships and witnessed countless forms of distorted nature from humans, soon their mentalities twisted as well. Then they abused their authority and used the Tian Xin Sect prison to lock away criminals into a type of purgatory.</p><br/><p>Every day there were dozens of prisoners that died in that purgatory as their flesh and blood was used to make a peerless monster. This monster was a superb one that could help them achieve their ambition to take over the Long Tian continent. In a full 200 years, both brothers collaborated from inside to outside, the older was in the light while the younger was in the dark. Since then, no one had ever found out.</p><br/><p>But this secret of Tang Fan and Tang Zhen is no longer a secret after their deaths.</p><br/><p>All the truths has been dug out by Ling Xiao and then relayed to Yuan Mo, as to how they were to deal with Tang Fan\u2019s cronies, that was Yuan Mo\u2019s problem.</p><br/><p>That monster, how it disappeared in the end, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t say anything about that to You XiaoMo, he only said two or three sentences to bypass the matter.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t care about that much, he only thought Ling Xiao must have killed it.</p><br/><p>The next day, You XiaoMo finally got out of bed.</p><br/><p>During that period, many people had come over to visit him, but most of them he was not familiar with. As to why they were visiting, the answer was obvious.</p><br/><p>A few days later, the news about Kong Wen\u2019s disappearance finally spread.</p><br/><p>At first, all the Elders and Shixiong thought that he must have had to go somewhere, but then after a few days, they still hadn\u2019t seen him come back. Without a single bit of information, people started feeling something was wrong, so they sent people out to search for him, but the result of course was nothing was found.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo heard that his seniors these past few days had been looking for Kong Wen.</p><br/><p>Because he was afraid people would find out, You XiaoMo hid inside his room and refused to take a single step outside.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, wanted to take him outside several times, but You XiaoMo was dead set on staying in bed refusing to leave. Ling Xiao couldn\u2019t forcefully carry him out, or else he would cry like a wolf hound, and so, Ling Xiao moved into his room on that same day. The bed was small so Zhou Peng suggested getting them a bigger one, but Ling Xiao refused.</p><br/><p>Compared to a big bed, he liked the smaller one more, because then You XiaoMo would have no place to hide, at night, he would automatically roll into his arms.</p><br/><p>The next day, their small house welcomed in uninvited guests.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

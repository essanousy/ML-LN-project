On a lower level realm like Earth, he was certain to stand at the very top of the pyramid. If it wasn\u2019t for You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, he might really become the ruler of Earth.</p><br/><p>As for the Li Family, they soon fell without the support of the Lycan.</p><br/><p>A once impregnable fortress, the entire Li Family collapsed in two days with the other powerhouse families all leaving them. From then on, the capital would never see hide nor hair of the Li Family amongst their powerhouse families. Their forces were divided and conquered by the other families, seperated, even the high level mage of the Li Family wasn\u2019t spared. Practically no one brought up the incident again.</p><br/><p>To You XiaoMo, these were all inconsequential.</p><br/><p>Ever since his identity had been exposed, the four members of the You Family did everything in their power to try and meet with him. He hadn\u2019t prepared himself mentally yet, so he didn\u2019t dare meet with them and thus kept dodging them.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t return to White Shark again and Johnson let them be. It wasn\u2019t like they didn\u2019t understand. However, what You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t expecting, was that he was still caught, in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 did you guys find me?\u201d A little speechless, You XiaoMo looked at You Bo, who was refusing to let go of the door, taking up the doorway. You Lu stood behind him. He didn\u2019t see Father and Mother You. Though You XiaoMo was puzzled as to how the two managed to find him, he still let out a breath of relief. At the very least he wouldn\u2019t have to face all four of them at once. He definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to handle that.</p><br/><p>You Bo sneered. \u201cNot telling.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. He looked to You Lu. You Lu was completely stoic and there was no chance of figuring out anything from his face. He should\u2019ve realized sooner that neither of his brothers were easy to deal with, one a volcano, one an iceberg. He really hoped that one day that it would cause thermal expansion and contraction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear wife, why don\u2019t you invite the guests inside?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s cheerful voice came from inside, blatantly trying to cause chaos.</p><br/><p>As soon as the words were out, You XiaoMo noticed an immediate drop in temperature. It was summer, but it felt like winter had come, gooseflesh rising on his arms. He really wanted to rub his arms.</p><br/><p>The explosive You Bo instantly scowled and said, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of blood brothers being guests. You XiaoMo, you sure have grown bold after ten years. You\u2019re trying to distance yourself from us now? Are you not planning to treat us as your family anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>You Lu, hearing this, raised an eyebrow but was too late to stop him.</p><br/><p>The awkwardness in You XiaoMo\u2019s expression vanished. He said in a self-mocking tone, \u201cThe ones who wanted to distance themselves was you, no? I\u2019m just a normal person. Didn\u2019t you guys always consider me a burden? If it wasn\u2019t for that accident ten years ago, then you\u2019d probably be contemplating on how to disappear from my life right about now and go on to live happily as a family, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the mockery on his face, You Bo\u2019s heart clenched. Though he had already prepared himself for something like this but personally hearing it made him realize he wasn\u2019t nearly as prepared as he had thought. You XiaoMo knew, as they had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoMo, it\u2019s not the way you think it is.\u201d The silent You Lu calmly gazed at him, as emotionless as always.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo noticed a hint of sorrow in his eyes. He felt like he might be seeing things. In you XiaoMo\u2019s eyes, You Lu was always so tall and strong, like their father. He was a powerful person, a man without any hint of weakness whatsoever.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear your explanations. I only believe in what I hear, what I\u2019ve seen. If you\u2019re just here to say this, then please leave. I don\u2019t have the time!\u201d You XiaoMo hardened his heart. He didn\u2019t want to forgive them so easily. He took a step back and slammed the door shut.</p><br/><p>Yet You Bo stopped him before he could. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that you have plenty of time. I can hear the game music coming from inside. If you don\u2019t want me to come and bother you every day, then meet with our parents for a talk. They\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cursed under his breath. That damn Ling Xiao. He had turned the game off!</p><br/><p>However, You Bo\u2019s words did have him hesitating. You Bo was someone who meant what he said. If he didn\u2019t agree then the other might really come and bother him every day. He couldn\u2019t flee back to the TongTian Continent now; that would be cowardly!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve booked a room at the Sky Sea Gardens. You had better come!\u201d You Bo immediately said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo clenched his fist internally. He had been played by You Bo again! The other had known he would agree, so he had planned everything, just waiting for You XiaoMo to jump into the trap. And he did!</p><br/><p>After the two left, You XiaoMo returned to the bedroom of their suite with his head hanging. Ling Xiao was helping him beat levels with his controller, his actions becoming smoother and smoother. This guy was even more like a veteran gamer than You XiaoMo, a real 21st century young adult. He was just about to speak when the other spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already guessed how that would end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With the You Family.</p><br/><p>Mother You, after finding out that You XiaoMo was willing to sit down and talk with them, was delighted. She immediately dragged her husband out shopping. She wanted to make sure she was as pretty as possible. Perhaps they\u2019d forgive her upon seeing how beautiful she was. It had to be said that You XiaoMo\u2019s habit of occasional stupidity might be from his mother.</p><br/><p>Father You had no other choice but to sacrifice himself. Though he felt that his wife was being rather naive, anything was possible considering it was You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>The time they agreed on soon arrived. Night fell on the prosperous city, the streets filling with the energy and noise of city nightlife. The pure moon hung high in the sky and the Sky Sea Gardens soon came to its peak traffic. Every single person who entered or exited Sky Sea Gardens were people of prestige.</p><br/><p>The You Family didn\u2019t like this sort of bustling atmosphere, but the food there was decent. It would definitely satisfy Xiao Mo/their son.</p><br/><p>When the time arrived, You XiaoMo and his husband Ling Xiao appeared at the main entrance to Sky Sea Gardens. Gazing upon the beautiful architecture, this was the first time he truly felt a sense of returning since coming to this realm. This was the big city, the atmosphere that was uniquely Earth. That world with cultivators everywhere had to be an illusion.</p><br/><p>After basking in the moment for a while, You XiaoMo led Ling Xiao inside, but one of the employees who had noticed them for a while, blocked their way.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

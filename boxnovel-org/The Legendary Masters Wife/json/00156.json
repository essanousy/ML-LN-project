It's a pity his control over his emotions is not as good as Tang Fan's.\n</p><br/><p>When\nYou XiaoMo showed up together with Ling Xiao, the few disciples by his\nside detected his mood. The repressed indignation and contempt is\nplainly shown, not disguised in the least.\n</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo's appearance\nis tantamount to someone throwing a bucket of dirty water in his face\nin public. Especially in front of his few disciples, making him feel\neven more loss of face. He restrains the impulse to vent his anger but\nhe can't.\n</p><br/><p>This is probably the first time someone pulls the mask\nfrom his face ever since he assumed the role as Master of Earth peak.

He never expected that his disciple would actually repay him this\nway!\n</p><br/><p>Ling\nXiao pulls You XiaoMo towards Kong Wen. He beams as he says to him,\n\"Uncle Kong, see who this is. Junior brother You's luck is really good.\nThe both of you, Master and disciple meet again, unexpected ba?\"\n</p><br/><p>Hearing\nhis words, You XiaoMo's mouth twitches. He steals a glance at Ling\nXiao. Are you purposely trying to enrage him? Wei, wei, when we go back,\nthe one that would be out of luck is me ah!\n</p><br/><p>\"Master ....... \"\n</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratches his head, not daring to look at Kong Wen. He seems to be blushing a little.\n</p><br/><p>\"En, you actually have some skill. Looks like Master underestimated you.\"\n</p><br/><p>Kong Wen gives a faintly discernible grunt and then suddenly adds some seemingly paradoxical words. It's unclear what he means.\n</p><br/><p>You\nXiaoMo doesn't know how he should respond. But there is one thing he\ncan be sure of. Kong Wen is angry. He can't help shooting a look at Ling\nXiao ------- Dude, he's angry. What should we do?\n</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\nbravely takes a firm step forward, nodding his head in agreement, \"What\nUncle Kong says is not wrong. Junior brother You's luck has come and no\none can stop it. This time, if Junior brother Zhou didn't have problems\nright at that time, Junior brother You would have no chance.\"\n</p><br/><p>Although\nhe speaks as if it really happened like that, probably only a few\nbelieve it. Because who doesn't know that Zhou Peng's relationship with\nhim is especially close. If he were to ask Zhou Peng to give his spot to\nYou XiaoMo, Zhou Peng would most probably agree, although some things\ncan't be for sure.\n</p><br/><p>But\nthere are some people that do know the truth. Such as Fang ChenLe and\nFu ZiLin. You XiaoMo already told them that he has a way to enter the\nParadise realm. Now thinking back and connecting it to this scene, the\nanswer is as clear as can be. But the two of them won't expose Ling\nXiao's words.\n</p><br/><p>Kong Wen grimaces slightly, looking at You XiaoMo\nwith a smile that is only skin deep, \"Little Seven's luck is indeed too\ngood when compared to others.\"\n</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opens and closes his\nmouth, before deciding that it would be better not to say anything. He\ncan't seem to make out Kong Wen's line of thought.\n</p><br/><p>While they are talking, the other few forces are also observing them.\n</p><br/><p>Ling\nXiao is after all quite the celebrity. Showing up at the same place as\nLuo ShuHe, there will always be a few people that will compare the both\nof them. But, Ling Xiao is very rarely seen being very close to anyone\non the outside. Seeing this suddenly, naturally, they are very curious.\n</p><br/><p>Not\nfar away, Luo ShuHe receives the signal from his father and secretly\nobserves Ling Xiao. Seeing him acting so intimately with a boyish\nbeautiful youth, a look of surprise flashes across his handsome face.\n</p><br/><p>The\nimpression he has of Lin Xiao is someone that looks as if he can get\nalong well with anyone, talking and laughing cheerfully, but is in\nactual fact someone that maintains a clear dividing line with everyone.\nThey are both the same kind of people, hiding behind a mask, so he can\ntell.\n</p><br/><p>Just like looking at Lin Xiao'a actions today, Luo ShuHe knows that he is definitely not putting on an act.\n</p><br/><p>Luo\nShuHe's lips curve upwards imperceptibly. He didn't expect that Lin\nXiao would actually announce his weakness in front of everyone. Is it\nthat he didn't think it through or he feels so sure that he can protect\nthat youth?\n</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, he suddenly very much wants to witness that scene, how would that scene unfold?\n</p><br/><p>Most\nprobably it's not just Luo ShuHe who is having these thoughts. Looking\nunaffected on the surface, many of these people are already hashing out\nschemes in their hearts.\n</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the barrier around the Paradise realm starts to act up, signaling that the barrier will soon open.\n</p><br/><p>Although\nthe barrier will open up, the time is not long. Furthermore, it will\nrestore itself automatically. So they have to first stabilize one of the\nbreaches in the barrier. But even if they manage to stabilize that\nbreach, the barrier will automatically restore itself in one month's\ntime. So they have to come out within a month or they will be locked\ninside. Whether they can come out fifty years later is not a sure thing.\n</p><br/><p>Kong Wen's status is that of a Peak Master.

But even if they manage to stabilize that\nbreach, the barrier will automatically restore itself in one month's\ntime. So they have to come out within a month or they will be locked\ninside. Whether they can come out fifty years later is not a sure thing.\n</p><br/><p>The\nones who stabilize the barrier are Tang Fan and Luo ChengYuan because\nonly Imperial level practitioners can do it. It's also because of this\nreason that TianXin sect and Qing Cheng sect get as many as forty to\nfifty slots whereas XingLuo group only has twenty or so.\n</p><br/><p>But the\nbarrier of the paradise realm is inside the Ten thousand python demon\nplain. They have to enter inside the Ten thousand python demon plain\nbefore they can do it. Luckily, years ago, several large forces secured\nan agreement with the overlord of the Ten thousand python demon plain.\nUnless the overlord of the Ten thousand python demon plain is willing to\nbear the wrath of two Imperial level practitioners, in this kind of\ncircumstance, they will not attack human practitioners unprovoked.\n</p><br/><p>Taking\nadvantage of the time when Tang Fan and Luo ChengYuan are competing\nwith each other to stabilize the barrier, You XiaoMo, in order to shake\noff the awkward atmosphere, starts speaking to Ling Xiao.\n</p><br/><p>Not long\nago, he did explain about the Ten thousand python demon plain. The Ten\nthousand python demon plain can be considered the number one most\ndangerous place in the Southern region of Long Xiao continent. But it\nwas formed only three thousand years ago. It can be considered to be a\nrising power.\n</p><br/><p>Although practitioners have their ideas when it\ncomes to the Evil Heavenly Pythons, with every part of their body\nconsidered as treasures, no one dares to provoke a level nine Evil\nHeavenly Python overlord. This is how the enormous python cave came to\nbe, becoming a force that almost matches that of TianXin sect and Qing\nCheng sect.\n</p><br/><p>But what You XiaoMo doesn't understand is that since\nan alliance of several major forces would definitely be able to wipeout\nthat level nine Evil Heavenly Python, why didn't they strangle it in its\ncradle before the Ten thousand python demon plain rose to prominence?\nThis is the one point he couldn't understand even after thinking it\nthrough a hundred ways.\n</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe who is at one side seems to\nhear his bewilderment so he suddenly comes closer and says, \"Little\nbrother, these matters are recorded in the documents in the East\npavilion of the library. You didn't read about it?\"\n</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \" ....... \"\n</p><br/><p>East pavilion??? The one he frequents is the West pavilion.\n</p><br/><p>The\nagreement between the major forces and the Ten thousand python demon\nplain is already three thousand years old. It has ceased to be a secret a\nlong time ago, placed prominently in the open on the second floor of\nthe East pavilion.\n</p><br/><p>\"This matter can actually be traced back to ten thousand years ago. At that time, you were yet to be born ....... \"\n</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe laughs *ha ha* as he speaks.\n</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is rendered speechless. No need to talk about ten thousand years ago, he wasn't even 'born' a year ago ne!\n</p><br/><p>\"Ten\nthousand years ago, the relationship between practitioners and magic\nbeasts is one of hunter and prey. Practitioners are the hunters. Magic\nbeasts are the prey. There are some practitioners who in order to\nincrease their strength, or to earn coins to buy magic pills and magic\nherbs, will enter into the Doomsday forest, where magic beasts appear\nand disappear, to hunt them down wantonly. At that time, the strength of\nthe magic beasts were not as strong as they are now. So you can\nimagine, the scene where corpses of magic beasts were piled up as high\nas mountains. That was really a kind of huge profits bring about an\nexplosion of violence. However, the greed of practitioners knows no end\n....... \"\n</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe's voice gets softer and softer.\n</p><br/><p>Endless greed will be punished!\n</p><br/><p>Those few practitioners, because of greed, in the end start to target the Demon moon silver fox clan.\n</p><br/><p>The\nDemon moon silver fox can be considered Long Xiao continent's more pure\nand noble magic beasts. That's because it is rumored that they possess\nan ancient inherited bloodline. The rumor at that time is that they were\nthe ones that would have the best chance of becoming level ten and even\nlevel eleven magic beasts.\n</p><br/><p>Level eleven is equivalent to a practitioner of Divine level.\n</p><br/><p>As\na result, once this rumor spread, all the practitioners became\nfrenzied. The Demon moon silver fox clan at that time did not have\nanyone above a level nine. Their strength was rather low but they were\nstill extremely proud magic beasts, unwilling to dance for the\npractitioners, so they refused to be bonded to them.\n</p><br/><p>The result of\nrefusing is, the number of Demon moon silver foxes experienced a\nprecipitous fall from over ten thousand to just over a hundred.\n</p><br/><p>Those\nthat were captured were not forcefully bonded nor enslaved. Instead,\nthere were skinned. Even though the number of remaining Demon moon\nsilver foxes were only about a hundred, the greedy practitioners\ncontinued to hunt them down. Even if they can't bond them, they can\nstill be sold at a sky high price.\n</p><br/><p>It must be said that the blood\nof the silver fox is of great help to those practitioners of the fire\nattribute. And there's also their fur. If the fur is turned into armor,\nit can save one's life.\n</p><br/><p>The frenzied practitioners forced the\nremaining hundred or so Demon Moon silver foxes into the Chaos Demon\nPeak in the heart of the Doomsday Forest.\n</p><br/><p>At that time, the\nDoomsday Forest was far less dangerous than it is now. Those few silver\nfoxes were surrounded in Chaos Demon Peak. Just when they were about to\ngive up all hope, a miracle occurred.\n</p><br/><p>A ray of bright white light suddenly came down from the heavens, falling right on the Chaos Demon Peak.\n</p><br/><p>A\nman with unrivaled magnificent style appears from the white rays of\nlight. That man's body is bathed in a layer of white light. That layer\nof white light seems to shine out from inside his body, making his\nradiance above all others, just like a god descending to Earth, dazzling\nto the extreme.\n</p><br/><p>It is this suddenly appearing man that saved the\nclan of Demon Moon silver foxes. He also finished off the practitioners\nwho were hunting down that clan of Demon Moon silver foxes. Those people\nwere no match for that man. Not even a single one of them could get in\nmore than five moves. The Chaos Demon Peak was dyed red with blood,\nattracting countless magic beasts.\n</p><br/><p>The man's appearance allowed\nthe magic beasts to discard their status as prey, allowing them to stand\non the same level as practitioners, with some that are even higher.\nBecause from that moment on, many strong magic beasts started to emerge,\nsome with strengths strong enough to challenge practitioners.\n</p><br/><p>From\nthat time on, no force has dared to slaughter magic beasts as they wish\nbecause in the rumors among the beast clan, there is someone they call\nthe Master of the magic beasts. That person is the legendary master of\nthe magic beasts!\n</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It could hold living things, it had spiritual energy and one could plant stuff there.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked on with curiosity.</p><br/><p>However, strangely, when You ZhenTian saw the ring, he furrowed his brows. The ring reminded him of his little brother, the one he framed. When he was chosen to become the next successor of the Vermillion Blood Clan, the elders gave him a ring, the one in You XiaoMo\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t one of the authenticating objects for being the head. All he knew was that it was a token of encouragement from those old farts, supposedly it had a lot spirit gems.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian didn\u2019t know how many spirit gems were in that ring, but it probably wasn\u2019t much, most likely just those old farts\u2019 private collection. You XiaoMo then proceeded to count out the rest of the fourteen million spirit gems out from the ring and then handed over his pre-prepared magic bags, which contained one point eight billion, to the auctioneer with a wide grin, showing off his bright white teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the spirit gems are here, not even missing one. As for the three magic bags, consider it a gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>The auctioneer took a long pause before reacting.</p><br/><p>As for those waiting for a good show, they were completely dumbfounded. Why was this proceeding in such an unexpected direction, could it be that he could actually afford it?</p><br/><p>The auctioneer quickly grabbed the magic bags and opened them only to find it full of pure white spirit gems, it almost blinded him. He could swear that he had never seen so many spirit gems before!</p><br/><p>Finally, the auctioneer, who kept an unpleasant expression, smiled.</p><br/><p>The auction house was instantly filled with noise.</p><br/><p>At the seating area of the Vermillion Blood Clan, Jiang Liu, who couldn\u2019t see, quickly pinched the arm of the one beside him and ask in distress, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>That person licked his dry lips then answered, \u201cHe paid, almost one point eight billion, so many spirit gems, I don\u2019t know how he managed to get so many.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu let go of his hand and he bit his lip so hard that it started to bleed.</p><br/><p>There was quite a few who shared a similar feeling with him, they all wished for Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo\u2019s dismay.</p><br/><p>At this point, the auction, which had gone on for a day and a night, was finally over. No matter how reluctant they were, everyone had to leave.</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo packed everything and rose to leave with Ling Xiao, Ling Xiao suddenly grabbed his hand. Just as he was about to inquire, he saw the True Dragon Clan coming towards them from straight ahead.</p><br/><p>The one who attended the auction as the True Dragon Clan\u2019s representative was Long TaiBai and his great uncle, Long Ao. As You XiaoMo remembered, they had nothing to do with the True Dragon Clan.</p><br/><p>Long Ao made his introduction and then went straight to the point, \u201cYou fellow, I want to ask you a favor, I hope you can agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head, embarrassed. It was the first time he had met such a respectful and sincere old man. So, maybe the Four Ancient Beast Clans were not as prideful and disrespectful as the people of the TongTian Continent believed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the request?\u201d The one who replied was Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Long Ao said, \u201cWithin that batch of magic herbs you bid for, was coincidently one we were looking for. I know it\u2019s unreasonable, but that magic herb is very important to us, I hope you would be willing to part with it. We will buy it at doubled the market price. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t respond, since he didn\u2019t know much about magic herbs.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t agree instantly either, \u201cWhich stalk are you looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had more than two, giving one away to the True Dragon Clan was fine too.</p><br/><p>Long Ao immediately replied with a name.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo recalled that he did see it at the auction, it was a matured mid-grade magic herb, pretty good quality too.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, that herb he only had the one he just got from the auction. Of course, it\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t have it in his dimension, it\u2019s just that it was still in the fields.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he started to furrowed his brows, Long Ao knew it wasn\u2019t likely to happen and couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit disappointed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d But just when he thought that, You XiaoMo suddenly agreed. He could always find magic herbs but one couldn\u2019t find a favor from the True Dragon Clan everywhere.</p><br/><p>Immediately Long Ao beamed with joy, as he was already a frank person, he said happily, \u201cYou fellow, thank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his hand and smiled, \u201cNo need to thank me. Also, you don\u2019t need to pay double the market price either, just the normal price is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was a simple exchange, he knew that the True Dragon Clan would remember this favor. It was a deal with no downsides.</p><br/><p>Long Ao agreed after a few words of symbolic refusal.</p><br/><p>They left the auction house after their transaction. The exit was the same as the entrance.</p><br/><p>They went out with Fu CangQiong and Wei Bai. The Cang Alliance didn\u2019t bid for much here, but that wasn\u2019t surprising since they also held auctions. In terms of strength, the Black Spider wasn\u2019t as good as the Cang Alliance. But, Fu CangQiong did take one of the final items and that was a pill recipe. No one would reject more of those.</p><br/><p>Just as they walked out of the underground auction, everyone keenly realized that the atmosphere outside was strange.</p><br/><p>The ones who should have already left were all at the entrance, like You ZhenTian, the Qilin Clan and the Demon Phoenix Clan. Even though they weren\u2019t standing together, one could tell it wasn\u2019t for something good.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo leaned towards Ling Xiao and whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied calmly, \u201cAbout catching you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo returned, \u201cThen it\u2019s also about catching you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Bai didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at their conversation. It was clear that the Vermillion Blood Clan was after them, but they still had the time to bicker? He didn\u2019t know what to say, but at least he finally knew why Shifu wanted him as a disciple. This kind of personality was right up his alley.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ZhenTian, what are you trying to do here? Could it be that you\u2019re embarrassed about not getting what you wanted and that turned to anger, so you are here to steal it?\u201d Fu CangQiong said with a fake smile as he pulled his little disciple behind him. You ZhenTian pretty much blocked the whole exit.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian had his hands behind his back and kept an extremely serious, as well as stern, expression. He only took at look at Fu CangQiong when he talked, \u201cFu CangQiong, this is the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s \u2018family matters\u2019. It has nothing to do with you, so you better not intervene.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was shaken. There wasn\u2019t even a procedure to accept his origins, when did he become family to You ZhenTian? Don\u2019t say something so terrifying!</p><br/><p>To comfort him, Ling Xiao patted his shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so surprised, some people are just so thick skinned. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, it had nothing to do with face, he was mostly thinking about the issue of seniority.</p><br/><p>In the ancient times, the You Family had a distinction between the main family and the side family. Although the side family had a bit of the You Family\u2019s bloodline in them, strictly speaking, they were more servants of the main family.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that even though his body was from the side family, he was still considered to be from the main family, otherwise he couldn\u2019t have inherited the dimension. With that in mind, then all of the Vermillion Blood Clan were his servants. Haha, this couldn\u2019t be more beautiful!</p><br/><p>The more he thought of it, the more excited he was, to the point that he couldn\u2019t help but start laughing stupidly.</p><br/><p>Then he was hit by Ling Xiao on the head.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted his head to accuse him, but he suddenly realized that the atmosphere was somewhat strange. Why was everyone looking at him like a weirdo?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy were you laughing like an idiot?\u201d Ling Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opened his mouth but he felt that it wasn\u2019t the time to say it and thus, shook his head, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t ask further.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, You ZhenTian couldn\u2019t have had a darker expression. As he was talking about something serious, the other party was laughing along as if he didn\u2019t exist. Clearly, they were looking down on him.</p><br/><p>It was then when a mocking voice appeared before You ZhenTian was about to blow up in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ZhenTian, do you still want face? How\u2019s your mouth so stinky, even from this far I could smell your breath. Could it be you just drank sewage water?\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian paused for a moment as he heard such a familiar voice, but in the next he was fuming with anger. With an aggravated expression, he stared at the direction where the voice was coming from, as he shouted, gritting his teeth, \u201cYou JunQi! You dare appear!\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi stopped hiding, he wasn\u2019t going to let anyone slander his son. He was also a Sacred Realm expert like You ZhenTian, he just didn\u2019t want to see him before, it wasn\u2019t that he was scared.</p><br/><p>All the crowd saw was a man wearing white, slowly and methodically walking towards them. It was another member of the Vermillion Blood Clan but not many knew of You JunQi.</p><br/><p>You JunQi was very lazy in his youth, then when he was fleeing, he went to other planes. It wasn\u2019t long after he returned that he was locked in the Forbidden zone, therefore, there was only a handful of people who knew that there was another Sacred Realm practitioner in the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>However, You JunQi wasn\u2019t as strong as before.</p><br/><p>Once You ZhenTian locked him in the Forbidden zone, his cultivation base was tampered with, so that it began dropping every year. Even though it was much better now, he could never return to his peak state.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ZhenTian, I don\u2019t know where you got your confidence from to say such a thing. I didn\u2019t even fuss about you stealing away my position as the head before, but now you\u2019re coveting my son\u2019s stuff? I feel ashamed for you, being a head like this. Can you feel some embarrassment?\u201d You JunQi sighed.</p><br/><p>He always knew that You ZhenTian was an asshole. In his eyes, brotherly feelings were just a facade, thus he could unabashedly hurt his little brother and nephew. But, he didn\u2019t think he was this amazing, turning the facts upside down, calling the black white without missing a beat. His expression was that of one where the child didn\u2019t live up to one\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>However, the crowd didn\u2019t have time ponder over such things. They were all shocked by his statement about the position as the head. Only a few knew the truth of how You ZhenTian got his position. For many, hearing that it was stolen was quick a shock. They became even more interested in their relationship.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian let out cold snort, \u201cDon\u2019t blame someone else for your failures. I\u2019m saying this now, your son must come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to take my son, then you better pass me first.\u201d You JunQi\u2019s eyes turned cold and the whole atmosphere around him turned swift and fierce. Drastically different from his usual laid backness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d You ZhenTian said with disdain. Maybe others didn\u2019t know of You JunQi\u2019s condition but he did. Maybe the old You JunQi could hold his own against him, but now? He could kill him with a finger.</p><br/><p>Fu CangQiong walked forward, and was about to open his mouth when, on the other side, Ji He suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>With a fierce expression, he said, \u201cAlliance head, since it\u2019s their \u2018family matters\u2019, I think it\u2019s better if you weren\u2019t involved. If you must, then I wouldn\u2019t mind have having a chat with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ji YunLang didn\u2019t say anything before, Ji He always held a grudge about Ji YunLang\u2019s legs being ruined. Of course he wasn\u2019t going to let Fu CangQiong help them.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because he and You ZhenTian came to an agreement that they dared to stop them here. If they let You XiaoMo get away this time, then it would be hard to find them again.</p><br/><p>\u201cJi He, when did you start butting into other people\u2019s business?\u201d Xuan Zheng suddenly walked forward, he and the baby turtle\u2019s great-grandfather were of the same bloodline. He had already heard about You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao saving the baby turtle\u2019s life. The baby turtle\u2019s great-grandfather had told him to help them out when needed.</p><br/><p>Ji He furrowed his brows, \u201cXuan Zheng, this has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Zheng smiled, \u201cThey are benefactors of the Black Turtle Clan. If our benefactor\u2019s in trouble, we, the Black Turtle Clan cannot stand by and watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>It looked as if You XiaoMo\u2019s side\u2019s got the upper hand, but there was still the Qilin Clan eyeing with hostility.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

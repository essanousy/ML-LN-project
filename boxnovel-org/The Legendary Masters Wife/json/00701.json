Several flashes of lightning would occasionally flash through the dark clouds, and the thunder made it seem as if a heavy rain was about to fall. The people of White Bone Town were already used to seeing this.</p><br/><p>Within this past year, they had already witnessed the dark thunderclouds at least ten times before. Every time it was extremely impressive and they could essentially see it and hear it even from the very edge of the Ghost Tomb Mountain Range. At the beginning, everyone made a huge fuss about it and almost believed that the world was ending, but after it appeared two or three times in a single month, they all calmed down.</p><br/><p>If some outsider grew alarmed over it, the citizens of White Bone Town would even look down on them. After that, many people knew that the people of White Bone Town all liked to look down on outsiders\u2019 panic. As a result, when more outsiders came across this kind of situation, they didn\u2019t dare to make it too obvious. Right now, when they saw the dark clouds again, everyone merely glanced at it before continuing whatever they were busy with. Very few people cared enough to take a second glance.</p><br/><p>However, the other people weren\u2019t calm. From the moment the dark clouds started to gather above Ghost Tomb Mountain Range, Lin Ming was so startled that he jumped, his expression both shocked and happy, but still a little worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis aura, could it be that Xiao-er is about to advance?\u201d Lin Gu stood up with surprise. Even though he had never experienced this kind of situation when advancing, he could still tell that it was definitely someone strong who was about to advance. Furthermore, this aura was much more powerful than he had imagined, powerful to the point of being beyond reasonable limits.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming frowned. \u201cIt seems so, but it feels as if there\u2019s something extra.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gu looked worried. \u201cWhat\u2019s extra? Haven\u2019t you already experienced it before? Will something happen to Xiao-er this time while advancing? Aren\u2019t these dark clouds a little bit too excessive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also think it\u2019s strange. Back then, when I advanced into seven stars, it wasn\u2019t this odd. I keep feeling as if there\u2019s something extra in the dark clouds above us!\u201d Lin Ming also remained perplexed.</p><br/><p>When Lin Gu saw that he couldn\u2019t pinpoint why, he simply turned and left.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming hastily pulled him to a stop. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gu didn\u2019t even look back when he responded, \u201cI\u2019m going over to the palace to take a look, or else I won\u2019t feel at ease.\u201d Last time when Lin Ming\u2019s son was in secluded cultivation, it was almost fatal. This time, no matter what he couldn\u2019t just sit and do nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d Lin Ming forcefully rejected him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lin Gu looked back and stared at him, a trace of stubbornness and obstinate appearing on his refined face.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming felt his heartstrings tug with his stare. It had been a very long time since he had last seen Lin Gu look like this, and it made his heart itch. The lines of his face immediately relaxed, and he chuckled. \u201cA-Gu, I know that you\u2019re very worried about Xiao-er. I\u2019m also worried about him, but you also know that in these circumstances, you can\u2019t transport anything. Even if you don\u2019t use a transport circle, by the time you hurry over there, it\u2019ll have ended.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gu knew that what he was saying was very logical, but he was still worried.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming quickly said, \u201cA-Gu, you have to believe in that damn brat. He isn\u2019t an impulsive person. I imagine that he\u2019s been preparing for this for a long time already, or else he wouldn\u2019t have chosen now to do it. Also, his wife is still at his side. With him there, there shouldn\u2019t be too many problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>If something happened to Ling Xiao, You XiaoMo definitely wouldn\u2019t just sit and watch.</p><br/><p>Finally, Lin Gu was still persuaded to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this brat chose just the right time to advance. By the time he comes out, he should be able to help us. Let\u2019s first go and discuss a little. That person already gave me the information; next I\u2019ll notify the Demon Phoenix Clan and the rest\u2026\u201d Lin Ming led Lin Gu back as he slowly started to speak with his deep and low voice, as if comforting Lin Gu\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the palace\u2019s secret room.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was currently sitting in lotus position on the stone bed, both of his eyes closed. The spiritual energy around his body fluctuated extremely violently, as if it was about to explode at any second.</p><br/><p>In the secret room next door, the same thing was happening to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Unlike what Lin Gu and Lin Ming were imagining, You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t actually keeping watch next to Ling Xiao. On the contrary, he was also advancing, but his situation wasn\u2019t any better than Ling Xiao\u2019s. Lin Gu and Lin Ming\u2019s suspicions had been correct: the reason why the dark clouds were so large, and the thunder and sound were much greater than before, was because both of them were essentially advancing simultaneously.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that they had melded their minds and were undergoing synchronous advancement. If Lin Ming knew, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have stopped Lin Gu. Instead, he would\u2019ve come over with him, but unfortunately he didn\u2019t have the ability to foresee that.</p><br/><p>However, in between the two secret chambers was You XiaoMo\u2019s Five Blessing Spirit Eye. At that moment, this Spirit Eye\u2019s rainbow spiritual energy was swiftly being absorbed by two attractions \u2013 You XiaoMo\u2019s and Ling Xiao\u2019s secret chambers. The rainbow liquid was currently diminishing at a rate visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>Two days later, the two of them finally stopped absorbing the rainbow spiritual energy. However, there was less than a tenth of the rainbow liquid left.</p><br/><p>Immediately after, the dark clouds in the sky changed, and it sounded as if the explosive thunder was resounding right next to their ears. The people in the distant White Bone Town all felt as if their ears were ringing, as thick lightning continuously smashed towards the palace, landing on the barrier, causing it to shake a few times.</p><br/><p>This was the strongest Lightning Tribulation that the people of White Bone Town had ever seen, because the Lightning Tribulation was made up entirely of Ninth Heaven Purple Lightning.</p><br/><p>There were nine levels total for Lightning Tribulation. The higher the level, the stronger the power of the Lightning Tribulation. The Ninth Heaven Purple Lightning was the most formidable of the ninth level Lightning Tribulation, besides black lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, you guys, there\u2019s a human figure up above!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cultivator\u2019s surprised cry suddenly sounded, but it was quickly muffled by the sound of thunder. However, even without his warning, everyone had already noticed it.</p><br/><p>Under the enormous thundercloud, there was a white figure wavering like a dancing mirage, its attitude leisurely and content. Every time a Ninth Heaven Purple Lightning attacked towards him, he would accept it gracefully, making everyone unable to take their eyes off of him.</p><br/><p>About three hours later, everyone finally felt their necks grow sore from looking up, and the thunderclouds weakened at last. By the time everyone let out a sigh of relief, there was another sudden huge rumble in the sky, and a silver-colored lightning sliced through the atmosphere, illuminating everyone\u2019s faces.</p><br/><p>In the next second, a bolt of black lightning struck!</p><br/><p>In Qilin Clan, ever since half a month prior, the sunny and cloudless sky had become heavy and dark, as if a gray fog had blocked the sunlight. Ever since that day, the atmosphere in the clan had become extremely stifling, and basically nobody talked.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma stood at the front of the main palace, staring at the tightly closed gates, her expression calm.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a subordinate suddenly walked out swiftly and said a few words quietly next to Zu Ma\u2019s ear. Her face quickly darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve confirmed the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It won\u2019t take long before they should start to make their move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zu Ma\u2019s expression immediately grew unreadable. \u201cAt this exact moment. It can\u2019t be that someone\u2019s leaking information from our end?\u201d</p><br/><p>The underling didn\u2019t have an answer. He didn\u2019t have the qualifications to discuss this kind of classified information.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma didn\u2019t expect him to give her a correct answer either. She mumbled to herself for a little before saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when they\u2019re going to act. Pass on my orders: tell them to prepare immediately. In addition, send out some spies to go investigate. If it\u2019s true, notify me immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Holy Maiden!\u201d After speaking, the subordinate immediately turned And left the peak with the main hall.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma\u2019s gaze transferred back to the tightly sealed main hall again. After a while, she said in a voice so quiet nobody else could hear, \u201cShaoYi, you must come out soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two days later, after investigating, the Black Spider discovered that the Demon Phoenix Clan, True Dragon Clan, and Black Turtle Clan were indeed gathering experts. Furthermore, they would attack the Qilin Clan shortly. TianGou\u2019s members were also involved.</p><br/><p>The worry in Zu Ma\u2019s heart grew even stronger. If TianGou was also involved, she knew that a certain man would most likely appear: Ling Xiao\u2019s father, Lin Ming. If he also acted, the situation would be disadvantageous for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news about ShaoYi being in secluded cultivation is concealed very well. Most people shouldn\u2019t know about it, yet the information was actually spread. There\u2019s definitely someone leaking it.\u201d Zu Ma\u2019s expression was dark as her gaze swept over the people present. Only the people here knew about ShaoYi\u2019s secluded cultivation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Holy Maiden implying that she suspects someone among us leaked out the information about Master being in secluded cultivation?\u201d Dong ChengTian, who was sitting at the second place to Zu Ma\u2019s right, felt his face grow slightly gloomy. He clearly extremely disliked that Zu Ma was suspecting them.</p><br/><p>The other people\u2019s faces were similarly unpleasant.</p><br/><p>Nobody would look happy about being suspected as a spy, because as long as the accusation was \u2018proven,\u2019 they would meet an extremely tragic ending. Traitors had also appeared in the Black Spider before. In the end, that traitor had died very miserably, because their master hadn\u2019t let him die easily.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma swept her gaze over them coolly and said, \u201cIf we can\u2019t find an answer, this is the only conclusion. You all had better pray that there isn\u2019t a spy, or you should quickly find the mole. Or else when Master comes out from secluded cultivation and learns about this, you will all be suspected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong ChengTian said, \u201cHoly Maiden, you\u2019re the only one suspecting the existence of a spy. Who here was not personally appointed and trusted by Master? Now that you\u2019re doubting us without good cause, if Master learns that you\u2019re suspecting us while we\u2019re facing a great danger, what will he think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zu Ma\u2019s face darkened slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I want to suspect you all. It\u2019s only that, coincidentally, I have no choice but to suspect you guys. I don\u2019t want this problem to remain unresolved by the time Master comes out of secluded cultivation. When that time comes, when Master lays blame, who among you dares to shoulder that responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Diao Xiong stopped them coldly. When everyone\u2019s gaze focused on him, he continued, \u201cRight now, it isn\u2019t the time to investigate whose responsibility it is. What\u2019s more important is to think of how to deal with the Demon Phoenix Clan and the other major powerhouses. According to the intelligence report, they\u2019ll reach Qilin Clan within a few days. Master is in seclusion, we have no way of retreating. We can only use Qilin Clan\u2019s terrain to defend ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlind defense most likely won\u2019t succeed. From what I\u2019m thinking, we should select a cavalry to cut them off and buy Master some time to win.\u201d Tao WenLiang spoke calmly from next to Diao Xiong. His appearance was scholarly, and he was the type who was extremely cautious.</p><br/><p>The ones sitting there were all the upper crust of the Black Spider. The least powerful was still at the one star Sacred Realm level. Even though Fang Yang, who had already been killed by Ling Xiao, wasn\u2019t the lowest one of this group, he was pretty much the bottom.</p><br/><p>Their words made Zu Ma and Dong ChengTian calm down. The presence of a spy was merely a suspicion; in reality, they had no proof at all. If they started to fight over the groundless rumor of a spy and recklessly suspected their own people, Master would definitely be furious when he found out.</p><br/><p>Finally, they decided to listen to Tao WenLiang\u2019s idea and first send out some people to intercept them, buying their master some time. If they couldn\u2019t block them, then they would withdraw. In any case, they still had the Qilin Clan. There were quite a few experts in it.</p><br/><p>However, their plans changed far more quickly than expected.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

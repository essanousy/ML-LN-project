Who was that?</p><br/><p>The question surfaced in You XiaoMo\u2019s brain, no matter how famous they were, he didn\u2019t recognize them.</p><br/><p>The man was afraid that he didn\u2019t believe him and thus test it out himself. He draped the silk cloak above his head and a second later he disappeared. When he took off the silk, he reappeared.</p><br/><p>With a face of wonder You XiaoMo said, \u201cThis seems pretty fun and interesting, let me see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man immediately handed it over.</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo took it, he pulled hard at it. It was very tough but also light. If one didn\u2019t try touching it, they wouldn\u2019t know it was actually light as a feather. Although it was good, it was not useful. When the man was testing it out, You XiaoMo purposefully used soul power to try detecting him. The results were that he could find his existence, although faint, but clearly this silk couldn\u2019t completely hide someone\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>As he was about to give it back, he had a casual look over the stand and caught sight of something blocked by a few small items. His pupils shrunk in response.</p><br/><p>Averting his eyes, You XiaoMo asked the man, \u201cWhat\u2019s the price of this silk?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man seeing his interest, perked up and responded, \u201cBecause this silk was made by master Yong He\u2026but since it\u2019s your first time here, I\u2019ll give you a discount, just two hundred spirit gems. Originally it would be five hundred.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a face of disbelief, You XiaoMo looked over and said, \u201cEven one hundred and I\u2019d still say was too expensive, and you are asking for two? I\u2019m telling you, this thing seems good but it\u2019s not very practical and it\u2019s easy to discover. I feel like you\u2019re just cheating me because I\u2019m a new face, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d The man quickly added, not thinking his greed would backfire on him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied in a slow and deliberate tone, \u201cYou here, I\u2019m actually interested in buying this silk, however your price is a little high. You know what, lets both give a little, I won\u2019t argue with you over the price, if you say two hundred, its two hundred, however, I want another thing from your stand.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished, he conveniently took something from the stand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it I take this item?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man hadn\u2019t process it at first, but when he looked at the item in front of him, his original hesitation disappeared. But he still pretended to be making a tough choice and said, \u201cThen, okay, I\u2019ll just let you have the better end of the deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave him the two hundred spirit gems, and took the item, leaving with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The man looked at their backs and finally showed a smile of complacency, he was really an idiot who thought he was clever. That silk and that felt combined was not even close to two hundred spirit gems. He didn\u2019t really think they would fall for it.</p><br/><p>The reason he accepted the deal so quickly was because of what You XiaoMo picked had little value.</p><br/><p>Speaking of You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>When they were out of the commerce district, You XiaoMo quickly took out the piece of felt.</p><br/><p>After a careful inspection, he immediately started laughing like an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d Ling Xiao asked speechless. Since the beginning his words and actions started to become weirder and weirder, his guess was that it had much to do with the felt in his hands.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved the piece of felt, \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze shifted to the felt for a few seconds before saying, \u201cThis thing, I seemed to have seen it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took out another felt from his dimension and said with triumph, \u201cLook here, aren\u2019t these two felts of the same material and the pattern is also similar?\u201d</p><br/><p>The felt he took out was a quarter of the sheepskin map they got from Wu Feng Town. At that time he was even scolded by Ling Xiao so he stopped thinking of finding the treasure from the map but still kept it. When he did, he still held a slim hope.</p><br/><p>(Reminder note: the incident took place in Wu Feng Town appear from chap 116 to 118).</p><br/><p>But now, he found something of a similar material in Tong Tian Continent and the pattern could be linked. What did this mean? It meant that what he thought was a \u2018treasure map\u2019 might actually exist.</p><br/><p>When he thought of it like this, You XiaoMo got excited, he didn\u2019t misread this, even if it wasn\u2019t a treasure map, there must be something else to it.</p><br/><p>Even Ling Xiao didn\u2019t think they would find the second piece here. Then it may be the case that You XiaoMo was right, no wonder he would buy that piece of impractical cloth, it was for this felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like this map may be from the Tong Tian Continent.\u201d Ling Xiao said stroking his chin.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded in agreement, \u201cToo bad we still need two more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cThese kinds of things can only be left to luck. With the Tong Tian Continent being this huge, if we search for it, it would be like finding a needle in the sea. Not only that, it might catch the attention of unwanted people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d You XiaoMo said, he didn\u2019t plan on forcing it anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, are we still shopping?\u201d Ling Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s just get home.\u201d You XiaoMo led him outside the market. A normal person would have kept hunting during a lucky day but he felt like a person\u2019s luck could not continue forever. What was his, would eventually be his.</p><br/><p>When the two arrived at the inn, Dao Yun wasn\u2019t back yet.</p><br/><p>Hearing them return, Duan MuQing quickly came over and brought over good news.</p><br/><p>\u201cSavior, this is the list for tomorrow\u2019s auction, please check to see if there is anything you wish for. If you do, then you can take this time to prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan MuQing handed a red booklet to You XiaoMo. Although the auction was held by the Cang Alliance, they would always give a list of items to the major forces so that they could prepare the money.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opened the booklet, there weren\u2019t a lot items up for auction, but just like Duan MuQing said, it was all because of the quality.</p><br/><p>Other than the familiar magic herbs, pills, soul training manuals, and skill training manuals, there were many priceless and rare items such as weapons and armors. All of which were good items.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s gaze kept moving downwards, but suddenly stopped at a certain point.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan MuQing\u2019s sight landed on the last auction item and he explained, \u201cThis is the Heavenly Cauldron, is the last heavy-weight item and the main event.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallowed hard before asking, \u201cWhat is the Heavenly Cauldron?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly snatched the booklet from his hand and before Duan MuQing could say anything, said, \u201cThe Tong Tian Continent has a Cauldron ranking. It has a record of every single cauldron, the higher the rank, the better the cauldron and the Heavenly Cauldron is ranked seventh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before You XiaoMo always thought that cauldrons were cauldrons, although there were good and bad ones, they weren\u2019t inherently different. However, he never thought that the Tong Tian Continent would have this ranking, they couldn\u2019t rank it on quality, right?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao knew of his bepuzzlement and explained, \u201cThe cauldrons on the ranking are different to the ones you use. The biggest difference lies in the fact that yours is of good quality, but no added benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s use the Heavenly Cauldron as example, according to the legends, the one who created it was a ancient blacksmith. At that time, many skills were not a lost art and thus when that blacksmith created the cauldron, he added a special array. That array can gather spiritual energy thus increase the chance of a pills success rate and quality. Not only that, when refining high-graded magic pills, these pills can fly out of the cauldron. The higher the level, the stronger they are, for example, a level ten and above pill even has attack power. However, the Heavenly Cauldron can trap them inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth slightly gaped open, that\u2019s such an amazing cauldron but even so it was just ranked seventh, the six above must be really amazing then.</p><br/><p>But just as he was thinking of switching cauldrons, the Heavenly Cauldron appeared before him, he couldn\u2019t let this opportunity pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to get this cauldron.\u201d You XiaoMo said enthusiastically with a fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026may be difficult.\u201d Duan MuQing saw his enthusiastic face, although he didn\u2019t want to bring him down, he still had to say something. Although his view on Ling Xiao changed in surprise, he had always thought it was their first time on the Tong Tian Continent, thus it wasn\u2019t weird of them to have never heard of the Cang Alliance. However, that man was so informative about the Cauldron ranking and of the Heavenly Cauldron, he couldn\u2019t help but be confused.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difficulty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cProbably because a lot of people want the Heavenly Cauldron, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he guessed it, Duan MuQing stopped hesitating and said, \u201cThe top ten cauldrons, no matter which one, are what all mages long for. Although I don\u2019t know why the Cang Alliance would put the Heavenly Cauldron up for auction at Tian Xiang City, but because the news had spread out already, the ones competing are not just forces of Bei Dong. Other than Bei Dong, there definitely will be others who bid for it as well, the competition would be fierce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d You XiaoMo blinked a few times.</p><br/><p>Duan MuQing choked on that expression, \u201cWhen those people appear, the price of the Heavenly Cauldron will rise to a very high number, so if saviors want to compete for it, you must quickly raise some spirit gems.\u201d</p><br/><p>But according to him, wanting to gather a large sum of spirit gems in one day is almost impossible.</p><br/><p>The second day, the auction proceeded as hoped.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even though they had considered this possibility before going here, they weren\u2019t really mentally prepared. Now, their souls were most certainly trembling because of Lin ShaoYi.</p><br/><p>This kind of feeling cannot be wrong!</p><br/><p>Black Turtle Clan had one member who experienced the ancient war and his face turned excited and his hands shook too. His stared wide eyed at that direction and murmured, \u201cThat person\u2026he\u2019s here again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although his voice was small, those nearby to him still heard it.</p><br/><p>In their hearts they all started to question, who was he?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it, hurry up and go!\u201d A True Dragon Clan practitioner charged over with a anxious expression. Even though there weren\u2019t many True Dragon Clan members here, they were all elites. If they all died here, it would be a huge blow to the True Dragon Clan.</p><br/><p>They had believed that even with the Black Spider and Qilin Clan partnering up, they could deal with it as the major forces and that includes Lin ShaoYi as well. No matter how strong he was, he was just the pinnacle of seven stars and they had a seven star as well. So it\u2019s impossible to think they couldn\u2019t deal with one Lin ShaoYi.</p><br/><p>However, this was all under the pretense that Lin ShaoYi\u2019s plan failed. As people should know, the Almighty Realm wasn\u2019t easily achieved. They just didn\u2019t think, Lin ShaoYi was lucky enough to get there at the most critical of moments.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s face turned sour. The weaker ones ran first while the strongest stayed behind. However, they still underestimated the Almighty. The first thing Lin ShaoYi did as the Almighty was to kill as a warning, and they were the unlucky ones chosen. Thus, they would become the first souls to appear by his hand.</p><br/><p>Just as they ran towards the edge of the Qilin Clan, the exit suddenly closed.</p><br/><p>The Qilin Clan\u2019s base was an dimension created by their ancestors. With Lin Ming and the other\u2019s abilities opening it wasn\u2019t hard, but also closing it was just as easy, so when they realized that no matter what they did, it wouldn\u2019t open, they finally understood the severity of the issue.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi\u2019s laughter came behind them.</p><br/><p>Everyone turned around but the Black Spider had no given chase. They had all suffered some sort of injuries, after all, they were surrounded by the seven major forces and many died. Now, they all stood below the mountain and above them, was Lin ShaoYi, who appeared as if God had descended.</p><br/><p>If the Lin ShaoYi from before was shockingly strong, then the Lin ShaoYi now made one feel suffocated, as if an invisible hand was clamped around their neck, ready to take their lives at any moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, none of you are getting away.\u201d Lin ShaoYi\u2019s voice and chuckle slowly appeared. His blood-red eyes stared at them and an invisible pressure weighted on them like a mountain. \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m the owner of all the planes, you will all live under my rule. Killing you can be done with just a thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, his hand reached forward and lighty tightening his fist, white strings appeared then turned to dust under his hand. Once he opened his fist, everything had disappeared from this world.</p><br/><p>This was the world\u2019s \u2018rule\u2019, it used to restrict them, but now, with a flick of a finger, he could pulverize these \u2018rules\u2019. This wonderful feeling of controlling everything filled him from the inside out. He couldn\u2019t help but want to sigh, this was the strength he longed for!</p><br/><p>Once he had such power, all Lin ShaoYi saw looking at Lin Ming and the others was their insignificance. It was so boring, because the him now, could use a finger and make them completely disappear.</p><br/><p>Seeing the blank looks of the people below, Lin ShaoYi laughed in mockery. All idiots who knows nothing!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo celebrate my becoming of the Almighty, I\u2019ll give you guys a chance. Bow before me, surrender yourselves to me and I\u2019ll spare your life. As for those who opposes, death!\u201d Lin ShaoYi\u2019s spiteful voice appeared in everyone\u2019s ears, it was so loud that they felt their ear drums buzzing. For a lot of them, this moment was when they realized, maybe they really lost.</p><br/><p>After he finished and a long while after, no one said anything. Even if they knew they were mostly likely going to die, no one wanted to be the one to cave.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi wasn\u2019t angry either, instead, his lips curled up and he eyed Lin Gu and Lin Ming with interest. They were the ones he wanted to deal with first, not only because they were Ling Xiao\u2019s family but because he needed to kill the strongest for the \u2018warning\u2019 to be effective.</p><br/><p>Thinking it this far, he slowly reached out his hand.</p><br/><p>Just then, a sudden loud bang could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dimension suddenly started to shake violently, as if some incredible force was attacking it from the outside. The earth shook with it and a while later, the dimension was broken through and a few stream of light charged in with intensity. In an instant they appeared before them and from the light appeared six figures.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe head, it\u2019s the head!\u201d The Demon Phoenix Clan experts shouted in surprise. Other than them, the elites of other clans all showed an expression of pleasant surprise as they stared at the figures above them.</p><br/><p>The six were, Fu CangQiong, the strongest three from the Demon Phoenix Clan, Lei Gong and Shen Old Man. However, they did not feel the happiness from being on time, but rather they stared at Lin ShaoYi with a solemn expression. From his body, they felt a terrifying power, was that the strength of the Almighty?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, instead of me going to you, you decided to come and seek your death!\u201d Lin ShaoYi looked at them and his lips curled up in joy. These were all people he wanted to kill. At first he thought of finishing things here before going to find them but now, it was more convenient this way.</p><br/><p>Fu CangQiong walked in front and stared at him with a piercing gaze, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t come to kill you, were we supposed to wait for you to come and pick us off one by one? Lin ShaoYi, let\u2019s be frank here, we all know your wish of unifying the TongTian Continent. But I\u2019m here to tell you that\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi shrugged and laughed. With an incredibly arrogant expression, he said, \u201cUnifying the TongTian Continent? Do you think I still need to? Let me tell you, I\u2019m the current ruler of all the planes, including the TongTian Continent and you guys? You are just a measly ant beneath my feet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste anymore time chit chatting, let\u2019s go at once!\u201d Xuan Zong said with a cold expression. After he said that, he turned into his original form and a massive Black Tortoise covered the sky. Those of the Black Turtle Clan rarely showed themselves, especially in their original form, almost no one had seen it before.</p><br/><p>The Demon Phoenix Clan and Dragon Clan head didn\u2019t fall behind either, with one turning into a massive Fire-red Demon Phoenix and the other a Five-Clawed Golden Dragon. The sky was almost completely covered by these three with barely a cloud in sight. An overpowering pressure slowly spread across.</p><br/><p>They must use all of their power to defeat Lin ShaoYi, the longer they dragged on, the worse it was for them. Thus, the three Emperor Beasts roared towards Lin ShaoYi from the sky and after a short while, they all used their ultimate moves. A flaming fireball, a scorching dragon\u2019s breath, a horn like soundwave\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi looked at the three Emperor Beasts in the sky and smiled mockingly. The seemingly terrifying power was nothing in front of him. If the Almighty could be defeated by a few seven stars, then it wasn\u2019t the Almighty Realm anymore. So, he simply reached out and said, \u201cFreeze, break!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just a freeze and a break, that\u2019s all it took.</p><br/><p>The three powerful moves stopped, then like glass, shattered, turning into shining dust and disappeared amongst the sky.</p><br/><p>But, that wasn\u2019t the end of it.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi lightly waved and in an instant, as if hit by a powerful blow, the three Emperor Beast\u2019s massive bodies actually went back a good distance. Not only that, all three spit out blood, and that blood, like mist, slowly fell down the sky.</p><br/><p>Everyone from the Black Spider watched with fervour, this was the power of the man they chased after! With no effort at all, he defeated the best of the Demon Phoenix Clan, the True Dragon Clan and the Black Turtle Clan, and with only one move at that! Zu Ma\u2019s eyes also sparkled. She stared at Lin ShaoYi with adoration and worship, this was the man she choose!</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the Alliance were filled with despair. They had thought that with their experts finally here, they could at least drag out Lin ShaoYi for a while, but they couldn\u2019t even last a hit. Now, they finally understood the strength of the Almighty. It was terrifying!</p><br/><p>Some wore a solemn expression, looks like death was inescapable now.</p><br/><p>Fu CangQiong, Lei Gong and Old Man Shen were all shocked, but they did not back down. The three looked at each other, then charged over in three streams of light. The Emperor Beasts who turned back to their human form, also charged over. If three wasn\u2019t enough, then six.</p><br/><p>However, they still underestimated the power of the Almighty.</p><br/><p>Controlling the \u2018rules\u2019 and becoming the ruler of everything within it, the Almighty didn\u2019t need to use spiritual energy from his body or absorb the spiritual energy from the world. Instead, like You XiaoMo\u2019s control over his dimension, with a single thought, he could make anything from that dimension appear and he could appear anywhere in his dimension.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi was the same, although he couldn\u2019t travel between planes, as long as he stood on the TongTian Continent, then he could go anywhere within it.</p><br/><p>That was one of the difference between the Almighty Realm and the Sacred Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the sky appeared the sound of power and power colliding. Under the shocking gaze of everyone else, even with the six partnering up, they weren\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>One after another they were blasted away and dropped into the mountain range below. Their power was so strong that it broke the mountain range. High above in the skies, Lin ShaoYi stood pridefully.</p><br/><p>As if sound disappeared from the world, everything felt silent.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi\u2019s indifferent gaze slowly landed on Lin Gu and Lin Ming who bore a heavy expression. Lin ShaoYi\u2019s eyes was filled with an unmistakable killing intent as he said softly, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, without giving them a chance to speak, he pointed towards their direction. The spacial energy around them suddenly went into turmoil and the space around them started to twisted, creating black spatial cracks one after another. The vast spacial energy poured out and these black holes, as if planning to devour them, opened their bloody mouth at Lin Ming and Lin Gu.</p><br/><p>Under the purposeful control of Lin ShaoYi, these spatial energies, which used to a piece of cake for Lin Ming and the others, became life threatening. There with no doubt in their minds that if they were hit, they would die. Seeing this, TianGou\u2019s members eyes went bloodshot and their expression were as if they wished to tear Lin ShaoYi apart.</p><br/><p>Feeling their hatred, Lin ShaoYi laughed, \u201cStupid people, don\u2019t worry, once I\u2019m done with your master, the next is you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished, the spacial cracks filled with spacial energy made a sizzling sound and pounded at Lin Gu and Lin Ming.</p><br/><p>Seeing as the two was about to be sucked in and teared into pieces, the menacing spatial energy and crack suddenly stopped. A second later, a power that seemed to have poured out from the ground brushed over the twisted dimension, as if by a comforting hand, it returned to its original state. The spatial energy that once filled the air instantly shrunk back into the spacial crack as if a mouse had seen a cat and disappeared.</p><br/><p>There was pure silence as a blurry figure, maybe two, appeared soundlessly above the spacial crack.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone appeared to have been strangled, the calm, high above, arrogant expression of Lin ShaoYi\u2019s finally cracked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

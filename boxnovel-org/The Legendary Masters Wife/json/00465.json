In particular, the great manor where his family lived had a patrol team passing by every five minutes.</p><br/><p>During the daytime, the old family head had brought a group of people along with him as he left Vermillion Blood City. As it was a covert operation, not many people knew about it. Ling Xiao even specially followed them for a while to ensure that they really left Vermillion Blood City.</p><br/><p>On that night, the four of them snuck into the great manor.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan hadn\u2019t been idling around these past two days in Vermillion Blood City. They lurked around the great manor and used this time to record the timing of the guards\u2019 change of shifts and their schedules. Even without the old family head overseeing the great manor, the four of them dared not let their guard down.</p><br/><p>However, the manor was too big so they decided to split into two groups after discussing.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan were one team. Ever since Yin Ge completely stimulated the Nine Headed Serpent King blood in him, his cultivation rose exponentially.</p><br/><p>Although half of him was human, his mother was also a capable person. Yin Ge more or less inherited her good traits. Furthermore, the Nine Headed Serpent King was the most receptive Emperor Beast to the Four Spirits. Their bloodline was so precious that once it was stimulated and unleashed, one\u2019s cultivation would rise at rocket speed.</p><br/><p>Today, Yin Ge was already an Emperor level seven star peak powerhouse. He was only a small step away from becoming a Divine level powerhouse but he couldn\u2019t wait anymore, so he ran out together with Zhan YuXuan before his breakthrough.</p><br/><p>As for Zhan YuXuan, his origin was more mysterious. Even his good friend Yin Ge wasn\u2019t very clear about it. Although his cultivation was currently lower than Yin Ge, self preservation wasn\u2019t an issue. If he really couldn\u2019t handle it, he could just crush a dimension talisman and leave.</p><br/><p>The structure of the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s great manor was somewhat unusual. It was divided into two levels. The lower one was almost set into the ground, becoming like an underground world. There were as many as ten entrances and while it wasn\u2019t deliberately hidden, one could miss them if they weren\u2019t careful enough.</p><br/><p>As there were many more guards on the lower level than the upper level, with more than five guards for every entrance, the lower level was left to Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo while Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan took the upper level.</p><br/><p>The underground level of the great manor was enormous. On the surface it looked liked there were only ten entrances, but there were actually many places that were hard or impossible to guard which allowed them to enter. After all, it was impossible to not let sunshine in all year round. Otherwise, it could not be called a manor.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the images reflected underwater. Although it was somewhat vague, he was certain that it was how the underground level looked. There seemed to be another pond on the other end, but how it was made, he didn\u2019t know. The water there didn\u2019t flow out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going down from here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao calculated the time, \u201cThe guards on the underground level will pass by below every ten seconds. We must swim there within this period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes went wide and he spoke in a hushed voice, \u201cIsn\u2019t ten seconds too short? This pond\u2019s depth looks like it\u2019s over twenty metres deep. And also if we make the floor wet we\u2019ll be discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t answer his question. He just pulled him along and dove.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly covered his mouth.</p><br/><p>At the same time, just beside the pond above their heads, a patrol team passed right by the pond.</p><br/><p>The underground pond was built in the garden and in the pond there was only some algae that was totally unable to hide their bodies. After coming out of the pond, the two figures immediately blended into the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>A brightly lit, exquisite pavilion stood in the middle of a flower garden in full bloom. It looked as if someone had scattered glitter over the colorful flowers, each and every one of the flowers exuded a beautiful glow. It was such a lovely scene, destroyed only by a sharp voice and the sound of porcelain falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou trash! You can\u2019t even do such a simple thing! What\u2019s the use of me keeping you lot! Get out of my sight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, two people ran out of the pavilion, only slowing down after they exited the garden.</p><br/><p>One of them sighed, \u201cThis Ninth Young Lady is really hard to please. Clearly it was her grandfather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d The other person looked around cautiously. After he was sure no one was around, he spoke. \u201cDo not casually talk about the people here. You may just lose your life. Ninth Young Lady is still a noble lady of the Vermillion Blood Clan no matter what. She\u2019s not someone we can just talk about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and go.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a black figure suddenly landed in front of them. The two of them were stunned and before they could even shout, a sudden sharp pain spread from the back of their necks. Their eyes closed and in the next second they vanished into thin air before they even fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>After putting the two people into Ling Xiao\u2019s dimension, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao hid in the rockery in the garden. You XiaoMo looked in the direction of the pavilion. This Ninth Young Lady\u2019s status didn\u2019t seem low. She was actually able to have her own beautiful pavilion to stay in. It was obvious that she most likely was a much doted on big missy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Ninth Young Lady?\u201d You XiaoMo asked out of curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s You ZhenTian\u2019s granddaughter, You Yong. She\u2019s the ninth grandchild. I heard that You ZhenTian was very fond of this granddaughter and pampered her a lot. As a result, it nurtured her condescending nature.\u201d Ling Xiao answered. He did a lot of background checks. He knew everything about the main members of the You Family, You ZhenTian and the old family head.</p><br/><p>Pfft!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t keep his laughter in when he heard You Yong\u2019s name. He couldn\u2019t believe someone was actually named You Yong, and a woman to top it off.</p><br/><p>*You Yong\u2019s name sounds the same as swimming.</p><br/><p>He laughed for a while before saying, \u201cSince she\u2019s his favorite granddaughter, she should know quite a lot of stuff right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmhmm.\u201d The corners of Ling Xiao\u2019s mouth curled upwards with a hint of a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll know after we ask her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the pavilion, You Yong was having a tantrum and throwing things around. The clean floor soon became littered with countless little fragments. Everything that she could throw in the room had been smashed.</p><br/><p>You Yong sat on a chair angrily and slapped the tabletop with her delicate hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis makes me so angry! Grandpa clearly dotes on me a lot, so why can\u2019t he let me follow?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a sound came from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d You Yong was still irritated and when she heard the knock on the door, she yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Young Lady, You Ping and You He came back again. They said they have something important to tell you.\u201d The maid\u2019s nervous and scared voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t have anything to vent my anger on. Let them in.\u201d You Yong snorted coldly. She wanted to see what important matters they had for her. If it was the same as just now, she\u2019d definitely pluck their heads off.</p><br/><p>Not long after, You Ping and You He walked in one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have anything important then say it. Don\u2019t try to test my patience.\u201d You Yong\u2019s questioning gaze swept over the both of them.</p><br/><p>You He took a step forward and hinted at the maid with a look, \u201cMiss, this matter is of great importance. No one else but you should hear of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt best be important. Otherwise you can be prepared to be skinned alive by me.\u201d You Yong gave them a warning look before having the maid leave, ordering her not to let anybody disturb them if it wasn\u2019t anything important.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment a white furball jumped from You He\u2019s body onto the tabletop beside the Ninth Young Lady. The little furball instantly got bigger and started to roll around on the tabletop. The snowy white ball of fluff looked extremely cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d You Yong was stunned for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMissy, please look at its eyes. Aren\u2019t they pretty?\u201d You He said.</p><br/><p>You Yong subconsciously did as she was told and looked at the furball\u2019s eyes. It was a pair of magical purple cat eyes that looked like they held the world\u2019s greatest mysteries in them. She was soon so entranced by them, her eyes started to lose focus and finally they became empty.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, You He gave a strange smile.</p><br/><p>The Ninth Young Lady now was completely absorbed in the illusion that the Thousand Illusions CatQiu had created. CatQiu\u2019s illusions were tailor-made according to the person the illusion was casted on. The most convenient bit was that the illusions could tease out memories from the person\u2019s brain and have her say it herself.</p><br/><p>Of course, You He was You XiaoMo, the master of the Thousand Illusions CatQiu.</p><br/><p>CatQiu\u2019s stagnant cultivation level finally had a breakthrough ever since You XiaoMo gave his contract beasts magic pills to help them promote to a higher level. Controlling other people\u2019s illusions became even easier and now he could create illusions for five people simultaneously.</p><br/><p>CatQiu drew the memory out of Ninth Young Lady\u2019s mind and conveyed the information to his owner.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo digested the information for a while but it was a pity that the Ninth Young Lady who was rumored to be You ZhenTian\u2019s most doted on granddaughter didn\u2019t actually know much. When it came to important information, there was hardly anything.</p><br/><p>Just as he was wondering why, an important piece of information suddenly flashed across his mind. It was the restricted area on the underground level, a place where even You Yong couldn\u2019t enter.</p><br/><p>This You Yong was a domineering person. There was one time when she accidentally walked into the region of the restricted area and was stopped outside by the guards. She had a bad temper and the more they didn\u2019t want to let her in, the more she wanted to enter. In the end, the matter blew up and You ZhenTian had to personally discipline her. It was only then that it stopped.</p><br/><p>However, this incident left a very deep impression on You Yong. The great manor was her home and there were actually places she couldn\u2019t go to. That\u2019s why she believed that the restricted area was most likely hiding some secrets that others shouldn\u2019t know.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

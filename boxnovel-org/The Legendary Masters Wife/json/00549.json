The result was that every one of them would go directly to see the King of Hell, and they would even enjoy it.</p><br/><p>This was the first time You XiaoMo had seen people who were so eager for death.</p><br/><p>They stayed at the inn for two days.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo counted on his fingers several times and discovered that every night they threw about seven or eight waves, or ninety percent, of people into the inn\u2019s backyard to be fertilizer for the flowers and plants.</p><br/><p>The second day, the mountain-like pile of corpses in the backyard almost scared the inn\u2019s manager to death, and it only finally stopped on the third night.</p><br/><p>Most likely because he realized that his behavior was just like seeking his own self-destruction, he finally stopped sending scouts over at night.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had a wonderful night\u2019s sleep, lying in Ling Xiao\u2019s embrace. This time he slept until he naturally woke up early in the morning. Instead of sending people to come notify them, Ye Nong came over himself.</p><br/><p>Since Fu CangQiong had warned Ye Nong over and over that he was to personally hand the item over to them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swept over the information in the jade drive once before handing it to Ling Xiao as usual, completely unaware that his clingy dad was currently standing to the side, looking at him with hidden bitterness.</p><br/><p>Fu CangQiong was very happy that they had found the pill recipe for the Samsara Pill. Even though he still couldn\u2019t find a transcendent level mage that could refine a grade six rainbow pill, he had already accomplished half of what he needed. At the same time, he consented to their request, and after learning that they were preparing to participate in Black Spider\u2019s auction, he even gave them a list of items for free.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo saw the items on the list, he couldn\u2019t look away again.</p><br/><p>No wonder Black Spider dared to invite TongTian Continent\u2019s major powers. If any one of these items were leaked out, it would be enough to make people fight until death.</p><br/><p>As for a major power such as the Cang Alliance, Black Spider hadn\u2019t taken pains to try and hide the goods that they were auctioning.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t let them know what treasures they had, it would mean that these major powers wouldn\u2019t have a motive to prepare spirit gems. When the time came to auction off the items, the prices would drop, and the one to lose would be Black Spider.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo roughly glanced over it and his gaze landed on the last couple items on the list. He frowned as he looked at one of the items. There were no specific details about this item, and all it said was that it was an ancient item. They didn\u2019t even know what type of ancient item it was, yet it was actually listed among the last items to be auctioned off.</p><br/><p>After sending Ye Nong off, they closed the door and studied the jade drive.</p><br/><p>Finally, they reached the conclusion that they had to go, no matter what.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what Ling Xiao was thinking about. Ling Xiao continued to stroke the jade drive without saying anything, expression indifferent, as if he was considering something else in his mind.</p><br/><p>The next day, You XiaoMo returned to XiaoYao Institution.</p><br/><p>Speaking of Giganticus\u2019 challenge match, You XiaoMo had calculated and discovered that it was actually at the same time as Black Spider\u2019s auction. They were both one month later.</p><br/><p>They had the Dimensional talismans so the time they had to spend on the road was shortened by quite a bit. The entire journey to and from Xi Jing had only taken half a month, and it was even faster than what You XiaoMo had imagined.</p><br/><p>Besides the time he had first entered Giganticus, this would now already be the second time he missed the challenge match.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t the challenge match, but if he didn\u2019t participate in the challenge match then he wouldn\u2019t have any points, and without points he couldn\u2019t get into the Beast Transfiguration Room or the Meditation Room.</p><br/><p>He had already decided to attend the auction, so he could only miss the competition. But this time he had no points to cancel his name, and most likely there wouldn\u2019t be anyone who would let him borrow some of their points.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head gloomily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Xiao\u2026 Mo?\u201d An uncertain voice suddenly spoke next to him. Maybe because they weren\u2019t used to his name, so they paused in the middle.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo unconsciously looked over and discovered that the person calling him was Jiu Ye. He couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s you? Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat should be what I\u2019m asking you.\u201d Jiu Ye\u2019s handsome and straight brows raised slightly. \u201cThis is the 95th floor, your floor should be the 90th floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned his head and saw that there was a large \u2018Ninety-Five\u2019 on the pillar next to the circular staircase. A drop of cold sweat slid down his face. He was too deep in his thoughts, and he just walked and walked till he reached this floor. \u201cApologies, apologies, I walked past my floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere seems to be something on your mind.\u201d Jiu Ye seldom broached a topic of his own volition.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was surprised for a moment, but then he thought about it a little. Jiu Ye should know quite a lot, so he could ask him, and he said, \u201cI do have something on my mind. You must\u2019ve heard about the Black Spider too, right? I decided to go with Ling Xiao, but the competition and the auction times conflict\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye more or less understood his situation, and he nodded. \u201cYou want to earn some points?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed and nodded. It was great talking with someone smart. \u201cIs there any way to earn some points without participating in the challenge match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye hesitated for a while. \u201cThere is, and presumably you can also guess what it is. There\u2019s only one competition every three months, and the most points you can earn each time is six points. For most people, six points is nowhere near enough. XiaoYao Institution also thought of a solution for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked, \u201cWhat solutions are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye said, \u201cThere\u2019s a private Exchange Quarter in Giganticus, and only students who are on the 70th floor and above can participate. The currency that the Exchange Quarter uses is points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about the trading that goes on between students?\u201d You XiaoMo still felt that this method couldn\u2019t resolve the demand that the students had for points, since everyone only had a few points, so who would just take them out and trade them.</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye denied it. \u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about the trade between the students and Giganticus\u2019 teachers and elders. They\u2019re not the same as us, since they can earn a certain amount of points every month. Although the teachers and elders also have different levels, they don\u2019t need points as frequently as students do. Those points just accumulate, and they\u2019re exactly what we need. Of course, students can trade among themselves, but this happens very rarely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye just happened to have nothing to do, so he personally brought You XiaoMo to the private Exchange Quarter.</p><br/><p>The private Exchange Quarter was on the 85th floor, right in the middle.</p><br/><p>As the floors went higher and higher, the population on each floor dropped. For example, the total population of the 90th floor that You XiaoMo was on didn\u2019t even reach twenty. The total population of the 85th floor was also under fifty people, so there was quite a lot of empty space.</p><br/><p>This empty space was utilized by XiaoYao Institution, and they were built into all sorts of different places. The private Exchange Quarter was one such place, and its area exceeded a thousand square feet.</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, the two of them arrived outside of the private Exchange Quarter.</p><br/><p>Right now was currently when the private Exchange Quarter was at its liveliest. Since everyone had some points during the last two months, they used them all in the Beast Transfiguration Room and the Meditation Room. Now that it was the third month, they had finally used up all of the points they had.</p><br/><p>After the points were used, naturally they wanted to come up with a way to earn more points. Therefore, everyone ran towards the private Exchange Quarter, and the large Exchange Quarter became lively.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked in together with Jiu Ye. The moment he saw the situation inside, he started to laugh.</p><br/><p>This Exchange Quarter was just like a marketplace, but most of the time, the shops in a marketplace were for sellers. However, here they were for buyers, and there was a quartz sign in front of every shop. On the quartz sign, the teachers and the elders indicated the items they needed.</p><br/><p>If the students had these items on them, they could immediately go up and start negotiations, and the prices were naturally easy to settle.</p><br/><p>For teachers and elders, points came for free, so the amount of points they gave out usually weren\u2019t too low and people didn\u2019t have to worry about being ripped off.</p><br/><p>As the two of them walked, Jiu Ye gave him an introduction.</p><br/><p>The Exchange Quarter was split into three blocks. Block One was for teachers of the 70th to 79th floor, and their requirements were usually pretty low, so they also gave fewer points. But this was also directly related to the amount of points they were given every month.</p><br/><p>Block Two was from the 80th to the 89th floor, and Block Three was from the 90th to the 100th floor.</p><br/><p>Block Three\u2019s teachers and elders gave the most points. But their requests were also very high, and most of the students were unwilling to fulfill them, so the students who shopped in Block Three were few.</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye suggested that You XiaoMo first go to Block One to take a look. Although they didn\u2019t give many points, the items that the teachers and elders needed were usually things that people were willing to exchange.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t really care. As long as he could exchange for some points, going to Block One would be the same thing.</p><br/><p>Since Block One had more teachers and elders than Block Two and Block Three, they also had the most space. There were approximately forty to fifty shops, and most of the shops had either one teacher or elder sitting inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price of Block One is between one to two points. Some seniors aren\u2019t mages, so what they mostly need are magic pills. But a student can only exchange one type of pill, if there\u2019s more they won\u2019t exchange with you.\u201d Jiu Ye said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded and glanced over all of them. The things that the teachers and elders needed were multifarious and varied, and there seemed to be no pattern to them. Some needed magic herbs, some needed soul training or skill training, some actually needed spirit gems. How poor would that teacher have to be in order to have to resort to trading points for spirit gems in the Exchange Quarter?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitated for a bit before walking over to that teacher.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

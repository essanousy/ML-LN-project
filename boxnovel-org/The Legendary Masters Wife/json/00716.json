His voice felt dreary, as if what he said was accidental, but oddly enough, there seemed to be a hint of \u2018bewitchment\u2019 involved.</p><br/><p>The two looked at each other.</p><br/><p>The young man tilted his head and asked in confusion, \u201cDo we look like we are trying very hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ping, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Does it not?</p><br/><p>The old members of White Shark all escaped from the water, afraid that they would be at a disadvantage. Only they had come chasing as if their lives didn\u2019t matter. Most importantly, the focus wasn\u2019t on that part, he wanted them to sympathize with the latter part of the sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s pretty easy.\u201d The young man didn\u2019t understand his aim and said nonchalantly. Well I mean, do you really expect an expert to be afraid of a measly water beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course not, if the word got back to the TongTian Continent, they would be laughing their asses off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you guys angry?\u201d He Ping asked again dryly.</p><br/><p>Confused, the young man raised his brows, \u201cAngry about what?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ping was speechless once again. Was he truly stupid of just pretending? But, because of his sincere expression, he couldn\u2019t tell.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough playing around, there are \u2018serious\u2019 matters to attend to.\u201d Finally, the tall man spoke with a hint of pampering and laughter.</p><br/><p>The young man instantly pouted, \u201cWho\u2019s playing around? I really don\u2019t understand, okay\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, the the sea creature roared in anger as if felt looked down upon. The sea water quickly started spinning creating, once again, a massive whirlpool. Before the young man could finish, it charged over with it\u2019s meters long body. It was very fast but in their eyes, it was surprisingly slow.</p><br/><p>He Ping watched as the young man passed him onto the other man and then took a few steps forward. With his skinny looking back in front of him, at that moment, the young man gave off a feeling of being the king of the world. This feeling was absurd but what happened next made him completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The White Shark members who were still in the sea saw the massive whirlpool. The water beast hadn\u2019t left yet, and they began showing signs of panic. Clearly they hadn\u2019t won, otherwise the water beast would have escaped already.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should hurry down to help, we can\u2019t let He Ping escape!\u201d As he finished, the four instantly flew towards the whirlpool. They didn\u2019t want to admit it but, the fact that He Ping didn\u2019t get saved was probably because of the two newcomers. Now, they just have to make up for it, however, just as they moved, a rumbling sound came from beneath the ocean floor. The water level started to rise and at a very fast pace as well, if they got any closer, they may be washed away.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet away!\u201d The four sensed the danger and quickly backed off. Just as his voice landed, a massive water beast emerged from the waters, as if been kicked up by someone. Along with the splash of water scattered in the air, the beast made a terrific scream and landed back into the sea.</p><br/><p>The scene was so shocking that they became utterly speechless. The water beast didn\u2019t sink into the ocean floor, rather, it turned into a human and was carried up by another man. That man was Ling Xiao, the one they \u2018bullied\u2019 and as for the criminal He Ping, he was in the hands of You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, everyone was left speechless. If they still didn\u2019t get it now, they would be idiots. With only the two of them, they managed to capture He Ping and the water beast, clearly they were much stronger. To think they said things like, \u2018don\u2019t hold us back\u2019, the reality was like a slap in the face for them.</p><br/><p>A few hundred meters away, another water beast was slayed by Liu Ying and the others. However, two were injured, although luckily not by much. When they arrived, Liu Ying\u2019s gaze landed on He Ping and his comrades being carried by the two newcomers. Something flashed across his eyes and the atmosphere became eerily silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that\u2026Captain, the ship\u2019s gone.\u201d A man in military uniform broke the silence but clearly it was gibberish, anyone with eyes could see the ship was gone.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying nodded and said towards You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, \u201cGood work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they couldn\u2019t send more people to grab boats, Liu Ying decided to leave this sea. They just needed to be careful to not be discovered and thus they headed out.</p><br/><p>During the trip, none of the old members of White Shark opened their mouth, all of them were silent like mutes. Especially the two who said to You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao to not hold them back, Zhang Long and the other basically wished to disappear. Instead, the one who kept talking became You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Just like a careless and naive young man, as if he had never seen Earth\u2019s scenery before, he kept talking, while his companion smiled in response..</p><br/><p>In fact, no one knew that their situation should\u2019ve been switched.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, being the actual Earthling, should be less curious than Ling Xiao, but he\u2019s been away for so long, that a lot of things felt faraway. Not only that, the moment they arrived, they were faced with something like this, he felt as if his previous life had been for naught and a new world had opened up!</p><br/><p>Although all their ships were destroyed by the two water beasts, they also gained a lot. Other than He Ping, they also captured his comrades. Once they brought them back to the Thunderclap Academy, the head were clearly pleased, supposedly the reward would be doubled.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Zhang Long and the others looked at You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao complicatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait up, Captain Ling.\u201d Thunderclap Academy\u2019s vice principal came out from the school and called them out in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying stopped and turned around in confusion, \u201cVice principal, is there anything else you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>A big honest smile appeared on the vice principal\u2019s face but his gaze swept across the members in the back, then explained, \u201cThe thing is, amongst the criminals you arrested, one of the family members of the victim is here in the academy. They learned that they were captured by you guys, so they wanted to thank you in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Liu Ying hesitated before continuing, \u201cVice principal, we were simply in charge of escorting them, there was someone else who capture them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vice principal continued smiling, \u201cBut the other criminal was caught by you guys, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying instantly understood the reason and said, \u201cVice principal, the one who caught the criminal was actually two new members of White Shark. If the family members want to thank somebody, it should be them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Who were they?\u201d The vice principal raised an eyebrow, surprised. Following Liu Ying\u2019s gaze, he saw the two in the back, one tall person and a harmless looking young man.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying didn\u2019t tell him the details, but he would find out sooner or later. Since the family wanted to thank them in person, he decided to take You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao along. The two were pretty surprised but they didn\u2019t say anything. After greeting Liu Ying, they followed the vice principal into the Thunderclap Academy. You XiaoMo was pretty curious the whole way through. It was the first time he knew that Earth had someplace like this. The basics were similar to the Dao Xin Academy, a place to study but the essence was different. Also, it was all modern architecture, making him feel very at home.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your family is really of the You Family then with your status, you should come to here for school.\u201d Ling Xiao voice sounded by his ear, it had a smiling feeling to it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouted in reply, \u201cBut the facts are, even if my family was of the You Family, my status wasn\u2019t enough for somewhere like this.\u201d Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have attended a normal school. He didn\u2019t die when he was three, he clearly remembered going through, primary, middle and high school. Everything he learned was normal everyday stuff.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao could hear the complaint in his voice and chuckled, \u201cDear wife, if you were at a place like this, you wouldn\u2019t have met me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee how good I am to you, to met you, I even got myself killed. You better pay me back cause I sacrificed my precious life for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your husband will definitely repay you!\u201d Ling Xiao said with a smile.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly felt a chill and he rubbed the goosebumps that formed on his arm. Even if he used his butthole he could figure out what he was saying, so he quickly added, \u201cI want something material.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded, \u201cYep, definitely material.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his straightforward response, You XiaoMo was even more confused, he didn\u2019t say anything wrong did he? But seeing Ling Xiao\u2019s attitude, he feel as if something had gone wrong, but even he chewed his lips, he couldn\u2019t figure out what!</p><br/><p>Before he could figure it out, they had arrived.</p><br/><p>The vice principal brought them to the principal\u2019s office. Just as he knocked, a calm and experienced voice appeared, probably that of the principal.</p><br/><p>They walked in.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a look inside and only one thought appeared.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t prepared yet!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

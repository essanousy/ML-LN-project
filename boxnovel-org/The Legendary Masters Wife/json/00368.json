The exam spanned two days and just three days ago it had ended. That day was the first day for new students of Ward B.</p><br/><p>After hearing that BaiLi XiaoYu, Jiang XiaoFeng, and Liu Le all passed the exam, You XiaoMo decided to personally welcome them. After all, the three had been with him for a while, making them kind of like his underlings.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t they say only those selected can go?\u201d Ling Xiao asked casually after listening to him talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I already talked with Elder Liu and he agreed to let me go. The time is today, in the afternoon, at ten past three. I heard that this year we are getting some good seedlings.\u201d You XiaoMo replied joyously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At two thirty p.m. in the afternoon, everyone gathered by the plaza on the dot.</p><br/><p>After Elder Liu did a headcount, he brought them over to the meeting place. It was the five small fighting platforms they had experienced when they arrived. Those of Ward B had yet to arrive.</p><br/><p>Everyone began to quietly talk among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear, this year there was a full-marks honor student.\u201d A well-informed student exclaimed in an excited whisper.</p><br/><p>Actually, the voice wasn\u2019t very quiet, You XiaoMo was four to five meters away and he could hear it. The Elders probably heard it too, they just didn\u2019t want to be bothered with it.</p><br/><p>Speaking of full-marks, You XiaoMo thought of his own exam rules.</p><br/><p>The first and second round\u2019s highest points were six, the last round of mixed fighting was five points max. A full-mark would mean seventeen in total. It really was impressive to stand out with all those people.</p><br/><p>One could consider BaiLi XiaoYu as a small genius, ever since You XiaoMo left, BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s improvements had been visible. Even then, he was just third place.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that in Block One there is also a super powerful first place. Although, Block One doesn\u2019t have a specific point system in place, that person seemed to have defeated the top five on the rankings board. Especially during the battle royal phase, he supposedly had a one versus five. So, in the end, his points exceeded the second place by a huge margin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know their names?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlock One was Yu WenNan, and Block Two was Chen QingEr.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the made a thinking face, \u201cDon\u2019t think I have heard of them, where did they come from? How did they become the dark horses in the exam?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo also perked up his ears in attention.</p><br/><p>The other just shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cActually, I don\u2019t know either. The two seemed very low key during their stay in Ward B. Their performance was mediocre, nothing special. It was only during the exam that they suddenly exploded, although it was nothing too surprising, didn\u2019t something similar happen before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Understanding his hint, everyone subconsciously turned towards the direction of You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, who was just listening intensely a moment ago realized, all of a sudden, everyone\u2019s attention was on them. However, most of the gazes landed on Ling Xiao, who was beside him. Speaking of a \u2018dark horse\u2019 Ling Xiao was \u2018darker\u2019 than him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d Spoke out one of them.</p><br/><p>Turned towards the entrance of the barrier, You XiaoMo indeed saw Vice-Principal Yan Fa bring along a group of people. Although\u2026this year the number of students who passed seemed a little low compared to before.</p><br/><p>Only once they got closer did he see clearly, the number fell at least one-third from before, especially for Block One students.</p><br/><p>No wonder he felt something was off before, it was this. Once the accepted Ward B students decreased, Ward A students, who are dispatched here, also would fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, do you know why this year there is so few people?\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao threw him a glance, he really thought he was a know-it-all huh, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably because of the one who they were just discussing about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first round of Block One\u2019s competition is a battle royale format. Although the rules state that if there are twenty people remaining they can pass, if someone is kicked off the platform, that probably counts as a fail. That person must have taken advantage of that to kick off the competition one-by-one, so there were less than twenty remaining.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but be amazed, that person was really ruthless, striping away other\u2019s opportunities as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, over there, those two are Yu WenNan and Chen QingEr.\u201d A student pointed towards the man and women standing behind Yan Fa.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo followed his gaze over and the two had very plain features, the type that would disappear into a crowd. But, one couldn\u2019t deny that their aura was very different from the rest, and it was because of that that he could immediately differentiate them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI keep feeling something off about them, do you have this feeling too?\u201d You XiaoMo looked over at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s pretty weird.\u201d Ling Xiao looked at the two and discretely squinted his eyes.</p><br/><p>At this moment Elder Liu announced the beginning of the test and in the first round of five, Yu WenNan was one them.</p><br/><p>In the competition, he could fight off the top five by himself, his strength was no joke. Therefore, Elder Liu sent out the number fiftieth member of the Hundred-Men Ranking to cut off his drive.</p><br/><p>The conclusion however was unanticipated.</p><br/><p>Yu WenNan won and cleanly because the practitioner was instead kicked off the stage during the second round.</p><br/><p>The plaza became silent an Yu WenNan walked down the platform, expressionless, ignoring everyone\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>After him another two students also passed, although not in the same exaggerated manner as Yu WenNan. Once the last of the Block one students were taken off the stage, it was finally time for Block Two to begin.</p><br/><p>Chen QingEr was the first to be called over by Yan Fa. The women, like Yu WenNan, was always expressionless and even had a hint of sombreness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis round you go.\u201d Elder Liu said as he suddenly turned to look at You XiaoMo who was very much out of it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo made an \u2018Ah\u2019 sound in surprise. He hadn\u2019t heard that he also had to go up, and against that Chen QingEr. \u201cElder Liu, did you get something wrong? It\u2019s not me, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but if Chen QingEr, like Yu WenNan hid their true strength, the one I originally put up against them wouldn\u2019t be enough. Those two are too arrogant and need to be brought down to earth.\u201d Elder Liu said with a hint of caution, while stroking his beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay fine, but if it doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t blame me, Elder Liu.\u201d You XiaoMo said as he had no choice but to accept.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat, with your skill as a level eight mage, if you lost, don\u2019t you think that a bit shameful?\u201d Elder Liu didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or be annoyed at this statement.</p><br/><p>Although, if Chen QingEr\u2019s strength was that high, then this person would be highly suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyhow, you just need to do your best.\u201d Elder Liu said.</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo was about to walk over, Ling Xiao suddenly grabbed hold of his arm.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned around and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced over at Chen QingEr, \u201cIf you find something wrong, go to the dimension immediately, even if you are exposed it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you say it like that\u2026I already feel like something is off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to be careful, now can you let go of my hand?\u201d You XiaoMo realized that everyone was looking at them since they were already in their seats, leaving him alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Ling Xiao said as he let go.</p><br/><p>Walking onto the platform You XiaoMo saw Chen QingEr staring at him with a gaze that seemed bottomless. Her plain features gave off an eerie feeling, as if she was\u2026smiling?</p><br/><p>Chen QingEr twiddled around with a strand of her hair as she suddenly gave off a light smile. The ominous gaze stared directly at You XiaoMo as she said, \u201cThe Academy really thinks highly of me, sending a level eight mage to fight me, a level six.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was astonished, she could actually tell?</p><br/><p>It was not impossible for a level-six to see through a level seven, but skipping two levels? That seemed improbable, especially since he tended to conceal his presence.</p><br/><p>Even then, Chen QingEr could see through it. It was just as Elder Liu said, her real level is much higher than it appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease go easy on me, senior.\u201d Chen QingEr said, still keeping a gentle smile on.</p><br/><p>Senior, huh? This Chen QingEr seemed older than him by a few years. Being called \u2018senior\u2019 by someone who was older was a first-time experience for You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so formal my junior, maybe you are even stronger than me.\u201d You XiaoMo replied smiling as well.</p><br/><p>Hearing what he was alluding to, Chen QingEr\u2019s smile became even softer.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease go first, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t mind if do.\u201d You XiaoMo accepted it bluntly, since normally, lady\u2019s first. But he continued on very casually, leaving Chen QingEr, who thought he wouldn\u2019t agree, speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, senior, no need to be polite with me.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Seven different colors were intertwining within the light, and this ball of light seemed to be wrapped around something that looked like a magic pill.</p><br/><p>The four corners of the stone stage were carved with four stone dragons. Their mouths were opened, and it seemed like there were transparent tubes extending from the stone dragons\u2019 mouths to the ball of light. There was a kind of white energy being transferred inside the tubes, and it was pouring endlessly in magic pill.</p><br/><p>But this wasn\u2019t what shocked You XiaoMo the most.</p><br/><p>There was a transparent prison below the stone stage. There were many people imprisoned inside of it; precisely speaking, they should be souls. There were mages, as well as a few practitioners, and there were even demon beasts. These souls were currently howling in pain, their faces fierce, as if they wanted to end their lives then and there.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo saw something peel away from behind them. It was the origin of their agony.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is conviction and soul force.\u201d At that exact moment, a hoarse voice suddenly sounded next to his ear.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned to look and found that the white-robed person who had brought him over had already left. Now it was a middle-aged man wearing the clothes of a priest. He was staring with fascination at the thing above the stone stage, and if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was the only other person there, You XiaoMo might have thought that what he just heard was an illusion.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had been captured, he had never heard a white-robed person say a single thing in this place. Now that somebody spoke to him, he was not used to it.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man slowly started to laugh. \u201cYou must want to know what\u2019s happening here very badly. I can tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man didn\u2019t care. He followed up with a shocking sentence: \u201cI\u2019m the same as you; we both came from another world, or should I say, another plane of existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going off about?\u201d You XiaoMo furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man turned and glanced at him, and it felt like his eyes had a kind of ability to pierce through someone\u2019s mind. The corners of his mouth slowly curved upwards. \u201cIn the world I\u2019m in, one can advance by relying on the power of conviction. Even though it\u2019s not as fast as cultivating, it is truly indispensable in our world. Moreover, the power of conviction can even help the practitioner to break through that realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo heard him speaking about the the secrets that he shouldn\u2019t know without any reservations whatsoever, he had more or less guessed what he wanted to do. On the contrary, his heart calmed down. \u201cWhat does the power of conviction that you talked about have to do with this? What exactly is your goal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRumor has it that the power of conviction can indeed break through and advance. But later, I discovered that it lacked the most important element.\u201d The middle-aged man spoke out loud as if to himself.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked, \u201cWhat element?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes suddenly revealed a hint of crazed happiness. He said, \u201cThe strength of the soul\u2019s origin. The reason that realm is hard to break into is because of the restrictive nature of the world. It only recognizes one. Originally, cultivation is a path going against the natural order, and one is often unable to control their own destiny. However, once someone breaks into that realm, not only can they control their own destiny, they will become the master of the entire world. They can easily wipe away the rules the previous master left behind and establish new rules. Everyone will live under those rules.\u201d The middle-aged man suddenly asked, changing the subject, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right, do you know why this world\u2019s rules aren\u2019t obvious?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was startled before he shook his head. How would he know this kind of thing? Ling Xiao had never talked about it with him, and he had never thought to inquire about it either.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man chuckled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s because the previous master is already no longer here. Even though the rules that he left behind are still here, it\u2019s already no longer as obvious as before. This is extremely advantageous for the next generation. Without the previous master\u2019s influence, the certainty of the TongTian Emperor breaking into that realm will increase greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt like his worldviews had been refreshed tens of thousands of times today alone.</p><br/><p>Back then when he heard Ling Xiao mention breaking into the Sacred Realm seven star pinnacle level, he never imagined that this realm would be so awesome. In addition, someone could even establish new rules, wasn\u2019t that the same thing as creating Heaven\u2019s laws?</p><br/><p>\u201cI already understand the realm you\u2019re talking about, but what does it have to do with the strength of the soul\u2019s origin?\u201d He still didn\u2019t understand why breaking into that realm would require using such a blood method?</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man simply didn\u2019t bother hiding or concealing anything that he knew from You XiaoMo. He probably thought that after this You XiaoMo wouldn\u2019t be able to tell anyone anyway, because he was going to die, so helped him resolve the misgivings in his mind all at once.</p><br/><p>The strength of the soul\u2019s origin was actually the strength of the world\u2019s origin. But the soul\u2019s origin that the middle-aged man was talking about here was in reality referring to the middle- and low-level people. They needed 9999 people from different planes of existence, and afterwards, they would extract the origin energy from the soul.</p><br/><p>Extremely unfortunately, You XiaoMo was the very last one.</p><br/><p>The TongTian Emperor had already implemented this plan for many years. The reason why he hadn\u2019t appeared in public for many years was because he was constantly running between different planes of existences with his subordinates.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to gather together over nine thousand different planes. What\u2019s more, there already wasn\u2019t very many middle-level planes, and it was fairly troublesome to pinpoint their locations. So he could only go to low-level planes to search. There were quite a few low-level planes, so it was easier to catch. But it was still something that wasted a considerable amount of time.</p><br/><p>However, under his persistence and patience, he finally only needed one more.</p><br/><p>But it was harder and harder to pinpoint the location of the planes. In order to capture the 9998th plane, the TongTian Emperor spent three or four hundred years, but this also meant that the difficulty level of finding the last plane would become even higher.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, You XiaoMo just happened to run into them at this time. It was also an accident finding out that he was a soul that came from a different world.</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Blood Clan made a huge fuss about You XiaoMo. Even though they concealed their real objective, the TongTian Emperor knew the You Family\u2019s secret.</p><br/><p>But he knew that the real You Family had already been wiped out in ancient times. What was left were just some side branches. Since You XiaoMo could open the Inheritance Jewel, that meant that he was from the real You Family. However, the TongTian Emperor didn\u2019t find out he was from a different world because of this; instead, it was during the second exam.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo was being pursued by the black shadows, he had accidentally let it slip. Even though it was only him back then, that world was actually all in the grasp of TongTian\u2019s Emperor. You XiaoMo\u2019s every word and action couldn\u2019t escape his surveillance.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, I said so much. It\u2019s also time for you to be on your way.\u201d It was as if the middle-aged man had unburdened his heart after speaking, and he smiled as his gaze landed on You XiaoMo again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the guards around them. He couldn\u2019t take on this many by himself, and he said hastily, \u201cWait a second, I still have another question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the middle-aged man asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cSince you guys only need 9999 people from different planes, why did you have to capture so many experts from TongTian Continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man lifted his hands and arranged his sleeves and robe before glancing at him with a hint of a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die in any case, so there\u2019s no harm in telling you. There\u2019s only one Higher Level Realm, you must know that. But just because there\u2019s only one, it needs an even larger amount of origin energy. Do you understand if I explain it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. There\u2019s also another thing.\u201d The middle-aged man suddenly remembered something, and he curved his lips slightly. \u201cEven though you\u2019re the last one, those people in the prison can\u2019t escape either. It won\u2019t be long before they\u2019ll go down there and accompany you. You don\u2019t know yet, do you? The Soul Disappearing Array down there isn\u2019t a normal array. It also has another name \u2014 Absolute Death Array!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Absolute Death Array is a kind of sacrificial array. It can transform all of the living people inside of the array into energy. The reason why TongTian Palace didn\u2019t seal their cultivation bases is to ensure that they can smoothly transform into energy. Because the more violently they resist, the more effective the Absolute Death Array is. When the energy reaches a certain high point, an ancient barrier surrounding TongTian Palace will activate. When the time comes, none of those people who barged into will be able to escape.\u201d A hint of sinister ruthlessness flashed through the middle-aged man\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sucked in a breath of air. Completely inhuman.</p><br/><p>No wonder He Dong would say that. It was indeed not without basis.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said, \u201cYou know everything that you should know. You can go on your way now.\u201d As he spoke, he reached out a hand towards You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Why would You XiaoMo wait to die obediently? A boundless wave of soul force shot towards the man with a roar the moment he moved.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man laughed coldly. He had long since expected that he wouldn\u2019t obediently submit. With a casual wave of his hand, an even more fierce wave of soul force welled up from inside him, colliding instantly with You XiaoMo\u2019s soul force. A violent wind started emerged between them, creating a piercing exploding noise at once. By the time the power dispersed, You XiaoMo had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged looked sharply in the direction of the stone stage only to see that a human figure had suddenly appeared on the originally empty stone stage. It was You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for him to shout, You XiaoMo smashed a fist onto one of the stone dragon\u2019s heads. With a rumble, the stone dragon\u2019s head tumbled down, and the force from the origin that was currently being transmitted sprayed out immediately, shapeless and colorless. It instantly disappeared in the air\u2026</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man opened his eyes wide and roared in rage, \u201cYou bastard, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately booked it and ran.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

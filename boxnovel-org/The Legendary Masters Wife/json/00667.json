After entering, she swept the tea set off the table in anger.</p><br/><p>Though it wasn\u2019t very loud, it still caught the attention of the employee assigned to the floor. However, before he even got to the door, the guards outside sent him off. The employee was hesitant at first, but left when they promised they\u2019d compensate the hotel for the damages.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Who was it; how dare they mess with me!\u201d Zu Ma\u2019s anger twisted her features, destroying the innocent demeanor and pure face she put on outside. Now, she was practically a venomous monster.</p><br/><p>Originally, she absolutely had to have that Dragon Ginseng Grass, even though it was a grade seven pill ingredient. However, with her current strength and position, so long as she could win first place in the assemblage, then she was certain she could break through to grade seven. She had never expected that someone would interfere halfway.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>Though the Everdragon Herb was known for being something that was supplied but no one could ever afford, it was still an extremely rare Level Twelve magic herb. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t have had to search for so long only to find an immature stalk. Waiting for it to mature would take several thousand years. She couldn\u2019t wait so long, and neither could ShaoYi.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and find the identity of the one who dared ruin my plans!\u201d Zu Ma ordered Tao Lin, who was standing in front of her, face cold.</p><br/><p>The person on Zu Ma\u2019s right was the older brother, Tao Sen. The two were siblings, both at Level Eleven. One was impulsive and aggressive while the other was careful and intelligent, supplementing each other well, so Lin ShaoYi had them follow Zu Ma as her underlings.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, elder brother Tao Sen\u2019s gaze darkened, asking bloodthirsty, \u201cHoly maiden, should I go and kill them and take back the Everdragon Herb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Zu Ma raised an eyebrow, looking down at him. \u201cNo wonder our leader told me you\u2019re all brawn and no brains; you really fit the description. Which of those who could attend that market isn\u2019t a powerhouse? That person is at least grade five, even ten of you added together wouldn\u2019t be able to match him. We have to carefully plan this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly maiden, then the Luck Creation Pill\u2026\u201d Tao Sen hesitantly began.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma intoned calmly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about the Luck Creation Pill. If he can provide the pill recipe for the Luck Creation Pill, then he must have more. Once we get the Dragon Ginseng Grass, then the Luck Creation Pill will be ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were preparing to look into You XiaoMo\u2019s identity and many of the others at market had the same idea. Some had even left with the lady, clearly aiming for the Luck Creation Pill she had. It was up to her to see if she could shake them off.</p><br/><p>After the market ended, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao headed directly for the forum.</p><br/><p>The forum was in a different place from the market, so the mages and practitioners interested had to leave. Some followed them from a distance but upon seeing them heading towards the forum, changed their mind.</p><br/><p>Generally, no one would be cloaked at the forum, so they could find out their identity there.</p><br/><p>The two arrived at the forum and, as expected, saw Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye. Because of their masters, practically everyone at the forum recognized them. In an attempt to get on the good side of the two successors of the two big Guilds, many people surrounded them, all trying to speak with them.</p><br/><p>After half an hour, they saw You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, dismissing their admirers and heading over.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing looked at You XiaoMo\u2019s giddy expression, smiling. \u201cSeeing how happy you are, I\u2019m guessing something good has happened? Care to share?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo giggled.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Jiu Ye spoke up. \u201cIt was you that used a Luck Creation Pill to exchange a stalk of the Everdragon herb at the market, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was stunned and asked subconsciously, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye calmly replied, \u201cI guessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Actually, he had the same guess; he just wasn\u2019t as certain. It was just that trading a Luck Creation Pill for an Everdragon herb was very much You XiaoMo\u2019s style. Jiu Ye had thought of this as well, which was why he asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao placed a hand on his head, saying gently, \u201cNow you finally know, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s not that I\u2019m too smart, it\u2019s that you\u2019re too stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly remembered. He had once complained to Ling Xiao that the reason why he was always bullied with because Ling Xiao was too clever; he himself wasn\u2019t stupid. He couldn\u2019t believe that Ling Xiao had kept that in mind.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had already forgotten about it. Men shouldn\u2019t be so petty.</p><br/><p>As they chatted, those that wanted to know Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo\u2019s identity finally got their wish, yet when they saw Ling Xiao\u2019s very recognizable face, they all startled, looking away in fear. This was one of the most infamous figures on the TongTian Continent right now. Against him, not even nine lives would save them.</p><br/><p>Of those who found out their identity, one was Zu Ma\u2019s underling.</p><br/><p>That person immediately informed Zu Ma and the latter, as expected, once again exploded into rage. The one that had foiled her again was an old enemy! What could be worse?</p><br/><p>Zu Ma never managed to let go of Ling Xiao, always dreaming about being able to kill him as payback for humiliating her that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly maiden, it seems that they\u2019re planning on attending the Mage Assemblage as well. I think, we can use this opportunity\u2026\u201d the clever Tao Lin immediately said.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma was also very intelligent, instantly understanding what Tao Lin was trying to say. Her gaze turned cold.</p><br/><p>There were many people attending this Mage Assemblage, so they had to eliminate a significant number of people. To do that, it was very likely that the XiaoYao Institution would hold a free for all battle. She could use that chance to kill You XiaoMo. She wanted Ling Xiao to have a taste of what it was like to lose his loved one. Only that would be able to calm her anger.</p><br/><p>The forum, in reality, was just a bunch of mages gathering and chatting, throwing around a few words of courtesy and trying to make connections. It was actually pretty boring.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo did manage to meet a few well-known mages, introduced to him by Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye. Quite a few were experts that usually didn\u2019t show up in public, but they were no lesser than those famous mages.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo managed to get a gist of the situation and found that he had quite a few strong rivals.</p><br/><p>Some veterans shamelessly signed up, aiming for a chance at the championship prize, even if they had to fight newbie mages for this chance, including several ancient monsters from the Mage Association and Beast Transfiguration Guild.</p><br/><p>However, even if You XiaoMo didn\u2019t actively seek out others, these others had their own ideas.</p><br/><p>A lot of people wanted to get to know Ling Xiao thanks to his fame and strength.</p><br/><p>The forum would go on for less time than the market did, but You XiaoMo and company didn\u2019t stay for long. Tomorrow was the start of the assemblage and everyone wanted to be in peak condition.</p><br/><p>After bidding Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye goodbye, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao returned to the ShuangWu Hotel. They had gotten some information on the situation surrounding the Mage Assemblage from them as well. They didn\u2019t know the specifics either, since this was the first time the XiaoYao Institution was hosting, and there were far more people signing up than in the past, so each round would have to eliminate a lot of people to progress.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t disappointed. After returning to his hotel room, he focused his attention on the Dragon Ginseng Grass, closing the door tight and taking out the two jade containers.</p><br/><p>He had already checked the Dragon Ginseng Grass. It was really a high-grade magic herb, very good quality and very well preserved. As for the other container, that was what he really was aiming for.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that the Dragon Ginseng Grass was a level twelve magic herb; something extremely valuable, but very few people knew about the growth of the Dragon Ginseng Grass: there was a kind of magic herb that grew alongside it. Of course, this had to do with this magic herb being extremely rare, thus the information on it not being complete,</p><br/><p>The magic herb that grew alongside the Dragon Ginseng Grass was also a level twelve magic herb, and it was even rarer than the Dragon Ginseng Grass. It was called the Phoenix Bait herb. It was also the ingredient for a grade seven magic pill. The two usually grew synchronization, the only difference here being that the Phoenix Bait herb was still immature, but that wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>The only reason You XiaoMo knew of its existence was from the jade drive left by his ancestors. There was some information on it in there. It was no small boon for You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Apart from that, there were also some seeds in the container.</p><br/><p>When the lady had first found the Dragon Ginseng Grass and Phoenix Bait herb, she didn\u2019t just gather the herbs, but also the surrounding seeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cComing to this Mage Assemblage was definitely worth it. With these, I\u2019ll be able to refine the sacred Yin Yang Pill after I breakthrough,\u201d You XiaoMo said excitedly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave a small smile. This truly was an unexpected boon.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, You XiaoMo replanted the Phoenix Bait herb in his dimension.</p><br/><p>The next morning was met with sunny, clear skies and the beginning of the much-anticipated Mage Assemblage.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

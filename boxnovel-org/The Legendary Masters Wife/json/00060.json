After the news got out, practically everyone wants to see what that little brother who was personally picked up by Ling Xiao looks like.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiao is an extremely talented person envied by all. Although he can be insolent and reckless or cold and aloof, it still doesn\u2019t change his place in the hearts of his brothers. Especially now that he has changed a little.</p><br/><p>Ever since that time he came back from his trip down the mountain, his character has changed. Before, Lin Xiao only had one expression on his face \u2013 indifferent. No matter if he is concerned about you or alienating you.</p><br/><p>But the current Lin Xiao is no longer the same. A warm smile often hangs on his handsome face. His voice sounds more pleasing to the ear. A thread of mischief and wickedness runs through his gentle and unrestrained nature. Bursting with magnetism, one cannot deny that under the allure of his gentle like jade voice and smiling face, more and more brothers are captivated by his charm.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s not as if nobody doubts this change in Lin Xiao. The fact is, the first day Ling Xiao returned to TianXin sect, he already caught the attention of a few wily old foxes. When the two of them met, Tang Fan already probed Ling Xiao but he failed to find anything questionable. As for the others, they only found out about the change in \u2018Lin Xiao\u2019 later on. TianXin sect, as a major sect needs to exercise caution in every respect. So other people also probed Ling Xiao but just like Tang Fan, they failed to find anything questionable. That\u2019s because the current Ling Xiao knows about the various secrets of TianXin sect. But what they never expected is that it is actually from Lin Xiao\u2019s memory.</p><br/><p>But compared to Lin Xiao from before, the current Ling Xiao\u2019s personality is much more likable, so many more brothers want to get closer to him. In just one short month, most of the brothers and sisters in the Warrior division have been won over by him. Even those that could not be won over by Lin Xiao are now firmly in Ling Xiao\u2019s camp. The current Ling Xiao\u2019s standing in the Warrior division is much higher than that of original Lin Xiao. So, when You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao show up together, it immediately attracts a large crowd of onlookers.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother, this is the little brother. He looks \u2026\u2026. not bad <i>ma</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Oh</i>, not bad, it\u2019s the type I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurns out the person that Elder brother personally went to pick up his him <i>ah</i>. I\u2019ve seen him before. It\u2019s Earth peak\u2019s outstanding talent Fu ZiLin, the famous poker face?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu ZiLin, \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201chaha!!\u201d</p><br/><p>With all of them <b>talking on top of each other</b>, it\u2019s completely different from what has been said about the Central lineage disciples, described by outsiders as mysterious and elitist. They are unexpectedly \u2026\u2026. chatty. It\u2019s only that their attention is focused on the wrong target.</p><br/><p>Zhou Peng supports his forehead with his hand, \u201cYou are all wrong. It\u2019s not him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussion immediately dies down. Then You XiaoMo walks out hesitatingly from behind Fu ZiLin. In an instant, pairs of eyes shoot at him like X-rays. Shrinking his neck, he wonders if he can step back from this battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a cute little fella. Not even eighteen <i>ba</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew, that\u2019s more like it <i>ma</i>. How can Elder brother like a poker face?\u201d Big sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like Elder brother likes the small and weak type. No wonder he didn\u2019t accept his previous pursuers. If I had known, I would not have learned the QingGang sword technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGross, it wouldn\u2019t change anything even if you didn\u2019t learn it. Look at your bear-like nature.\u201d says a junior brother in disgust.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent brat, how can you speak to your big sister like that? How am I like a bear?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blushes beet red from their words. Ling Xiao likes him? Not possible. Although Ling Xiao did help him out a lot, it\u2019s all in exchange for his hard work. On top of that, he had also agreed to many unfair agreements on his part.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao is relatively thick-skinned. Seemingly unfazed by their words. After saying a few words, he lets them go handle the preparations for the competition. He then takes You XiaoMo and Fu ZiLin to their rooms.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that the Central lineage is not the same as the other four lineages. The Central lineage is a forbidden place for people that don\u2019t have business here. So usually, there are no visitors. Because of that, there are no guest rooms, so they will have to cram in and share rooms with others.</p><br/><p>But after Ling Xiao explains this, the one with the biggest reaction is actually You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou you you \u2026\u2026. you mean, I have to sleep in the same room with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at Ling Xiao in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cCentral lineage has no guest rooms. All the previous competitions also have multiple people sharing one room. It can\u2019t be that your Elder brother didn\u2019t tell you about it <i>ma</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao beams as he speaks. From the tone of his voice, he seems to be in a good mood.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth hangs slightly open. He really didn\u2019t hear anything about this from Elder brother. He always thought that everyone will have their own room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is my room?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu ZiLin who hasn\u2019t said a word the whole time finally opens his mouth. He accepts the reality much more readily than You XiaoMo. This is also his first time in the Central lineage but his mental toughness is much more resilient than You XiaoMo\u2019s. On top of that, there is his cold as ice nature, making it unthinkable that he would bother to squabble about trivial things. That\u2019s because there is really only one outcome, that is to accept it!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiles as he points to the neighboring room, \u201cNext door is Junior brother Zhou\u2019s room. You will have to stay with him for the next few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu ZiLin nods his head indifferently. He then walks right over, pushes the door open and <b>*peng*</b> shuts it again. The whole process is straight to the point, not the tiniest bit of <b>hesitation</b>, as if he has done it many times before.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at him with eyes wide open and mouth agape. But thinking of his own situation he simply can\u2019t take it. If he has to share a room with someone else, he can still accept it. But the person he has to share a room with is Ling Xiao that loves to make fun of him. Such an extremely mean person!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, was this assigned beforehand?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suspects that Ling Xiao is abusing his power.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrows his eyes as a flash of wickedness seems to emerge. A devilish hint appears in his eyes but he maintains his gentle and amiable smile. A relaxed drawl can be heard, \u201cDo you mean to say that you would rather room with someone else than share a room with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s head shakes like a drum-shaped rattle. He feels that his eyes are getting blurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, with the situation you\u2019re in, you can only stay with me. If someone were to find out about the secrets on you, do you think that other than me, there is someone else that would help you conceal the secret of your magic water dimension?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo can\u2019t help but feel guilty. He really only now just thought about this issue.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao is right. He holds such a huge secret on his chest. If someone were to discover his secret, it would most probably spell the end of this life. So he is left with no other choice but to stay together with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Seeing his lowered crestfallen face, accepting his fate, Ling Xiao gleefully puts his arm around his shoulder. He beams as he says: \u201cLet\u2019s go <i>ba</i> little brother. I\u2019ll let you take a look at Lin Xiao\u2019s room. Do you know that you are the lucky first one? None of your other brothers have had the pleasure.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts. He himself doesn\u2019t wish the be the lucky one.</p><br/><p><b>Notes:</b>seven mouths, eight tongues \u2013 talking all at oncenot dragging mud, not carrying water \u2013 no nonsense</p><br/>\n</div>"}

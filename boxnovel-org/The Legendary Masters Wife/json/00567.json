There was too much to consider, risks and exposure and whatnot. They might as well do it themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me what you were laughing about just now.\u201d After discussing the pills, Ling Xiao brought up an old topic. He had a much clearer head than You XiaoMo, able to push the topic back on track after they had gone on a tangent.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave him a basic summary of what had happened in these two days, including how the owner killed outsiders and cooked them into steamed buns, almost making him eat one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you been to Dong Zhou before? I think the people of JiJiu Town are all pretty disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been here once before, but didn\u2019t stay long, and that was tens of thousands of years ago. Dong Zhou has changed from what it is in my memories, but their xenophobia has always rang true, especially the practitioner towns: most of them aren\u2019t tribesmen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the townspeople will let this be. Do you want to stay in my dimension for now?\u201d You XiaoMo suggested. He, at least, really wanted to throw Ling Xiao in there to make things simpler.</p><br/><p>Yet Ling Xiao didn\u2019t hesitate to reject his offer. \u201cNo need. I\u2019m not so injured that I can\u2019t even protect myself. They\u2019re nothing but ants; what\u2019s there to worry about. If they really try to attack, then we\u2019ll just kill them. Plus, your intelligence is so lacking, I\u2019d be worried!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s easy for you to say!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glared at him. If it was just a few people, then that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. However, JiJiu Town had thousands. It wouldn\u2019t be possible to silence them all for certain. He didn\u2019t want to be hunted down by everyone upon arrival to Dong Zhou.</p><br/><p>Now he had the Reincarnation Pill added to his troubles. If he messed up and made more grudges, then he could banish all thought of going anywhere with many Dong Zhou people again, and then where would he go to find the two magic herbs he was missing?</p><br/><p>Lastly\u2026</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the one who\u2019s lacking intelligence! Your entire family is lacking intelligence!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this step by step. We\u2019ll talk about this after dealing with the owner and employees of the inn tonight. So that\u2019s decided then. You keep resting.\u201d You XiaoMo decided by himself. As a man, he had to be able to take command of the family.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao cuffed him over the head. \u201cDecided your ass.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo clutched his head. Being in control was too hard, and too often met with domestic violence. He was going to complain to the Women\u2019s Federation.</p><br/><p>t/n: Women\u2019s Federation is a women\u2019s rights organization of China. Protecting women from domestic violence is one of their task.</p><br/><p>(Ra: so you are a woman now, Momo?)</p><br/><p>Though he had caused quite a commotion earlier today, no one had dared to come and mess with them yet. Even the strongest man of JiJiu Town had cowered, even if they did cause trouble, they\u2019d only be looking for a beating.</p><br/><p>However, this had hindered the other outsiders, because the locals started ostracizing them even more. Now, even if they had spirit gems, no one would be willing to sell anything. Some couldn\u2019t bare this kind of atmosphere and left directly.</p><br/><p>That night, HaoLai Inn\u2019s innkeeper had learned from the blunder last time. Afraid that they wouldn\u2019t eat the midnight snacks, he drugged their dinner directly.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper had the cook make a table of food and then he delivered it directly to their room. More importantly, he had to make sure that both of them ate. Otherwise, if only the young man ate then their plan would fail and they\u2019d be found out.</p><br/><p>When the innkeeper entered, he saw the young man\u2019s companion sitting beside the desk and was delighted. It seemed that the heavens were helping him. He didn\u2019t need to risk being found out and find a way to get the other over.</p><br/><p>\u201cSirs, here is the food you ordered!\u201d The innkeeper set the dishes on the table energetically, his expression cheerful. Then, he placed a pot of tea on the table, too, bidding them a good meal before leaving with a skip in his step.</p><br/><p>Staring at the feast set out on the table, You XiaoMo felt disgusted, especially by the meat dishes. Who knew if they were made from human meat or not. The very thought made him want to puke.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sifted through the plates of meat, saying emotionlessly, \u201cJudging by the smell, it\u2019s probably human meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo retched.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao poured a cup of tea and took a sniff. It had been drugged, too.</p><br/><p>A whole table of food, no matter vegetarian or meat dishes, it was all drugged. They were dead set on drugging them.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t made from human flesh, You XiaoMo would still eat it even if it were drugged. It wasn\u2019t like the drugs would have much of an effect. But now he had no appetite at all.</p><br/><p>On the first floor, the innkeeper felt that it was about time and took some people upstairs.</p><br/><p>To ensure that they would be able to get their prey today, they had knocked all the other customers unconscious to prevent anyone from messing up their plan.</p><br/><p>The cook held a kitchen knife. No matter cooking or killing, she only used this knife. The two employees each held a large swords.</p><br/><p>The four crept towards their target\u2019s room. The owner had the highest cultivation base and sensed no movement from the room. She knocked on the door, and there was no answer. They must\u2019ve fallen for it.</p><br/><p>After pushing open the door and entering, they saw You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao collapsed on the table as expected, half of the food eaten. The teapot had been knocked over, and the tea had spilled onto the floor, forming a large damp spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cInnkeeper, they fell for it.\u201d The first employee excitedly walked over, sword in hand, and realized that they really weren\u2019t moving at all.</p><br/><p>The second employee was a mute, and simply swung his sword in the air to express his excitement.</p><br/><p>The cook sheathed the knife at her side and took out the rope they had prepared and asked, \u201cInnkeeper, should we tie them up now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d the innkeeper said. \u201cThe other customers have already been knocked out. No one will notice for a while. Let\u2019s find their magic bags first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The innkeeper then went to You XiaoMo and lifted his robes, looking around his belt. Yet there was so sign of any magic bags. He couldn\u2019t help but feel confused. \u201cWeird, where is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally it had been this young man that had paid. He had personally seen the other take out spirit gems, so that\u2019s why he searched the young man first.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper then walked to Ling Xiao\u2019s side and didn\u2019t find a magic bag after searching him either. He then had an idea and pulled out their hands, but there was still nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, what\u2019s going on?\u201d The cook asked hurriedly.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s really weird. There\u2019s no magic bags, nor any dimension rings. Then where did they put their spirit gems?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a pocket dimension of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four nodded in wide-eyed realization.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper paled, looking down and seeing the young man lying on the table, his eyes black and bright, watching them with a smile. The man next to him had also woken up, supporting his chin with one hand and watching them in boredom. His expressionless face was terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d The owner roared, and turned to flee.</p><br/><p>What was a pocket dimension? Something that only the powerful would have!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was much faster than them. In the blink of an eye, he had appeared at the entrance to the room. The innkeeper was shocked and skidded to a halt, but the two employees weren\u2019t able to stop in time and crashed into him, falling onto him.</p><br/><p>The cook was rather large, and not as fast, seeing You XiaoMo blocking the way, she immediately slashed at him viciously.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo kicked the knife out of her hand, sending it flying into the door frame. The cook bellowed in fury, lunging for him in a body slam!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt most disgusted about this cook because she was the one who made dishes out of human flesh. Who knew what the peanuts and sweet lotus roots he had eaten on the first night had been contaminated with. At this thought, he shuddered in disgust and didn\u2019t show any mercy as he kicked out.</p><br/><p>The cook screamed as she was sent flying. Her momentum seemed to be about to send her crashing out onto the pavement. However, just as she reached the closed windows, her body slammed into a transparent barrier.</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper and two employees had just gotten up off the floor, but upon seeing this, they decided to silently lie back down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked over and kicked them. \u201cGet up. Don\u2019t play dead or I\u2019ll send you to see Yama right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was Yama? The three didn\u2019t know, but it definitely wasn\u2019t someone good. They hurriedly got up and cowered in the corner.</p><br/><p>t/n: Yama, or the King of Hell, is a Hindu god and a part of Buddhism. They didn\u2019t know about this god mainly because buddhism doesn\u2019t exist here, as well as gods.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy good sirs, we were wrong, please let us go! We only rob people because we\u2019re forced to. We promise to never do this again!\u201d The innkeeper was scared witless by his viciousness. He dared to bet that You XiaoMo was the young man that had caused that commotion at the tailor shop earlier today.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he knew they had killed people and cooked them to serve in dishes, You XiaoMo might\u2019ve been somewhat moved. Robbery and killing was something many people did, but there was still a difference.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo kicked the man harshly. \u201cYeah, you can promise to not lure people in and rob them. Then what about killing them and cooking their flesh? You take me for a fool?! Forced my ass. You think I can\u2019t tell that you\u2019ve been doing this for a fair few years?\u201d</p><br/><p>That A Chuan clearly was an accomplice, and it wasn\u2019t the first time he had done this. It was obvious from the exterior that HaoLai Inn had been here for at least ten years. They were swift and practiced at killing. Even the drugs were the kind that could knock a practitioner unconscious.</p><br/><p>Forced? Bullshit. Only twisted people could do something like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should we deal with them?\u201d You XiaoMo kicked them a few times to vent his frustrations before returning to Ling Xiao, still enraged.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said lightly, \u201cHow else? Kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time he unhesitatingly agreed with Ling Xiao\u2019s murderous suggestions! Amazing!</p><br/><p>On the following morning, the neighbors woke up to find that HaoLai Inn had been burned to the ground and none of them had noticed. Apart from the missing innkeeper and employees, the customers at HaoLai Inn had all been thrown onto the streets unharmed.</p><hr/><h5>Ra: Sometimes I think Addis has this urge to chop me into human meat bun like this female chef, I wonder why.</h5><h5>Addis: \u2026.Just give me your IP address then I can find out where you live.

As a result, they unexpectedly ran into Xia Yin, who had already betrayed the Guma Tribe.</p><br/><p>When Xia Yin saw them, she remembered shifting the blame onto them back then, as well as what happened in the cave city underground. If it weren\u2019t for Ling Xiao not wanting to get involved with them, they most likely would have become enemies by now.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan also wiped away a handful of cold sweat on the spot.</p><br/><p>Ever since he found out that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, who he had met at the bottom of the ocean, were friends with his son, he had worried for quite a while.</p><br/><p>After all, it couldn\u2019t be said that there were no grudges between them; it\u2019s only that the grudges weren\u2019t very big. If Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo wanted to get revenge, they could absolutely exploit their relationship with his young son.</p><br/><p>However, after knowing their purpose in coming, MoQi XiYuan was neither startled nor happy. It seemed like they were preparing to abandon their former hatred and stop arguing about bygone matters. If things were like this, that would be extremely great, except\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the two of you confirmed that the powerhouse collaborating with the Guma Tribe is the Black Spider?\u201d</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan had also heard of Xi Jing\u2019s current situation. The Black Spider was extremely powerful, with all sorts of treacherous and murderous tricks. Before, they were always hidden in the darkness, but now that they had surfaced, nobody had been able to get a handle on them yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person, Zu Ma, Chief MoQi should have heard of her before, right?\u201d Ling Xiao said lightly.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan suddenly frowned. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve heard of her before. She\u2019s the former holy maiden in the Guma Tribe. She\u2019s exceptionally strong, but she suddenly disappeared several thousand years ago for some unknown reason. Nobody knows where she went.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s fingers knocked against the table. He tapped lightly twice before saying, one word at a time, \u201cShe\u2019s currently in the Black Spider right now. Furthermore, she\u2019s also the Black Spider\u2019s leader\u2019s confidant.\u201d</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan was startled. The magnificent holy maiden had actually joined the Black Spider?</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether that old fart Mo Ma knew about this or not, this was harmful for them. Zu Ma\u2019s power to rally supporters was greater than Xia Yin\u2019s, and the rumors said that she seemed to have broken into grade six. Even though they didn\u2019t know whether it was true or not, but it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><br/><p>After quickly calculating, MoQi XiYuan instantly made a decision. He looked at Ling Xiao, who wore an unfathomable expression. \u201cI imagine that the two of you, who rushed from distant lands to Dong Zhou, must not have come here purely to collaborate with us, right? What requirements do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief MoQi is indeed a frank and straightforward person. If I may speak bluntly, I heard that ShuiXi Tribe has a Five Blessing Spirit Eye. I want to borrow it for a while, I don\u2019t know if that is possible or not?\u201d Ling Xiao curled the corner of his lips and got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan\u2019s expression changed slightly. He hadn\u2019t expected them to come because of the Five Blessing Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>Ever since the ancient war, many of Dong Zhou\u2019s Five Blessing Spirit Eyes had been destroyed. There weren\u2019t many that had lasted until now, and there were some that had even been consumed completely.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as if outsiders hadn\u2019t considered the idea of the Five Blessing Spirit Eye. Who knew how many spies had been sent over over the past many years, but they had never succeeded. Outsiders were unable to imagine the degree of secrecy the three large tribes had for the Five Blessing Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao saw that he looked troubled, and his eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cChief MoQi is unwilling?\u201d</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan shook his head and smiled bitterly. \u201cSince Your Excellency actually mentioned the Five Blessing Spirit Eye, I expect that you must have already investigated it beforehand. To tell the truth, the ShuiXi Tribe does indeed have a Five Blessing Spirit Eye, but this Five Blessing Spirit Eye is nearly dried up. I\u2019m afraid it cannot satisfy your needs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ling Xiao asked without batting an eyelash.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan explained, \u201cEven though the Five Blessing Spirit Eye that we are using right now wasn\u2019t passed down from the ancient times, when we discovered it back then it was only a small, lower grade Spirit Eye. Because the tribe\u2019s required amounts have increased in recent years, now there isn\u2019t much left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said indifferently, \u201cChief MoQi, may you take us there so we can take a look ourselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan hesitated for a second before agreeing. He was telling the truth. Indeed, the less people that knew about the Five Blessing Spirit Eye, the better, but the value of a nearly dried-up Five Blessing Spirit Eye wasn\u2019t very high. Even if they knew where it was, it didn\u2019t matter much.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan handed this trivial task to his younger son MoQi Rong. MoQi Rong was a mage, so he often went to the Five Blessing Spirit Eye when he was young. Furthermore, he could use this opportunity to deepen their relationship. Of course, right now he still didn\u2019t know about Fang ChenLe and Fu ZiLin\u2019s relationship with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>MoQi Rong was very happy when he saw You XiaoMo. After returning to the tribe, he was in secluded cultivation the entire time, and he wasn\u2019t as free as he had been at XiaoYao Institution. He also used to have a group of friends by his side at that time, and the one who left the deepest impression was Yan Hui. It was only too bad that they had different interests.</p><br/><p>The location of the Five Blessing Spirit Eye was quite hidden. Even though it was almost dried-up, the tribe had still dispatched many guards to protect it, and it had set up layers and layers of traps. If someone wanted to get all the way in, the entrance was extremely hidden, and the inside was extremely complicated, so if they didn\u2019t have an acquaintance to lead the way, it was very easy to get lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, there are quite a few traps in here. If you accidentally touch one, the location of the secret pathway will change, and we will be immediately sent to another place. Perhaps it\u2019s still in the secret pathway, or perhaps we\u2019ll be transported out\u2026\u201d MoQi Rong explained as he walked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo made a sound of admiration. This was an enormous project; the entire secret passageway was an enormous transport circle. It was an ingenious design, and it was a maze on top of that. With two layers of safeguards, people unfamiliar with the situation would definitely fall into the trap.</p><br/><p>After a while, they finally arrived at the Five Blessing Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>It was a black cave, and they could occasionally see a flash of spiritual light flash across. A gust of extremely rich spiritual energy emitted from the cave, but there were four experts guarding the entrance who were all at the Divine Realm level.</p><br/><p>MoQi Rong showed the token that his dad gave him, and the four guards instantly let them pass.</p><br/><p>After the three of them walked inside, You XiaoMo immediately saw that there was something glowing on the floor of the cave. It was about two meters long, and five different rainbow-colored elements \u2013 Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth \u2013 tangled above the light. Rainbow colored spiritual energy continuously leaked outside in spurts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Five Blessing Spirit Eye. Since it\u2019s about to dry up, that\u2019s why there\u2019s sometimes spiritual energy and sometimes not. The light is also pretty dim. If this was before, the rainbow-colored spiritual energy would be several times stronger than right now.\u201d MoQi Rong explained.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded his head, not really understanding. \u201cIf it dries up, will it be useless? How many days longer do you think you can use what\u2019s remaining?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it dries up, then we don\u2019t need to send people to guard it anymore.\u201d MoQi Rong nodded. \u201cBased on my estimations, this place can only be used for another five days at the most. Once the five elements covering the top disappears, it can\u2019t be used anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly five days!\u201d You XiaoMo was a little disappointed. He didn\u2019t know whether he could break into grade four in five days.</p><br/><p>MoQi Rong said apologetically, \u201cFellow Brother You, many apologies for disappointing you.\u201d Even though he didn\u2019t know the exact situation, he could see that You XiaoMo urgently wanted to increase his power level.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved his hand and told him not to overthink things. It was only their fault for coming at a bad time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ling Xiao suddenly said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back and tell your dad to give this Five Blessing Spirit Eye to us. It will be our requirement for exchanging. We will help ShuiXi Tribe deal with Guma Tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and MoQi Rong looked at him in surprise at the same time.</p><br/><p>This kind of deal wasn\u2019t worth it at all. You didn\u2019t know whether there would be any results in five days. ShuiXi Tribe would simply make a huge profit, and You XiaoMo didn\u2019t believe that Ling Xiao didn\u2019t know. However, he also knew that Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t someone who would lose out. It was good enough if he didn\u2019t make someone else at a loss. If he said this, he definitely had some other plans in mind.</p><br/><p>Finally, MoQi Rong still informed his dad.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan also thought it was strange, but he couldn\u2019t think of what Ling Xiao\u2019s goal would be. It was impossible that there was something MoQi XiYuan didn\u2019t know about the Five Blessing Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>ShuiXi Tribe had already possessed the Five Blessing Spirit Eye for close to ten thousand years. In that time, they had observed and studied it who knew how many times. If there was some secret, they had long since discovered it.</p><br/><p>However, after his younger son told him about You XiaoMo\u2019s relationship with Fu ZiLin and Fang ChenLe, MoQi XiYuan guessed that Ling Xiao was most likely doing this because of that relationship. If this was the case, their strange actions would have an explanation. Since he couldn\u2019t think of a more reasonable explanation, MoQi XiYuan still agreed to this exchange in the end. Disregarding their goal, this matter would only be advantageous to ShuiXi Tribe, not disadvantageous. In addition, he didn\u2019t need to worry about them betraying them at the last moment.</p><br/><p>After that, according to Ling Xiao\u2019s request, MoQi XiYuan called the members guarding the Five Blessing Spirit Eye back in order to let them enter the secret pathway freely. He also told them about the layout of the secret pathways, but only one kind.</p><br/><p>The secret pathways had thousands of shapes, but as long as they didn\u2019t touch any traps, nothing would happen. Since they still planned on using this secret pathway in the future, he could only tell them about one kind.</p><br/><p>After finishing up everything, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t immediately go into the Five Blessing Spirit Eye to cultivate. He had another purpose for coming to Dong Zhou: to see Da-shixiong, who he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time. Uncle should have already notified them by now.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, after Fang ChenLe knew that his Xiao-shidi had already arrived, he was extremely excited.</p><br/><p>He had always believed that several more years would pass before he would be able to see the other. He and Fu ZiLin had already been in TongTian Continent for many years, and they had come even earlier than You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao. They were already very clear about the situation there.</p><br/><p>During these years, he had often heard about them, and his emotions were just like riding a rollercoaster, rising and falling greatly. It really made him extremely afraid.</p><br/><p>Just as expected, even after going somewhere else, his xiao-shidi still didn\u2019t let someone stop worrying.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, not only did these two demon beasts manage to get past all the security in place, they had managed to get inside without anyone noticing. Just from this, it was clear that those two demon beasts weren\u2018t ordinary demon beasts.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know the Metal Swallowing Beast, after all, it was an ancient, mythical demon beast, but it was different for the Golden Winged Insects. They were very well known.</p><br/><p>Just one Golden Winged Insect was enough of a delight, but a second? No matter what, he had to obtain both.</p><br/><p>The City Master of Xing Luo City felt a deep aching pain in his finger. He had only been bitten once by the Golden Winged Insect but it felt like his blood and energy had been sucked out. Gazing in the direction You XiaoMo escaped in, rage burned in his eyes, as well as a heavy greed.</p><br/><p>This was a terrible day for You XiaoMo. He was completely surrounded by enemies. Next time, he\u2019d have to teach the Metal Swallowing Beast and Xiao Pong what strategy was, what it meant to have a useless teammate, and when you should pretend to not know each other.</p><br/><p>Of course, that would all have to come after he got out of this mess.</p><br/><p>In the distance, Tang ZhongHua, who had stayed out of the fight, watched You XiaoMo run around with a shocked expression. His powerful eyesight allowed him a clear view of You XiaoMo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>It was the young man they had met in the hotel a few days ago. They had thought the other had left, but instead he was in the City Master\u2019s home causing trouble.</p><br/><p>Then he heard the City Master of Xing Luo City yell \u2018Golden Winged Insects\u2019, a strange emotion appeared in Tang ZhongHua\u2019s eyes. Xing Luo City\u2019s City Master had recovered by then, and his wound had finally closed. His expression was terrifying and greedy, with eyes locked onto You XiaoMo like a hunter on its prey.</p><br/><p>Almost everyone was surveying the battle, but he crept silently behind You XiaoMo. All the background noise seemed to have suddenly been sealed away. This was the Domain of Xing Luo City\u2019s City Master.</p><br/><p>Every Divine level expert could create their own Domain. Those with Domains would be slightly stronger than normal Divine level practitioners, and there was a very useful ability Domains possessed. The user could pull their target inside and isolate them from everyone else, those of which wouldn\u2019t be able to see inside the Domain.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew something was wrong when things went silent.</p><br/><p>As expected, when he looked back, he saw the figure of Xing Luo City\u2019s City Master looking at him with disdain, as if there was no way You XiaoMo could escape.</p><br/><p>This time he knew it was probably over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell? Go on, run!\u201d Xing Luo City\u2019s City Master sneered. Now, he didn\u2019t seem so anxious to act. Originally, he didn\u2019t need to summon his Domain to deal with You XiaoMo, but he had ulterior motives and You XiaoMo really was too good at slipping away.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought for a moment and suddenly said, \u201cActually, I have an accomplice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The City Master narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he had no reply to that, You XiaoMo continued, \u201cI split up with him. He took my contracted demon beasts to steal things from the treasury, and I went to your room. He should be out of here with what he has stolen from your treasury.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t care about my life, refusing to help me, then don\u2019t blame me for being cruel. I have a way to contact him, and can get him to meet up with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think you just want your accomplice to come and save you.\u201d Xing Luo City\u2019s City Master stared at him, easily seeing through his schemes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked his eyes. \u201cCity Master, sir, even if I had him come to save me, with your strength, my friend won\u2019t be able to defeat you. I\u2019ve already fallen into your hands, so if you believe me, you might even get your treasures back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the City Master flashed. \u201cAlright, I shall believe you this once.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately took out his transmitter stone, almost tearing up. Dear god, let it work this time, otherwise he might actually die.</p><br/><p>After he got out of this, he would beg for Ling Xiao\u2019s forgiveness.</p><br/><p>What the excited You XiaoMo didn\u2019t realize was that the City Master was smiling coldly at him. He clearly didn\u2019t believe what You XiaoMo had said, watching him as if he were like a clown.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned so that his back was to the City Master, gazing at the flashing transmitter stone. As he was beginning to pray for this to work, the flashing died down into a layer of weak light.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo almost started laughing wildly in delight, holding the transmission stone like a treasure. \u201cMy dear accomplice, where are you? I miss you. Every day we\u2019re apart is like three years. I\u2019ve missed you for days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d Five seconds later, a light laughter sounded.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo did his best to ignore the chill that spread through him, smiling weakly. \u201cDarling, don\u2019t just laugh. I\u2019m almost out of the City Master\u2019s estate. Hurry and welcome me or else the today of next year will be my memorial.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afraid that the City Master would hear their words, he couldn\u2019t be too straightforward.</p><br/><p>The other seemed like he had just heard something funny. \u201cCity Master\u2019s estate, huh? Where, when did you go, how come I don\u2019t know? And what\u2019s this about escaping?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, You XiaoMo hurriedly covered the transmission stone stone, discretely glancing at the City Master. Seeing that the other\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed, he relaxed a little, coughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask so much. I\u2019m in Xing Luo City\u2019s City Master estate, it\u2019s an emergency!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn emergency? From what I\u2019ve seen, you seem to be having fun, running from the south wing to the west wing. You seemed to have been enjoying yourself, I\u2019m almost jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo began to stutter. \u201cTh-then, I-I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Are you coming to rescue your wife or not?\u201d He knew it; Ling Xiao would definitely bring up these old grudges.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, so now you admit you\u2019re my wife?\u201d Ling Xiao gave a ambiguous laugh.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately withered. \u201cAlright, I admit I was wrong. I\u2019ll never do it again. If you say east, I won\u2019t dare go west, so hurry and come over with the treasures to save me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his voice on purpose at the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen hang on.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the light from the transmitter stone faded.</p><br/><p>Without the other\u2019s voice, You XiaoMo immediately felt insecure. His sort of empty feeling was really the worst.</p><br/><p>Composing himself, You XiaoMo turned with a smile, saying to the City Master, \u201cCity Master, sir, I\u2019ve already talked with my friend. He said he\u2019d get here soon and will return everything we took from the vault.\u201d</p><br/><p>The City Master eyed him like a fox for a few seconds before suddenly beginning to laugh. His laughter wasn\u2019t nice at all, but rather malicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d You XiaoMo frowned at this strange laughter.</p><br/><p>The City Master stopped laughing, coldly eyeing him and saying, \u201cDid you really think that I would believe your lies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Didn\u2019t I just say my accomplice will return what we stole to you? You heard me talk to him.\u201d A question mark rose in You XiaoMo\u2019s mind. Could it be that the other hadn\u2019t heard his and Ling Xiao\u2019s conversation? Though their conversation was strange, it could prove that he had an accomplice.</p><br/><p>The City Master sneered. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you did it, but you are quite daring to try and trick this City Master. In my Domain, transmitter stones wouldn\u2019t possibly work. Your act wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was confused. \u201cWait, you mean to say that transmitter stones can\u2019t be used in Domains? Then when can they be used? Could it only work if the other person was in the Domain, too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, but don\u2019t think you can trick me. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know you did something to your transmitter stone, in reality you don\u2019t have an accomplice!\u201d The City Master laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s jaw dropped. The answer to this mystery was at the recesses of his mind. After a moment, he swallowed thickly and asked, as if testing the waters, \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me speak to my accomplice just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The City Master seemed irritated. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that this was just an act you did? Foolish. In my Domain, I have a full grasp of your every movement.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this, You XiaoMo was very certain of one thing.</p><br/><p>He was being toyed with!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had tricked him again. The other had known he was in the City Master\u2019s estate from the beginning and had watched the entire thing play out. The reason the transmitter stone could connect was because the other was in the Domain right now, but this guy wasn\u2019t using the transmitter stone to speak to him at all, but directly transmitting his voice over.</p><br/><p>No wonder the City Master of Xing Luo City would think he was lying!</p><br/><p>Dammit, this guy really had him fooled.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo felt secure with Ling Xiao backing him, and he immediately gazed at the City Master with reckless courage and delight. \u201cCity Master, did you know that, in your Domain, there\u2019s a\u2026 Ouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when an invisible hand cuffed him over the head.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>(Ra: Daddy LX is here to spank some bad kiddo for running around)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

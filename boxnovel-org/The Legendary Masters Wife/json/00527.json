Most of the men wore expressions of contemplation, a few looking like they had just eaten shit.</p><br/><p>For example, that Tian Hen guy looked like he had just been scammed, knowing that Ling Xiao left with that Uncle Gu. He suddenly harrumphed and set his feet on the table in s displeased manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m not as strong as he is, but so what if he\u2019s Sacred Level? It isn\u2019t like TianGou has no Sacred level elites. Tian Gui is also level twelve. If he can beat Tian Gui, then that\u2019s really something.\u201d Tian Hen suddenly took on a very sloppy demeanor, like a street thug.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but stare. This guy gave him the same feeling the old man did, like he had multiple personalities.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian Hen, be careful of what you say,\u201d Tian Yuan suddenly said, half admonishing.</p><br/><p>Tian Hen understood what Tian Yuan was trying to say. He glanced at You XiaoMo and suddenly took his feet off the table, staring at him with amusement. \u201cBrat, do you think I\u2019m right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t expect the other would talk to him. He took a moment to process this before saying, \u201cOh, what you just said would usually be right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean usually?\u201d Tian Hen scowled.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouted, saying disapprovingly, \u201cThe situation you\u2019re talking about might apply to most people, but not all. Some people are special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen smiled and said, \u201cSo you mean your man should be treated specially?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing him say \u2018your man\u2019, You XiaoMo\u2019s face flushed involuntarily. He composed himself and said, \u201cOf course. Not everyone is alright with being treated as ordinary like you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen\u2019s expression chilled. \u201cBrat, what did you say?\u201d The intensity of his presence seemed to be about to explode with his rage,</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stayed unfazed. Don\u2019t forget, he was already a grade one rainbow level, though he wasn\u2019t to the other\u2019s level yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian Hen, stop messing around,\u201d Tian Dao said lightly.</p><br/><p>Tian Hen huffed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled in triumph. If you dared to diss Ling Xiao in front of him, then you had better prepare to be roasted. Plus, he wasn\u2019t wrong, there was nothing amazing about a three star defeating a one star.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who stole stalks of magic herbs from my room was you, right?\u201d The silent Tian Xiu suddenly spoke up, his deep, dark eyes calmly gazing at You XiaoMo. When he said this, he was completely expressionless, you couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, so you\u2019re a thief.\u201d Tian Hen finally found a way to turn the tides on You XiaoMo, mocking the other mercilessly upon hearing Tian Xiu\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at him like looking at a child throwing a tantrum before looking back at Tian Xiu and explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t steal them. I exchanged them with other magic herbs. You aren\u2019t worse off at all since I exchanged high-grade magic herbs for your mid-grade ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen said with triumph, \u201cTaking without asking is thieving.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo huffed, \u201cI refuse to believe that you haven\u2019t done the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen was at a loss for words. He really couldn\u2019t refute that. Tiangou\u2019s members were all people who followed their whims. To be honest, the amount of times they had thieved would only be high.</p><br/><p>Tian Ming, spectating this from one side, almost burst into laughter. This was the first time he had seen Tian Hen in such a state of speechlessness. He had been verbally beaten twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pursue the act of exchanging magic herbs, but you broke my Restriction Barrier and touched my books\u2026\u201d Tian Xiu didn\u2019t sympathize with Tian Hen, he only cared about Leisure Pavilion.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cHow would I know that your Restriction Barrier would be so easily broken? You can\u2019t blame us for this, only your own Restriction Barrier, for not being strong enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe sure knows how to twist his words,\u201d Tian Yuan said, unable to hold back laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be able to make Tian Hen so speechless otherwise.\u201d Tian Ming started laughing, unable to hold back any longer.</p><br/><p>Tian Hen glared at him hatefully.</p><br/><p>Tian Xiu didn\u2019t get angry, just said, emotionlessly, \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, it was Golden Winged Insects that ate through the Restriction Barrier around Leisure Pavilion, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him in shock. This person could guess that it was the Golden Winged Insects just from a hole?</p><br/><p>Seeing his expression, Tian Xiu knew that he had hit the mark. \u201cThat clearly wasn\u2019t something a person could do. Plus, the only creature that can bite through a Restriction Barrier without being detected is the legendary Golden Winged Insect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at You XiaoMo in shock.</p><br/><p>Golden Winged Insects were beyond rare, even in Xi Jing. This was the kind of thing one could only see in ancient times.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t bother hiding it now that the cat was out of the bag. The clothes near You XiaoMo\u2019s chest moved suddenly and then two Golden Winged Insects flew out, circling for a while before landing on You XiaoMo\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have two?\u201d Tian Ming exclaimed in shock. He had thought there was only one, because one was impressive enough.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smirked with delight. \u201cThey\u2019re my contract beasts. The male is called Xiao Ping and the female is called Xiao Pong.\u201d As he said his, he waved the two down and had them land on the table.</p><br/><p>Tian Men and Tian Yang, who were closest to You XiaoMo, stretched their necks to take a closer look at the two Golden Winged Insects, barely larger than their thumb. This sort of demon beast was only ever seen in books, not reality.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Winged Insects, as expected, and they\u2019re of very pure coloration.\u201d Tian Men said.</p><br/><p>According to what he had read about the Golden Winged Insects, they were golden on the outside, but not all of them were pure gold. Some were tainted with other colors. Though these kinds of Golden Winged Insects cold also produce golden thread and eat through seals, they weren\u2019t nearly as overpowered as the ones from the legends.</p><br/><p>This was because those tainted with other colors had a limit to their power. For example, their golden threat wasn\u2019t unbreakable like in the the legends, and had an expiration date, so one had no way of knowing when it would stop working.</p><br/><p>As for seals, they cold only eat through weaker ones.</p><br/><p>Even so, there were still people who raised those impure Golden Winged Insects and sold their golden threads for an exorbitant price.</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, it further emphasized how valuable the pure Golden Winged Insects were.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave they produced silk yet?\u201d Tian Xiu asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised an eyebrow. \u201cNot yet. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen suddenly cursed. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s a true treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo realized that everyone was staring at his Ping Pong like they were invaluable treasures, almost like they could shoot lasers from their eyes.</p><br/><p>Tian Xiu explained, \u201cMost people know that just one Golden Winged Insect can produce golden silk, but they don\u2019t know that the silk produced together by a male and a female is ten times as durable. It\u2019s not unexpected though. Golden Winged Insects were extremely rare even in ancient times. Nowadays, never mind a male and a female, just getting one is extremely lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes shone. He really hadn\u2019t known this, but\u2026 \u201cWhat does that have to do with having produced golden silk before or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>The had noticed what the man called Tian Xiu had specifically asked about.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it does.\u201d Tian Hen interrupted, sounding displeased. \u201cOnly Golden Winged Insects that have never produced golden silk before can produce golden silk ten times as durable. And they must be a pair, one male and one female.\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder he had called them a treasure just now.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly asked, \u201cThen how do I let my Golden Winged Insects create silk ten times as strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMating,\u201d Tian Ming drawled out the word slowly.</p><br/><p>Tian Hen glared at him, as if admonishing him for stealing his lines.</p><br/><p>Tian Ming calmly waved his fan.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was puzzled. He had only heard of animals mating to produce offspring. He had never of them mating to produce golden silk. Was golden silk sentient or something?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, can they really produce golden silk from mating? Where does their offspring come from?\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>Tian Hen mocked him, \u201cYou really are stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Ming chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to say that. You asked this, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen slammed the desk, yelling back, \u201cStop pushing this to me. It was you who egged me on to ask. If you really want to consider it, you\u2019re involved as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnusual things really do happen every year, especially this one!\u201d Tian Yuan suddenly laughed. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone so eager to admit they\u2019re stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen and Tian Ming immediately stopped talking, looking towards Tian Yuan with smiles that weren\u2019t quite smiles.</p><br/><p>Tian Yuan smiled, shutting up as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Winged Insects don\u2019t have offspring. They\u2019re all metamorphosed from the Hidden Dipper Stink Bugs. Once they die, their population will decrease.\u201d Tian Xiu said expressionlessly. Though he was stoic like Tian Dao, they had different personalities. He was used to maintaining a cold face, like he didn\u2019t care about anything. Meanwhile, Tian Dao really was just calm and quiet, used to not giving away his thoughts. Thus why Tian Dao was their general.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>The tension that had thickened the air began to dissipate.</p><br/><p>Tian Xiu said, \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cleared his throat, saying, \u201cI just wanted to ask. After my Golden Winged Insects mate, can they immediately produce the golden silk or is it like pregnancy, and we won\u2019t know when they\u2019ll be hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s the latter, how did he tell if Xiao Pong was pregnant?</p><br/><p>The room went silent for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>Tian Xiu deadpanned an explanation. \u201cIt has nothing to do with pregnancy. Every time Golden Winged Insects mate, they\u2019ll be able to spit out golden silk. However, according to the data, they don\u2019t have any sort of mating season, so no one knows when they\u2019ll feel like mating.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his hand. \u201cLast question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xiu motioned for him to speak.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose, saying, \u201cDo Golden Winged Insects spit out their golden silk from their Chrysanthemum?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xiu stopped speaking and the others also fell silent. Two minutes later, Tian Hen couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201c\u2026.What\u2019s a Chrysanthemum?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was shocked. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Hen replied, \u201cShould we know?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blurted out, \u201cIt\u2019s your asshole!\u201d</p><br/><p>BANG!</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>!</p><br/><p>What replied him was Tian Hen falling off his chair in a most ugly fashion, creating a huge noise. Apart from Tian Xiu and Tian Dao\u2019s tense looks, everyone else looked like they had been struck by thunder, looking at You XiaoMo in utter disbelief.</p><br/><p>Or, it could be understood as, when You XiaoMo said this, everyone definitely clenched their butts.</p><br/><p>At this time, the man and Ling Xiao had finished their talk and were returning. Seeing this upon entering, the man looked shocked while Ling Xiao looked to You XiaoMo, having the feeling that it was was definitely his wife who had created such a scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened with you guys?\u201d The man asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Everyone replied simultaneously.</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t believe it. It was clear something was wrong. He looked to You XiaoMo, who was the only one with a normal expression. \u201cCould you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d You XiaoMo nodded, agreeing, \u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Ming immediately ran out.</p><br/><p>With someone setting an example, the others naturally wouldn\u2019t stay and be humiliated, all finding excuses to run off.</p><br/><p>In the end, only Tian Xiu and Tian Dao remained of the eight. The two stoics seemed calm, but no one knew what they were thinking inside.</p><br/><p>The more they were like this, the more the man felt that something was up. He looked to You XiaoMo, motioning for him to continue speaking.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that they were all making a big deal out of nothing. It was very normal that Chrysanthemum meant asshole, and it was far more civilized to say Chrysanthemum than asshole. He didn\u2019t realize that the point wasn\u2019t that Chrysanthemum meant asshole, but that he had said \u201cyour asshole\u201d. With the first word, this sounded entirely different.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo was rather impressed with Tian Xiu and Tian Dao who hadn\u2019t fled. Seeing their tense expressions, he thought for a moment and said, smiling, \u201cNothing really. I was just asking them some questions about Golden Winged Insects.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could almost see Tian Xiu and Tian Dao\u2019s inner sighs of relief.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

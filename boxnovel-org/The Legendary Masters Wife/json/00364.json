Due to the fact that the Academy had solved the problem of the leyline about to run dry, the Cultivation Center was opened for a month. During this time, there was no need of a Purple or Red card to enter the restricted card areas and even the required points were reduced by one-third.</p><br/><p>When the news was announced, the whole academy boiled with excitement.</p><br/><p>It appeared that everyday students arrived at the Cultivation Center like ants; unendingly. Both the Red and Purple card areas were always at maximum capacity.</p><br/><p>Other than that, Hei Tian also sent people to start digging Spirit Gems at Mirage Sand Sea.</p><br/><p>Since the Leyline was below Azure Island, Hei Tian and the Azure Sea Dragon made a pact to give seventy percent to Ling Xiao and the rest of the thirty percent to be equally split among the BaiLi Family, Tong Family, and the Azure Sea Dragon.</p><br/><p>A few days later, You XiaoMo, under the pressure of Ling Xiao had their first \u2018husband-husband\u2019 family meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time we were at Mirage Sand Sea you said that if we had a disagreement we should hold a family meeting, right? So, before Quan QiTian went out from his closed door cultivation, we should decide on a solution, right.\u201d Ling Xiao asked while smiling.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo avoided his gaze and with a darkened face questioned what he was going to do with such an excited tone.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo give a few dry coughs before speaking, \u201cThen let\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded with a smile, \u201cThe topic of this family meeting is about whether or not we should give the Elemental Essence to Duan QiTian or not, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched as he questioned why he was so good at this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, about this topic, do you have anything you want to add? Little You?\u201d Ling Xiao Asked.</p><br/><p>Hearing this You XiaoMo felt his forehead veins pop. Unable to tolerate it, he kicked Ling Xiao and said, \u201cCan you stop with this kind of language?\u201d</p><br/><p>With this he felt as if the one in front of him were his parents and he thought he could use Ling Xiao\u2019s unfamiliarity with \u2018family meetings\u2019 to guide the flow of conversation. In the end, from beginning to end it was him who dictated the meeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then I\u2019ll use a more formal tone.\u201d Ling Xiao took his advice then looked at him with a serious face, \u201cDear wife, what are your thoughts about the ownership of the Elemental Essence?\u201d</p><br/><p>He, he went into the mood immediately!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him with his mouth dropped open.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him seriously, \u201cDear wife, please answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Trying to calm down, You XiaoMo took a deep breath before talking, \u201cIf\u2026you have other uses for it, I have no problem.\u201d After speaking, he uncomfortably looked around. It was just that when Ling Xiao asked this, he knew there must be other uses.</p><br/><p>From Ling Xiao\u2019s handsome face appeared a wide smile, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, dear wife has decided to let your husband make the decision, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea\u2026Yeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then your husband will tell you the answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tilted his head to look at him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave the Elemental Essence for now, I have a better use for it. As for your ShiFu\u2019s Soul, you don\u2019t have to mindlessly worry anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued to explain, \u201cActually there is another effective, but slow approach. I told you before that the Elemental Essence is of the nature element, nature represents liveliness. As long as you train beside it, your Soul will be nourished. The problem will be solved eventually, it is just a matter of when. He has lived with it for this long, I\u2019m sure he will have the patience to wait for a few more years.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked a few times before asking, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case then why didn\u2019t the old man train beside the Elemental Essence at DaoXin Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d Ling Xiao said as he knocked You XiaoMo on the head, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, DaoXin Academy\u2019s Elemental Essence was almost used up. Once Duan QiTian trained beside it, it would definitely use up more of its energy. If that\u2019s the case, then the Elemental Essence would be depleted of its energy even faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him with bitter grudge as he covered his head.</p><br/><p>He knew his IQ was already in the negatives and still knocked his head? What if it becomes double digits?</p><br/><p>This is what You XiaoMo would like to say but predicting Ling Xiao\u2019s response, he could almost guarantee he would reply with, \u2018wasn\u2019t it already in the double digits?\u2019</p><br/><p>That would be asking for it!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you already knew of this possibility, why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? You made me think all this time consuming the Elemental Essence was the only way to restore the old man\u2019s soul.\u201d You XiaoMo complained.</p><br/><p>Giving him a side glance Ling Xiao replied, \u201cWhy do I need to tell you, isn\u2019t the outcome the same?\u201d</p><br/><p>That is true, but the feelings were completely different! He wasted so much emotion thinking this time he would get the old man to owe him a huge favor. The old man was not straightforward that even giving him something would be a lot of fuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just said that the Elemental Essence has other uses, so if there wasn\u2019t two this time, were you just not going to help DaoXin Academy?\u201d You XiaoMo asked spontaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDepends on the situation.\u201d Ling Xiao answered, giving him a deep contemplating look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat situation?\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly felt that their wavelengths were not connecting. Although they never connected in the first place.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I felt the necessity of getting that Elemental Essence then I absolutely would not have helped DaoXin Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that this sentence contained too much information and he couldn\u2019t sort through it all. But he was certain that maybe even heaven was helping DaoXin Academy. They just had to meet a leyline with two Elemental Essences.</p><br/><p>Now that he thought about it, the people Ling Xiao killed at the Boundless Sea, not one was for helping DaoXin Academy. Like Monster Fox, Dong Shen and the other, and Chai Family\u2019s Elder. At most he lent a Divine Level Practitioner title to DaoXin Academy, although it was a really useful title.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey wife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Once You XiaoMo came back to his senses, he saw Ling Xiao\u2019s face in close intimacy. In shock he asked, \u201cWh-What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding up a finger Ling Xiao continued, \u201cSince we finished with the first family meeting topic, let\u2019s start with the second one. The most important one.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbfounded, he couldn\u2019t remember when they had another important question to discuss.</p><br/><p>In a deep voice, Ling Xiao said, \u201cThe center of our second discussion is: husband-husband harmonious relationship. Our most recent sexual lifestyle has left your husband very unsatisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued, \u201cThus, as your husband, my suggestion would be, at best, to do it every day. My wife, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held everything back before finally spitting out, \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a serious response, Ling Xiao said, \u201cDear wife, it was you who said when there is a difference in opinion, we should hold a family meeting and it must be resolved immediately. Are you going back on your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, You XiaoMo felt as if he had carried a rock over only to smash himself in the toes, really digging his own grave. He regretted it now, if he knew how Ling Xiao was so adaptive he wouldn\u2019t have given this suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wife, don\u2019t think about backing away, otherwise your husband here wouldn\u2019t discuss anything with you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since then, Ling Xiao seemed to become obsessed in holding family meetings. No matter how small the issue, he would joyously bring it up to discuss. And as You XiaoMo discovered, he was as much of a failure in family meetings in his previous life as he was in this.</p><br/><p>The fervor behind Boundless Sea seemed to also have died down with time.</p><br/><p>But the digging of Spirit Gems continued with order, and there was finally some progress.</p><br/><p>When Ling Xiao listed his demands to Hei Tian, it was promised that when they dug up ten percent, they would put it in a magic bag and bring it to a designated spot. Thus, this would repeat seven times until he received the full amount promised.</p><br/><p>Half a month later, they finally dug up ten percent.</p><br/><p>After You XiaoMo asked, he realized Ling Xiao told the Academy to put the magic bag in Yan City\u2019s shopping street. Hearing that made You XiaoMo want to go too, so Ling Xiao thought of a middle ground.</p><br/><p>Usually in Ward A, students only had two ways of leaving the school.</p><br/><p>One was to enter the one hundred People Rank and the other was to receive quests.</p><br/><p>The first one was not possible since it was a sensitive time and they almost never took an absence leave. Therefore, the second option was the least noticeable.</p><br/><p>Once the announcement of the Spirit Gems came out for three days, Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo took a quest to the outside. The objective was a High-Level Demon Beast\u2019s baby, the difficulty was upper-middle, and the reward was a magic herb.</p><br/><p>It was one that You XiaoMo didn\u2019t have, he had a lot of different herbs in his dimension, so it took them awhile to find this one. He wouldn\u2019t need to lie either. However, upon hearing this, Yu TangLin actually came to join the party.</p><br/><p>Once Yu TangLin was there, BaiLi TianYi tagged along too.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun didn\u2019t get to go to the Boundless Sea the last time, so hearing they were going to the deep mountain, he decided to join. Also, for some reason, Yin Ge followed suit.</p><br/><p>Now a two-man trip became a six-man expedition.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swore that once they entered Deep mountain he was ditching them all.</p><br/><p>Then, the crew left with great strength and vigor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

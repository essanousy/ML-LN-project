Fatty\u2019s dad was quickly kicked out of the management team, reducing the team of originally five people to four.</p><br/><p>Internally, ShuangYu hotel wasn\u2019t as peaceful and calm as everyone thought. On the surface, it was supposed to be five people managing the hotel together but due to disagreements, the management team was divided into two groups. On Wu Cheng\u2019s side, there was only his father and his father\u2019s buddy who had been on very good terms with him since way back. As for the other three managers, they stood together.</p><br/><p>The situation was extremely unfavourable for Wu Cheng\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>This was because every time there was an important matter and they had disagreements in their views, the five of them would have to take a vote. Wu Cheng\u2019s side would always end up with two votes only.</p><br/><p>In order to change the situation, they had to get rid of one person from the other group and install one of their own.</p><br/><p>As a result, they targeted Fatty\u2019s father because he was the weakest and the future generations from his side tended to be worse than the previous ones. For example, Fatty, who only knew how to do things that made himself a burden for his father. There was no better choice than getting rid of him.</p><br/><p>Hence Wu Cheng made use of You XiaoMo as a fuse and worked together afterwards to take Manager Zhang down. However, they weren\u2019t able to install one of their own men as the fifth person into the management team. Neither was the other group successful. This was because that DaRen had decided that he would personally attend future meetings. He himself, was the so-called fifth person.t/n: Daren: title of respect toward superiors</p><br/><p>While it was different from how he had planned, the outcome of the current situation was already very ideal.</p><br/><p>And this was all thanks to You XiaoMo. Same for that time with the Eagle Guild.</p><br/><p>The Eagle Guild had always been a scourge to ShuangYu Hotel and especially so for that DaRen. Old Eagle was always riding on his head, which resulted in quite a fair bit of his anger building up. That\u2019s why when he learned that Old Eagle was chased out of Central City, no one could be happier than him.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what that DaRen thought about it, but when he learned that Manager Zhang\u2019s faction had offended You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, his decision indeed came faster than before.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had no knowledge about any of this because he and Ling Xiao had already returned to the Southern Continent.</p><br/><p>As there was a limit to the distance travelled for the low grade dimensional talisman, they couldn\u2019t reach their location directly and had no other choice but to accept being transported to a random location of Southern Continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBei Yang City, what is this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked up at the top of the city gate and saw the name of a city. The scale of it could only be considered as moderate, but the city walls were extremely high and there were a lot of people entering and leaving the city gate. The security was also tighter than what was usual for other cities, it was as if this Bei Yang City was an important checkpoint.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk and you will know.\u201d Ling Xiao said casually before taking the lead by walking first.</p><br/><p>There were many people in Bei Yang City, all sorts of them, so the two easily got the information they wanted.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Bei Yang City was an important natural fortress. One must pass through the city to reach the Southern Continent\u2019s most prosperous areas, so coming to the city had become a must for many merchants.</p><br/><p>However, this time the influx of people was greater than the usual.</p><br/><p>This was because it would soon be the birthday of the disciple of the Cang Alliance\u2019s leader. Even though there were only a few people invited, many still flocked there to take a look. If they were lucky enough to meet all the rumoured powerhouses, it would be worth it.</p><br/><p>The two of them weren\u2019t in a rush to reach their destination after entering the city. The purpose of their trip to the Southern Continent this time was to gather information regarding Feng ChiYun. Since Bei Yang City was a natural fortress, it certainly must be well-informed about such news.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, do you guys know what\u2019s so special about the Cang Alliance leader\u2019s most beloved disciple? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard anything extraordinary about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The restaurant was a hotchpotch of crooks and honest folk and in it many people were having lively discussions on the upcoming birthday banquet. Speaking about the banquet, everyone had the same question in mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the Cang Alliance has hidden that person very well. Almost no one has seen him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe cannot not show up for his own birthday, can he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may not know about this, but I was fortunate enough to witness it five years ago. That person did appear, but he wore a black cloak and a hat on his head. He was wrapped up from head to toe, it\u2019s impossible to tell how he looks but it seems like he has a weak body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really curious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u203b\u203b\u203b</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo perked his ears up and listened but after so long no one had even mentioned a thing about the Vermillion Blood Clan. Did they just finish talking or did they have nothing to talk about?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey big brother, I heard there\u2019s a lot of people attending the banquet and they\u2019re all significant figures. Is it true?\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask the person at the next table.</p><br/><p>The man wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, just look at the Cang Alliance leader\u2019s status. The people that are invited are either powerhouses on the Tong Tian list or major forces from all around. Some even take pride in being invited by the Cang Alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen which forces are attending?\u201d You XiaoMo continued to probe further.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so many. The two big guilds from Zhong Tian, the Guma tribe and a few others from DongZhou, the Four Ancient Beast Clans and some powerful demon beasts from XiJing, the Vermillion Blood Clan and two side branches from the Southern Continent etcetera.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s companion who was sitting beside him interjected, \u201cOh yeah, there was supposed to be an Eagle\u2019s Guild, but ever since Old Eagle lost and fled, everyone\u2019s been guessing if he\u2019ll show up at the banquet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who do you think the major forces will send to attend the banquet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man thought for a while before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell. Take the Vermillion Blood Clan for example. They\u2019re extremely powerful and influential and they have a lot of talented individuals in the family. It\u2019s hard to say who they\u2019ll send, but if nothing unexpected happens it should be among the four sons of the old family head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so certain?\u201d This wasn\u2019t the answer You XiaoMo wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sort of thing is easy to guess. No matter how much the Cang Alliance leader loves his disciple, that cannot make up for the difference in their status and power. If it was the Cang Alliance leader celebrating his birthday, then the old family head from the Vermillion Blood Clan would most likely attend in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>From what he had said, their hopes of the situation turning out how they wished were slim.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao helplessly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao tapped his chin and thought.</p><br/><p>At this moment, two people wearing cloaks walked through the door. From their tall and broad physiques it was most probably two men. The two of them scanned around the lobby after they entered the restaurant before settling on the direction You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were at and walked over.</p><br/><p>The way the two of them dressed was too attention-grabbing. A handful of people had their sights on them and their eyes followed as they moved, until they stood in front of You XiaoMo\u2019s table.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked up in surprise. Just as he was about to open his mouth to speak, he caught a glimpse of strands of silver hair peeking out from under the hood of one of the men. When he thought of silver hair he thought of that person.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the other person took a step forward and slightly lowered his hat, revealing a familiar face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe finally found you guys.\u201d He smiled and greeted them.</p><br/><p>That person was really Zhan YuXuan. Then the other one must be Yin Ge, but wasn\u2019t Yin Ge locked up by his father? Why would he be here?</p><br/><p>Seeing as they were acting so cautiously, You XiaoMo had the shop manager open up a room for them and they headed upstairs together.</p><br/><p>Once they entered the room, Zhan YuXuan took off his cloak whereas Yin Ge only had his head of silver hair out, cloak still on him with no intention of taking it off.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo poured two glasses of water for the two of them.</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan gave his thanks before downing the cup of water in one shot. They ran to so many places today they hadn\u2019t even had a sip of water till now.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge didn\u2019t drink. His usual cold eyes fell on Ling Xiao and there seemed to be a hint of surprise and shock in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you recognise us?\u201d You XiaoMo didn\u2019t notice Yin Ge\u2019s gaze. He finally couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking the question that perplexed him. They had clearly changed how they look, no matter how familiar they were they shouldn\u2019t be able to tell at first glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the name. Furthermore you guys are a duo, it won\u2019t be hard for someone who is familiar with you two to guess correctly. As for the appearance, someone has already spread Ling Xiao\u2019s portrait around from your battle with the Eagle Guild.\u201d Zhan YuXuan smiled.</p><br/><p>So he was just Ling Xiao\u2019s accessory?</p><br/><p>Ha ha, very funny, You XiaoMo thought. Why not spread his portrait too? Although he looked plainer, he could at least show his face, even though that wasn\u2019t even his real face.</p><br/><p>After that, Zhan YuXuan briefly talked about what had happened. Basically they were \u2018fugitives\u2019 now and because Yin Ge\u2019s father was a Sacred level powerhouse with a lot of influence in Tong Tian Continent, they were afraid of being found. That was why they were so cautious and always trying to hide the whole way, especially Yin Ge as his silver hair was too noticeable.</p><br/><p>They had already been waiting within Bei Yang City since five days ago.</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan had guessed that they would most likely pass by Bei Yang City so they decided to wait for seven or eight days. If they hadn\u2019t seen You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao by then, they would directly head to the birthday banquet that the Cang Alliance had organised.</p><br/><p>As to why they were so certain, it was because Ling Xiao had already made it onto the Ten Gods List and the powerhouses from the Ten Gods List would have received an invitation from the Cang Alliance.</p><br/><p>Following that, You XiaoMo told them about the news of XiongXiao and their plan.</p><br/><p>After listening to their plan, the both of them looked back at You XiaoMo in shock. Having guts alone wasn\u2019t enough to break into the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s base camp.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we really are going to the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s main house, I have an idea that can make the old family head change his mind and attend the banquet personally.\u201d Yin Ge spoke up and broke his silence.</p><br/><p>The three of them immediately focused their eyes on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may not know this since you just arrived on Tong Tian Continent, but the Southern Continent\u2019s situation is somewhat grim. It may look peaceful on the surface, but in reality it\u2019s a turbulent time.\u201d Yin Ge slowly explained.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

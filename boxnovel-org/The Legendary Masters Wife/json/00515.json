To the Vermillion Blood Clan, from the Family Head to the clan members, each of them had all seen the Inheritance Jewel as the symbol of Family Head.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian actually only knew the secret behind the Inheritance Jewel, but regarding how to activate it, the ancient book didn\u2019t mention anything.</p><br/><p>At first he only wanted to bring back the Inheritance Jewel to slowly research it. After he learned about You XiaoMo\u2019s story, he wanted to capture him at all costs. Even if he couldn\u2019t obtain the Inheritance Jewel genuinely, as long as he could control You XiaoMo, then it would be the same as having a god-defying treasure.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian\u2019s calculation was rolling smoothly, however, there was one thing he missed, and that was the unexpected appearance of a powerhouse as You XiaoMo\u2019s escort.</p><br/><p>They went all the way to the TongTian Continent and then came to the territory of Vermillion Blood Clan, only, they changed their appearance. Within less than two years they flipped the Vermillion Blood Clan upside down. To a controlling person like You ZhenTian, he could never swallow such a loss!</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband, I still don\u2019t understand the frightening secret behind the Inheritance Jewel. Ten years have already passed, you still don\u2019t want to give me an explanation?\u201d Madam Yin\u2019s voice sounded casual, but for her to take the initiative in asking indicated that she was very concerned about this matter.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian knew his wife would ask about it sooner or later, he sighed heavily, \u201cMy wife, I didn\u2019t want to conceal it from you, but this matter is too crucial, if it accidentally leaks out, the Vermillion Blood Clan might face a terrible calamity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Yin shivered. A terrible calamity?</p><br/><p>With the position of the Vermillion Blood Clan in TongTian Continent, who would dare to directly go against them, but a terrible calamity\u2026</p><br/><p>Madam Yin and him had been married for twenty thousand years, she knew her husband wasn\u2019t a person who would say something baselessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, I won\u2019t ask further. Still, how do you want to take care of You XiaoMo, I heard that this person seems to have a close relationship with Fu CangQiong.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian furrowed his brows, actually this was also the matter he had been scruppling about. According to the information he gathered at that time, You XiaoMo and his companion had a hidden secret with Fu CangQiong\u2019s disciple. And since Fu CangQiong extremely doted on his disciple, it was difficult to guarantee he wouldn\u2019t take those two\u2019s side for his disciple\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFu CangQiong is indeed a trouble, and I can\u2019t directly ask him. Moreover, my wife, you haven\u2019t seen the situation from that time, so I\u2019m afraid you didn\u2019t know the truth. It seems that those two and the son of the Nine Headed Serpent King also have quite a relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have heard this rumor about it as well.\u201d Going beyond his expectation, Madam Yin did know about it.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian also didn\u2019t seem surprised, his voice sounded heavier, \u201cAlthough the Nine Headed Serpent King is only a Three-Star Sacred level practitioner, he is a madman, if you mess with him, he will make sure to pay you back by all means.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Blood Clan was a big clan with massive businesses, they couldn\u2019t afford the revenge of a Sacred level expert, even if You ZhenTian was more powerful, he didn\u2019t have the ability to protect his clan members at every moment.</p><br/><p>The Nine Headed Serpent King had lived for over one hundred thousand years, his wife, Madam Yin, was only half of his age, when she was young she had already heard about the Nine Headed Serpent King.</p><br/><p>The Nine Headed Serpent King was a hotheaded unreasonably stubborn and capricious man. If he thought you were wrong, even if you had ten thousand mouths, he wouldn\u2019t change his mind. In addition, the Nine Headed Serpent King Clan had very few members, to say it reluctantly, there were only two people, him and his son.</p><br/><p>If the Nine Headed Serpent King knew the Vermillion Blood Clan was targeting his son, who knows what maniacal thing that old fox would do.</p><br/><p>If You ZhenTian wanted to make a move on Yin Ge, he must take the consequences of offending the Nine Headed Serpent King into consideration.</p><br/><p>Besides, he also had to consider the man beside You XiaoMo, although he didn\u2019t receive any information regarding that man during the last two years, his identity alone was enough for him to avoid.</p><br/><p>As he thought about it, You ZhenTian was angry, he wanted to make a move on You XiaoMo but ended up having too many considerations to take. He was the Family head of the Vermillion Blood Clan, yet his hands were tied in front of him.</p><br/><p>Madam Yin knew he was honing a bull\u2019s horn, she stood up and walked to his side, her white hand gently caressed and stroked his back, as she spoke softly, \u201cMy husband, if you want to take action on You XiaoMo, you only need to watch out for Fu CangQiong.\u201d</p><br/><p>t//n: hone a bull\u2019s horn= to waste time on an insoluble or insignificant problem</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you do nothing to the Nine Headed Serpent King\u2019s son, he wouldn\u2019t see the Vermillion Blood Clan as an enemy. And the man you are worried about, you must have already known, the QiLin Clan and the Demon Phoenix Clan both highly value the purity of their bloodlines, if that man really possess two types of blood, then he will never be accepted by both clans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d You ZhenTian asked in pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Furthermore, if this man isn\u2019t accepted by both clans, you can start from this clue to investigate his identity.\u201d Madam Yin was the daughter of the clan head of the Silver Dragon Clan, she knew these things very clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, I will send people to investigate right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband, remember, this matter should be kept low profile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wife, rest assured, I understand.\u201d You ZhenTian left hurriedly after saying it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Xi Jing was a region with a thick density of demon beasts on the Tong Tian continent. This was also the only region with endless mountain ranges, hills and plateaus. Here in this region, the plains only accounted for less than one percent, thus this region was only suitable for demon beasts to live.</p><br/><p>Thus, not many would come here as an individual, basically they would form a group. The amount of people weren\u2019t many, but they were definitely powerhouses, because, if they weren\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in Xi Jing. This also meant one thing, Xi Jing was the heaviest kill rated region on the whole Tong Tian Continent.</p><br/><p>The demon beasts in Xi Jing always obeyed the law of jungle, like how humans \u2018 only respected the strong\u2019. Except, demon beasts were always relatively more straightforward, they weren\u2019t like humans; full of cunning plots. Most of the time they would use their fist to talk directly, the image was often seen as extremely cruel and bloody.</p><br/><p>Like right now, on the mountain ranges, two powerful demon beasts were killing each other, blood splattered like raindrops, underneath them had been dyed a bloody red color.</p><br/><p>The two big demon beasts seemed to be evenly matched. Although they were heavily injured, both of them couldn\u2019t finish the other. As they saw this would end up with both side suffering, one of them, whose body was like an ox, his eyes were under his armpits, suddenly raised his head and made a hoarse roar. His roar reached to a thousand of miles away.</p><br/><p>Opposite to the ox shaped demon beast, the other big demon beast\u2019s complexion changed, as he immediately turned around and ran.</p><br/><p>The ox shaped demon beast, who was just summoned by his companion, saw his opponent run away, so he immediately chased after. One after another, they entered a chase that lasted for a thousand miles. Eventually, the runaway demon beast was stopped by the opponent\u2019s companion, his circumstances became more and more unfavorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cXing Qi, how dare you to ambush and kill me, don\u2019t you feel afraid that my clan members will find out and go after you?\u201d The big demon beast in the shape of a tortoise said in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cKekeke.\u201d The ox shaped demon beast sinisterly laughed, \u201cIf I were afraid, I wouldn\u2019t want to kill you, because if you were dead then no one would know it was my doing anyway, what is there to be afraid of? I suggest you obediently hand me the one inside your clothes and I will consider leaving your corpse intact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep dreaming!\u201d Despite all the that, the tortoise shaped demon beast held his body tighter, his eyes flashed a hint of wrath, as if he want to eat him alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are seeking for your own death!\u201d The ox shaped demon beast cursed, he used his eyes to signal his companion, and the two of them suddenly made a move.</p><br/><p>The tortoise shaped demon beast was angry and frightened. Right now he was gravely injured and was nothing more than a spent arrow from a powerful crossbow. With one more enemy after him, if miracle didn\u2019t happen soon, he would no doubt die today. He was fine with his own death, but he must never let anything happened to the master hidden inside his clothes.</p><br/><p>t/n: a spent arrow from a powerful crossbow = spent force</p><br/><p>Under the joint attack, the tortoise shaped demon beast couldn\u2019t withstand it anymore, his body staggered as he fell down to the bottom of the mountain and caused a loud noise, even with naked eyes one could see dust flying up.</p><br/><p>A moment later, the tortoise shaped demon beast suddenly transformed into human form and turned into a man with a purple shirt. Blood was spilling out from his mouth and his body was staggering. After a while, he suddenly opened his clothes and looked inside, when he had made sure everything was fine, he sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>The ox shaped demon beast and his companion also transformed into human form. They were both burly and muscular, their looks were very sinister and dangerous. They didn\u2019t look like good people.</p><br/><p>They walked toward the man in the purple shirt, Xing Qi laughed rashly, \u201cRunning? I will see where can you run to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXing Qi, did someone incite you to ambush me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in the purple shirt couldn\u2019t figure out why these two seemed like they had come prepared as well as carried a clear goal on killing him. But he didn\u2019t believe Xing Qi and his partner would be brave enough to go against him,unless there was someone behind the curtains pulling the strings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pity, even if you die, I won\u2019t tell you.\u201d Xing Qi seethed, his tone was extremely vicious.</p><br/><p>The man in the purple shirt\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. At this moment, a light bulb popped up inside his mind, he raised his head and looked toward the void while quickly shouting, \u201cHey there, I am Mo Jing of the Mystic Tortoise Clan, if you are willing to help me, the clan will definitely repay you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xing Qi was shocked for a little, he then laughed, \u201ckeke\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all useless, there is no one beside us here, are you trying to shift our attention away so that you can flee? Just give up on that idea! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>A question suddenly came from above the sky, \u201cAh, is it true?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

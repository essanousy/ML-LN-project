When he wanted to walk over to them, Tang YuLin shook off his hand, and bent down to gather the scattered magic herbs. Seeing this, BaiLi TianYi could only help him pick up the herbs too.</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi cursed, \u201cDamn, I should have made them pack the stall before leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin eyed him indifferently and said: \u201cDo you want to buy magic herbs? If you do, I can give you a discount.\u201d</p><br/><p>When BaiLi TianYi heard this, happiness welled up in him and he replied, \u201cWell then, how much do you have left? I\u2019ll buy them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin took a mental stock of what he had, and after a while he replied, \u201cI have fifteen sets of magic herbs for the YuanYang pill. I\u2019ll charge you thirty points for it. HuoXue pills have eighteen sets of materials. I\u2019ll charge you thirty six points. And I also have nine sets for ZhenYang pills. I\u2019ll just charge you thirty six points for that too. So it\u2019s a total of a hundred and two points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really quite cheap.\u201d BaiLi TianYi chuckled, and immediately took out his card to transfer the points. \u201cYou can draw it yourself. It\u2019s okay even if the wrong amount is transferred. If it\u2019s more, just take it as a gift from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tang YuLin shook his head, and deadpanned, \u201cI\u2019m an honest businessman, and I will never cheat my customers of their points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, en, I know that Tang YuLin is very honorable, I\u2019m just joking with you.\u201d When faced with Tang YuLin, BaiLi TianYi became extremely docile and obedient, to the extent of becoming a \u2018wife slave\u2019, where whatever Tang YuLin says goes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could not stop his lips from twitching when he heard their entire conversation. Since he had purchased from Tang YuLin before, he clearly knew that the price quoted to BaiLi TianYi was not cheap. It was even twice as expensive as the time You XiaoMo bought it, and this BaiLi TianYi actually paid without any change in expression. But when You XiaoMo saw BaiLi TianYi\u2019s card, he suddenly understood. BaiLi TianYi actually had a purple card \u2013 no wonder he could still smile so happily even after being fleeced.</p><br/><p>Once again, Tang YuLin managed to sell all his magic herbs in a flash. He felt extremely satisfied and at this point, he finally noticed You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao\u2019s presence. He did not recognise Ling Xiao, and was momentarily startled after seeing You XiaoMo. Tang YuLin frowned and shot out three consecutive questions, \u201cAre you here to collect the magic herbs? Isn\u2019t it tomorrow? Did I remember wrongly?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled as he replied, \u201cYou didn\u2019t remember wrongly. I\u2019m not here to collect the magic herbs. I\u2019m actually here to buy magic herbs to refine other types of pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin eagerly returned, \u201cWhat magic pill? I may have stock.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was astounded that he got a reply and said, \u201cThe TianLing pill and Mental Purification pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin did not hesitate at all, and with a face full of expectation, he said, \u201cI have them, do you want to buy?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had assumed that he would not have the magic herbs for the pills, thus he was pleasantly surprised. Rather than finding some other stall to buy it from, it would be better to get it from someone familiar. He may even be able to get a small discount too. \u201cThat\u2019s great! How much do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin said, \u201cI have a lot, about one hundred sets of materials for each pill. But I didn\u2019t bring them with me. If you want to buy them, we will have to go to my room to get it. Or I could send it over to you some other time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am free now. We can get it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two wrapped their discussion, and prepared to leave together. Both appeared to have forgotten about Ling Xiao and BaiLi TianYi, and walked off without caring whether they followed.</p><br/><p>If Tang YuLin wanted to leave, BaiLi TianYi would naturally chase after him. His action was unanimous to the abandoned Ling Xiao. As BaiLi TianYi looked at the calm and composed Ling Xiao, he said, \u201cLing Xiao, I have been looking forward to meeting you for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lazily eyed him, \u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi was bored, so he tried to look for a conversation topic. \u201cYou XiaoMo is under your protection, ba. He offended the Chai Family, and although the Chai Family is currently intimidated by DaoXin Academy, they won\u2019t be willing to take things lying down. They\u2019ll keep trying until they succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nonchalantly replied, \u201cThey will not have a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi stared at him for a few seconds, then broke into a smiled and stopped talking. Thus the topic concluded here.</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin was staying in a single person room. Although his level was not that high, he had the ability to rent a single person room. Compared to the rest of the students, he could be considered as a front runner, and was a \u2018rich man\u2019 with a tidy sum of savings.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was quite curious about why he had so many magic herbs to sell every day. But as it was Tang YuLin\u2019s private business, it was not very proper of him to inquire about it. So he could only put the problem out of mind.</p><br/><p>To store level five magic herbs, Tang YuLin specifically found someone to build a gigantic jade storage box. The jade box took up one tenth of the space in his room, and there were thousands of magic herbs inside.</p><br/><p>It took Tang YuLin a long time to collect these magic herbs. As level five magic herbs were hard to obtain, by and large he exclusively sold level four magic herbs. Therefore, over time, he managed to accumulate a lot of level five herbs.</p><br/><p>But one set of materials for a TianLing pill costs three points. One hundred sets would be three hundred points. You XiaoMo wanted the magic herbs for both the TianLing pill and Mental Purification pill. But his card only has about three hundred points left, so he could only buy fifty sets of materials for each pill. Fortunately, Tang YuLin agreed to wait until he earned more points. You XiaoMo could then buy from him at any time.</p><br/><p>After bidding farewell to Tang YuLin, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao went to see Elder Gong. The lease of the pavilion that You XiaoMo was renting would soon expire. His card still had ninety points remaining, which was enough for him to continue renting for another seven days. As for Ling Xiao, he only renewed his lease for five days and seemed reluctant to spend more points. You XiaoMo did not know why and what he was planning to do with the points he saved.</p><br/><p>After parting with Ling Xiao, You XiaoMo returned to his pavilion. Unexpectedly, he met Ning Jing-daoshi outside, and discovered that Ning Jing-daoshi had heard from others that he was looking for her. Thinking he had an urgent matter to discuss, she went to look for him in person.</p><br/><p>Since SheQiu and the others were still cultivating inside, You XiaoMo could not invite her in, and could only discourteously stand outside with her to talk. When he brought up his advancement, Ning Jing-daoshi was not very surprised. She had probably accumulated too many psychological shocks, thus the news about his advancement calmed her down instead.</p><br/><p>The students\u2019 data had already been passed to the higher ups, so his class allocation would not be that easy to change.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing-daoshi reassured him that she would find another chance to pass the information on, and left after chatting for awhile.</p><br/><p>After sending Ning Jing-daoshi off, You XiaoMo hurriedly returned to his pavilion. There were not many points left on his card, so he had an urgent need to earn more points. Since he had recently advanced, You XiaoMo was looking forward to refining level five magic pills.</p><br/><p>While he was refining pills, BaiLi XiaoYu came to look for him. The thirty sets of herbs that You XiaoMo passed to him had all been refined. He managed to refine twenty five successful magic pills, and scrapped the remaining five pills. This was quite a high success rate.</p><br/><p>But BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s speed of refining pills was slower. When Tang YuLin came to deliver the magic herbs, he saw that BaiLi XiaoYu had not finished refining his previous batch. Hence, he did not give him more. When BaiLi XiaoYu was done with his thirty sets, he wanted to open the stall with You XiaoMo. But You XiaoMo had no time, so he threw the thirty magic pills that he refined at BaiLi XiaoYu and told him to sell everything.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu, who finally got an assignment, ran *pata pata* to set up the stall. You XiaoMo was not worried that he would be bullied. Once the two words \u2018BaiLi\u201d are thrown out, those people with brains would know that he was one who could not be offended.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu returned with a big haul in the afternoon. Although he took a longer time to sell everything than You XiaoMo did, he did manage to sell everything.</p><br/><p>The thirty pills sold for one hundred and twenty points in total. You XiaoMo wanted to pay BaiLi XiaoYu for his labor, but BaiLi XiaoYu refused to accept, and said that he volunteered for it. Hearing this, You XiaoMo stopped insisting, and gave him half of the magic herbs from the batch of sixty level four magic herbs that Tang YuLin delivered yesterday. BaiLi XiaoYu appeared to have developed an addiction, and after receiving the herbs, he hid in his pavilion to refine pills again.</p><br/><p>The two paid no attention to outside matters, and with Tang YuLin personally sending the magic herbs over, they did not come out for the next few days. Thus, they were not aware that the demon beasts that Ling Xiao hunted had become a huge sensation in Ward B. Of particular note was the fact that Ling Xiao did not sell the live demon beasts to the students. Instead he made a deal with the academy.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo came out of his pavilion, this news was already a few days old.</p><br/><p>The past few days, he had repeatedly tempered his skill for refining magic pills. As a result, he used up the hundred sets of level five magic herbs that he bought from Tang YuLin. Although he had not sold the magic pills that were refined, he could foresee that the points on his black card would rise again.</p><br/><p>That morning, You XiaoMo and BaiLi XiaoYu finally \u2018left the fort\u2019.</p><br/><p>This time, it was not for the purpose of selling magic pills. But because Ning Jing-daoshi had sent someone to inform them that the classes had been allocated, and that class would start today.</p><br/><p>The teacher-in-charge disliked students that were late to their first class. So she reminded them to arrive early to avoid leaving a bad impression on the teacher.</p><br/><p>Since Ning Jing-daoshi did not tell him if he had been assigned to a new class, and the teacher personally instructing him had not been selected, You XiaoMo naturally headed towards Class Three.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu was a low grade level four mage, so he was in a different class from You XiaoMo. Their classrooms were also in separate venues, and the distance between their classrooms were neither near nor far. When they walked to the classroom building, they split up to headed to their respective classes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo assumed he would definitely reach his classroom before the lesson started. Never would he have thought he would meet an eccentric person on the way to class, who not only caused him to be late, but also caused him to play truant.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

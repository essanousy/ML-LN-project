Never mind twenty-one thousand spirit gems, twenty million wasn\u2019t even a problem for him. However, he refused to be scammed like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your boss!?\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s expression chilled, saying demandingly.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression finally shifted away from that false kindness, revealing a sliver of mockery. \u201cEven if I do get the boss, I\u2019ll tell you honestly, it was her who told us to do this. It\u2019s better that you watch yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>That bitch!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo really didn\u2019t understand. When had they ever offended this woman? It was the first time they had ever met; it wasn\u2019t possible that they would\u2019ve met before now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare take that tone? Your boss doesn\u2019t think that she can scam people as she wants just because she\u2019s the boss of a tavern, does she?\u201d The corner of MaoQiu\u2019s lips quirked up, her alluring eyes sharpening, making her vulpine beauty even more attractive.</p><br/><p>The man was stunned for a moment, mind drifting before he returned to the present and hollered, \u201cSo what if that\u2019s true? This is our territory, so what we say goes. If you don\u2019t pay, don\u2019t even think of walking out of Ziran City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao blew on the hot tea in his cup and took a sip, looking at the server coldly. \u201cThen try us. Let\u2019s see if we can walk out of Ziran City or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>The server was just a mid-level demon beast. Ling Xiao released just a sliver of his aura and the other couldn\u2019t take it anymore, legs giving out under him as he collapsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are daring to speak like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was then that the door to the elegant room was opened from the outside, and a white figure walked in. It was the boss of the tavern. Who knows how long she had been standing there?</p><br/><p>The boss\u2019 demeanor was no longer as clean and noble as it was before, but with a confidence and pride like a goddess of victory, standing high up above everyone else.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at her coldly. His lips quirked into a curve. \u201cNo matter how daring I am, it\u2019s nothing on your scam of a shop. Just one meal costs twenty-one thousand spirit gems. Aren\u2019t you afraid it\u2019ll affect your business if people hear about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner chuckled softly, her orchid fingers playing with the dark locks of hair near her ear. She looked at Ling Xiao with a curl of interest on her lips, and her dignified demeanor suddenly became very suggestive. Though she couldn\u2019t compare to a natural fox like MaoQiu, the sudden charm made people unable to remove their gaze. For example, their server had his eyes practically glued to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo long as I deny it, then, gentleman, do you think they\u2019ll believe me or outsiders like you?\u201d The owner smiled confidently.</p><br/><p>This was implying that she was dead set on scamming them.</p><br/><p>No matter how dumb You XiaoMo was, he would still be able to tell what was going on here. This tavern owner who looked pure and dignified was actually very coquettish, and had her eyes on Ling Xiao. That was why she was making things difficult for them. You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but glare at Ling Xiao. He was too handsome for his own good!</p><br/><p>\u201cTavern owner, I suggest you get rid of that repulsive expression you\u2019re wearing, or else you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d MaoQiu said this with a smile. It was very rare that she would be so nice to such an annoying person and issue to them such a warning. She really was too nice.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegret?\u201d The owner looked like she had heard something unbelievable, suddenly beginning laugh uproariously, her laughter grating. Their server also began to laugh.</p><br/><p>The owner stopped laughing abruptly, looking at MaoQiu with a chilling gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time someone has ever said something like that to me. How interesting. That word doesn\u2019t exist in my dictionary; the people who will be regretting their actions are you, not me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait; you don\u2019t know who you\u2019ve messed with.\u201d The sucker up server, with the owner to back him up, often acted bigger than he was, arrogant and unafraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. We\u2019ll just wait for you to make us regret. Then, I guess we don\u2019t need to pay anymore,\u201d You XiaoMo said as he began to walk out. This was the first time he had ever dined and dashed, and it was an unpleasant experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think of leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>Four brutes swarmed inside, blocking the exit.</p><br/><p>Against these small fries, You XiaoMo could knock them all off their asses with a single kick. Right now, he was in a bad mood, and naturally wouldn\u2019t show any mercy.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised a foot and took aim at the first brute that charged towards them, kicking out. The other didn\u2019t even have a chance to dodge, his body flying backwards into the three behind him. The group was immediately bowled over, screams resounding along with the cracking of bones. He had dealt with all four in one kick.</p><br/><p>The owner\u2019s expression chilled, but she didn\u2019t panic. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape. Hei Xiong is arriving soon. He won\u2019t let you go so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Hei Xiong?\u201d You XiaoMo raised an eyebrow. Seemed like this person was someone big.</p><br/><p>The server who had went to cower behind the owner\u2019s back peeked his head out, saying in a prideful tone, \u201cHei Xiong is the master of Ziran City. He\u2019s the strongest in the entirety of Ziran City and he\u2019s the owner\u2019s backer. None of you will be able to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner straightened her back, her lips curling up slightly.</p><br/><p>Though Hei Xiong was ugly, he was truly strong, and Hei Xiong liked her. Since she enjoyed running taverns, Hei Xiong helped her open this one.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t need to send anyone for Hei Xiong to have received the news of what just occurred. He was almost definitely on his way now.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stood after finishing his tea. His form was tall and slender, seeming to shock the two. The owner\u2019s eyes seemed to brighten.</p><br/><p>\u201cGentleman, you know that it doesn\u2019t have to come to this. So long as you agree to my terms, I can promise, I won\u2019t let Hei Xiong harm your companions.\u201d The owner\u2019s eyes were practically glued to Ling Xiao, her arousal clear as day in her expression. She had never ever seen a man so handsome. Compared to him, Hei Xiong was like cow shit on the street.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo realized a truth of the world.</p><br/><p>Going from being sexual to abstinence was very difficult, but the opposite was all too easy. You really couldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover. He regretted choosing this tavern.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it!\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but yell. She already had this Hei Xiong yet she still was trying to find other men. Even if she wasn\u2019t being sated, she couldn\u2019t hit on his man. There were many others in Ziran city!.</p><br/><p>The owner\u2019s expression twisted, glaring at him with almond shaped eyes. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even said anything, what are you cutting in for? Fuck off.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was enraged. \u201cHe\u2019s my partner, why can\u2019t I cut in? You fuck off, what\u2019s your fucking problem!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner was surprised.</p><br/><p>She had thought that vulpine woman was the one with the man. She hadn\u2019t thought it was the young man. As for homosexuality, it wasn\u2019t uncommon in Ziran City, so there was nothing to be too shocked about.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, please calm down!\u201d MaoQiu comforted him, \u201cThis sort of trash that\u2019s good at being a slut isn\u2019t worth getting angry at. Don\u2019t damage your health by getting angry at her.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the entire room went silent.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared. This was MaoQiu? His impression of MaoQiu was a very composed beauty. Today was the first time he had heard her curse. He really was learning something new every day.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu didn\u2019t seem to have any thoughts about it and continued. \u201cMaster, if you\u2019re still wound up about this, I\u2019ll teach her a lesson for you. Let\u2019s see if she still dares covet the Boss\u2019 beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu assumed that meant he agreed, looking towards the owner with malicious intent.</p><br/><p>The owner had long since gotten so angry that her entire face had twisted. \u201cYou bitch! I dare you to say that again! I\u2019ll rip up your mouth!\u201d A feigned purity and dignity always crumbled quickly. Where was her elegant beauty now?</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t hard to guess how her personality had developed into this.</p><br/><p>Demon cats had to rely on powerhouses to survive, but since they were all very good looking, baring alluring beauty no matter male or female, there were always plenty of elites fighting over them. Like the owner.</p><br/><p>The owner was the number one beauty of the demon cat clan. Originally, three elites were fighting over her, all from Ziran City. In the end, Hei Xiong was the one who won, so everyone in Ziran City knew that a certain owner of a certain tavern was Hei Xiong\u2019s woman. Hei Xiong really treasured this woman, and gave her everything she asked for. Thus, no one dared get on her bad side.</p><br/><p>With a very powerful man\u2019s backing, if the owner couldn\u2019t be so confident, then who could?</p><br/><p>MaoQiu\u2019s figure flashed, instantly appearing in front of the cat demon, raising her hand and landing a harsh slap at the other\u2019s beautiful face. The sound of the slap was very loud and clear, hard enough to send the owner\u2019s head to the side.</p><br/><p>The owner clutched her swollen face, eyes wide as saucers and looking at MaoQiu in disbelief. She was so enraged, her lips were shaking. \u201cYou bitch, how dare you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap!</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t even finished speaking when MaoQiu slapped her across her other cheek before slapping her over ten times in succession, left and right, until her face was swollen like a bun.</p><br/><p>The owner collapsed onto the ground, dizzy, clutching her swollen face with both hands. Her eyes practically spat fire as she glared at MaoQiu, her voice sharp and grating. \u201cYou bitch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>MaoQiu kicked her.</p><br/><p>The owner wasn\u2019t able to dodge it, her forehead knocking against the floor and going red.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu laughed lightly. \u201cIf you say the word bitch again, I\u2019ll tear off your skin. I\u2019m missing a set of skin, anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner was kneeling on the ground, panting. She had never suffered such humiliation, trembling in anger. Though she wanted to curse and let out her anger a little, she was afraid the other would really kill her. Her beautiful eyes glared daggers at MaoQiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? Do you want me to pluck your eyes out, too?\u201d MaoQiu raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>The owner didn\u2019t dare look at her again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo watched on in shock. This was a true goddess!</p><br/><p>He had really learned something new today. So MaoQiu could be so cool, too! Against an arrogant woman like the owner, you could only face her with the same venom.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu returned to them, smiling softly.</p><br/><p>The server was already dumb with fright. Usually, when people heard Hei Xiong\u2019s name they\u2019d be terrified. Yet these people actually dared to attack the owner. He didn\u2019t dare speak out of turn again either.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Ling Xiao got up, patting the dust off his robes. He didn\u2019t even spare the owner a look. He might\u2019ve if she actually had a brain, but she didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded. He didn\u2019t want to waste his time on this dumbass woman. It was better if they just left Ziran City as soon as possible. He immediately had Ling Xiao wear his silver mask in case his face attracted anymore nutcases.</p><br/><p>That was when the door was opened once again.</p><br/><p>A heavy-built man with a rather ugly face walked in, easily blocking the door with his immense form. The man roared as he came in. \u201cWho dares bully Hei Xiong\u2019s little darling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh\u2026\u201d Seeing her backer finally here, the owner didn\u2019t try to repress herself anymore, beginning to wail, her swollen face twisting.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy darling, who did this to you?\u201d Seeing the owner on the ground, Hei Xiong\u2019s expression twisted, immediately walking over and helping her up gently, like she might break, heart aching.</p><br/><p>The owner\u2019s face was terrifying, glaring poisonously at You XiaoMo and company. No matter how enraptured she had been with Ling Xiao, by now, there would be nothing but hate. She would never let go of this hatred.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Xiong-ge, you have to kill them for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong\u2019s cold gaze swept over You XiaoMo and company landing on the all-too-handsome Ling Xiao. Killing intent flashed through his eyes and he said in a icy tone, \u201cWill you finish yourselves off, or do you want me to do it personally?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

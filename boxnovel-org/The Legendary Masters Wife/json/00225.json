However, he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s already famous.</p><br/><p>Just as he arrives at the mage assessment area, someone walks over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo fixes his eyes upon the other and discovers that it\u2019s Gao Yang. Judging from his looks it seems like he\u2019s been waiting for quite a while, one can\u2019t help but feel surprised.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang is very happy to see him, he doesn\u2019t discover there\u2019s now an extra male wearing a mask by his side until he walks over. The male\u2019s clothes are luxurious, he doesn\u2019t seem like a normal person but Gao Yang has another objective today so he didn\u2019t pay much attention and shifts his gaze to You XiaoMo and happily says, \u201cFellow You, elder brother has already waited for you for quite a while, Ning Jing DaoShi wants me to bring you over to see her.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raises his eyebrows, \u201cWants me to go over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Yang explains, \u201cAren\u2019t you here to participate in the assessment today? It just so happens that Ning Jing DaoShi also needs to assess a group of people, she wants me to take you over there quickly. This is clearly better than you having to line up in the queue for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks towards Ling Xiao and the other nods his head at him, \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to inconvenience Gao DaGe to show us the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he went to seek the masked man\u2019s opinion, Gao Yang stares at him blankly before quickly snapping out of it.</p><br/><p>Going through the backdoor the second time, You XiaoMo no longer feels superior, he can pretty much guess who the group of people Gao Yang referred to are. He was already in the limelight yesterday, he\u2019s dead set on not standing under the limelight again today.</p><br/><p>Three people follow Gao Yang and arrive at the destination after walking for ten minutes. This time it\u2019s no longer at the guild hall he went to yesterday, instead it\u2019s a building that\u2019s located behind the guild hall that looks very grand. The outer appearance of the building is particularly appealing.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo discovers that it\u2019s pretty similar to the mage hall he previously took an assessment in, they all look like a cauldron, it\u2019s just that this cauldron is a dark red. The plaque above his head has four vigorous and forceful words on it \u2014 Mage Association! (E/N: Original Chinese characters are four.)</p><br/><p>The Mage Association is the biggest and only association in Yan City, it doesn\u2019t belong to any powerhouse and was established a few years ago by a few high level mages of Yan City in collaboration. The association aims to solicit all mages from all over the land, as long as the mage meets the association\u2019s conditions they will be accepted. It\u2019s difference compared to DaoXin Academy in that it doesn\u2019t have an age restriction.</p><br/><p>This year, DaoXin Academy\u2019s student recruitment assessment is still held at the Mage Association, but it\u2019s only limited to the children of the City Yan\u2019s four big families and those from a few powerhouse\u2019s, there are also a few other mages who don\u2019t have a wealthy background or patron but have huge potential and talent.</p><br/><p>When Gao Yang took them inside, there was already a group of people gathered at the association\u2019s assessment hall.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t really arrive late, yet there had already been a dense crowd here hours ago. Luckily, the assessment hall is very grand and spacious so it\u2019s not too congested.</p><br/><p>Everyone who was able to come here to be assessed are all privileged upper echelons, thus they attract attention from others as soon as they arrive. Multiple judging gazes shoot towards them and land on You XiaoMo\u2019s group of three, their strong curiosity can\u2019t be covered up, some people even start to chat softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come Gao Yan-gexia brought three people here, which one is You XiaoMo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, of course it\u2019s the youth that looks the smallest and weakest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEighteen year old young genius You XiaoMo, so he really did come here, there\u2019s much to look forward to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is there to look forward to, do you think there won\u2019t be a lot of other geniuses from Yan City\u2019s four big families? It\u2019s not like a level four mage who\u2019s younger than him doesn\u2019t exist, thinking back to those days, Teng ZiYe-gexia became a level four mage when he was only sixteen years old, now he\u2019s only twenty one and is already a mid level five mage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeng Ye- gexia was an existence that couldn\u2019t be surpassed back in those days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing whispering sounds around him, some which are in admiration, some in envy and others in jealousy\u2026 a hint of surprise flashes in You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes, he had thought that the assessment would be the same as yesterday with only between ten to twenty people participating. He didn\u2019t imagine there\u2019d actually be so many people and judging from their looks, they don\u2019t seem like normal students.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang turns around and tells him, \u201cFellow You, these are all the juniors from the four big families, there\u2019s no need to pay attention to their words, they\u2019re all just people who say the grapes are sour because they can\u2019t eat the grapes[1].\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo almost laughed out loud, he didn\u2019t think that last sentence was actually commonly used in this world as well, \u201cGao DaGe, you don\u2019t need to worry about me, I understand!\u201d Jealousy is common to all men, but it hasn\u2019t been too long since he arrived at Yan City, he doesn\u2019t really understand anything to do with the so called four big families so he definitely won\u2019t take it to heart.</p><br/><p>Under the gazes of many, Gao Yang takes You XiaoMo\u2019s group of three through the crowd to Ning Jing DaoShi\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi had been waiting for them for a long time, seeing that they arrived, her beautiful eyes look around in a charming manner with hints of joy surging around like rays of dazzling light. All onlookers can\u2019t take their eyes off her, although she\u2019s not young anymore, she\u2019s still the unrequited love of many students.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat, you made DaoShi wait a long time.\u201d Ning Jing DaoShi looks at You XiaoMo and says in a teasing manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 sorry.\u201d You XiaoMo rubs his nose and apologises with a slightly red face. Compared to other people in the hall, he really did come quite late, but he didn\u2019t even think he\u2019d come here to take the assessment in the first place.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi can\u2019t hold it in any longer and goes \u2018pffft\u2019 in laughter, \u201cI\u2019m joking with you, brat. There\u2019s no need to take it seriously, it was me who forgot to tell you to come here for the assessment yesterday. It\u2019s not your fault, there\u2019s no need for you to apologise to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs and doesn\u2019t reply. Of course he knows that Ning Jing DaoShi is joking with him, but if he doesn\u2019t apologise then is he somehow supposed to refute her words. If he said that, he\u2019d probably be poked to a hornet\u2019s nest by all the gazes around him.</p><br/><p>Even though Ning Jing hasn\u2019t known him for a long time, she knows that his personality is a bit shy so she won\u2019t tease him anymore. Her line of sight lands on Ling Xiao who\u2019s standing behind him with a snow white mask on and she raises her brows up in surprise.</p><br/><p>Although the male is wearing a mask, his noble temperament can\u2019t be concealed no matter what, luxurious snow white clothing outlines the man\u2019s tall and slender figure, the temperament he gives off carries a slight unrestrained and gentle vibe, unsurpassable beauty yet also has a sort of delicate attractiveness.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, this is an elegant and noble man, many people have taken notice of his existence, quite a lot of people are softly chatting about him. Ning Jing is somewhat curious, she didn\u2019t see this man yesterday.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo observes Ning Jing DaoShi\u2019s line of sight and follows it to discover that she\u2019s looking at Ling Xiao and then goes to explain, \u201cDaoShi, this is my friend, he\u2019s called Ling Xiao. He went to participate in the warrior enrollment assessment yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Jing instantly reveals a gentle smile and nods at him, \u201cStudent Ling, I welcome you to join Dao Xin Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao slightly lifts the corners of his lips and opens his mouth to say, \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was suppressing his laughter so much that he could almost get an internal injury from it, Student Ling, haha, it\u2019s so funny he could laugh to death.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stealthily shoots him a look, his eyes are filled with traces of an unfathomable smile, almost like he\u2019s saying \u2018you\u2019re dead meat\u2019.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo coughs and hurriedly averts his gaze, \u201cOh yeah, DaoShi, hasn\u2019t the assessment started?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Jing smiles, \u201cThere\u2019s still a few people who haven\u2019t arrived, we\u2019ll wait a bit longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was just about to ask who these big shots were, they actually made so many people wait for them, even DaoShi is waiting for him, when noisy chatters resound from the direction of the entrance, he looks over and sees a group of people walk in. The people who were crowding the entrance all willingly make way for them, their attitudes really are respectful and modest, there\u2019s also hints of ingratiation and fear.</p><br/><p>One only sees a tall silhouette walk through the opened doors first, it\u2019s a male who\u2019s quite handsome in appearance, he looks to be around twenty years old, his forehead radiates touches of gentleness, a gorgeous blue robe makes him seem extremely honorable. The jade belt on his hips sways in the air as he walks, magnificently beautiful yet also chic and elegant.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang to the side takes notice of You XiaoMo doing the elevators and explains, \u201cThis is Tong YueXu from the Tong family and is one of the best geniuses of the Tong family. Although he\u2019s twenty years old today, he was already a level four mage three years, there were a few reasons as to why he didn\u2019t enter Dao Xin Academy but this person\u2019s talent at making pills is extremely high. He counts as one of the best here in Yan City. Apparently, he\u2019s already got half a foot in the level five field already.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t fully understand and shifts his gaze from Tong YueXu to the youth behind him.</p><br/><p>The youth looks younger than Tong YueXu with delicate facial features. His looks carry a lively and delicate beauty, when the other smiles he has a pair of deep dimples on his face and looks very sweet.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks, \u201cWho\u2019s the youth behind him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Yang says, \u201cThe youngest son of the BaiLi family, BaiLi XiaoYu, he\u2019s eighteen just like you. He became a level four mage seven months ago, he\u2019s not the most outstanding one amongst the younger generation of the BaiLi family but his talent is still one of the best there.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo listens and is astonished, the big families are definitely worthy of their name, they really do have talented people one after the other.</p><br/><p>As soon as Gao Yang finishes speaking, the entire assessment hall suddenly quiets down, but it\u2019s only for a few seconds, very quickly there\u2019s another loud and noisy commotion, quite a lot of people, especially males, look towards the entrance with sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo whips his head around to have a look, he just so happens to get a quick glimpse of the enchanting figure that just walked in.</p><br/><p>T/N</p><br/><p>[1]  Used to describe when someone\u2019s bitter that someone else has something but they don\u2019t have it, and so to try make themselves feel better they just go and say that the thing\u2019s bad. The children\u2019s story behind this saying is that one day there was a fox who found a vine of grapes hanging up high and couldn\u2019t reach it no matter how hard he tried. Then a bird comes flying over and takes a grape, the fox sees this and feels bitter so he just walks away while telling himself, \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat the grapes anyways, they\u2019re definitely sour.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

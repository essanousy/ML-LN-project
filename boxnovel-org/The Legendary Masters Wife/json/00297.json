The space around the golden seal was distorted, and the ground exploded under its immense pressure.</p><br/><p>The young man started to tremble. He knew with certainty that he couldn\u2019t take this attack, but he couldn\u2019t stay there like a sitting duck. He raised his hands and gathered his soul power in front of him, creating a Spiritual Barrier that was three to four times as thick as the one You XiaoMo had made.</p><br/><p>The gold seal flashed a few times before viciously smashing against the young man\u2019s Spiritual Barrier under everyone\u2019s shocked eyes!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A powerful shockwave erupted from where the two forces met, like a raging storm, it swept across the entire field. Two seconds later, everyone heard a loud crack. There wasn\u2019t even time for cracks to spread across the young man\u2019s Spiritual Barrier; it just shattered directly.</p><br/><p>Yet, what was most surprising wasn\u2019t that, but the Golden Seal seemed to have only used half its power in that collision. It\u2019s size had decreased, but it still held an immense energy within it, streaking towards the young man after shattering the Spiritual Barrier.</p><br/><p>Luckily for him, Elder Tang was prepared to interfere and quickly pushed the young man aside.</p><br/><p>The Golden Seal created a massive crater where it hit the ground; half the stage had been annihilated.</p><br/><p>Not far in front of the crater, the young man sat, pale faced. If it wasn\u2019t for Elder Tang\u2019s quick acting, he might already be dead.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo panted, looking at the massive crater in shock.</p><br/><p>He remembered in the competition two days ago, Chai Zheng had faced this attack head on as well, but nothing like this had happened then.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo guessed that though the young man was of a higher level than Chai Zheng, he didn\u2019t have the backing of a powerful group like the Chai family, so his techniques weren\u2019t as high grade as Chai Zheng.</p><br/><p>Elder Chang stared at the massive crater before moving his gaze to You XiaoMo. He had defeated his opponent in just two moves, as well; it seemed like this year\u2019s freshmen were very impressive.</p><br/><p>Elder Tang immediately declared, \u201cThis round goes to You XiaoMo!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man reluctantly gave his card to You XiaoMo. No matter what, defeat was defeat, no amount of reluctance would change that.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo excitedly took out his own card, transferring ten points from the young man\u2019s card to his own before returning the card.</p><br/><p>The young man stared at the red card in his hands and suddenly flushed. He had only just realized how silly his taunting had been.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ignored him, running to Ling Xiao and triumphantly giving him a thumbs up, \u201cLing Xiao, I won!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grasped his thumb, narrowing his eyes and saying, \u201cYour speed wasn\u2019t bad just now!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately deflated. He wanted to retract his thumb, but Ling Xiao\u2019s grip on it was too firm. However, it was as Ling Xiao implied; not only did this match prove his strength to those from Ward A, it also proved that his speed training from the previous few days had borne fruit.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, fine, I\u2019ll keep training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze, You XiaoMo could only compromise. In reality, the feeling of reaping his harvest was great.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao chuckled, saying, \u201cGreat, then we\u2019ll add an hour to your daily training.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a beat, he gripped Ling Xiao\u2019s clothes, begging mournfully, \u201cPlease no, two hours is too much! I still need to cultivate and refine pills. Let\u2019s each take a step back; how\u2019s one and a half hours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cOk!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u201d That was a little quick, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>He regretted his actions. If he had known, he would\u2019ve fought for just one hour. He felt like Ling Xiao was playing with him again.</p><br/><p>Not long later, the other four matches came to a close.</p><br/><p>Apart from Tong YueXu who managed to endure five rounds, the other three had all lost.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a closer look before realizing that apart from Tong YueXu who had a high grade level six mage as an opponent, the other three had level seven mages due to their higher skills.</p><br/><p>The gap between level six and seven had always been great divider, completely different from the gap between the high and middle grades of level six mages. One could say that level seven was a sublimation of quality. The three weren\u2019t able to endure, all losing in the third round.</p><br/><p>However, it might\u2019ve been You XiaoMo\u2019s victory that provoked them/ In order to not lose so badly in front of everyone, the three students all did their best, leaving their opponents helpless.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Teng ZiXin also managed to last five rounds with her skills, and did it without too much struggle. She might\u2019ve even defeated her opponent if they went a few more rounds.</p><br/><p>However, no one else managed to last five rounds after Teng ZiXin. In the end, only four managed to win. It seemed very few, but in the previous years it was usually only one or two who came out with a victory.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s over with, everyone follow me.\u201d The Fifth Elder stood forth and said, looking over the crowd of both excited and disappointed people. Then, he immediately turned and walked towards the passageway.</p><br/><p>Everyone composed themselves the best they could and hurriedly followed.</p><br/><p>You XiaMo and Ling Xiao walked at the very back of the group. Though they were surprised at having to go through another test, the result was satisfying. Ten points wasn\u2019t much, but it was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>Ward A was like Ward B, hidden inside a valley, and the area is took up was at least twice of Ward B. Looking at it from above, the towering buildings seemed like models, turning into miniatures.</p><br/><p>The Fifth Elder left them along the way because he was busy, and the one leading turned into Elder Tang.</p><br/><p>Elder Tang took them directly to their future abodes.</p><br/><p>Ward A\u2019s accommodation was different from Ward B. They weren\u2019t split into compounds named after the four seasons and weren\u2019t separated by strength. But there was one thing that was the same, and that was accommodation fees.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something that everyone should know. Ward A only has two kinds of accommodation, and those two are good and bad. The good ones have individual and group rooms. Individual rooms cost two points a day and group rooms cost three points. The bad accommodation is also split into individual and group rooms and the furniture inside isn\u2019t as good, but it doesn\u2019t cost anything. Don\u2019t choose the better one out of pride, because you\u2019ll soon find out there\u2019s another very important use for the points inside your card. Now, everyone should choose. Those who choose the better accommodation stand to my right, those who choose the worse one stand to my left.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, Elder Tang didn\u2019t attempt to interfere in their decisions anymore.</p><br/><p>So, everyone began to choose according to their own thoughts. Most people chose the worse one, either because of what Elder Tang had said, or because they had their own plans.</p><br/><p>Though the better one only required a measly two points a day to rent, everyone was still willing to live in free accommodation. Most of the people present, apart from those with some sort of background, were all independents, able to make sacrifices.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo decisively pulled Ling Xiao to the right.</p><br/><p>It might be as Elder Tang had said, but if they had the ability to do so, why not enjoy the better option? He wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><br/><p>Plus, if they really did run out of points in the end, it wasn\u2019t too late to move. It wasn\u2019t like the school would prevent students from moving.</p><br/><p>Apart from them, Tong YueXu and Chi YunFeng also stood over on their side. Of course, Teng ZiXin and the others did as well, but for them it was a matter of pride, not points.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought Chi YunFeng would choose the left side, so when he saw the other approaching, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYou seem like someone who doesn\u2019t like to waste, how come you came over here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chi YunFeng replied mildly, \u201cIf it gets to it, I can just move. It\u2019s no biggie.\u201d</p><br/><p>This thought was the same as his own. No wonder he felt a bond with Chi YunFeng.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled.</p><br/><p>Next, Elder Tang had another Elder lead the ones on the left away before personally leading You XiaoMo and the others to the better equipped accommodation.</p><br/><p>After walking for a few steps, Elder Tang asked, \u201cDo any of you want to share rooms?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone shook their heads. Even if they were friends, it didn\u2019t mean that they were willing to room together. Plus, it wasn\u2019t like any of them couldn\u2019t afford it.</p><br/><p>Elder Tang didn\u2019t speak again, assigning them rooms as they went. You XiaoMo purposefully lagged behind with Ling Xiao, so they were the last ones to be assigned a room.</p><br/><p>Elder Tang opened a door; the d\u00e9cor and furniture inside wasn\u2019t bad and the color of the room was warm. He said to You XiaoMo, \u201cYou can have this room.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao in conflict before flushing and saying, \u201cElder Tang, we\u2019re going to share a room, so you don\u2019t have to assign another one to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Tang paused for a second, his gaze flitting between them. However, he was someone who had seen much in his life; this kind of thing would only make him surprised for a moment. He then said, \u201cDo as you want. Also, Ward A has no classes and focuses on independent study. From tomorrow onwards, you have to rely on yourselves to improve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In the end, the crowd followed the mentor into Xiao Yao Institute in a massive formation.t/n: DPS = Damage per second</p><br/><p>XiaoYao Institute wasn\u2019t like DaoXin Academy and they wouldn\u2019t give students all sorts of benefits, like the underground Ley Line or such. This was a place where merit spoke lengths.</p><br/><p>The crowd walked along a wide road with very few people. The mentor explained the situation in XiaoYao Institute as he walked.</p><br/><p>After about half an hour, they finally arrived at the foot of that massive structure. Against it, humans were like tiny ants. It was impossible to tell how large it truly was unless one flew up and looked down at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoYao Institute has always operated by a ranking system. The building in front of you is divided into a hundred floors, and every floor has its own benefits. What you can learn depends on you, of course, the further up you get, the better it\u2019ll be for you. However, since you only just arrived, you\u2019ll be placed on the first floor.</p><br/><p>These words were said to inform You XiaoMo and the other clueless students of the situation. Qiao WuXing and company obviously already knew all this, and probably knew far more than just this. As they discussed this, Qiao WuXing filled them in on what wasn\u2019t brought up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis building is called the Giganticus. Apart from students, mentors and elders also live inside, not for the convenience of teaching, but to keep an eye on the students on each floor. So, once you go inside, it\u2019s up to you to learn with your own merit. The mentors won\u2019t provide you with that sort of advice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, every three months, there\u2019ll be an opportunity for you to advance to a higher rank by challenging someone. Every person only has three chances to challenge someone or be challenged. If you fail, you\u2019ll have to wait three months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf someone challenges you, can you refuse their challenge?\u201d You XiaoMo had much to ask after listening to this; that was what it meant to pursue knowledge relentlessly.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing\u2019s footsteps faltered. He had thought it would be someone else who would ask that. However, he quickly recovered and replied, \u201cYes, but only once.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo then asked, \u201cThen, if many people challenge you at once, can the challenged choose who to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing said, \u201cThey can\u2019t. If there are more than three challengers, then there will be a random draw that\u2019ll pick three people from these challengers. However, the challenged can choose to refuse one of the challenges and there won\u2019t be another draw to pick a new challenger.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cIt\u2019s that nice?\u201d</p><br/><p>The energetic Tian Xin\u2019s pigtails swished and she mocked him upon hearing what he had to say, \u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot. Of course it wouldn\u2019t be so simple. Challenges affect your points.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ignored the first sentence. \u201cWhat do points do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin replied, \u201cPoints are affected by the number of challenges you take. Every time you win, you gain a point. If you refuse a challenge, you\u2019ll lose a point. However, if you lose, you won\u2019t gain or lose any points. Points can be used to purchase a lot of things. You\u2019ll know what, exactly, this all entails once you get in.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo understood. It was similar to Ward A\u2019s point system, but it was implemented in a far harsher way.</p><br/><p>The mentor led them to the first floor, where the living situation clearly wasn\u2019t very good.</p><br/><p>Looking at the dirty and cramped room, You XiaoMo felt that he might be too clean for this place, never mind Ling Xiao whose face was twisted in evident disgust.</p><br/><p>The mentor then said, \u201cEach person gets one room. If you\u2019ve brought someone in, XiaoYao Institute isn\u2019t responsible for their living arrangements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, noises of shock and protest arose.</p><br/><p>Even one person would be cramped in such a small room, two people were impossible to fit in.</p><br/><p>Many people were already considering sending the people they brought back.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could guess that while XiaoYao Institute didn\u2019t forbid people from bringing others, no one would want to if they lived in a place like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t need to worry about this, really. You won\u2019t be here long, after all, because in three days, the tri-monthly challenges will begin. Though we only just got here, it doesn\u2019t prevent us from entering. If you don\u2019t want to live in a place like this, then you have to work hard and climb up. The living situation up there is far better and you have plenty of space, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>TianXin walked in nonchalantly. Usually, girls would definitely object to such a lack of cleanliness, but she seemed to care the least out of everyone.</p><br/><p>Their rooms were all adjacent to one another and the rooms were small, too, so it was just a few steps across.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin\u2019s somewhat mischievous voice rang out again. \u201cYou XiaoHa, go and tidy up. Later on, I\u2019ll take you to the arena, yeah? I\u2019ve been a few times in the past.\u201d Though it was when she was little.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d The aforementioned XiaoHa hadn\u2019t even replied when Yan Hui\u2019s excited voice chipped in.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin rolled her eyes at him, murmuring, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you.\u201d However, she didn\u2019t object. Getting along with others would only bring profit, standing united was a show of love, that was what older brother WuXing had told her.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sighed, accepting his fate, and gave a glare to the perpetrator who stood next to him. \u201cHurry and help me clean. It\u2019s disgusting here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most men didn\u2019t mind the dirt, especially when they were fixated on cultivation, so most of them didn\u2019t care too much for hygiene. Plus, this was the first floor. Most people would be able to advance to a higher floor pretty quick, so that gave them even less incentive to clean.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took out two cloths from his dimension and had Ling Xiao get a bucket of normal water from his dimension. Using Spiritual Water here would be an absurd waste of resources. He threw one of the cloths to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tidy up the trash here, go and wipe down the bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stared at the cloth in his hand expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Seeing his motionlessness, You XiaoMo said with a hint of laughter, \u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d Then, he took out a broom and began to sweep.(Ra: Momo has become lady boss who know how to order the husband for minimal tasks :o)</p><br/><p>Hearing the ruckus, Yan Hui came to their door and was shocked at the sight he was met with. \u201cHow come you have a broom? You don\u2019t carry that sort of thing around everywhere you go, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied calmly, \u201cI used to live alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui then asked, \u201cDo you have anymore that you can lend me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused for a moment. \u201cNo, but I can lend you this one once I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui nodded, delighted.</p><br/><p>That was when the uncle\u2019s soft-spoken voice drifted over. \u201cSorry, but could I borrow it, too?\u201d He was rather shy, almost to the point where he didn\u2019t dare appear in front of others.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until You XiaoMo was almost done with sweeping the floor that Ling Xiao began to clean reluctantly. However, because of the amount of dust, the cloth turned black with one wipe and had to be cleaned almost continuously. It wasn\u2019t long before the water turned black.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo refilled the bucket with clean water. It took them a full ten buckets of water to clean up the bed. Then, he used a dry cloth to wipe it dry.</p><br/><p>He had wanted to wipe the floor as well, but there was even more dust on the ground than on the bed. Plus, there were also patches of who-knows-what on the ground. It would be too troublesome to clean that up, so Ling Xiao refused.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know that you only say that because you don\u2019t want to wipe the floor.\u201d You XiaoMo easily saw through his intentions. Ling Xiao was reluctant to wipe the bed down, so he would only be more reluctant to work on the floor.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao threw his cloth to the side and said in a very matter of fact way, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you know, then I won\u2019t have to find an excuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt his lips twitch into an irritated smile. It\u2019s not like you need an excuse to not do anything you don\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t called being honest, it was called being an asshole!</p><br/><p>Asshole Ling Xiao immediately took over the now cleaned bed and stretched out lazily.</p><br/><p>However, he still ended up listening to Ling Xiao. The floor was too dirty. If they had the mops of the twenty first century, it would make things easier, but they didn\u2019t, so they could only use their own hands. Thank god they would only be here for three days.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, Tian Xin finally came to get them.</p><br/><p>The people from the Mage Guild also came along. Who knew what was going on in An Qiao\u2019s head to make him willing accompany You XiaoMo and company to see the arena.</p><br/><p>The Giganticus had a total of a hundred floors and, every ten floors, there would be a massive arena right in the center of the floor that was sort of like the Colosseum of Ancient Rome. Whenever the tri-monthly challenges happened, people would flood the place.</p><br/><p>For this, XiaoYao Institute had a rule: challengers could only challenge people within ten floors of themselves, so even if one\u2019s strength was far more formidable, you couldn\u2019t get to the top floor immediately.</p><br/><p>However, there was little point in watching matches that weren\u2019t on floor seventy and above. The truly exciting matches all happened in the higher floors, and those battles were truly battles that would make one\u2019s blood roar.</p><br/><p>Floors seventy to one hundred were different from the lower floors. The three arenas were merged into one, so the tri-monthly challenges would all occur in one arena, which became the liveliest place in Giganticus.</p><br/><p>However, not all people could go and spectate for free. People who weren\u2019t yet at floor seventy or above had to pay one point to enter. One point per day.</p><br/><p>Since they had just arrived, they couldn\u2019t access the arenas of the upper floors yet.</p><br/><p>Thus, Tian Xin took them to the arena on the fiftieth floor.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

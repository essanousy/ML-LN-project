Envious of his good fortune to have a master who loved him and unreservedly provided the materials and soul and skill training manuals needed for cultivation. Jealous of his potential to already be a Grade One Rainbow Level mage at the young age of twenty five.</p><br/><p>Yet, the early years of his life was miserable and bumpy. He had to depend on his own perseverance and he finally managed to successfully advance to Rainbow Level when he was on the verge of reaching one hundred years of age. If he had such convenient conditions, he too could have advanced in his twenties like Su Lang, and become a genius that was envied by all.</p><br/><p>The reason why Su Lang was able to get the attention of their master was closely related to the fact that he had an infinite supply of materials when he was young. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to have advanced so quickly. In the end, he caught Shifu\u2019s eye and was then accepted as a disciple.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui tried hard to calm the rolling thoughts in his heart. When he raised his head, a smile that showed love and respect as good brothers should hung on his face once more, \u201cShidi, everyone has their own fate. Your luck is indeed incomparable with mine, but you are really unworthy of the title of the TongTian Continent\u2019s Number One Genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Lang was immediately enraged by his words. Flames shot from his eyes as he grabbed Yan Hui\u2019s collar in a fit of discombobulation and snarled, \u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense! Then you tell me, how am I unworthy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was praised as the Number One Genius in the TongTian Continent from an early age. He had completely taken the title as his possession now that his future was becoming even more brilliant. Yet, Yan Hui was saying that he was not the Number One Genius of TongTian Continent, how could he believe it!</p><br/><p>Yan Hui grabbed his hand and pried Su Lang\u2019s fingers off his collar one by one with a serene smile on his face, \u201cShidi, you know that I, your Shixiong, used to be a student in XiaoYao Institution. How could the XiaoYao Institution rise abruptly to become the number one educational institute in the TongTian Continent without some capability and skill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?!\u201d Su Lang shook his hand off with an expression of loathing.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui was not hopeful about his intelligence, so he continued, \u201cThat means, there are no lack of geniuses in the XiaoYao Institution. As far as I know, there\u2019s one person who is better suited to be the Number One Genius in the TongTian Continent. He\u2019s the one who is worthy of the title.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Lang was stunned, but he still didn\u2019t believe it despite Yan Hui declaring it so solemnly. He just thought Yan Hui was fooling him and immediately sneered, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you say who is the one who is more worthy of being the Number One Genius than I am?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know that I have two objectives for going to XiaoYao Institution this time right?\u201d Yan Hui leisurely began.</p><br/><p>Although this topic was a little like increasing another\u2019s spirit and extinguishing one\u2019s own prestige, what harm would there be in doing it if he was able to see the confidence and pride slowly collapse on Su Lang\u2019s face!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know. But what does that have to do with this? Don\u2019t tell me that the genius you speak of is one of them?\u201d Su Lang looked contemptuous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Yan Hui turned around and looked at him with a clear gaze as a elated smile bloomed on his face, \u201cThe person I\u2019m talked about is named You XiaoMo. The evaluation of his soul showed six colors when we both became students of XiaoYao Institution. Although his test was accidentally interrupted, everyone knew that his soul was already seven colors. Furthermore, he is not even twenty-five years old, but do you know how high his cultivation base is now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Lang\u2019s expression twisted uglily.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui deliberately said in a nasty tone. \u201cHe is already\u2026 Grade Two Rainbow Level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Su Lang\u2019s eyes turned red with anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fact and it can\u2019t be helped if you don\u2019t believe it. You\u2019re only Grade One at twenty-five years old. By the time he reaches your age, he\u2019ll probably be at Grade Three or Four. You\u2019ll never be able to catch up no matter what.\u201d It was as if Yan Hui thought that Su Lang did not suffer enough blows.</p><br/><p>Su Lang, who was originally too angry to speak, suddenly laughed.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui frowned, \u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Lang sneered, \u201cI was almost deceived by you. You also have to do it decently if you want to fabricate a lie. It\u2019s impossible for him to advance in just a few years even if he is a genius. I believe that you have also experienced this. How can it be that easy for Rainbow Level mages to advance? Don\u2019t even speak of Grade Two, even advancing Grade One is not necessarily possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui thought what was he laughing at. He would not believe it himself if he had not seen with his own eyes how someone actually considered advancement as easy as eating. His cultivation would steadily rise whenever he came back from his trip.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui did not care about Su Lang\u2019s ridicule as he leisurely said, \u201cI remember that he seemed to be only about twenty-two years old when he just became a student. At that time, his cultivation was only at mid-grade or high-grade Level Nine though I forgot the specific details. Now, in just more one year, or two years at the maximum, he is already a Grade Two Rainbow Level mage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Lan\u2019s eyes almost popped out of his skull.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui unreservedly dealt another psychological blow to him. Su Lang really ought to be knocked off his pedestal once.</p><br/><p>Neither of them noticed that the protagonist they were talking about was hiding in a corner and had completely overheard their conversation word for word.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shyly buried his head into Ling Xiao\u2019s chest. He was a little embarrassed to hear Yan Hui praise him so much. Although Yan Hui had an ulterior motive, there was none who did not like to listen to people praising them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I am really the Number One Genius in the TongTian Continent? Hehe.\u201d The sound of giggling drifted to Ling Xiao\u2019s ears as You XiaoMo poked Ling Xiao\u2019s chest. You XiaoMo urgently needed the approval of a second person for so much flattery.</p><br/><p>There was no one else here except the for Ling Xiao so he had no choice but to resort to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really want to know?\u201d Ling Xiao had an expression of \u2018no change in expression even if Mount Tai collapses\u2019, and then he patted You XiaoMo\u2019s head when he heard his question.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo fell silent a moment, \u201c\u2026Let\u2019s forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many geniuses had their IQs linked to their status as a genius. He also had a true genius around him who specialized in dealing shocks to his confidence. You XiaoMo wondered if he was looking for abuse again.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly laughed, \u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad. I wanted to give you a compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Excuse me, may I ask if I can rewind what just happened?</p><br/><p>Back to the main point. From their dialogue, their Shifu had probably let Yan Hui go to XiaoYao Institution to monitor their behind-the-scenes movements. However, they still did not know the identity of the other side, but it was obvious that the other probably understood them. This type of situation where the enemy was hidden in the shadows while they were in the light was disadvantageous to them. Therefore, they had to verify the identity of his Shifu.</p><br/><p>The Shixiong and Shidi finally parted on bad terms. It seemed that there would no longer be any more useful information. The two immediately left the place.</p><br/><p>It was almost dawn after they returned to the hotel.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lay on the bed and rolled around a few times before stopping. He lay on his stomach to watch Ling Xiao reheat the water which had gone cold to make tea to drink. He could not refrain from lamenting, people who are able to use fire sure were different. They did not need to fear that there would be no firewood when cooking or when they wanted to eat hot food.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to drink?\u201d Ling Xiao poured a cup of steaming hot tea from the teapot.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately climbed out of bed and rolled over.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shoved the teapot into his hands, \u201cPour it yourself if you want to drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>You Xiao silently cast a despicable glare at him for a while. He wasn\u2019t even willing to pour a cup of tea for his family\u2019s wife, it\u2019s too disappointing, \u201cWill we continue to stay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you really want to know Yan Hui\u2019s purpose for approaching us?\u201d Ling Xiao drank his tea with a look of pleasure on his face. This expression really made You XiaoMo think that Ling Xiao was possessed by a ghost every time he witnessed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to know, but who knows when his Shifu will appear. We can\u2019t always be running over to monitor them every day. You have to take care of your internal injuries and I have to work hard to advance. We both don\u2019t have the time ah!\u201d You XiaoMo was quite regretful. If SheQiu and the rest were here, it would be fine.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao put down his tea cup, hinting for him to pour the tea.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo subconsciously poured it. It was only after he finished pouring that he realized that he had missed the opportunity to get revenge. He was really just too kind.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao drank a mouthful before saying, \u201cWe do not have time, but some people have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao did not answer him, but his gaze fell onto his chest.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo followed his line of sight and looked at his clothes. At some point, the Metal Swallowing Beast and the two Golden Winged Insects had poked their small heads out, wobbly hanging on his chest.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, wasn\u2019t there some readily available labor force here that was just eating and playing every day? It was definitely time for them to pull their weight, otherwise, his effort of raising them like children whose hands needed to be held while shitting and peeing would be in vain.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly remembered one thing, \u201cI remembered that Tian Dao and the rest had said before, the gold silk produced during the mating of a male and a female Golden Winged Insect would be ten times more stronger than usual. But up until now, I have not seen them in heat. How would they produce the golden silk like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao touched his chin as he pondered over it. He really did not know what to do about this too, \u201cIf you really want the golden silk, make some aphrodisiacs for them to try. As for the heavy lifting, let the Metal Swallowing Beast do it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 not too good ba.\u201d You XiaoMo touched his nose. He suddenly processed what Ling Xiao had said and was alarmed, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be referring for me to make it when you said to make some aphrodisiacs right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao calmly replied, \u201cMagic pills may not necessarily be a cure for people and their injuries. There are always some people who will invent some strange things, especially for magic pills like aphrodisiacs and such.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought of Ancestor Dan Qing\u2019s jade drive. Maybe that old fellow would have this type of pill recipe?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 I\u2019ll just give it a try\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Also, most of the captives had been freed and that wasn\u2019t just a few people, it was hundreds.</p><br/><p>No matter how many helpers the Vermillion Blood Clan had, they couldn\u2019t possibly recapture them all at once. Not to mention the fact that there were plenty of strong practitioners, who, like a horse without a leash, went wild.</p><br/><p>They had endured it for too long and so the moment they were given their freedom, there was no way they were going back in again. Thus, they risked their lives in defiance.</p><br/><p>To create more chaos in the manor, before Ling Xiao left the Forbidden Area, he injured all of guard leaders who were relatively stronger, thus reducing the overall defensive power by half. That, of course meant that they were no match for the prisoners and apparently one or two leaders were killed.</p><br/><p>The prisoners escaped the Forbidden Area in waves of madness, all yelling as they surged to the exit. The guards who rushed over were no matter, some were even brutally murdered. Screams rose and fell in waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at this moment a force of insurmountable strength rose to the sky and came along with it a furious roar. Those prisoners who had escaped the furthest were suddenly all flipped over and in front of where they stopped, appeared a person.</p><br/><p>The one who came had furrowed brows and a burning gaze but also a face that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were quite familiar with.</p><br/><p>He was one of the original Ten gods, You AnTai. After he was defeated by Ling Xiao, he stayed in the stone room of the Vermillion Blood Clan to closed-door cultivated, never stepping a foot out.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t detected the uproar from the Forbidden Area, he wouldn\u2019t have come out early.</p><br/><p>The ruffian and the others, after noticing You AnTai\u2019s arrival, immediately gave up on their tangle with others and ran in different directions. Although You AnTai has been dropped off of the Ten God Ranking, he was still a level seven peak practitioner, whereas the ruffian was only a level three, he wasn\u2019t a match at all.</p><br/><p>Without a sliver of hesitation, You AnTai chased after the ruffian because he was currently the one with the highest level. They couldn\u2019t let any strong practitioners escape, otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take their revenge on the Vermillion Blood Clan. What a big family feared the most wasn\u2019t when their enemies were lurking in the shadows, but they were in the light.</p><br/><p>The others were chased by the two brothers, You Dan and You Shuang. They were simply injured, but not enough that they didn\u2019t have any ounce of fighting power left.</p><br/><p>Once You AnTai left, Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo, who concealed themselves, appeared in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stared in the direction of their departure.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tilted his head to look at his expression, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re not thinking of following them to kill them, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao let out a chuckle, \u201cYou feel it\u2019s not okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a bit of pondering You XiaoMo said, \u201cNo, not okay per say, but wouldn\u2019t it hinder our plan? We haven\u2019t found out where Feng ChiYun is yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, as to where Feng ChiYun could be, I have a good guess. I\u2019ll tell you when we get out.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glared at him, he really wanted to ask now.</p><br/><p>Then, the two of them followed the direction of someone\u2019s departure.</p><br/><p>You TaiAn was very fast and the ruffian, since he had been captured for so long, with no improvements in his level, was caught up to after a while. A three star versus a seven star, there was no suspense.</p><br/><p>With an unwilling face, the ruffian shouted in rage. He had finally been given a chance to escape but his freedom, to his surprise, wasn\u2019t even a hour long, how could he be satisfied?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Long, if I can catch you once I can catch you again. And like I said before, your whole life can only be spent down in the Forbidden Area.\u201d As if he was Satan himself, You AnTai said to You Long with naked scorn in his tone and attitude.</p><br/><p>You Long was already disheartened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, You AnTai, you spoke my mind, if I can defeat you once, I can defeat you twice.\u201d A voice abruptly interjected.</p><br/><p>You AnTai was taken aback, why did this voice sound so familiar?</p><br/><p>Then, he saw a face he would never forget in his life, it was Ling Mo, who had defeated him in the June Mountain Ranges. If it wasn\u2019t for him, he wouldn\u2019t be at the main house of the Vermillion Blood Clan but on his way to the banquet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s me.\u201d Ling Xiao looked at him with half closed eyes.</p><br/><p>But just as You Long looked up with bewilderment, Ling Xiao returned to his original appearance. In each hand appeared a sliver of fire, purple and red, the temperature around them instantly went up by a few hundred degrees.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, You AnTai saw a different fire and as if something broke through his brain; purple and red, QiLin Sacred fire and Demon Phoenix Sacred fire\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, it was you!\u201d You AnTai finally recalled, Ling Mo and You XiaoHa were actually Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo, who the Vermillion Blood Clan had been searching for all along.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, but too late!\u201d Ling Xiao said with appreciation.</p><br/><p>Feeling his killing intent, You AnTai said with a cold laugh, \u201cAlthough you did defeat me, it won\u2019t be easy to kill me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed in a deep voice, \u201cAbout that, we\u2019ll see after we try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You AnTai opened his mouth but before he could say anything, a vast sea of pressure rolled over and covered him, as if he was an ant crushed below a mountain. His soul force was out of his control he couldn\u2019t even begin to resist. He had only felt this kind of feeling from one person before and that was the old head, You ZhenTian!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao watched on with amusement as You AnTai\u2019s expression changed from that of composure to one of twisted fear, \u201cThen, let the show begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, Ling Xiao took You XiaoMo and left the underground.</p><br/><p>You Long stared dumbfounded at their direction. Was this the power of a Sacred level practitioner? You AnTai couldn\u2019t even last a few minutes and just died like that?</p><br/><p>Sensing that many people were headed his way, You Long finally regained his senses and, without further delay, quickly left this trouble ridden place.</p><br/><p>This riot that happened within the Forbidden Area caused an irreparable loss to the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>Out of one hundred or so prisoners, forty percent of them got away and that included a few strong practitioners from the ninth floor. But what was the most shocking was the death of the Iron Blood God, You AnTai.</p><br/><p>When the guard team arrived, all they saw was him with dismembered limbs in a pool of blood.</p><br/><p>Such a strong practitioner, who had run wild in the Tong Tian Continent for thousands of years, had died, just like that and within the main house too.</p><br/><p>Once two of the masters heard the news and arrived, the chaos was already at its closing stages. Seeing the estate, as if it was run over by a horde of wild pigs, in such an unbearable condition, the masters were furious saying that they would find the culprit and right the name of the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>Soon after, they quickly told others to lock down the Vermillion Blood City.</p><br/><p>However, this was to no effect. Once the main group arrived, the guards at the gate were either dead or injured. The culprits had already escaped the city.</p><br/><p>Later on, they were able to lock in on Ling Xiao and the others by their entry records, however, they were clearly using fake names thus they had no where to start looking.</p><br/><p>At this point in time, Ling Xiao and three others were on their way to the banquet.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The Southern Continent\u2019s north side was the headquarters of the Cang Alliance. Here, it was not sorted by cities and towns but were instead considered to all be part of the alliance. Once in their field of influence, one had to follow their rules, even if they were from the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>For the little ShiDi\u2019s birthday banquet, it was held at Amaranthine mountain, the same as last year.</p><br/><p>The Amaranthine mountain was an enormous mountain from the Jia Lan Mountain Range as well as being the headquarters of the Cang Alliance. Only the head of the alliance and his beloved disciple could hold their celebrations here.</p><br/><p>As it became closer to the birthday banquet, the Amaranthine Mountain was busier by tens of times. Numerous flows of light arrived at the Jia Lan Mountain Range, heading towards the headquarters at the peak of Amaranthine mountain.</p><br/><p>These usually rarely seen elites were arriving like cabbage. As they came one after another, it became a feast for the eyes for the onlookers. Since one needed an invitation to go in the banquet, many were blocked outside and could only watch in envy at those who swaggered in.</p><br/><p>Four streaks of light flashed across the sky and landed at the base of the Amaranthine mountain.</p><br/><p>The four were Ling Xiao and the others, who arrived just in time before the banquet started.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked on the Amaranthine mountain in surprise, the mountain was huge but uniquely short. Compared with the mountain peaks around it, it suddenly became the only shorty out of a group of tall people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that, Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan hesitated a little, \u201cCan we go in without an invitation?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cIt should be fine, the Cang Alliance didn\u2019t say how many guests you could bring with one invitation. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the two hesitated no longer. If it was as Ling Xiao said, Feng ChiYun was truly brought along by You ZhenTian, then he must be on the Amaranthine mountain. Yin Ge didn\u2019t want to stay at the bottom, aimlessly waiting.</p><br/><p>Although the mountain was short, the distance to the peak was not short.</p><br/><p>Five minutes later, the flying four landed at a spacious area on the peak. The peak was even noisier than the bottom, on the open road, only a few walked in the middle. These were the ones with status and power and on the sides were the onlookers, here for the entertainment.</p><br/><p>Looking at them, the crowd would sporadically let out waves of whispers, although quiet, but with that many people, it quickly became bustling with noise.</p><br/><p>At the end of the road was an entrance with disciples of the Cang Alliance who were there to enforce order. To prevent the possibility of counterfeit invitations, their inspections were quite detailed.</p><br/><p>The line was short so it didn\u2019t take long before it was their turn.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

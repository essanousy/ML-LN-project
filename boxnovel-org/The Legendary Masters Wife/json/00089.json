You XiaoMo is almost certain of his status. He should be one of the legendary guards of Yun Shui peak. It\u2019s just that this Elder\u2019s outer appearance is seriously different from the image he conjured up in his mind.</p><br/><p>After taking them outside the estate, the boy once again disappears soundlessly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is already used to seeing strange things so he just walks inside with Ling Xiao, going according to the path they used the last time. Right in front of the large magic herb field is a small hut. At this moment, Ling Xiao who is walking in front stops suddenly. You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t notice and bumps his head right into his back. Rubbing his hurting nose, he is just about to open his mouth when Ling Xiao suddenly covers his mouth.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raises his head and uses his eyes to ask, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao mouths those words, not caring if You XiaoMo understands. He pricks up his ears listening to the movements in the small hut.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks over at the wooden hut that is still over thirty meters away. His lips twitch as he pouts.</p><br/><p>After a while, Ling Xiao removes his hand from You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth and signals for him to continue walking.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo receives the message. Knowing that they can start talking, he quickly asks, \u201cWhat happened just now? Don\u2019t tell me there was someone else in the wooden hut besides Uncle Ye? But no one came out <i>ah</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person has left. It\u2019s not strange that you didn\u2019t see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t hide it from him, continuing, \u201cThey were talking about you. That person was sent by Tang Fan. Tang Fan heard that Ye Han wanted to accept you as an apprentice so he sent someone to convince him not to take you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks, a little upset.</p><br/><p>Why is it that everyone doesn\u2019t want him to be Uncle Ye\u2019s apprentice? Although he knows in his heart, but hearing it from the mouth of others, he still feels very wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis you still have to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glances at him and continues lightly, \u201cYe Han is someone that everyone in TianXin sect wants to get on their side. Even Tang Fan is no exception. The only peak that is closely linked to Tang Fan is Heaven peak. Although he is the Grand Master of TianXin sect, he still wishes for the person by Ye Han\u2019s side to be someone from Heaven peak. Furthermore, you\u2019re from Earth peak, for him to agree, that would be strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts exaggeratedly, \u201cClearly I\u2019m also a disciple of TianXin sect \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sneers coldly and says lightly, \u201cTang Fan isn\u2019t as fair and impartial as you imagine. He is only an ordinary person, with selfish motives and desires. On top of that, he has been on top for a long time. No matter how noble and lofty, one would still be reduced to some small selfish man. Furthermore, Tang Fan was never a saint. Wait until you\u2019ve seen it a few more times, you\u2019ll slowly get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts. He has absolutely no desire to get used to it. This world is too treacherous. He wants to go back to Earth!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear what that person said to Uncle Ye?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks.</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, Ling Xiao can\u2019t help hooking his arm over You XiaoMo\u2019s shoulder, one finger tilting his jaw upwards, saying frivolously, \u201cOf course. Although he put up a barrier outside, the level is nothing difficult for me. You want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts and pouts. Why does he feel like he is being molested? It must be that he got up the wrong way from the bed this morning. Otherwise, why would he have this absurd misconception?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sees that he doesn\u2019t respond but still doesn\u2019t feel put out, \u201cActually you can guess without me having to tell you. That person used the excuse that you only entered TianXin sect for less than two months so you don\u2019t have a service record. He wants Ye Han to forget about taking you in as an apprentice and let Tang YunQi take your place. But Ye Shan is also not <b>someone that is easy to deal with</b>. He insisted that other than you, no one else would do. That person received orders from Tang Fan so of course he wouldn\u2019t ease up. In the end, he said that your background is dubious and that you may be a spy. They spoke until they heard your footsteps, then that person left. That\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo can\u2019t help but pout three times over. Why does it seem like those last words is putting the blame on him? He is only a puny little mage. There\u2019s no need to add those amazing and fearsome things to his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in <i>ba</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Han\u2019s voice comes from the hut.</p><br/><p>Only then does You XiaoMo realize that he has unconsciously walked right up to the hut so he just pushes the door and walks in with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ye Han stands in front of a rack of magic herbs, with his back facing them, as if he is putting the magic herbs in order. Hearing the door open, he turns around. His face is calm, just like how he appeared three days ago. As if he is not the least big angry with what just happened half a minute ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what do you think about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Han doesn\u2019t like to talk in a roundabout way, <b>getting straight to the point</b> after sitting down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glances at Ling Xiao who gives him a slight smile. He quickly shifts his gaze and hesitates for a bit before saying, \u201cUncle Ye, I am very happy that you appreciate a nobody like me but I have been granted your undeserved kindness. I think I\u2019m not fit for this position. So, I think that it should be given to someone that needs it more than me.</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, Ye Han isn\u2019t surprised. He only looks at him for a while before sighing softly, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve already heard about it. Three days ago, I was indeed too rash. I didn\u2019t consider how this matter would cause problems for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that Uncle Ye.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hears those words bearing responsibility and is alarmed, \u201cI never felt that this matter is troublesome, it\u2019s just that, it\u2019s just that \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>After racking his brains, You XiaoMo still can\u2019t figure out what he should say so he can only look at Ling Xiao at his side.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sees his imploring gaze and is very happy that he immediately thinks of him. As for the possibility that it is because there are only the three of them here, so You XiaoMo has no other choice, Ling Xiao chooses to single-mindedly ignore that fact altogether.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ye, this matter, I trust you know more about it than the both of us. Your position is very unique. The person by your side, be it disciple or apprentice, they must be proven to be a hundred percent devoted to TianXin sect. But You XiaoMo is different. He still hasn\u2019t inherited the canons of TianXin sect, making it obvious that TianXin sect does not trust him. For this type of disciple to be able to come in and out of Yun Shui peak, it\u2019s not just the Grand Master that won\u2019t agree, even those old fogies up there would probably not agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shui peak is like the heart of TianXin sect. Touch one hair and it would affect the whole body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes <i>ah</i>, Uncle Ye, if you really need an apprentice, my Elder brother and Second brother can do. They are both level four mages. Their experience is richer than mine, definitely will do a better job than me. Really. If you don\u2019t believe, you can test them.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly chimes in. He now understands Ling Xiao\u2019s analysis. Truthfully, it would be extremely difficult for him to walk this road of an apprentice. Rather than charging ahead obstinately, wouldn\u2019t it be better for him to give this opportunity to Elder brother and Second brother? This way, the opportunity wouldn\u2019t be wasted.</p><br/><p>Ye Han doesn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. It\u2019s obviously such a serious topic but hearing him speak this way he can\u2019t maintain the seriousness. He actually feels that this little disciple is worried that he would compromise thus losing out on this good opportunity so he hurriedly pitched his Big brothers.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hears him still constantly thinking about his Elder brother and is just about to flip out when he suddenly gets a flash of inspiration. He then gives a push before Ye Han starts to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ye, what Little brother says is right. I have met those two brothers. Their characters are indeed pretty good when compared to others. Elder brother Fang ChenLe is a gentle and amiable person that is very approachable. His popularity is also quite high. Second brother Fu ZiLin although a little cold, he is very serious when it comes to doing things. If you were to accept the both of them, I can guarantee that you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, You XiaoMo stares wide-eyed in surprise at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s hard to believe that Ling Xiao would speak on behalf of his Big brothers. He somehow remembers that Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t seem to like Elder brother very much. Furthermore, his understanding of those two is even deeper than his!</p><br/><p>The ones surprised is not just You XiaoMo. There\u2019s also Ye Han.</p><br/><p>But Ye Han is not like You XiaoMo, showing his inner thoughts on his face. He is only shocked in his heart.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao is actually recommending someone, and people from Earth peak on top of that. If Tang Fan finds out, he would most probably be angered to death by this disciple. But it must be said that this Ling Xiao is really more to his liking. If Tang Fan really gets angered, then wouldn\u2019t that be good!</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ye, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks cautiously.</p><br/><p>Ye Han almost can\u2019t keep a straight face. This is the first time a junior has dared to speak to him like that. On top of that, asking him what is his decision. It can\u2019t be that that one short moment is all the time he is given to consider?</p><br/><p>Although the impression Ye Han has of the both of them is not bad, he can\u2019t decide on such a big thing in such a short time. If not, certain people would definitely get anxious.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t give you an answer on this matter right now. How about this <i>ba</i>. Find a time for them to come by and I will test them personally. If they can impress me, I will accept them as apprentices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Han says.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m very grateful. I will let them know.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo says immediately, his face showing both happiness and surprise.</p><br/><p>Ye Han shakes his head. He has not seen this type of pure happiness for the sake of his brothers getting an opportunity, actually beaming with happiness from the inside, for a long time now. It\u2019s a pity \u2026\u2026. it\u2019s a pity that he already has a Master. If not, taking him as a disciple is probably not a bad decision. Thinking of this, Ye Han is inwardly shocked. He has not thought about taking a disciple for a very long time. And now, this young man that he has only met twice can make him think this way, it\u2019s really very shocking!</p><br/><p>The one that doesn\u2019t know that he just missed out on a gigantic opportunity, You XiaoMo, is currently pulling Ling Xiao along down the mountain, full of excitement, seeming as if he urgently wants to share the good news with his Big brothers.</p><br/><p><b>Notes:</b>lamp that doesn\u2019t burn much oil \u2013 someone that is easy to deal withopen door see mountain \u2013 get straight to the point</p><br/>\n</div>"}

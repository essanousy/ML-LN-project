The sky was just brightening when Ling Xiao finally dragged You XiaoMo back to the cabin. Even if he had never seen this world\u2019s ocean at night, he still shouldn\u2019t behave so foolishly; it would pull his IQ down further.</p><br/><p>At noon, the sunlight became harsh.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo left the cabin to get some air. It was lunchtime; though he had food in his pocket dimension, but he had gotten sick of always eating those things.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo found a crew member and asked after the location of the kitchen. On his way over, he thought of what he would make, having decided to cook it himself.</p><br/><p>Speaking of culinary ability, it was something he had taught himself from when he was young.</p><br/><p>Since they rarely seemed to care about him, the young You XiaoMo wanted to do something to attract the attention of his parents. He wasn\u2019t very smart back then, so he chose to cook, and definitely regretted it afterwards, because he didn\u2019t get his parents\u2019 attention, but instead You Lu and You Bai. From then on, he lived a miserable life.</p><br/><p>Whenever he was free, You Lu and You Bai would make him cook for them. They were especially picky eaters and forced his culinary skills to improve to more or less the level of a five star chef.</p><br/><p>But since he came to this world, he found that he hadn\u2019t ever cooked Ling Xiao a meal before.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought over it and decided to cook something while he had the tools necessary, so that he wouldn\u2019t commit the same failure like his first time cooking Thousand Spirit Earth Sheep.</p><br/><p>There was only one chef in the kitchen, called Wan, and his assistant. He was in charge of cooking meals for the sailors and captain of the merchant ship. With twenty to thirty people, he cooked in massive pots.</p><br/><p>By eleven o\u2019clock, lunch had been made already. So the kitchen was empty. However, Chef Wan and his assistant were eating at the door of the kitchen. They always ate separately from the crew.</p><br/><p>\u201cChef Wan, can I borrow the kitchen?\u201d You XiaoMo walked in front of Chef Wan and gave him a few spirit gems.</p><br/><p>With the five spirit gems, Chef Wan nodded. They were normal humans, and five spirit gems was enough to purchase everything in the kitchen. This was the first time he had ever met a practitioner that cooked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo entered the kitchen and looked around at what ingredients were present.</p><br/><p>The crew weren\u2019t vegetarians and their work required a lot of energy, so the ingredients consisted of primarily meat. There were even a few live chickens and ducks in the cages on the ground.</p><br/><p>Rather some contemplation, You XiaoMo eventually decided to make three meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes, as well as a soup and dessert.</p><br/><p>Killing live chickens was something he had done before as an ordinary human, so the first dish was spicy and sour chicken. This dish tasted fresh and salty, while the sourness and spice melted in your mouth. It was definitely suitable for Ling Xiao who preferred meat. The only thing was that he didn\u2019t know if his lack of practice these few years had caused his culinary skills to regress or not.</p><br/><p>He bustled around the kitchen, not noticing that the Chef Wan and his assistant outside had been lured in by the aroma. Watching You XiaoMo cooking with practiced swiftness, the two looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Six dishes and the dessert took You XiaoMo a mere hour to finish. And he had done this by himself. The kitchen was already filled with a mouthwatering aroma.</p><br/><p>Chef Wan and his assistant were already drooling all over the place.</p><br/><p>Observing the finished product, You XiaoMo sighed in relief. His skills hadn\u2019t deteriorated; his blades had not dulled. However, it would be a little troublesome to take all the dishes back himself.</p><br/><p>That was when You XiaoMo noticed Chef Wan and his assistant. Seeing them staring directly at his food, he had an idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Wan, can you help us bring the food to the room? In return, I\u2019ll let you have some of what I just made; how does that sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Chef Wan\u2019s assistant wiped his drool away. He had noticed that there were leftovers in You XiaoMo\u2019s pot. Even if the other didn\u2019t suggest it, he would\u2019ve still taken the initiative to help.</p><br/><p>Before leaving the kitchen, the assistant hid the leftovers You XiaoMo made to prevent others from eating everything while they were delivering the dishes. That would be terrible.</p><br/><p>Then, the two carried three dishes each towards the cabin at a swift pace.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was a little slower, washing the grease from his hands and face before leaving with the dessert and cutlery. Just as he arrived at the cabin, three people walked out, heading in the opposite direction. These people were also outsiders like him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at them briefly, calmly walking past them.</p><br/><p>Chef Wan and his assistant just happened to be coming back from the room and greeted him in a hurry before heading back to the kitchen.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pushed open the door and walked inside. Ling Xiao was looking at the dishes on the bed strangely. They had to be put on the bed since there was no table.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou made this?\u201d Ling Xiao asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo proudly lifted his chin. \u201cOf course I made it, who else did you think it was?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced up at him. \u201cI thought it was that chef.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo set down the dessert and tableware, shoving a pair of chopsticks into his hand. He said, \u201cThe food that Chef Wan cooks is nowhere near as good as mine. I made everything. They were drooling over it. If you don\u2019t believe it, then try some.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s chopsticks went towards the spicy and sour chicken without shame. Though the ingredients were very normal, it had a mouthwatering scent, something that was just his taste.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d You XiaoMo stared at him with bright eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cFinally, you at least have something going for you; my hope was not in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Should I thank you for having hope for me?</p><br/><p>Though he showed no mercy in his words, the dishes were quickly picked clean by Ling Xiao. This time, Ling Xiao ate even more than he did, his actions providing You XiaoMo with some comfort at last.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, dinner is on you.\u201d The stated Ling Xiao suddenly said this as You XiaoMo was about to walk out, plates in hand.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked back at him and said, proudly, \u201cThat depends on my mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he strutted out like a peacock.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gazed after him as he left, a smile curling on his lips. How vindictive!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo only just walked into the kitchen when he saw Chef Wan and his assistant staring at a pot with dejection written all over their faces.</p><br/><p>It was the pot the assistant had hidden.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened with you?\u201d You XiaoMo asked in passing.</p><br/><p>The little assistant sighed and complained, \u201cI deliberately hid the food. I didn\u2019t expect it to still be eaten by others. They sure are annoying, eating what belongs to others without their consent.\u201d Although the other party gave them a spirit gem in compensation, but who cared about that? Those arrogant bastards.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Chef Wan stopped his complaints, not wanting to be overheard by that group. They were only normal people, after all.</p><br/><p>The assistant grimaced.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t pursue it, setting the tableware down before leaving.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a saint; he couldn\u2019t go and teach those guys a lesson just because they ate someone else\u2019s food, and those people had compensated the two for it with a spirit gem.</p><br/><p>The assistant knew that it was impossible, too. He was just complaining.</p><br/><p>Returning to the room, You XiaoMo originally wanted to take advantage of this time at sea to practice making a first grade rainbow pill. A few days ago, he had traded some magic herbs with Tian Xiu, and now he had two more ingredients for a pill. But at the thought of what a rainbow pill\u2019s creation would bring with it, he gave up on this idea. The sea was a dangerous place, and if he lured in a disaster, the ship might capsize. That would be terrible.</p><br/><p>Seeing him so conflicted, Ling Xiao said, \u201cHow about we cultivate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like that\u2019s all we can do.\u201d Due to his recent breakthrough, he wasn\u2019t expecting another any time soon. But he hadn\u2019t had time to stabilize his power yet after the breakthrough.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked to the side of the bed. Seeing how Ling Xiao had taken up two thirds of the space, he said, \u201cMove over a little, give me some space.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly pulled him into his arms, \u201cWhat space. Just sit here.\u201d</p><br/><p>With his fleshy butt against the other man\u2019s leg, You XiaoMo immediately realized what kind of cultivation Ling Xiao was talking about. He hadn\u2019t picked up Ling Xiao\u2019s train of thought, thinking that the other was referring to meditation.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly stood up, but was pulled back again. He turned and smiled foolishly at the other man, \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the day, and we\u2019re in someone else\u2019s bed, don\u2019t mess around. Don\u2019t you want to eat my food tonight? It\u2019ll be delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao frowned and thought for second before saying with lament, \u201cThat\u2019s true. I guess I have no choice\u2026 but to forgo dinner. It isn\u2019t like anything will happen if I miss a meal, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end, he gave You XiaoMo a smile.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d No, my ass!</p><br/><p>In the end, of course, he was unable to escape. Fortunately, Ling Xiao just pulled off his underwear and did it once. At first, he thought that Ling Xiao just wanted to sedate his lust, but when he felt the colors in his sea of consciousness begin to spin, he found that Ling Xiao really did want to cultivate with him \u2026 As if. He dared to bet that cultivation was only second to the primary motive: lust.</p><br/><p>Ra: Once again the wife has won over the husband through the stomach route &gt;_&gt;</p><br/><p>Addis: Let me know if you guys want me to write out a recipe for the chicken.

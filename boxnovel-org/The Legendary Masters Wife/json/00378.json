Like a monster in hibernation, it was filled with infinite spatial force that made one\u2019s heart palpitate. Just a tiny bit of force was enough to kill a Spiritual Realm practitioner.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had a sense of deadly crisis coming from all directions when he entered the tunnel. He could only see an area within a hundred meters radius. Despite this, it was enough to shock him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo enveloped his eyes with his soul power and was now able to see the constant pressure of the spatial force. It was as if there were tiny and incorporeal sharp weapons. All the things floating in the space were swept over and shredded into dust in a split second. If that had been a person, there was bound to be no bones left\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned back and looked at Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan.</p><br/><p>A faint layer of milky white light was released from their entire bodies. This should be the effect of the Space Stone. The two did not panic as they had already experienced this once.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo did notice that Yin Ge\u2019s appearance was slightly different from usual.</p><br/><p>The biggest difference was in his eyes. The color had changed from black to silver and his round black pupils had changed to vertical silts. Though there was no expression on his face, those pair of eyes still showed a hint of ferociousness that belonged to the Serpent King. Yin Ge\u2019s strength steadily rose after rousing the bloodline of the Serpent King in his body, and directly skipped over the eighth level. He was now at the threshold of the ninth level, and was even faintly approaching the tenth level.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, how long will it take for us to reach the end?\u201d You XiaoMo withdrew his gaze and lifted his head to look at Ling Xiao. Three days had passed since they entered the spatial tunnel. But not even a slight hint of light could be seen from the front. It was evident they were quite a distance from the exit.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had been worried that Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan could not take it anymore, but when he saw their leisurely behavior, he knew that his worries were superfluous.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt our current speed, we\u2019ll take one and a half months to reach the end. Bear in mind that this is a conservative estimate.\u201d Ling Xiao replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just too long ba!\u201d You XiaoMo disappointedly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cProvided there are no unforeseen events, this is already the fastest time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by unforeseen events?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan\u2019s voice drifted from behind, \u201cIt means a spatial storm. Spatial storms are characteristic to the spatial tunnels and it\u2019s extremely dangerous. I\u2019ve heard that spatial storms are constructed entirely of spatial forces. It\u2019ll appear once every year. Even an Emperor Realm expert will find it hard to survive once they encounter this kind of thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo mused and happily replied soon after, \u201cSince it occurs once every year, then our chances of encountering this spatial storm is very low. There\u2019s no need to worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Zhan YuXuan smiled and nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to encounter it unless there\u2019s a character so inferior that they are hated greatly by both man and God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like there\u2019s definitely someone among you both whose character is so inferior that they are hated greatly by both man and God.\u201d Zhan YuXuan had finished speaking when Ling Xiao\u2019s voice languidly drifted over as they stopped progressing.</p><br/><p>The three looked in the direction he was gazing at. At about hundred meters in front, the spatial forces were like a gale as they tore each other apart. An ear-piercing sound emitted as it rotated without stopping like a tornado. This whirlwind was getting larger and larger as the distance drew nearer.</p><br/><p>This was a spatial storm!</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan and You XiaoMo looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan gently chuckled, \u201cI think my character is not so bad. I didn\u2019t meet any spatial storms the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ducked his head, \u201cMy character has always been good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two simultaneously looked at Yin Ge after shirking responsibilities. Although they did not say anything, their meaning was very obvious \u2013 you are the one.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge calmly shot a glance at the two, \u201cJinxes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d You XiaoMo resignedly broke the silence after a long while.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao closed his eyes and when he opened them again, the color of his eyes changed into a deep and mysterious violet, \u201cEveryone stand behind me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the spatial tunnel, which was filled with spatial forces all around. Thus, one could not open their dimension even if they had one as it would cause a disruption in the space. Such a disruption had a high probability of collapsing the spatial tunnel.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan followed his instructions and flew behind Ling Xiao. You XiaoMo was then temporarily passed over to the two.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo promptly urged, \u201cLing Xiao, you be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked back and faintly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>The front of the tunnel was blocked entirely by the dense spatial storm. Even a chink could not be seen. It was impossible to take another route, so there was only one method \u2013 that was to force their way through.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cI will use my flames to create a two meter wide fire dome. Remember not to take a single step out of the fire dome. Otherwise, even I would not be able to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three solemnly nodded.</p><br/><p>Just as they had finished speaking, the spatial storm had drawn nearer and was just ten meters ahead. The powerful gravitational force seemed as if it was going to suck them all in. Except for Ling Xiao, You XiaoMo and the two hurried to stabilize their footing.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a blood-curdling shriek sounded out with no warning.</p><br/><p>The sound came from their left. Following that, not only was there one scream, a series of screams were heard. However, it disappeared after a few seconds and only the howl of the fatal spatial storm remained.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-w-w \u2026what happened? There\u2019re still people here?\u201d You XiaoMo was so scared that he started stammering.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cSomeone encountered a spatial storm like us. It seems like they\u2019re all dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wiped his cold sweat. This was too savage!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone be careful, the spatial storm is about to hit us.\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s stern voice suddenly sounded. There was a seriousness in his voice that was usually not present, it appeared that he was paying great attention to the threat of the spatial storm.</p><br/><p>Just as he finished speaking, the spatial storm howled and engulfed the four inside. Purple flames were torn apart inside the storm, but the dome of flames still progressed forward at a uniform velocity no matter how it distorted.</p><br/><p>If someone saw this, they would definitely be gobsmacked.</p><br/><p>To be so calm even when encountering a spatial storm, this person was definitely a phoenix feather and unicorn horn existence.</p><br/><p>t/n: phoenix feather and unicorn horn means an extremely rare object</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, those who could become eyewitnesses were all dead.</p><br/><p>A thin layer of sweat appeared on Ling Xiao\u2019s forehead after four hours. Regardless of how capable he was, even he would find it difficult to release his lifebound flame for a constant period to ward off the spatial storm. Furthermore, the rate of the consumption of his spiritual energy was too fast.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was incessantly worried upon seeing this. Thinking about the spiritual water in his dimension, he was in a flurry as he immediately took out a bottle of spiritual water from his magic bag. There were only ten drops inside, but it was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao could feel his internal spiritual energy starting to recover after drinking the spiritual water.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao redoubled his efforts and after an hour, they had finally passed through the spatial storm. The devastating spatial storm gradually drifted further behind them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and the two momentarily sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, are you okay?\u201d You XiaoMo asked anxiously as he made Yin Ge release him before throwing himself onto Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. I just used up too much spiritual energy. I\u2019ll be fine after resting.\u201d There was a faint smile on Ling Xiao\u2019s face. Although only five hours had passed, his spiritual energy had been depleted by ninety percent. There would be no problem as long as they did not meet another spatial storm.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frowned, \u201cIf I knew about this earlier, I would have prepared more spiritual water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao unobtrusively glanced at Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan at the rear upon hearing this. The two looked the same, as if they had not heard what You XiaoMo had said. Ling Xiao assured, \u201cIt\u2019s of no matter. I\u2019ll still have a way even without spiritual water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Be that as it may, You XiaoMo was still awfully upset.</p><br/><p>After the spatial storm passed, the next portion of their journey was much smoother. They did not run into any unforeseen events as dangerous as the spatial storm and Ling Xiao\u2019s spiritual energy had also recovered.</p><br/><p>They finally saw the exit of the tunnel after a month and a half.</p><br/><p>A small bright spot of light was flashing in front of them and You XiaoMo\u2019s long repressed tension finally released.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan were also relieved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to exit soon. Be careful, bear in mind not to be reckless.\u201d Ling Xiao instructed the three. As long as they still had not exited, they may also fall short of success for lack of a final effort even if the exit was right in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>The three once again roused their spirits.</p><br/><p>The exit may seem just right in front of their eyes, but there was actually still a ways to go.</p><br/><p>The spot of light was two times bigger after an hour, but it was still some distance away.</p><br/><p>Excluding You XiaoMo, Ling Xiao and the two others appeared very calm. This situation could be considered as an invisible test of the spatial tunnel. Letting one think that the exit was just right before one\u2019s eyes, giving rise to impatience. You XiaoMo now had this feeling, but seeing that Ling Xiao and the rest were all very calm, he had no choice but to repress this emotion.</p><br/><p>This continued till the exit was less than a hundred meters away.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo beamed in joy at Ling Xiao, \u201cLook, look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his smile, Ling Xiao also could not refrain from smiling. Just as he was about to speak, his expression suddenly changed. A cry for help suddenly sounded from far and drew nearer before he could speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan\u2019s expressions had changed too. They did not even look at the person crying for help, and like Ling Xiao, put on a burst of speed without further ado. Only You XiaoMo was unable to make heads or tails of the situation.</p><br/><p>The person crying for help had seen them and immediately rushed towards them while waving in pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bros, help!\u201d Accompanying his excited yell was a clamor of tremendous noise. Even an earthquake was not as loud. The spatial tunnel violently shook and swayed, as if it was about to collapse in the next second.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared so intently that his two eyeballs nearly popped out of their eye sockets. Chasing that person was a pack of malevolent-looking monsters. Tentative estimates showed that it was a horde of at least a hundred beasts behind him, and the strength of every one was actually \u2013</p><br/><p>Level ten!!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

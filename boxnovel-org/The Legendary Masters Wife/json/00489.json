And so, before You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes, the two Golden Winged Insects easily bit a hole in the strong and sturdy Restrictions.</p><br/><p>Without even waiting for You XiaoMo to recover from the shock, Xiao Ping and Xiao Pong crept in without alarming anyone on the inside.</p><br/><p>This was the first time You XiaoMo realised that they had other uses apart from eating.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, Xiao Ping and Xiao Pong flew back. Not long after, the middle aged man and Tang He came out and returned to their own rooms one after another.</p><br/><p>Through the mind link he shared with his contract beasts, You XiaoMo was able to learn about their conversation. What he didn\u2019t expect was that there was a part of it that was related to him.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t go into the details of the situation during their conversation, You XiaoMo was already able to guess the gist of it.</p><br/><p>Regarding Jiang Liu\u2019s disappearance, he was indeed taken by people from Yin Yang Valley, but not because they saw his talent and wanted him. They took him because he surrendered and and pledged allegiance to them. Otherwise, how would Yin Yang Valley even know about a small fry like Jiang Liu.</p><br/><p>As to how Jiang Liu got Yin Yang Valley interested in him, it probably had something to do with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pieced the previous events together and easily guessed that Jiang Liu had betrayed him in exchange for a position in Yin Yang Valley. Only a fellow villager like him who left Peach Blossom Village together with You XiaoMo would be so clear on his matters.</p><br/><p>This time, they were indeed here to participate in the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s trials.</p><br/><p>They were the first batch to arrive. There were a few other batches after them but they would be arriving later because Yu Xian City had met with a disaster a few days ago.</p><br/><p>Apart from that, there was another event going on that had also received a fair amount of attention.</p><br/><p>That event was the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s trials to recruit talented individuals. This grand event was a competition that was held once every ten years. The minimum criteria for registering for the competition was that the person who\u2019s registering must at least be an Emperor level. Although the criteria was extremely strict, there were as many as several hundred people signing up for it in previous years. Furthermore, they would only take in five people at the end of it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was not interested in that but he felt that Ling Xiao was likely to come here after hearing about this news because it was sufficiently lively here, so it would also be sensational enough too.</p><br/><p>At this moment, You XiaoMo still didn\u2019t know that he already had two groups of people investigating him.</p><br/><p>One of the groups was the Qing Feng Sect.</p><br/><p>The Qing Feng Sect was one of the three major forces of Xing Luo City. In their sect, they had one Divine level powerhouse called Chen Zhen, who was also their sect leader. That was the reason why few dared to go against the Qing Feng Sect.</p><br/><p>However, since Wang Ge and the other four people\u2019s ranks in the Qing Feng Sect weren\u2019t high, the Qing Feng Sect didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. They just sent Gao MaYuan, Wang Ge\u2019s superior who was sent to Hu Village ten years ago and caused harm to Weng Gong\u2019s whole family, to investigate the matter.</p><br/><p>Wang Ge, formerly known as Wang An, was Wang QianYu\u2019s younger Brother. Wang QianYu was Gao MaYuan\u2019s concubine. She was very pretty and she was Gao MaYuan\u2019s favorite.</p><br/><p>When she learned that her only brother was murdered, Wang QianYu wept. Wanting to cheer her up, Gao MaYuan promised to find the killer and dismember him by using five horses to pull him apart to avenge his brother-in-law.</p><br/><p>In order to make good on his promise to his woman, Gao MaYuan immediately sent people to investigate Hu Village when he received the news.</p><br/><p>Although the villagers of Hu Village had already moved away, clues could still be found if one looked closely enough. A few hundred people couldn\u2019t just disappear like that. Someone must have seen them when they moved.</p><br/><p>In just two days, they really found something.</p><br/><p>When the villagers were about to leave Hu Village, You XiaoMo once warned them not flaunt their wealth. Otherwise, they might bring harm on themselves. So when Gao MaYuan\u2019s men came to search, the villagers had already hid their wealth well in storage bags, leaving only a few crystal coins on themselves.</p><br/><p>As for information regarding You XiaoMo, Gao MaYuan\u2019s men couldn\u2019t get a single word about him when they asked around.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because the villagers were unwilling to speak, but because they didn\u2019t know You XiaoMo\u2019s name. You XiaoMo considered this point at that time, so he purposely didn\u2019t tell them his name. As a result, the villagers only knew it was a youth with fair and clear skin.</p><br/><p>The youth bought their magic herbs and fields and then got them to leave Hu Village.</p><br/><p>Gao MaYuan suspected there were some secrets in Hu Village when he heard that so he sent his men to search. In the end, they found nothing and the clue led to a dead end.</p><br/><p>The other group of people investigating him consisted of that young master and that baldy underling.</p><br/><p>They were from Yu Xian City. The reason why they arrived at Hu Village a few days late and consequently missed him was because of Ling Xiao. In order to get famous, Ling Xiao went to Yu Xian City and caused a big ruckus.</p><br/><p>Although the villagers of Hu Village didn\u2019t know about You XiaoMo, that batch of magic herbs was too important, even if they hadn\u2019t matured yet. After investigating, they finally heard from the villagers that after they moved out of Hu Village, there was another person that stayed behind in Hu Village together with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>That person was Weng Gong. As to where he was, the villagers had no clue. However, someone was bound to recognise such an old man like him.</p><br/><p>Following the clues, they finally found the village Weng Gong was residing in.</p><br/><p>The village was surrounded by mountains from all around, isolating it from the rest of the world. Its population was smaller than Hu Village and it was indeed a good place for the elderly to live out the rest of their remaining lives. Before You XiaoMo left, he even specially built a simple house for Weng Gong. That was why he left a deep impression on the villagers there.</p><br/><p>When the man and his underlings came over to find him, Weng Gong happened to be on the top of a mountain looking in Xing Luo City\u2019s direction. This was something he had to do everyday.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning each day, Weng Gong would wait at the mountain top for four hours, looking forward to seeing You XiaoMo on the road once again and telling him the good news that his revenge had been taken. It was this belief that had kept the lonely man going.</p><br/><p>The man and his group walked up to the mountain top. Weng Gong happened to have his back towards them.</p><br/><p>When he heard the footsteps, Weng Gong thought it was just the villagers. He only realised that it was a group of strangers he hadn\u2019t seen before when he turned his head around. \u201cWho are you people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Weng Gong?\u201d The man scanned him up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you people?\u201d Weng Gong repeated his question.</p><br/><p>The man took a step forward, his towering figure giving people a sense of oppression. Weng Gong was already old and he was only an ordinary person too, so he instantly crumpled to the ground.</p><br/><p>The man looked at him condescendingly as if he was looking at an ant and said, \u201cI\u2019m asking you, what is the name of the youth who brought you to this village? What does he look like? Where has he gone and what is his objective? Answer my questions honestly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Weng Gong gave him a look but didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>A hint of ruthlessness flashed across the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow dare a mere mortal like you go against me? I\u2019ll give you one last chance. Are you talking or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Weng Gong looked at him contemptuously. Words like this, he had heard Gao MaYuan say them before. This time was the same as that time. They all set themselves high above the masses, but this time he had nothing that he cared about anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you people, even if you kill me I won\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man laughed, \u201cDid you think I\u2019ll let you die a quick death? If you\u2019re not willing to tell, I have my own ways to make you speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Weng Gong\u2019s mouth moved.</p><br/><p>Baldy suddenly rushed forward and grabbed Weng Gong\u2019s chin. He used so much force that it forced Weng Gong to open his mouth. \u201cYou want to bite your tongue and end your life?\u201d He spat out viciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, how do we deal with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake him away first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man took the lead to walk down the mountain after he was done talking. Baldy escorted Weng Gong and followed after, but when they reached a cliff, Weng Gong suddenly had an outburst of strength and pushed Baldy aside. Baldy didn\u2019t expect that old man to still have the strength to resist, so he got pushed away because of a moment\u2019s carelessness.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong jumped off the cliff.</p><br/><p>Baldy was furious. When he was finally able to react to what had happened, he realised that he was basically slapped in the face by an ordinary person. He immediately followed Weng Gong and jumped off. He was a practitioner so the height of the cliff didn\u2019t matter to him at all, but it wasn\u2019t the same for an ordinary human. An ordinary person would definitely die if he fell off from the cliff.</p><br/><p>Just as Baldy was about to grab the falling Weng Gong, a black shadow came out from somewhere and cut in between the two of them, taking Weng Gong away first.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Baldy shouted angrily.</p><br/><p>The black shadow and Weng Gong landed on the mountain top opposite him.</p><br/><p>When the black shadow turned around and allowed everyone to see his face clearly, the man\u2019s expression quickly changed. He turned and ran in the opposite direction without a second word.</p><br/><p>However, he was still too slow. The black shadow snapped his fingers and smirked at the man\u2019s back, \u201c Since you\u2019re already here, don\u2019t leave, Yu Xian City\u2019s young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Red flames shot up from their feet and they were instantly set on fire. Pained screams rang through the entire mountain, amplified by a few dozen times. Startled birds flapped their wings frantically and took to the sky.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s burned and twisted face could somewhat be seen in the flames, staring at the black shadow in fear. He never expected him to show up here.</p><br/><p>Soon after, a few burned corpses fell from the sky and into the valley and disappeared.</p><br/><p>That was how Yu Xian City\u2019s young master died.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong looked at the man who saved him in shock. Who that young master was, he didn\u2019t know, but he had heard about Yu Xian City and their name had long resounded in his ears. This man actually killed the people from Yu Xian City.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t look at the man\u2019s face and just looked at his figure, Weng Gong would have thought that he was a cool and handsome man. However, he had a face that had been ravaged by time. His face also gave people the feeling that it didn\u2019t go well with the rest of his body, but at the same time Weng Gong couldn\u2019t tell which part was the problem.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

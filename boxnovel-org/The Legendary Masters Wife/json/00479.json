When he opened his eyes, it was like his soul had returned, his empty eyes shining. The first thing reflected in them was the handsome face of a young silver-haired man.</p><br/><p>The silver haired young man had a stoic face, but Feng ChiYun could see the emotions swimming in the other\u2019s eyes and couldn\u2019t stop his mouth from curling into a slight smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d The silver-haired young man hesitantly nodded, his voice raspy. When their gazes met, their once confused and hazy feelings seemed to disperse into the wind.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun moved the body he had just gotten back. His memory ended at when You ZhenTian took him from the estate. Prior to that, he had been living relatively freely on the estate.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge walked to him and sat beside him. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun tilted his head, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout the female gu within your body\u2026\u201d Yin Ge explained what Ling Xiao had told him to Feng ChiYun in brief. Afraid that Feng ChiYun might be unwilling, he purposefully twisted a few words.</p><br/><p>The more Feng ChiYun heard, the more tense he became. Though he liked Yin Ge, he wasn\u2019t at that point yet.</p><br/><p>Seeing his lack of reaction, Yin Ge knew he wasn\u2019t very willing. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll have Ling Xiao remove the female gu from your body and then destroy both.\u201d He stood as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun subconsciously grabbed the other\u2019s robe, his handsome face tinted red. \u201cBut you\u2026 said that the Heart Linking Gu was a powerful supplement, and it could help with our cultivation. It\u2019s it a waste if we destroy it just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Yin Ge\u2019s stoic face broke out into a gentle, but barely there smile, like a melting iceberg. Unfortunately, Feng ChiYun, his head bowed, didn\u2019t notice and missed the moment.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge gripped his hand. His own hand was naturally cold, but Feng ChiYun\u2019s hand was like a blazing sun in the summer, transmitting a simmering warmth, not only warming his hand but his heart as well.</p><br/><p>Returning to his position on the bed, Yin Ge\u2019s hands caressed Feng ChiYun\u2019s face as he leaned over to give the other a chaste kiss. The clumsy kiss moved two hearts\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside of the hut, You XiaoMo, peeping on the two, saw Yin Ge take off Feng ChiYun\u2019s robes. Hey, he had a pretty good figure. Probably because of embarrassment, Feng ChiYun was red from his chest to his ears.</p><br/><p>As for Yin Ge, this guy usually wore a cold expression, and barely ever spoke more than ten sentences a day. You XiaoMo thought he would be very cool about it, but instead, the other\u2019s ears were burning red.</p><br/><p>He never would\u2019ve expected it, but it seemed that they were both virgins.</p><br/><p>There was some sort of indescribable excitement to watching others from this perspective, but he definitely wasn\u2019t a voyeur.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you had enough yet?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s voice rose behind him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately turned to look at him. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d If only he could watch everything.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at the inside of the hut.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly dragged him away. If they kept watching, he couldn\u2019t be certain if Ling Xiao would be affected or not, and if he was, then You XiaoMo would definitely become his victim. For the sake of his health, goodbye, real life AV!T/n: AV = Adult video = porn</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to your dimension,\u201d Ling Xiao suddenly suggested.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s footsteps faltered for a moment and then he let go, running for his life as he yelled, \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think he doesn\u2019t know what Ling Xiao was thinking. That asshole was definitely thinking of what was happening in that hut. But since circumstances prevented it, what with their current surroundings, their dimensions were left empty and therefore, free game. He knew what Ling Xiao wanted them to do in their dimension. There was no way he\u2019d let him!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t expect for him to react so fast, falling silent for two seconds before giving chase.</p><br/><p>As the two ran after one another and into the bamboo forest, Zhan YuXuan sighed, looking skyward. Even these two had to display so much PDA in front of him. Loners like him really got the worst end of every stick!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>What You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao didn\u2019t know was that, at that very moment, the Qilin Clan was looking for them.</p><br/><p>Lin HaoWu might not like Ling Xiao, but he was a member of the Qilin Clan so they couldn\u2019t just let him go like that.</p><br/><p>Thus, regardless of Lin HaoWu\u2019s personal feelings, the others all wanted to find and talk to Ling Xiao to persuade him to go back to the Qilin Clan.</p><br/><p>However, the two hadn\u2019t expected that they would be asked to stay behind by Fu CangQiong, so they could only wait outside of Jialan Mountains. They hadn\u2019t expected that Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo would be so careful leaving Jialan Mountains. It wasn\u2019t long before they managed to lose them.</p><br/><p>Lin HaoWu was getting progressively more irritated. \u201cUncle Hang, that Ling Mo is very suspicious, there\u2019s definitely something fishy about him. I think he might\u2019ve played some sort of trick; he can\u2019t be a member of the Qilin Clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how do you explain that purple fire?\u201d Lin Hang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin HaoWu didn\u2019t back down, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to explain. Not all purple fire has to be Qilin Sacred Fire. I think he simply did something to try and trick everyone. Plus, Uncle Hang, think about it. If he really is a member of the Qilin Clan, then hasn\u2019t he come home to where he belongs. If this isn\u2019t suspicious, then what is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Hang\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cYour reasons aren\u2019t inconceivable, but I promised the elders. If we don\u2019t personally confirm this, then what will we say to the elders?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin HaoWu said, \u201cBut we don\u2019t even know where he is, where will we even go to find him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind, let\u2019s go back for now.\u201d Lin Hang frowned a little, but it soon was released as a soft sigh. They couldn\u2019t stay outside for too long, so they\u2019d have to leave things at that for now.</p><br/><p>Lin HaoWu was delighted.</p><br/><p>The Qilin Clan had Sacred level experts too, so they didn\u2019t lack Dimensional talismans. A mid grade Dimensional talisman was enough to take them back to the sacred grounds of the Qilin Clan.</p><br/><p>After Lin Hang sent Lin HaoWu off, the first one he went to meet wasn\u2019t the elders in the clan. Instead, he went through a small path, the surroundings getting progressively quieter, and the sound of birdsong and water getting clearer. At the very end, there was a tower build on the surface of a lake with overhanging eaves, like a moving painting.</p><br/><p>Entering the tower, Lin Hang hadn\u2019t even announced himself when a voice echoed out from inside.</p><br/><p>Lin Hang pushed the door open and entered, met with a thin, obscuring curtain, a blurred figure reclined behind it, cup held in their right hand. Hearing his entrance, the other didn\u2019t even look up. Beside him were two beautiful handmaidens, their heads bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d A lazy and bewitching voice rang out slowly. Lin Hang respectfully replied, \u201cLin Hang has disappointed the young master and was unable to meet with that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man behind the curtain tossed the cup onto the floor, wine splashing across expensive carpets. The two handmaidens bowed their heads further.</p><br/><p>Lin Hang thought he was angry and quickly bent down on one knee. \u201cPlease punish me as you see fit, young master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of, I\u2019m not angry.\u201d The man chuckled, muttering, seemingly to himself, \u201cLin Xiao, oh, Lin Xiao, don\u2019t think that just because you changed your name, I don\u2019t know who you are\u2026\u201dT/n: Lin in Lin Xiao here is Lin in QiLin, not to be mistake the old Lin Xiao of Tian Xin Sect</p><br/><p>A flash of doubt flashed through Lin Hang\u2019s eyes. Who was this Lin Xiao? If he was a member of the clan, then why wasn\u2019t he actually in the clan? If he wasn\u2019t, then why would the young master always say his name like he was a thorn in the side?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master, should I continue to pursue him?\u201d Lin Hang shook away his thoughts and asked, hands placed together.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I\u2019ve already made arrangements.\u201d The man waved a hand. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Hang left the tower and then went to report to the elders.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge and Feng ChiYun\u2019s joining transduced the Heart Linking Gu, and, like Ling Xiao had said, it was a great supplement for the two. Their cultivation levels skyrocketed.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun was originally a level eight low grade mage. While being imprisonment, You ZhenTian didn\u2019t do anything further to confine him. During that time, he had calmed himself and cultivated, allowing himself to improve quite a bit. Then, with the Heart Linking Gu, he had thought he would at most advance a grade or two, never expecting that it would end up a level or two. He was now a level nine high grade mage.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was extremely jealous. He had cultivated for a year or two. Yet Feng ChiYun managed to achieve this so quickly. This was karma, he guessed. The Vermillion Blood imprisoned him, but ended up giving him an advantage.</p><br/><p>As for Yin Ge, his cultivational level was already very high, so compared to Feng ChiYun, he hadn\u2019t advanced such. He had originally been a Emperor level three star, but now he was seven star.</p><br/><p>However, the most envious was Zhan YuXuan.</p><br/><p>They had all gotten stronger, but he was still stuck here at Imperial level.</p><br/><p>In the TongTian Continent, power was everything, so after this, he parted with Yin Ge and Feng ChiYun. On one hand, he didn\u2019t want to third wheel, on another, he had his own place to be.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge always knew that Zhan YuXuan wouldn\u2019t stay by his side long.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you two going? Back to XiJing?\u201d Before they parted, You XiaoMo asked casually. After saving Feng ChiYun, another burden had been lifted off his shoulders and he felt much lighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yin Ge held Feng ChiYun\u2019s hand. \u201cMy current strength isn\u2019t enough to face my father, so I\u2019ve decided to travel with Feng ChiYun to train and improve until I can defeat my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo discretely wiped away some sweat. That sure was savage!</p><br/><p>After they parted, the two began their journey back to ZhongTian, and then You XiaoMo remembered something heartbreaking.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

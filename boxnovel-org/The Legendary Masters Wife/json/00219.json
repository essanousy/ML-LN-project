But it doesn\u2019t mean that all people there are people who kill other people like flies, some of them are only lone practitioners who don\u2019t want to join major forces at Yan City.</p><br/><p>Due to the mutual agreement between forces at Yan City, the Life and Death Street becomes a place that is not controlled by anybody. Because of that, the Life and Death Street\u2019s condition has become very chaotic. All kinds of people who have unusual strength, kidnap people and steal treasures find themselves here. It\u2019s very chaotic, and it couldn\u2019t become any more chaotic than that.</p><br/><p>On a bright sunny day, a robbery occurred on Life and Death Street.</p><br/><p>A person who didn\u2019t look that old, looked just like a passer-by. The youth, whose strength looked to be only at the Sky level, robbed a bald, burly Star level guy. Probably because he knew that his own strength was below the other person, the youth ran after he robbed the guy\u2019s magic bag. The bald guy got angry, and called his companions to chase after the youth.</p><br/><p>The youth glanced back in a hurry, and his pupils became small in an instant. Apparently, he didn\u2019t think that the robbed bald guy had a group of thug companions, and each of their strengths were not below him. The youth ran in a rush, and carelessly ran into a dead end. When the youth turned his head, the bald guy and his gang had already reached the entrance of the dead end.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou son-of-a-bitch, do you think you can still run? Dare to rob this great uncle\u2019s magic bag, don\u2019t you know who this great uncle is?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bald man made a vicious face while cracking his own ten fingers in front of the cornered youth. The bald guy didn\u2019t want to catch the youth in a hurry. Since the youth dared to challenge the bald guy, they wouldn\u2019t let go of him easily!</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s face became pale, there was a glimpse of despair in his eyes.</p><br/><p>If it were only the bald guy, he still could risk his life and try to run, but the bald guy had five people following behind him, the gap was too big, he had no way out.</p><br/><p>The people who live in the Life and Death Street were all vicious and merciless. For them, it\u2019s easier to kill people than eating a dish.</p><br/><p>When the youth turned desperate, he heard a surprised and bewildered sound from on top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi, this person\u2019s figure is really similar to yours, eh. But he\u2019s a little bit dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth looked up abruptly. He didn\u2019t realize there were two unfamiliar men on top the wall above his head. One was small, while the other was big. The small one who just talked looked younger with a delicate and pretty face, and his eyes looked very bright, completely without impurities nor hostility. This man surely wasn\u2019t a person from the Life and Death Street; while the big one was gorgeously dressed and looked just like the aristocrat with high nobility. But somehow this man gave off a rather complicated impression. After hearing the boy\u2019s words, he revealed a faint smile on his lips, \u201cThen let\u2019s choose him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s intuition told him that these two people were very interested in him, and perhaps they could save him; the key was these two people. The youth had no other choice, so he shouted at both of them hastily, \u201cIf both of you are willing to help me, I promise I will fulfill whatever you want me to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nothing is more important than life; he didn\u2019t mind even if he has to work like an ox. As long as he could survive, he would do anything.</p><br/><p>The teenager immediately showed a joyful expression, \u201cAre you really willing to do anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth nodded without hesitation, \u201cI\u2019m willing to do anything, as long as both of you save my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teenager quickly said, \u201cThen you must not take your words back, oh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth nodded, \u201cI will never take back my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the youth made an unfathomable mystery (t/n: unable to make head or tail of it) agreement with the two men right in front of his eyes, the bald man suddenly became furious. He glared at You XiaoMo who was on top of the wall, \u201cWant to save him? That also depends whether you have the skill to do that or not, you guys try me!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this, the youth immediately looked towards You XiaoMo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2019s side, to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t blame him for that, because You Xiaomo really didn\u2019t look like a practitioner. Although a mage also has abilities, but since he looked young, no matter how you look at it, there\u2019s no way he could win over a group of Moon level and Star level practitioners.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo looked at the youth\u2019s action, he couldn\u2019t help but twitch his mouth, and quickly let out one of the Qiu team. Suddenly, a fiery red object appeared out of nowhere in front of the youth.</p><br/><p>The youth stared at it with big eyes, and couldn\u2019t help but rub his own eyes. It unexpectedly was a fiery red demon fox.</p><br/><p>The fox looked like it\u2019s already matured; its pair of rare, fiery red eyes were flickering brightly and looked at him with ice-cold eyes, then turned to look at the bald guy and his group with an ice-cold and blood-thirsty expression from its eyes.</p><br/><p>The bald guy and his men were suddenly frightened, they stopped hastily, stared at the seven-tailed demon fox frightenedly. Seven tails, so that means this one is a level seven demon fox.</p><br/><p>Not waiting for them to react and run away, Mao Qiu turned its figure into fiery red and ran towards them.</p><br/><p>Its speed was very fast, before the bald guy and his men were able to react or hide, each of them were immediately burned by its flame. Suddenly there was an agonizing scream, followed by other shrills.</p><br/><p>Because the bald guy was the last one, he should be able to run; but seeing that he was already scared and limp on the ground, if the seven level demon fox were to kill him, he was already unable to run away, not to mention that the other party was already suppressing him using its power.</p><br/><p>Those facts have proved that he already couldn\u2019t escape; Mao Qiu simply didn\u2019t give him any chance to. After it killed his companions, Mao Qiu gracefully walked towards him, and opened its ferocious mouth in front of its prey, and ate the bald man\u2019s upper body in one bite. Before the bald man could even make a miserable cry, Mao Qiu had already swallowed him completely.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Hei said before, inside the bodies of strong practitioners and mages flow a lot of energy through the meridian system. Eating their corpse would help them level up.</p><br/><p>This was the first time You XiaoMo saw this oppressive sight, so he was terrified.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao intentionally let him look at it, so he didn\u2019t cover You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The youth\u2019s expression was calm. There were more brutal things that had happened at Life and Death Street, if he couldn\u2019t adapt even to this small thing, it would be impossible for him to survive on Life and Death Street.</p><br/><p>Two minutes later, the three of them appeared at the inn on Life and Death Street.</p><br/><p>The inn was a tourist trap, the price was unusually high, and if they found out that the other party\u2019s strength was lower than themselves, they would just rob and kill them. Nevertheless, for the people who couldn\u2019t find a place to stay, they would still choose this inn and just be careful not to reveal their valuables.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo put Mao Qiu back into the space, and then got comforted by Ling Xiao. He already accepted the fact that demon beasts eat people, no matter what, it was part of the natural selection; the survival of the fittest. If he couldn\u2019t fit, he would just get eliminated, just like what he learned from his biology class.</p><br/><p>The youth was surprised on how both Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo got along with each other, his instinct told him they weren\u2019t just friends, instead, they were more like\u2026 lovers?</p><br/><p>The youth was frightened by his own imagination. But he wasn\u2019t surprised for too long, there are actually some men who get together with another man in this world, and because it was harder for women practitioners to practice compared to men practitioners in this Long Xiang Continent, so there were far less women practitioners compared to men.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Liu Yue, I give my thanks to both of you for saving me. I\u2019m wondering, what can I do to help you, when both of you found me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue got rid of his distracting thoughts, cupping his hands towards both of them. After he witnessed the teenager\u2019s contract beast, there\u2019s no way he would dare to think of doing any funny business.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked, \u201cHave you reached twenty-five?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue blankly stared, \u201cNot yet, I will reach twenty five next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was somewhat surprised, he hasn\u2019t reach twenty-five years old, but he was already so tall, what did he eat to grew up to be that tall?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finished talking, he was already interrupted by Ling Xiao, \u201cXiao-Momo, let\u2019s just get to the point.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s ears became red, he rubbed his nose and said, \u201cDo you know about the student enrollment at Dao Xin Academy? We\u2019d like you to register for one of us. After you finish this task, we will reward you accordingly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue\u2019s sight fell on Ling Xiao, he finally understood what they meant at the dead end before. It was actually because of this. It\u2019s nothing difficult, \u201cI can help you with that, but my strength isn\u2019t enough, Dao Xin Academy\u2019s requirement for student enrollment is Sun level or above.\u201d</p><br/><p>Student admission for Dao Xin Academy was extremely sensational, and he lived at Life and Death Street, there\u2019d be no way he hadn\u2019t heard about it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, i am a mage, I can just give you magic pills to help you level up into Sun level. It won\u2019t be a problem anymore\u201d.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue\u2019s eyes became bigger, and then asked excitedly, \u201cIs what you said really true?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately took out a bottle of level three magic pills on top of the table.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue couldn\u2019t help but rub his hand. He stared at the transparent jade bottle filled with the magic pills passionately. The color and lustre of these level three magic pills were actually much darker than the low grade magic pills that he got before; so these were actually high level magic pills?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing, you will really give it to me?\u201d Liu Yue asked him hesitantly, he still hardly believed there would be such a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, but just for insurance, after that we will erase your memory about this matter, if you agree with this term, this bottle is yours. When things are done, i will give you five level four magic pills. How about it?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>This was clearly where meats fell from the sky. If he were to reject it, he would become the biggest fool in the world.</p><br/><p>When he saw that he nodded, You XiaoMo became secretly relieved.</p><br/><p>Were he to refuse, he couldn\u2019t guarantee he would be able to find another person whose figure was similar to Ling Xiao\u2019s.</p><br/><p>When Liu Yue was about to to take the jade bottle, suddenly there was a hand that came over, and the index finger was on top of the bottle\u2019s neck. When he looked up, he saw that the owner of the hand was a masked man.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cI have to tell you beforehand. When I erase your memories, it will be extremely painful to the point that you may not wish to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue quickly responded, and said this firmly, \u201cIn order to become stronger, I can endure all kinds of hardships.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised up his eyebrow, and moved his hand.</p><br/><p>Since it had already been eight days before they finally found Liu Yue, plus, they had to make Liu Yue level up, as well as making his body qualities similar to Ling Xiao, it took another couple of days before they could finalize all the details. Finally, they sat on top of the Gigantic Flamebird, and quickly went to the student enrollment place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

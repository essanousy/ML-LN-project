He stands up and stretches himself and just when he wants to break out a yawn, a beaming handsome face appears in front of his eyes.</p><br/><p>Although this type of situation has happened before, he still jumps in fright, his body toppling backwards abruptly. Just when he is about to fall off the chair, the owner of that handsome face stretches out his hand and grabs his collar, pulling him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, why are you so clumsy <i>ne</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao speaks softly by his ear.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s soul still hasn\u2019t calmed down when he takes a breath and glares at him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t frighten me, I wouldn\u2019t be so clumsy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao brings him to his side, smiling while speaking, \u201cHow could I frighten you? Clearly, you are the one who was sleeping, so you can\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo exclaims <i>*ah*</i>. He just remembers that he was transcribing magic pill formulas before he fell asleep. Lowering his head to take a look, he doesn\u2019t see the ten or so pieces of paper that he finished transcribing before. When he fails to find them after looking under the table, he can\u2019t help but widen his eyes, \u201cThe magic pill formulas I transcribed <i>ne</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, are you talking about this <i>ah</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lifts up the pile of paper in his hands. They are the ones he picked up from the floor before. The topmost piece is a little wrinkled, as if stained by something wet.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stretches his hand wanting to snatch them back but Ling Xiao raises his hand causing him to come up empty.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao crosses his legs, flipping through the sheets of paper while mocking, \u201cLittle brother, your calligraphy really made be see things in a new light <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shifts his gaze uneasily, two tell-tale pink spots appearing on his cheeks.</p><br/><p>Of course he knows that his calligraphy is too terrible to look at. But he can\u2019t help it. Who asked him to have never written with a brush before? If he has a fountain pen or a ball point pen, he would be able to write acceptable-looking characters.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is something I\u2019m very curious about. I wonder if Little brother can help explain it. If you can satisfy me, I will help you transcribe these magic pill formulas. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao throws the stack of paper in his hand onto the table. Then he picks up another stack of paper and waves them in front of his face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was just looking all over the place awkwardly when he sees Ling Xiao bring out a stack of papers. He looks over in surprise and sees neat and orderly characters written in beautiful handwriting. His eyes gleam suddenly when he thinks of another thing. He asks doubtfully, \u201cElder brother Ling, did you write these?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me, then don\u2019t tell me it was you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao casts a sidelong glance at him as he retorts.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut \u2026\u2026. I remember that you said you haven\u2019t written for a long time, so \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubs his nose. He still remembers the characters from when Ling Xiao transcribed the Heavenly Soul Scroll for him. At that time, his calligraphy was just like his now. It can also be described as too terrible to look at. So the sudden appearance of this beautiful handwriting, makes him doubt that this is really written by him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao angrily raps him on the head, \u201cThat was before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since he showed his ugly handwriting, in order to not embarrass himself in front of You XiaoMo again, he deliberately found time to practice writing again. These magic pill formulas were just written by him based on what You XiaoMo transcribed.</p><br/><p>Hearing his reply, You XiaoMo is deeply jealous, \u201cWhat was it that you\u2019re so curious about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of that, Ling Xiao suddenly looks at him as if deep in thought, \u201cUsually, someone who can read should be able to write. But you seem to be able to read but not write. Why is this? Furthermore, I feel that you seem to have more secrets that I don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><br/><p>A drop of cold sweat suddenly rolls down You XiaoMo\u2019s forehead. This person is too sharp.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t dare to look directly at him. He shifts his gaze away while saying, \u201cThere is nothing to be curious about. My parents died young. Before I was seventeen, I was brought up in my maternal aunt\u2019s family. My maternal aunt\u2019s family is not rich, so there is no money to send me to school. I could only learn to recognize a few words from my maternal aunt\u2019s son and daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t tell him the real reason even if beaten to death. He is someone that crossed-over from the twenty first century Earth.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao frowns. He isn\u2019t really clear about You XiaoMo\u2019s life history, \u201cIs that how it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can find a time to look for someone to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo answers hastily. He isn\u2019t worried that he would be found out because when he asked Jiang Liu about things that has to do with him, Jiang Liu also told him the same thing.</p><br/><p>Although Ling Xiao is still skeptical, seeing him speak with certainty, he doesn\u2019t ask any further. Thinking of why he came over this time, he says, \u201cRegarding the auction, I have already made the proper arrangements. If you are not busy tomorrow we can just set out tomorrow <i>ba</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I have nothing going on tomorrow. I can go at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he hears that the matter with the auction is settled, he immediately grabs Ling Xiao\u2019s arm excitedly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glances at the arm that is clutched by him and reveals a crafty smile, \u201cIt is already dark. Since I have to come here again tomorrow, I might as well \u2026\u2026. sleep over here tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone clearly states that this is not something to be discussed \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly takes back his hand and stammers, \u201cElder brother Ling, this is not really suitable <i>ba</i>. I only have one bed and it is very small. It can only hold one person \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiles sweetly, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, we only have to squeeze a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face suddenly crumbles. Squeeze a little? He is afraid that even his innards will be squeezed out. He has an inkling that Ling Xiao will definitely make use of this opportunity to make a move on him.</p><br/><p>The real situation proves that Ling Xiao really isn\u2019t going to just squeeze a little like he said. His bed is already small to begin with. For two persons to sleep on it, they can only stick closely together. You XiaoMo dawdles for half a day before he was finally pulled by Ling Xiao onto the bed. All four limbs tangling together, not even a crack is left in between them.</p><br/><p>Waking up the next day, You XiaoMo finds that he is again like a eight-legged octopus hanging onto Ling Xiao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Because the matter with the auction can\u2019t be revealed to anyone else, Ling Xiao only arranged for the two of them to go down the mountain. Zhou Peng who had originally wanted to go with them was sent by Ling Xiao on another secret mission.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, You XiaoMo notifies Fang ChenLe about going down the mountain. Because he is already a core disciple, he doesn\u2019t have to ask for permission like before. It also doesn\u2019t have to be recorded.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe knows that he is going down the mountain with Ling Xiao so he isn\u2019t worried. He only tells him to take care.</p><br/><p>Half a stick of incense later, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao leave TianXin sect together.</p><br/><p>TianXin sect is located in the most flourishing Southern part of Long Xiao continent. HunJi city is the the third biggest city of this Southern region. It\u2019s located on a mountain pass of the WuFeng mountain range. Every day, over ten thousand people go in and out of this fortress. That\u2019s why it developed so quickly in a short ten or so years to become the third largest city in the Southern region.</p><br/><p>The destination of their trip this time is this HunJi city.</p><br/><p>Although the area of HunJi city is not as large as the largest and second largest city, its prosperity is greater than even the largest city. So a lot of rare things can be found there, like rare high level magic pills and high level magic herbs.</p><br/><p>Looking at the unending green flatlands, a black horse carriage is flying forward like a whirlwind. The horse carriage is drawn by a galloping reddish brown horse. Its tall and large body is much stronger and sturdier than normal horses. Its fiery red eyes are stubborn and unruly. Time and again, it would raise his head up and neigh. One look and people can tell that this horse is in a very excitable state \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo feels like he is soon going to vomit. This is the first time he is taking a horse carriage. It\u2019s also the first time he is taking a horse carriage that is running so fast.</p><br/><p>Although the inside of the horse carriage is lined with a layer of thick plush woolen blankets, the horse carriage is shaking very fiercely. His brain that is not very smart to begin with, right now is already shaken into mush. His stomach churns endlessly, almost causing him to throw up last night\u2019s meal.</p><br/><p>The one hugging him, Ling Xiao, is not the least bit affected by the speed of the horse. His eyes laugh as he hugs the listless You XiaoMo and strokes his back, \u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon. Just endure it a little more and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words, You XiaoMo already heard them quite a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this \u2026\u2026. I will never again sit this horse carriage \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo speaks falteringly. It\u2019s too much torture. He feels that he has already lost half his life.</p><br/><p>Because there is no limit on the time he can go down the mountain, there is no need to get there in a hurry. So Ling Xiao suggested that they take a horse carriage. Thinking that he has yet to take a horse carriage, You XiaoMo thinks that he can give it a try, so he agrees. He didn\u2019t expect that he would regret it less than half an hour later. Also, where did Ling Xiao get this horse carriage? The horse that is pulling the carriage seems relatively easily excitable leaving You XiaoMo in a disastrous state.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be fine when you get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao consoles him.</p><br/><p>The Raging fire horse is really relatively easily excitable. But they have good stamina. And they are also fast. Once you get used to their speed, you will find that this is actually a very enjoyable thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cI rather not get used to it ever \u2026\u2026. <i>ou</i> \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Crossing through the green plains, that enormous city on top of the fortress finally appears.</p><br/><p>The tall city walls reaching to the clouds are extremely wide and grand. The unending red city wall seems to give out a rusty feel. It obviously has a very long history. When the sunshine pours down from above, the red city wall seems to shine, reflecting dazzling rays of light. Taking a look from up close, the red city walls are actually made of what is called Rosefinch spirit iron.</p><br/><p>Rosefinch spirit iron is something that has excellent defensive properties. But its price is also extraordinary. HunJi city walls are completely made out of Rosefinch spirit iron, so it is clear how deep their resources are.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, the horse carriage finally reaches outside HunJi city. That Raging fire horse, that is not driven by anyone, stops on its own.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

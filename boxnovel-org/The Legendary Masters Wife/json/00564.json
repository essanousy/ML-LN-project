Once it was dark, the streets became pitch black, with only a few buildings that would emit light from their windows. The HaoLai Inn was one of those buildings. From afar, one could see a few of the rooms on the second floor were still lit.</p><br/><p>The HaoLai Inn sign shook violently under the night\u2019s cold and violent winds.</p><br/><p>In the lobby of the inn, the innkeeper came out of the corner with an oil lamp in hand. Within the darkness, lit only by a dim oil lamp, the innkeeper looked very scary and frightening.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper carried the lamp up the stairs and, as he walked, a creaking noise could be heard. In the silence of the night, it was amplified a by hundred fold.</p><br/><p>Once up, the innkeeper walked over to the rooms with their lights on. His wrinkly face made an eerie smile.</p><br/><p>In the room, You XiaoMo was concentrated on staring at Ling Xiao when there was a sudden knock on the door.</p><br/><p>Who would knock at such a hour?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt confused but still went to open the door. He was greeted with the innkeeper standing outside, holding an oil lamp beneath his chin, scaring him instantly. He felt as if he\u2019d seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper made a smile that was meant to please as he put down his lamp on the floor. He then held out his other hand that had a tray and said, \u201cCustomer, this is a free midnight snack from my shop to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cNo thanks, I\u2019m not hungry, you can take it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t in the mood for food, even if someone gave him ten free bowls, he still wouldn\u2019t eat it.</p><br/><p>After that, he prepared to close to door.</p><br/><p>Quickly, the innkeeper held out his hand to stop him. With a modest smile he said, \u201cCustomer, even if you aren\u2019t hungry right now, you can have it when you are. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone to eat it, and it would be such a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo furrowed his brows but still took the tray. Instantly, the innkeeper smiled as if blooming a flower and left with the lamp.</p><br/><p>Once he was back in his room, You XiaoMo finally realized the abnormality in the innkeeper\u2019s actions. The people of the JiJiu Town were very excluding to outsiders, why would one suddenly give him free snacks?</p><br/><p>His brain was a mess and he didn\u2019t have the time to think about other complicated stuff, so he just left the tray on the table, for it to feel the loneliness.</p><br/><p>On the first floor lobby.</p><br/><p>The two shop assistants were both male, whereas the chef was a middle aged women. After they saw the innkeeper come down, they instantly surrounded him. but before they asked anything, they saw his gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cInnkeeper, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hurriedly, the chef asked.</p><br/><p>With a darkened expression, he replied, \u201cWe may have to cancel our plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Everyone asked, confused. They had even come prepared.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper said, \u201cOne of the customers wasn\u2019t interested in the snack. Even though I still sent it, it\u2019s most likely that they won\u2019t eat it. If we can\u2019t drug them, they could pose a hindrance to our plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are we just going to leave them be? From what I heard from A Chuan, they are big fishes!\u201d The chef said venomously as her kitchen knife let out a cold shine.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d The innkeeper replied, \u201cFrom what I see, those two won\u2019t be leaving JiJiu Town anytime soon. One of them seemed injured. It\u2019s likely that they will stay until his wounds are healed. As long as they are still in the inn, we have plenty of chances.\u2019</p><br/><p>One the assistants then asked, \u201cThen what about the other two?\u201d</p><br/><p>Recently a lot of outsiders came to JiJiu Town. With the help of A Chuan, there were four outsiders currently staying there. Two of them may leave the next day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have probably already eaten the snack I sent them. We have to get rid of them today, otherwise they will find out that something was in it by tomorrow.\u201d The innkeeper thought about it and continued, \u201cOkay, so I\u2019ll go and distract the two that didn\u2019t eat the snack while you guys go tie up the other two. Make sure to keep it quiet, we don\u2019t want to be discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four split up and got to work. The HaoLai Inn was one of those \u2018shady\u2019 shops.</p><br/><p>A Chuan was truly from the JiJiu Town but he also had another identity and that was to introduce foreigners to HaoLai Inn. They then drugged them, tied them up and stole all of their belongings. Of course, killing and such were also included, since they were just a bunch of outsiders.</p><br/><p>Thus, it wasn\u2019t even thirty minutes when the innkeeper knocked on You XiaoMo\u2019s door again.</p><br/><p>With impatience You XiaoMo opened the door, \u201cWhat do you want this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile to placate, the innkeeper said, \u201cCustomer, I thought that you may be feeling worried over your friend there, so I made two side dishes for you and a small bottle of wine. If you feel bored, you can have the wine with something to snack on.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly felt that this innkeeper was a bit interesting. After seeing the stuff on his hand, he said, \u201cIf I remember correctly, the people of the JiJiu Town were very excluding, shouldn\u2019t you guys be the same? Why are you being so nice and giving me free food?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you say is correct, the JiJiu Town is very excluding to outsiders, but there is a small section that isn\u2019t, like me. Although we still charged you such an expensive rate, it was out of necessity. If we were to stand out, then we would be targeted by the people of the town, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d With no rush, the innkeeper answered calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then, you can leave the stuff.\u201d You XiaoMo thought that there was some truth to what he said. What he didn\u2019t know was that it was on purpose.</p><br/><p>With his consent, the innkeeper walked in with his head lowered. However, seamlessly, he also took a peak and saw that blurry figure behind the screen.</p><br/><p>Once he put the stuff down, the innkeeper took the previous stuff and said, \u201cCustomer, these snack\u2019s have gone cold so I\u2019ll take it down stairs with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither the wine nor the dishes were drugged. So as to make sure he didn\u2019t discover the drug, he came with the purpose to also retrieve the evidence.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved his hand to shoo him away. The innkeeper figured that it was probably enough time and left the room.</p><br/><p>Once he arrived at the kitchen, he emptied the two snacks into a bucket and hurried to the firewood storage. Expectedly, his people were already there with the two outsiders tied up.</p><br/><p>Although they were practitioners, the drugs they used weren\u2019t normal. The normal stuff would only work on normal people after all.</p><br/><p>The four striped them of all their riches but there were only two magic bags.</p><br/><p>It was too bad that they were just normal practitioners. Their combined spirit gems didn\u2019t even reach a hundred. Although it was still a decent amount, that was enough to satisfy them. By the looks of things, they couldn\u2019t let the big fishes off the hook. They must have a lot on them.</p><br/><p>Turning to the chef, the innkeeper said, \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving the rest to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slapping her chest, the chef affirmed with an eerie expression, \u201cDon\u2019t worry innkeeper, just leave the rest to me.\u201d Then she brought out her trusty kitchen knife.</p><br/><p>On the second floor, You XiaoMo was wholly unaware that the other two outsiders were already gone.</p><br/><p>The two dishes that the innkeeper had bought were peanuts and sugar lotus slices. He hadn\u2019t eaten these in a long time, that it really got his appetite up.</p><br/><p>If the innkeeper knew that this was all that was needed to lure You XiaoMo, he wouldn\u2019t have been so regretful of his decision to not drug it. It was a waste of a perfectly good opportunity, although, with only You XiaoMo eating it, it was destined to fail anyways.</p><br/><p>On the morning of the second day, Ling Xiao was still recuperating on the bed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo made a lazy stretch. It was very uncomfortable, sleeping on the table. He felt sore all over. If he wasn\u2019t afraid of disturbing Ling Xiao by sleeping on the bed, there was no way he would have given it up.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ling Xiao\u2019s condition wasn\u2019t bad, You XiaoMo walked out of the room, yawning. At the staircase, he met with the shopkeeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer, you\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought that this was the perfect opportunity, since didn\u2019t need to get down. You XiaoMo said, \u201cThe sugar lotus slices from last night were delicious, give me another, also some other stuff. No need for wine, just tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The innkeeper affirmed and went down to get it prepared.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo guessed that it was probably pre-prepared since it wasn\u2019t even five minutes after that the innkeeper returned with everything. There were the lotus slices he ordered, a steamy meat bun and two bowls of congee. All in good serving.</p><br/><p>This time, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t let him in but shooed him off after he took the stuff.</p><br/><p>Once he placed the stuff down, he walked over to the screen to check on Ling Xiao. Seeing that his eyes were still unopened, he didn\u2019t call in fear of disturbing him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the lotus slices that got his appetite up but his gaze was drawn to the steamy bun beside it. It was a pure white, very big and made one\u2019s mouth water just by looking at it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but take one and pull it apart. He had a weird habit of eating buns, he always split it in half, that way, according to him, it tasted better.</p><br/><p>But just as he was preparing to take a bite, he found something odd about the filling. There was something sharp in the meat?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took the stuff out and upon a closer inspection, realized that it was a piece of a nail. There was a human nail in the bun?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s hands shook and with that the bun fell onto the floor.</p><br/><p>What amazing luck he had, he just found a human meat bun!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The map they have must absolutely not be discovered by Tang YunQi and company. But it\u2019s all for naught because Tang YunQi is forever stuck to Ling Xiao, asking this and that. He simply has no chance to bring it up.</p><br/><p>But there is one thing for certain. Ling Xiao must have expected it already. That\u2019s why he accepted Tang YunQi\u2019s suggestion without talking it over with him first. So, even though his heart is bursting with curiosity, You XiaoMo still bears with it.</p><br/><p>A lot of the magic herbs and magic beasts are at the Jade Spiritual Cave. Although You XiaoMo just left the Jade Spiritual Cave a few hours ago, he was planning to return again to the Jade Spiritual Cave to dig up some magic herbs. Therefore, he moves forward with them without protesting.</p><br/><p>The whole way, the one with the most words is Tang YunQi. No one knows where all those words came from, from the North pole to the South pole. Although Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t say much in reply, she still carries on enthusiastically by herself.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is rather bored, riding on top of Da Piqiu.</p><br/><p>Although Da Piqiu has a wound on one of it\u2019s legs, the healing capability of the Blue-blooded wolf is very strong. Furthermore, You XiaoMo was not stingy with the Healing magic pill. Right now, that wound is already healing rapidly, not the least bit affecting it\u2019s strong and vigorous posture.</p><br/><p>Just as he was feeling bored, Jiang Liu who was walking in front starts to slow down his pace. Very quickly, he is walking side by side with him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu seems to have been looking for an opportunity to talk to him. A dazzling smile bursts forth from his bright and fresh face as he looks at You XiaoMo. He smiles while saying, \u201cBig brother You, it\u2019s been a long time. I didn\u2019t expect us to actually meet in the Paradise Realm. Looks like we are quite fated, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs drily.</p><br/><p>What fated? From his point of view, it\u2019s more like ill-fated. He knows that Jiang Liu certainly did not expect that he would actually make it to the Paradise Realm.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he keeps the same expression on the surface. It\u2019s just that he is very curious. He and Jiang Liu are disciples from different peaks, with not much contact with each other. Although there is bad blood between Earth peak and Heaven peak, they are newly admitted disciples, still under a year. Even if he has assimilated himself into his peak, it\u2019s hard to imagine that the rivalry would rise to the extent of stabbing him in the back <i>ba</i>. But thinking back now, he feels that Jiang Liu probably hated him from the beginning.</p><br/><p>But he can\u2019t figure out why Jiang Liu hates him so much. He doesn\u2019t remember ever offending Jiang Liu, but he can\u2019t be sure about the original You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu doesn\u2019t seem to detect his wariness. He glances at the Blue-blooded wolf below him and says admiringly, \u201cBig brother You\u2019s luck is very good. Just a few days after entering the Paradise Realm and you already have a level eight Blue-blooded wolf. I read in the scrolls that the combat ability of the Blue-blooded wolf is very strong, probably one of the best among the magic beasts of the same level. I also really want to have a Blue-blooded wolf.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s brain churns quickly as he says, \u201cThere are still twenty over days. I believe you will have the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu winks at him cheekily, \u201cI also believe my luck can\u2019t be that bad. Oh right, Big brother You. This Blue-blooded wolf if very big. Can you let me get on as well? I also want to try and see how it feels to sit on a level eight magic beast. Can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is momentarily speechless when he hears those words. Normally, people wouldn\u2019t bring up this kind of request <i>ba</i>. However, he can\u2019t just say that so he can only say awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Junior brother Jiang. Da Piqiu doesn\u2019t like strangers to get close to it. Also, his injury still hasn\u2019t healed so I\u2019m afraid it is not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so <i>ah</i>. Then it\u2019s fine. I was only asking, nothing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu frowns imperceptibly and then nods understandingly, as if his words just now were really something he just thought of.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs awkwardly and doesn\u2019t say anything more.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Jiang Liu brings up another topic. He looks at him in a probing manner as he says, \u201cBig brother You, there is something I want to say but you must not accuse me of being a busybody. I\u2019m only curious, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frowns, not knowing what he wants to say.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu looks at him with shining eyes, his fingers linked behind his back, as he smiles seemingly harmlessly while saying, \u201cI heard that only level three mages have the right to get a spot on the Paradise Realm list. Since Big brother You can appear hear, does it mean that you are already a level three mage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, a strange look immediately appears faintly on You XiaoMo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>This matter of him not being a level three mage seems to have spread from Earth peak. A lot of the disciples are also blabbermouths. Seems like Flying peak and Heaven peak must have received the news.</p><br/><p>Actually, before he entered the Paradise Realm, it surprised him that Tang Fan and Kong Wen didn\u2019t just say, \u201cYou are not a level three mage.\u201d But thinking back now, it\u2019s probably because the Paradise Realm was about to open, and the two of them are people that don\u2019t like to lose face. Attacking their own disciple in front of the other sects would instead cause others to gossip.</p><br/><p>At that time, his thinking was this: If Tang Fan and Kong Wen insist on pressing the point, he would just come out and tell them that he is already a level three mage. He\u2019ll say that he by chance broke through the day before setting out. Even if they suspect him, there is nothing they can do about it because he is genuinely a level three mage.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t get the chance to say it, so right now, other people do not know what his actual level is.</p><br/><p>Originally, others could generally figure out his cultivation by looking at his soul force. However, ever since he gained true mastery over his dimension, the dimension seems to be able to form a faint protective barrier around his body.</p><br/><p>This matter was found out by Ling Xiao who then told him about it. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have known. That protective barrier can actually conceal his level according to his will.</p><br/><p>Therefore, in the eyes of Tang Fan and company, he still appears as a level two mage.</p><br/><p>Since Jiang Liu is already a level three mage, he should have the ability to see through his level. That means, he should know what level he currently is. Yet he still asks this kind of question. Therefore, it is unlikely that he doesn\u2019t have an ulterior motive.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t like people to badmouth Ling Xiao behind his back so he puts on a happy voice and says, \u201cYes <i>ah</i>. Talking about that, my luck is really good <i>ne</i>. The night before we set out, by luck, I broke through while refining magic pills. However, because everyone was busy with the Paradise Realm, I didn\u2019t tell everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu\u2019s expression freezes momentarily but he recovers very quickly. There is no trace of awkwardness on his face. Instead he appears very happy for him as he says, \u201cBig brother You is really a level three mage? Didn\u2019t I say that your luck is not bad? Congratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t congratulated you. I heard that you also became a level three mage not too long ago. Congratulations to you too!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo says hurriedly. He suddenly feels as if he is saying his new year greetings.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu laughs <b>*ha ha*</b>, but his eyes are flashing as he glances sharply, \u201cHow can Junior brother compare with Big brother You\u2019s luck? If not for the old master\u2019s benevolence, there was no way I could have risen to a level three mage within three short months.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs while saying, \u201cActually it is you who has better luck than me. At least you have a master that cares for you and supplies you generously with magic herbs. Unlike me, I have to buy everything myself. The magic herbs that I use for refining magic pills is bought with the money I got from selling magic pills. If not, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to rise to the next level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately the smile on Jiang Liu\u2019s face slips.</p><br/><p>He feels that these words seem to be mocking him. He has a master who supplies him with magic herbs. Because of that, he is able to rise quickly. On the other hand, You XiaoMo\u2019s magic herbs were bought with the gold coins that he himself earned. And yet, the speed with which he advanced is about the same as his. These words seem to be saying that if he didn\u2019t have a master who supplied him with magic herbs, he can\u2019t compare to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Although You XiaoMo probably didn\u2019t have an ulterior motive when he said those words, he feels that each and every word is like a thorn, stabbing deeply into his heart, forming a dark mass that seems to be expanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected of Big brother You, this matter, Junior brother cannot compare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu puts on a fake smile.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs <b>*ha ha*</b> while saying, \u201cJunior brother Jiang\u2019s innate talent was already higher than mine. I can only rely on hard work to make up for the deficit in my innate talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu seems to choke momentarily, no longer saying anything more.</p><br/><p>After that, the two of them concentrated on the journey and no longer spoke. It is unclear if Jiang Liu already got the answer he was looking for or if he was really rendered speechless by You XiaoMo\u2019s words. Whatever it is, he was no longer seen looking for You XiaoMo to talk to him.</p><br/><p>As for You XiaoMo, at first he was endlessly depressed because he had to travel together with Tang YunQi and company. Now, it seems as if the depression from before has been swept away. His delicate and glowing face is sparkling with joy straight from his heart, even saying a few words to Da Piqiu from time to time.</p><br/><p>At the front, Ling Xiao who never once looked back suddenly raises the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Tang YunQi just happens to turn her head and catch sight of the smile before it disappears. She can\u2019t help but ask curiously, \u201cBrother Xiao, what are you smiling about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shoots her a glance and then replies indifferently, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang YunQi doesn\u2019t really believe it and wants to keep asking but right at this moment, Lei Ju who was always at the front leading the way suddenly runs back and shouts excitedly and happily, \u201cEveryone, quick, come and see. There is a level six magic beast in the cave ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>________________________________________<wbr>__________I don\u2019t speak Chinese. Corrections welcomed.</wbr></p><br/>\n</div>"}

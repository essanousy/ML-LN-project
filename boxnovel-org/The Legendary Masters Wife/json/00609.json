Even though the expert from the Black Spider couldn\u2019t make out what the newcomer looked like clearly, he could sense the familiar aura being exuded, and the expert opened his eyes wide in disbelief.</p><br/><p>This person wasn\u2019t anyone else except the man in the black robe who had fought with Ling Xiao at the bottom of the ocean in Dong City over the White Tiger\u2019s palace. Afterwards, he had fled when he was injured by Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Even though he was also a Sacred Realm expert who was even stronger than the Mage Association\u2019s experts, because he was wounded by Ling Xiao, it had caused his strength to decrease, so he had tolerated these major powers. Or else someone with the Black Spider\u2019s bandit-like attitude definitely wouldn\u2019t have agreed to split the magic herbs evenly with the Mage Association and other major powers.</p><br/><p>When he had entered the Peach Blossom Ruins, he clearly hadn\u2019t seen Ling Xiao or You XiaoMo. He presumed that they had probably been chased by Xia Yin to some other place, and he hadn\u2019t expected to see him here. He even more so hadn\u2019t expected him to be the one who came out to help the Mage Association, and in a moment of oversight, he was fooled.</p><br/><p>It was the so-called \u201chitting them when they were down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao obviously wasn\u2019t here to reminisce about the olden days. Once he intercepted him, he acted immediately, and within a few blows he caused the expert to spew blood endlessly, unable to defend himself. His injury, which still hadn\u2019t healed completely from two or three months ago, became even more serious. Even if he was a Divine Realm expert, he wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat him.</p><br/><p>The other Black Spider members couldn\u2019t even take care of themselves, let alone come and save him. Furthermore, in their eyes, their companions were people that they could leave behind or sell out at any time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment, as long as you don\u2019t kill me, I can tell you a big secret. It concerns that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised his hand, and a ball of fire the size of a fist appeared with a crackle in his hand. Purple and red flames intertwined together, spinning like a whirlwind.</p><br/><p>The person in black definitely didn\u2019t want to die here, and he hastily told him to stop, that he still knew quite a few secrets that he was certain Ling Xiao would be quite interested in.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s movements paused, and he looked at him with an expression that seemed to be smiling but not at the same time. \u201cThat person?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black saw him wavering, and joy leaped in his heart. He said quickly, \u201cCorrect, that person is your biggest enemy. I imagine that you would be very interested in knowing more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you talk about it a little? If it has value, I can consider letting you go.\u201d Ling Xiao extinguished the ball of fire in his hand, his figure still standing in the entrance, not moving a single step, gaze locked on the Black Spider expert\u2019s body. Even if the person in black wanted to play tricks on him, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to escape.</p><br/><p>The black-robed person covered his chest with his hand as he stood up, his face going pale, his footsteps a little uneven. When he smiled, he revealed a mouth full of bloody teeth. \u201cThat person\u2026 right now\u2026 he is\u2026 ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t finished talking yet when his body suddenly exploded, leaving behind a bloody hole where his heart was. The black-robed person opened his mouth, as if he wanted to say something, but he had already fallen down, unmoving.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took a few steps back as a spray of blood just happened to splash onto the ground where he was standing.</p><br/><p>The sudden situation attracted everyone\u2019s attention, and a member of the Black Spider took advantage of the opportunity to escape.</p><br/><p>A few people thought that Ling Xiao killed the person in black. Even though the truth was about the same, the ones with good judgment could tell that the black-robed person\u2019s body had exploded on its own. This should be something that was controlled from very far away; someone most likely had a hold over the person in black.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo slipped in from outside.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked over and blatantly stripped the magic bags from the black-robed person\u2019s body and handed it to You XiaoMo, who put them away extremely self-consciously. He didn\u2019t even look at them before tossing them into the dimension. They didn\u2019t have the intention of sharing them with the others at all.</p><br/><p>Only an idiot would share them. Ling Xiao could be considered the one who killed the person in black; moreover, if it weren\u2019t for Ling Xiao intercepting him, the person in black would have fled a long time ago. If the others wanted to beg for a share of the treasure, then they would still have to take a look and see if they were standing on the side of logic.</p><br/><p>The one who showed the most interest was still the Qilin Clan.</p><br/><p>Since the person in black was the strongest among the five people from the Black Spider, and since the Black Spider was the one who had taken most of the treasures from the cave dwelling, the majority of those treasures were in the black-robed person\u2019s magic bags.</p><br/><p>However, the True Dragon Clan didn\u2019t seem to be unhappy. The lives of their clan members were still more important than any object. Moreover, the identity of the youth was fairly out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>The representative from the Mage Association frowned, but he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>The other two major powers\u2019 responses made the Qilin Clan feel worse and worse, but out of fear of Ling Xiao\u2019s strength, they didn\u2019t dare to step forward and oppose him. Especially after they learned that Ling Xiao\u2019s Godfire had the ability to swallow other Godfire, he was simply their natural enemy, unless they wanted to end up like the Demon Phoenix Godfire\u2019s Ji Rui.</p><br/><p>After the barrier around the cave dwellings was broken, this place would also soon be filled with miasma. Spirit Mountain\u2019s Eight Mansions had already lost a mansion.</p><br/><p>After leaving the sixth mansion, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao separated from the other major powers.</p><br/><p>However, they had made an agreement with the youth that after leaving the ruins, they would go find him, and so they told him to prepare the demon beast Life Crystals. What they needed wasn\u2019t just one or two.</p><br/><p>The thing that the youth had in abundance was demon beast Life Crystals. There were many demon beasts in Xi Jing, and every year, at least hundreds of thousands demon beasts died. Most were killed in battle, but there were also a few who had died from old age. Every year, the True Dragon Clan could collect ten or so crystals at the very least, and he hadn\u2019t even finished selling all the Life Crystals he stole from the True Dragon Clan last time.</p><br/><p>Without any outsiders present, You XiaoMo\u2019s tense expression finally relaxed.</p><br/><p>He had known that the Qilin Clan and Ling Xiao didn\u2019t get along for a long time now. He could already tell during the Black Spider\u2019s auction, and the more they had to interact with each other, he discovered that Ling Xiao\u2019s expression grew chillier and chillier. In the end, it looked entirely as if he wanted to eat someone alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the person in black say back there?\u201d You XiaoMo could finally ask without having to worry.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t answer his question immediately. Instead, he started dragging him back in the direction they came from.</p><br/><p>Correct, it was the path that led back to the sixth mansion. They returned the same way they came.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was full of doubt, but he understood once they returned to the cave dwelling and he saw the black-robed person\u2019s corpse. The person in black was already completely dead, but the fresh blood covering the floor acted as if it was alive as it gathering into a round ball of blood. Once they arrived, the ball of blood spasmed a few times like a heart before slowly expanding and finally forming the shape of a person made of blood.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gaped.</p><br/><p>The blood figure turned and looked towards them. Even though it was blurry, they could still make out a very handsome face. It suddenly revealed a dazzling smile before its gaze landed on Ling Xiao, and it laughed. \u201cThe person I like the least in all of the Qilin Clan is you. But the only one who really understands me is also you. Lin Xiao (, not a typo), it\u2019s been an eternity since we last met, I trust that you\u2019ve been well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your inquiry. I\u2019ve been doing pretty well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stared at this face, which he hadn\u2019t seen in many years, his heart calm. His surname was Ling, but also Lin, because Lin was his father\u2019s last name. But after he was born, his father changed Ling Xiao\u2019s surname to Ling, and he had never told him the reason why. However, this was something that the Qilin Clan never knew about. They knew that his surname was Ling, but they didn\u2019t know that this Ling was once Lin.</p><br/><p>The blood figure assessed him before laughing lightly. \u201cYour cultivation base is higher than what I imagined it to be. I really thought that you would stay in the Middle Level Realm for ten thousand years, but it seems like that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shot him an indifferent glance. He suddenly smiled. \u201cDid you personally kill one of your subordinates just to speak nonsense with me? It\u2019s been ten thousand years since we last met, but you\u2019ve become more and more long-winded.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood figure didn\u2019t get irritated or angry. \u201cOf course not. I came to warn you that there are only two years left of the promise you made ten thousand years ago. When the time comes, you better not disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he even purposefully shot a glance at You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s scalp prickled. He felt as if this person was very unusual, but when he heard them speaking, he finally knew Ling Xiao meant during their conversation when they had just met. It seemed that this extremely strange person was actually the arch-criminal who drove Ling Xiao to Long Xiang Continent. It also seemed that he wasn\u2019t your typical formidable adversary.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulled You XiaoMo behind him, as if he didn\u2019t want him to be seen. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would care about me so much. I\u2019m very touched.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft\u2026.\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>The blood figure was stunned for a moment before recovering very quickly. When he heard You XiaoMo\u2019s laugh, he swept a glance over him before lowering his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re the same as ever. You always like to misunderstand other people\u2019s intentions. However, I can\u2019t see you being so confident. Are you really entrusting all of your hopes to this little brat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018little brat\u2019 he was referring to was naturally You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had enormous potential, more potential than anyone he had ever met before. But right now, he was still only Grade Three Rainbow Level. Even though it wasn\u2019t impossible for him to reach Grade Six or Seven within two years, it had extremely large consequences. It probably hadn\u2019t manifested yet, but the more time went on, the clearer the after-effects would be. He greatly anticipated the arrival of that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that you care a lot about me. I appreciate your kindness.\u201d Ling Xiao smiled slightly as he spoke, his expression as light as ever. Matched with his words, someone who wasn\u2019t familiar with the situation would really believe that their relationship was quite good.</p><br/><p>The blood figure paused for a second before an ugly smile appeared on his handsome face. \u201cDo you know that what I hate the most is you using that expression to say those kinds of words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, so that\u2019s why I specifically replied to you that way.\u201d The smile on Ling Xiao\u2019s face grew even warmer.</p><br/><p>Three seconds later, the blood figure spilled back onto the ground, the air ringing with his last sentence. \u201cI greatly anticipate the day that we meet again. I hope that you will not disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

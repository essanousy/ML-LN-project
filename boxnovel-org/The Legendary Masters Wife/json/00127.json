Their relationship is definitely not at the stage where they would eat together or shoot the breeze together. And yet it is Fifth brother who personally calls him over.</p><br/><p>When he walks over, Zhao DaZhou asks the disciple that is eating at the same table with him to go find another table. And he says it in front of You XiaoMo. That disciple looks oddly at him. Before leaving, he also glances at You XiaoMo seemingly not too happy.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is depressed as he realizes that he is again hated through no fault of his own. This person is also his brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth brother, do you need me for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sits down in front of him and asks.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, Zhao DaZhou looks at him strangely, \u201cDidn\u2019t you come to the canteen to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is stunned for a moment. What kind of question is this <i>ah</i>? But he still nods, \u201cYes, I\u2019m here to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>What has this got to do with you calling me over?</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou seems to be able to hear his thoughts, explaining a little awkwardly, \u201cNow is the peak time for the canteen. You won\u2019t be able to find a seat. It so happens that there is a seat here. After all, you\u2019re only one person.\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time he finishes saying this, his ears have already turned red.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stares at him in surprise. He only comes back to his senses when he realizes that he is about to be shamed into anger. So this Fifth brother saw that he couldn\u2019t find a seat so he called him over. He really is the number one most awkward young man in his heart. Clearly he wants to befriend him yet he comes up with an awkward excuse. Inside his heart, he is secretly delighted!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, thank you Fifth brother. I\u2019ll go get food now.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo beams as he speaks, standing up under the shamed to anger glance from him.</p><br/><p>After queueing for quite some time, he brings his food back and finds that Fifth brother is still sitting at the table. He didn\u2019t seem to have made much progress with the food in front of him. He thought that he would have already finished eating and left.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou takes a glance at the food in his hands. There is an even distribution between meat and vegetables. It\u2019s just that the quantity is somewhat little. Also, there is only one bowl of rice so he can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cDo you usually eat so little?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nods while sitting down, \u201cYes <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder he looks so thin. Zhao DaZhou hesitates a bit but can\u2019t stop himself from saying, \u201cI urge you to eat a little more next time. Eating so little, you won\u2019t have enough energy when you refine magic pills later. Don\u2019t cry your eyes out when you fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is stunned for a moment before realizing that he is concerned about him. He then simply gives him a dazzling smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Fifth brother. I will eat when I\u2019m hungry. I won\u2019t let myself starve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou says, \u201cThe canteen doesn\u2019t serve food at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs, \u201cI know <i>ya</i>. The last time I went down the mountain I bought some ordinary magic fruits and snacks. It\u2019s all in my magic bag so I can have them at any time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, it\u2019s all in his dimension.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou looks at him with his mouth open for quite a while. Turns, turns out that the person he is concerned about is actually quite an eater? Thinking like this, he immediately keeps his mouth shut. He would be a fool to continue worrying about him not having enough to eat.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he doesn\u2019t speak, You XiaoMo also keeps quiet and starts eating quietly with his head down.</p><br/><p>After just a few bites, Zhao DaZhou suddenly says in a thin mosquito-like voice, \u201cSeventh brother, about, about the matter last time, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks up in surprise, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thank him? Could it be that he did something good unintentionally?</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou turns red in embarrassment. Thinking that he didn\u2019t hear what he said, he repeats it awkwardly, \u201cI said, thank you for the matter last time. If you didn\u2019t give me those pointers, I wouldn\u2019t have improved so much. So, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that day, Zhao DaZhou went back and actually decided to try the method that You XiaoMo told him. At first, he failed. But after trying a few times, he discovered the secret key points. From that day on, his success rate for refining magic pills increased considerably. Now he can already distill magic herbs twice with ease.</p><br/><p>For him, this is a glorious thing. When his dad found out, he actually praised him. That was the first time he received praise from his dad.</p><br/><p>After hearing him bring it up, You XiaoMo remembers that there really was such a thing.</p><br/><p>But, that was just him casually mentioning his own experience. He absolutely didn\u2019t expect that Big brother Zhao would take it seriously. Unexpectedly, he actually tried it out. But it is good that it was helpful. After all, he doesn\u2019t mind helping out his own brothers.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs lightly, \u201cFifth brother doesn\u2019t have to thank me. I only said what I knew. The key thing lies in your own grasp on the matter. Talking about that, this is the result of your own efforts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how it is, I still want to thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou knows that he is being polite.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he insists, You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t pursue the matter.</p><br/><p>After a while, Zhao DaZhou suddenly grits his teeth and says in a low voice, \u201cSeventh brother. If you already finished using the one month\u2019s worth of magic herbs from before, I can make an exception and give you half a month\u2019s worth of magic herbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at him in surprise. It is a while before he shakes his head saying cautiously, \u201cHow can that be? After all, Earth peak has its own rules. If someone finds out, you will receive a huge punishment. I can\u2019t let you take the risk.\u201d</p><br/><p>He definitely doesn\u2019t want Fifth brother to take this kind of risk just to pay him back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t say anything, no one would find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou frowns as he speaks.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shakes his head firmly, \u201cNo, maybe it won\u2019t be discovered immediately but I remember that the Hall of Enchanted Herbs conducts an inventory check every month. At that time, it will be discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. When the time comes, I have my ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he has his heart set on it, You XiaoMo feels a little helpless. He can only choose to tell a white lie, \u201cFifth brother. I know you mean well. But I don\u2019t want to hide it from you. Actually other than the magic herbs I took the last time, I still have quite a bit of level two magic herbs in my magic bag. Didn\u2019t I just go down the mountain? I sold the magic pills I refined before and then bought some level two magic herbs. I still haven\u2019t used them yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou\u2019s eyes open wide. No wonder he never sees him taking on chores. Looks like he has been selling magic pills.</p><br/><p>But that little bit of magic pills, how much can they fetch? But seeing his serious look, Zhao DaZhou doesn\u2019t doubt him. Actually there are quite a few disciples of the mage division that would chose this method when they are short of money. Even he himself would occasionally go down and sell magic pills to buy magic herbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re \u2026\u2026. really not lying to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou asks.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m not lying!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo says dripping in cold sweat. Please don\u2019t make him swear it <i>ah</i>!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine then. But if you really want it next time, I can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou\u2019s tone seems a little unsatisfied. After all, this is the first time he helps someone else voluntarily. Also, this \u2018someone else\u2019 didn\u2019t ask for any repayment for his help. Because of his status, when other people are nice to him, they all have ulterior motives.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gives out an embarrassed laugh. He really admires this Fifth brother. In order to thank him, he would rather go violate the rules of Earth peak. Although he means well, but if it really gets discovered, even he <b>would have to bear the consequences</b>.</p><br/><p>Strictly speaking, even though he is not the main offender, in the eyes of others, he is definitely an accomplice or he might even be labeled as the instigator.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Fifth brother. Three months from now is the day the Paradise realm opens. Are you also thinking of going?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is afraid that he would keep on talking about this so he quickly changes the topic of the conversation.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Zhao DaZhou becomes quiet.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo is thinking that he must have said something wrong, Zhao DaZhou suddenly opens his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father doesn\u2019t want to let me go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou says.</p><br/><p>Actually he really wants to go. Everyone knows that going to the Paradise realm is a good opportunity. If he is lucky, he might be able to bond a capable magic beast to himself. Or maybe he will find some mid level or high level magic herbs. Even low level magic herbs would make him very happy. But what can be done? His father is dead set on not letting him go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks in surprise.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou pouts while saying, \u201cOf course it\u2019s because he\u2019s worried that I will meet with danger. Because great opportunity is accompanied by risk. Lands of treasure like the Paradise realm must be rife with hidden dangers. My dad only has me as his only son and heir. So he is worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>If his dad is willing to let him go, based on his dad\u2019s status, Master would definitely give him a spot on the list.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really a pity!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sighs. But he really understands why Uncle Zhao thinks that way. If he has a son, he also won\u2019t be willing to let him meet with danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeventh brother, you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>After looking at him for some time, Zhao DaZhou suddenly asks.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Ah</i>? Of course I want to go <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo reacts after being stunned momentarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this <i>ba</i>? I\u2019ll go ask my father to help you get a spot from Master. But you have to become a level three mage quickly within these three months. Only then will you have the chance. Take it as me repaying your favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou says earnestly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry. Why are there so many people owing him favors? So many people wanting to pay him back? But hearing him say it like that, he is still very moved. Fifth brother is actually a pretty good guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth brother, you don\u2019t have to. Elder brother already said that he will help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo says.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou stares at him with his eyes open wide for quite a while before saying with a hint of jealousy, \u201cElder brother is too good to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs <b>*hei hei*</b>. Yes <i>ah</i>. He also thinks so. Although Master doesn\u2019t value him, it is enough that he has an Elder brother that treats him well. Furthermore, he has another \u2018Elder brother\u2019 that is actually also very good to him. It\u2019s just that he has never said so.</p><br/><p>Quarter of an hour later, the two of them finish eating and go back their separate ways.</p><br/><p>After this interaction, their brotherly relationship gets quite a bit closer.</p><br/><p><b>Note:</b>you must take with you what you can\u2019t finish eating \u2013 bear all the consequences</p><br/>\n</div>"}

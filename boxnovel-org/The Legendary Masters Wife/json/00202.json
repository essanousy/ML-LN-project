The one whose strength was even higher than the master of the Paradise Realm, he couldn\u2019t find any reason to advance anymore.</p><br/><p>On the surface Ling Xiao may not be a disciple of the Tian Xin Sect, but the one he protected was, well, barely. As he is unsure about the man\u2019s standpoint right now, Luo ChengYuan didn\u2019t dare rush into action, otherwise his corpse might lay next to Tang Fan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>When the Qing Cheng group finally left, the crowd also dispersed as there was nothing left to see.</p><br/><p>In less than two hours, the square had almost emptied, the rest were the Tian Xin Sect\u2019s disciples, they didn\u2019t dare to leave as they looked up to the sky toward Ling Xiao with respect and fear.</p><br/><p>Yuan Mo hesitated a little, but he still came forward, looking at Ling Xiao, he said, \u201cFrom now on I will call you Lin Xiao, today Tang Fan has been killed by you, since you also found the one you were looking for, there shouldn\u2019t be any grudges left between you and the Tian Xin Sect, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Which literally implied, can you overlook the Tian Xin Sect.</p><br/><p>With his age and status, to say these words is not easy.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, toward this Great Elder, held a bit of appreciation. For the Tian Xin Sect\u2019s future, Yuan Mo even disregarded his self-esteem, if you can hold it then you can discard it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had no intentions toward the Tian Xin Sect in the first place. Even if he wanted to, You XiaoMo wouldn\u2019t let him either, or else. Ling Xiao touched the teeth marks on his cheek, he had a feeling, You XiaoMo was going to bite him to death.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Ling Xiao said, \u201cGreat Elder, rest assured, I won\u2019t do anything to the Tian Xin Sect, but as you said, Tang Fan is dead, the grandmaster seat is now empty, I expect there shall not be a second Tang Fan appearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Mo was startled, immediately, tentatively asking, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s finger pointed toward Zhou Peng standing not far away, \u201cZhou-shidi is young and can be considered a talented person compared to his peers, it would be fitting to let him take on the head seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Mo didn\u2019t expect he would nominated Zhou Peng, he knew Zhou Peng\u2019s personality, although he is not the most suitable one for the grandmaster title, it was not like letting him on was not ok, only\u2026 \u201cHis level is not enough for people to submit to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao already guessed he would say so and he calmly said, \u201cWhat if he has a contract with a level 9 demon beast, then how about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Mo\u2019s heart moved a little, \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before, when he told Tang Fan \u201cTang Zhen was murdered by him\u201d that was a lie, at best he only heavily injured Tang Zhen, the one who really killed him was Zhou Peng and his demon beast. Previously when Ling Xiao said he wanted to give Zhao Peng a big gift, he meant this level 9 beast. This was when he pretended to be Elder Li, he found some excuse to leave for a while, it was in order to capture this one.</p><br/><p>Yuan Mo immediately expressed he would support Zhou Peng for the grandmaster seat, he was worried that when Tang Fan died, the Tian Xin Sect would have one less Imperial level martial artist and that the Qing Cheng Sect would take advantage of it. But if Zhao Peng became the grandmaster, then it should be enough to make up for the loss from Tang Fan\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>And the most important thing is, he saw Ling Xiao seemed to be interested in promoting Zhou Peng, if he can get Ling Xiao to stand on Tian Xin Sect\u2019s side, then there was no need to be worried about if the Tian Xin Sect could grow strong or not, this is what he had long intended.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was not like he had never thought of Ling Xiao putting Zhou Peng on the seat so that he could turn the Tian Xin Sect into his possession. But such a strong person like himself, not to mention he also said he only came here to find someone, so that possibility is relatively low.</p><br/><p>Following Tang Fan\u2019s death, it marked the day the Tian Xin Sect would undergo a big purge.</p><br/><p>Those parties once led by Tang Fan, with Yuan Mo\u2019s underhanded method, gradually disintegrated.</p><br/><p>And replacing them were those parties that had a long time ago been against Tang Fan\u2019s party. It was the bunch of people that Zhao DaZhou had told You XiaoMo about before, even though some of them still opposed Zhou Peng becoming the head, they were all suppressed by Yuan Mo.</p><br/><p>With Yuan Mo\u2019s method, even if they were unwilling, they still had to obey. Nominally, he is the only Imperial level martial artist of the sect, but if in the first hundred years, he could support Tang Fan onto the seat, then a hundred years later, he can still support Zhou Peng.</p><br/><p>With pressure here and there, those who wanted to stand up already stood up. Tian Xin Sect\u2019s atmosphere grew into a new color, some people were sad, but naturally some people were content with it. After this big wash was over, the most notable change is Earth peak, most of the cheer is also from there.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, although he was kicked out by Tang Fan, his disciple position was restored by Yuan Mo.</p><br/><p>When he came back to the Earth Peak, he was immediately blocked by three people as he went to enter his room, three different angry faces stared at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shallowly laughed, Ling Xiao was dragged away by Yuan Mo to help Zhou Peng take the seat, so he was not here to help him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy three shixiong, we should calmly discuss this matter.\u201d You XiaoMo secretly glanced at the door, trying to find any figures of those from the SheQiu bunch. <i>Your master is in big trouble now, where the hell are you?</i></p><br/><p>SheQiu, just like the others, thought \u201cSolve it yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou was the one who lost his patience first. He fiercely stared at him, \u201cYou XiaoMo, you did so well hiding this fact from us. Now look how glorious you are! To think we were touched from your kindness earlier, you have already contracted with a level 9 beast.\u201d Of course, this is not the reason for his anger, what he is angry about is that You Xiao Mo didn\u2019t tell him anything at all, which clearly indicates he didn\u2019t trust him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could only smile obsequiously, he didn\u2019t mean it though.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe, seeing his grievous little face, sighed and said, \u201cXiao-shidi, I understand your idea. I cannot blame you completely, but you should be honest with me. The one who saved me at the Paradise Realm, was he also \u2018Lin Xiao\u2019? \u201c</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded, since it had come to this, he didn\u2019t have to hide anymore.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe\u2019s heart finally calmed down, \u201cI should have guessed this sooner, then so the Dead Soul demon beast, is also \u2018Lin Xiao\u2019s\u2019 masterpiece?\u201d</p><br/><p>Remembering that Dead Soul beast\u2019s strange behavior and speech, they were full of doubt before, but if this was \u2018Lin Xiao\u2019s\u2019 doing, then things started to make sense. Although they knew if it was not for You XiaoMo, \u2018Lin Xiao\u2019 wouldn\u2019t bother helping them.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao-shidi, you treat us too well.\u201d Zhao DaZhou grouchily said to hide his shyness.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo touched his nose, and laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s because you are also good to me, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe couldn\u2019t help but pat his head, this Xiao-shidi\u2019s personality, he knew. If other people repayed him with double kindness, he would repay back ten times better. In fact, the lucky ones were them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly slapped his head, he took out from his magic bag a thin book and handed it to them, \u201cThis is for you guys, good stuff <em>ah</em>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu ZiLin took the book, he didn\u2019t show any expression but directly opened it to see. When he swiftly looked over it, his eyes instantly opened wide into two big dots. This is only the second expression people had ever seen on his face.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou was tickled by the sentence, he came over to take a look, and his reaction was the same as Fu ZiLin, the only difference is that his expression looked more stupid.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe also got curious. When he looked at it, he couldn\u2019t take a breathe, not for a while. He finally reacted and said, \u201cXiao-shidi, this this this\u2026.this book is not our sect\u2019s soul training, right ?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the writing was awful, that didn\u2019t stop them from reading the book.</p><br/><p>Compared to the Tian Xin Sect\u2019s soul training book, this Heavenly Soul Scripture is no doubt a higher level.</p><br/><p>But they did not expect You XiaoMo would give this to them, this is way too kind to imagine.</p><br/><p>Of course, they didn\u2019t know You XiaoMo was feeling guilty, that was why he thought of giving this Scripture to the three of them for them to practice it. After all, he was the one who killed their shifu, Kong Wen, although he never treated him right, but them, he didn\u2019t treat them badly.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t say he could not give it to others in the first place, and the worse of it, he never told him that he stole it\u2026.</p><br/><p>After some explanation, the trio finally knew this soul training scripture was given by Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>All kinds of envy and jealousy arose, but after all, they had all lived longer than You XiaoMo by a few years, their thoughts were much more subtle.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe, as the representative, firmly warned him not to casually take out a soul training book like that, even in the future if someone is nice to him, he shouldn\u2019t feel touched out of nowhere and then take it out, or else it will bring unexpected trouble.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was \u201cgently\u201d taught a lesson from top to bottom, he even nearly swore to not to take it out ever again.</p><br/><p>But right now, he didn\u2019t expect that this soul training scripture would later bring him major trouble.</p><br/><p>After talking about the main business, Fang ChenLe suddenly remembered one thing. He hesitated before asking, \u201cXiao-shidi, if that business with the Tian Xin Sect is over, are you and \u2018Lin Xiao\u2019 going to leave here?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was petrified, he never thought about it, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I want to know his intentions first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished the sentence, he couldn\u2019t help but shed a tear, why did he have such an abnormal thought \u201cLing Xiao? Go where he goes?\u201d Why does it sound like the idiom <strong>\u2018married to chicken, follow the chicken, married to dog, follow the dog\u2019</strong>?</p><br/><p><b>t/n: A woman should follow whatever her husband orders</b></p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe sighed, why did he have a feeling his little shidi was sent off to his husband\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>In fact, even Zhao DaZhou and Fu ZiLin also felt that way.</p><br/><p>Between their brotherhood, it turned out the youngest one was the first \u201cto be married.\u201d Wait, this logic seems to be a bit off.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe no longer forced him, he patted You XiaoMo\u2019s miserable face, and said, \u201cXiao-shidi, in the future wherever you go, remember not to forget us, and we will always remember you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately said, \u201cShixiong, rest assured, I can forget Ling Xiao, but I certainly will never forget you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe and Fu Zilin, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou weakly inserted a word, \u201cSeventh-shidi, next time, before you say those words, remember to check behind your back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind him was standing a shadow, and that one was Ling Xiao!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

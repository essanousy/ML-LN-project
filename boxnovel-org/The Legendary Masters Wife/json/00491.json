He had guessed that You XiaoMo had come to the TongTian Continent. Since Fang ChenYue was the other\u2019s respected Da Shixiong, You XiaoMo definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to sit by if he knew that Fang ChenYue had fallen into Jiang Liu\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu couldn\u2019t help but feel excited at the thought of capturing You XiaoMo so soon. He didn\u2019t know why the Vermillion Blood Clan wanted You XiaoMo, but he was certain that You XiaoMo had something they needed.</p><br/><p>However, Tang ZhongHua and Tang He didn\u2019t immediately understand what he was thinking of.</p><br/><p>Though YinYang Valley had forces in Xing Luo City, randomly capturing a stranger without knowing the other\u2019s background wasn\u2019t a wise choice of action.</p><br/><p>Plus, the selection trial was tomorrow. It might be affected.</p><br/><p>Seeing that they seemed unwilling to act, Jiang Liu realized the reason for their hesitation and said in a low, rushed voice, \u201cI recognize this person. He\u2019s someone from the Middle Level Realm. His identity is pretty special. Capturing him will only do you good.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was a person from the Middle Level Realm, then that meant he had no background.</p><br/><p>Though they didn\u2019t know why Jiang Liu wanted to capture this person, he didn\u2019t seem like he was lying. Tang ZhongHua walked up to Ling Xiao, half doubtfully.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao swept his gaze over the three, smiling, before stopping at Jiang Liu.</p><br/><p>After some contemplation, he had managed to figure out what Jiang Liu wanted to do. He had a good idea, but luck was important.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Liu\u2019s cultivation level was rather surprising. It seemed that he had been given many opportunities these few years. It was just unfortunate that he seemed a little weird. Was this the aftereffect of forcibly increasing his cultivation level?</p><br/><p>Seeing that \u2018Fang ChenYue\u2019 seemed unfazed and was even smiling, an unsettled feeling rose in Jiang Liu\u2019s chest. It was especially strong when those eyes looked at him. It felt like even his soul was being looked through.</p><br/><p>He hurriedly reassured himself. That was impossible.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenYue was just a Mage. No matter how strong he was, he wouldn\u2019t be able to match up to them.</p><br/><p>In his delight, he had neglected something: Fang ChenYue\u2019s temperament. Fang ChenYue was like the older brother you never had, and interacting with him would give you a warm feeling inside your heart. As for Ling Xiao, even if the entire Higher Realm collapsed, he wouldn\u2019t be able to even fake that.</p><br/><p>Tang ZhongHua surveyed Ling Xiao, hands grasped behind his back. \u201cDo you need me to force you, or will you come quietly?\u201d He thought nothing of a person from the Middle Level Realm, his tone clearly superior.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre all people in the YinYang Valley so unreasonable?\u201d Ling Xiao asked, smiling. There was no hint of anxiety on his face at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you know we\u2019re from the YinYang Valley, I advise you to come quietly. We won\u2019t do anything to you, we just want you to come with us for a while, so don\u2019t force us to use violence. Nothing good will come of it for you.\u201d Tang ZhongHua really did hope the other would listen. That way, he wouldn\u2019t have to go through the trouble of fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Tang, why bother wasting so many words on him? Let\u2019s just get him.\u201d Tang He, tired of their talking, unsheathed a thin knife and said, bloodthirsty, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, then I will. I didn\u2019t get the chance to fully enjoy myself back in the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Tang ZhongHua rejected his offer, raising his hand and revealing his arm from under his sleeve. His hands had a silver, metal sleeve over them.</p><br/><p>Amusement appeared on Tang He\u2019s face. He was going to use his ace immediately?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t realize his Uncle Tang viewed this with such importance. It seemed like he wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. However\u2026 Tang He looked towards Ling Xiao. He couldn\u2019t help but feel that there was something wrong with the whole situation, but he couldn\u2019t grasp why.</p><br/><p>Tang ZhongHua\u2019s metal hand was already darting towards Ling Xiao, yelling, \u201cIf you refuse to take the easy way out and insist on the hard way, then eat this: Ghost Claw! Take this as a lesson and remember it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took one small step forward with his left foot. His fist, which looked completely normal without any metal sleeve, seemed to weigh tons, slamming directly against Tang ZhongHua\u2019s Ghost Claw.</p><br/><p>The two forces met, creating a shockwave that spread out. A few of the passing people didn\u2019t dodge in time and were blown off their feet.</p><br/><p>Two seconds later, a cracking noise sounded out.</p><br/><p>Before anyone realized what had happened, Tang ZhongHua was flying back, screaming, and slammed into the ground. His right arm was twisted at an unnatural angle, dangling to one side. His face was pale, eyes reflecting pain and shock.</p><br/><p>The area was silent\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t Fang ChenYue.\u201d In this strange atmosphere, Jiang Liu\u2019s high pitched voice rung out, piercing through everyone\u2019s ears like a bewitchment, waking them all up.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao side-eyed him, using a surprised tone to say, \u201cAh? Who\u2019s Fang ChenYue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu\u2019s expression immediately twisted. He only just realized that, apart from the other\u2019s face, he wasn\u2019t like Fang ChenYue at all. Could it really be that he had gotten the wrong person?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that can be overlooked with just the excuse of getting the wrong person,\u201d Ling Xiao said, timely. His voice was playful but clearly was unwilling to let the matter go.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu soon calmed. He wasn\u2019t inexperienced. Though he had gotten the wrong person, Xing Luo City was within the YinYang Valley\u2019s control. He didn\u2019t believe that this guy dared to do anything to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was all a misunderstanding. I trust that you don\u2019t want YinYang Valley as your enemy, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though he said this, addressing the other with respect, Jiang Liu still maintained a threatening tone.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes. This Jiang Liu didn\u2019t seem as weak and soft as he was before. Could it be that because he had the YinYang Valley\u2019s support, he had gotten so confident?</p><br/><p>This feeling was like someone who used to be even lower than an ant suddenly changing into a person with backing, acting all superior and looking down at people. This was exceptionally unsatisfying.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t like his expression, so he backhanded him, the sound of skin hitting skin extremely loud and clear.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu might be a level nine mage, but he couldn\u2019t take Ling Xiao\u2019s slap, thrown to the ground by the force. When he raised his head again, half his face was swollen, and he wore an expression of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you dare hit me?\u201d Jiang Liu\u2019s hands were trembling, his eyes red as he glared.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao ignored Tang He and walked up to Jiang Liu, crouching. Staring into the other\u2019s hateful eyes, Ling Xiao smiled softly. \u201cI don\u2019t like your eyes. How about I dig them out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu felt a chill spread through his body, beginning to shake. He knew that this man wasn\u2019t joking. He didn\u2019t want to have his eyes dug out, yelling at Tang He in terror. \u201cNo, no\u2026 Tang-Tang He, Tang He! Save me! Hurry and save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang He was rooted in place. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to save Jiang Liu, but that he was helpless to act. This guy had an aura that could only belong to an emperor level practitioner. He wasn\u2019t the other\u2019s opponent at all. If he stayed, then he might be killed as well.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Tang He backed away, yelling, \u201cJiang Liu, hang on, I\u2019ll go find people to save you!\u201d After that, he ran in the other direction.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu felt anger consume him. His only savior had abandoned him. Though he knew that neither Tang He or Tang ZhongHua were this man\u2019s opponent, he couldn\u2019t help the rage that rose in his heart.</p><br/><p>Realizing that if he kept stalling, all of Xing Luo City\u2019s powerhouses might arrive soon, Ling Xiao decided to get this over with. It wasn\u2019t that he was afraid of those people, but the idiot was still in Xing Luo City.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t use his fingers, that was too dirty!</p><br/><p>Using fire, the other\u2019s fragile eyes couldn\u2019t stand the heat, melting bit by bit. It was far crueler than just digging them out. Jiang Liu screamed with all his might, veins bulging and nails tearing at his own face, creating lines of blood. He\u2019d rather die right there.</p><br/><p>By the time Ling Xiao retracted the flames, Jiang Liu didn\u2019t even have the energy left to scream, twitching as he lay on the ground. He seemed like he was on his last breath, as if he had lost half a life.</p><br/><p>The people around had all ran off. It was too terrifying. Just hearing Jiang Liu\u2019s screams made them feel like it was their own eyes being burned away.</p><br/><p>Though it was a terrible fate, no one sympathized with Jiang Liu.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was dead set on attacking that man using his connections with the YinYang Valley, he wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this.</p><br/><p>Seeing several figures approaching, Ling Xiao lowered his head and said to Jiang Liu with a delighted smile, \u201cAiya, looks like your saviors are here. Then let\u2019s stop here. Next time, remember to chill out a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until he left that those people arrived.</p><br/><p>Amongst them was Tang He. Seeing Jiang Liu\u2019s state, he couldn\u2019t help but inhale sharply. Both of Jiang Liu\u2019s eyes had become black holes. If they had been dug out, then there was a chance of healing them, but like this, it would be impossible.</p><br/><p>Shock flashed through the eyes of the city master of Xing Luo City, but it was drowned in rage. Someone dared to murder people in his city, and the victim was someone chosen by the Vermillion Blood Clan, too. Unforgivable.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn my orders, give everything we have to apprehend the perpetrator.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

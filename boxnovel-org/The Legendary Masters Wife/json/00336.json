Around March, when they blossomed, these petals filled up the sky as they danced, a once in a lifetime sight. This attracted many tourists for sightseeing, making this time of the year the busiest.</p><br/><p>Around November, when the peaches started to grow plump and juicy, they filled the mountain with mature peach trees. The villagers lived modestly, when the peaches weren\u2019t sold, they were given as gifts to tourist, thus spreading their name far and wide.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mother was a beauty birthed from this Peach Blossom Village and was known as the Peach Blossom Goddess. With numerous followers and suitors, she had a beautifully sounding name, Jiang TaoEr.</p><br/><p>Jiang TaoEr was attractive and lovely, growing up in the village, she never took a step outside. Since her father, the previous village mayor, protected her so well that even she was untainted.</p><br/><p>Sadly, since the incident, Jiang TaoEr was slowly forgotten.</p><br/><p>Once in a while, looking at the flowing petals in the sky, people would remember the Peach Blossom Goddess who danced beneath the peach trees.</p><br/><p>Although Jiang TaoEr was forgotten, the villagers couldn\u2019t forget about what happened that year, it left such an everlasting impression.</p><br/><p>For You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, it was easy to find out what happened twenty years ago.</p><br/><p>Twenty years ago, when Jiang TaoEr was seventeen, in her prime, and at the time able to marry, her father was reluctant give her away so easily.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hai was forty when his baby daughter was born and because his wife was too old when she gave birth, she became bedridden right after. It wasn\u2019t long before she died, leaving the daughter and father by themselves.</p><br/><p>Even though Jiang Hai had always pampered Jiang TaoEr, miraculously she didn\u2019t grow out of shape but prettier by the day with a doting personality too. In a year\u2019s time, from when she was sixteen to seventeen, those who wanted her hand at marriage didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>But, because Jiang Hai kept rejecting those suitors, some with ill intentions decided to deceive Jiang TaoEr into leaving the village. Being as na\u00efve as she was, and fond of the outside world, she was successfully fooled.</p><br/><p>What happened was easy to guess, they tried to rape her. However, their plan was fooled. Someone came and saved Jiang TaoEr and funnily enough, they fell in love at first sight. They kept it a secret from Jiang Hai and by the time they were exposed, she was already pregnant.</p><br/><p>Thinking family matters should be kept secret, and not wanting to ruin his daughter\u2019s name, he had to approve of their marriage, although unwillingly.</p><br/><p>Once they became married, they were very much in love and the man had talent too. He was the one who built up the tourist industry in Peach Blossom Village. Although it wasn\u2019t until much later did Jiang Hai approve of their love and treated him as his son.</p><br/><p>Sadly, all goods things must come to an end as the man disappeared when You XiaoMo became a month old. Nothing was heard of him since and no one had seen him either.</p><br/><p>Some say he was tired of the life in Peach Blossom Village, others said he was destined for greatness so he wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with such a tiny village and thus left his wife and son.</p><br/><p>They would also say he was but playing with Jiang TaoEr and he became bored, then he left. There was also some who said he died. Numerous rumors were there but the truth was that he never came back.</p><br/><p>Jiang TaoEr soon became depressed and at the tender age of twenty, two years after the incident, left. Still she was beautiful as a flower and unlike three years ago had a hint of mature appeal, leaving a lasting impression in the villagers.</p><br/><p>The old mayor soon died of grief, leaving the small You XiaoMo later being taken in by his grandfather\u2019s father and mother\u2019s uncle.</p><br/><p>A comedic story, but with a bitter end.</p><br/><p>All those who heard the story couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>Once upon a time, there was a goddess beneath the peach blossom trees\u2026</p><br/><p>The elderly who took You XiaoMo in was one who believed that his father had died so that wasa what he had told You XiaoMo. That was what many villagers believed too.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were listening, the version of the story they heard the most was \u2013 the man died!</p><br/><p>If one asked anymore, the elders would most definitely start swearing since Jiang TaoEr\u2019s death was directly connected to him. Jiang TaoEr left such a strong positive impression on the villagers.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like we have to find my Great Grandfather.\u201d You XiaoMo said defeatedly.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was still a beautiful story since before the man left without a word, he had done no harm to Jiang TaoEr.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought such a man, one who was so good to his wife and her family, was not one to abandon them. He must have had a reason and that reason should be what they were searching for.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him, \u201cThat\u2019s what you should have already done.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo touched his nose feeling slightly guilty. He didn\u2019t go because he had never seen his grandfather\u2019s father, he was afraid of identifying the wrong person and being exposed.</p><br/><p>As to not waste more time, they went directly to Jiang TaoEr\u2019s uncle\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>The uncle\u2019s house was easy enough to spot. After the old mayor passed away, he became the next mayor.</p><br/><p>The Peach Blossom Village had an old tradition of having every mayor living in the Peach Blossom Compound. Their family could go too, but once the mayor passed, they had to move out. The rule had never been broken.</p><br/><p>It was easy to spot, beside the compound were two one-hundred year old peach trees and only those two bloomed all year round. This year was not the blossoming season, so they were more apparent.</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo stood in front of the compound thinking of an approach, unbeknownst to him, Ling Xiao was looking at him, deep in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoMo?\u201d That was when, by his ear, a puzzled voice sounded.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned to look and that was when he noticed a forty or so middle-aged man looking at him quizzically with an expression of hesitation.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how to respond since he couldn\u2019t recognize this person.</p><br/><p>His mother\u2019s uncle was only older than Jiang Hai by a year but had many children. Comparatively Jiang Hai had only a few descendants and even the original You XiaoMo, who had died, was at two ends of the spectrum.</p><br/><p>The uncle\u2019s house, other than the two sons who left to go work, all stayed in the village. Even with that his close family had a dozen members. As if he could tell who this person was.</p><br/><p>So, You XiaoMo had to awkwardly ignore the name and answered, \u201cEh\u2026it\u2019s me, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good thing the middle-age man didn\u2019t fuss over it and once he confirmed it was You XiaoMo, showed a face of delight. Immediately he walked over and pulled You XiaoMo\u2019s arm towards the compound as he said, \u201cEver since you were taken in by the TianXin Sect, Great Grandpa has missed you. If he saw you coming back, he would be really happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Great Grandpa, the one who took in You XiaoMo was already eighty or so of age.</p><br/><p>At this age and still remembering You XiaoMo, he really was loved.</p><br/><p>By You XiaoMo\u2019s belief, if he took the place of the original then he was obligated to treat his relatives well, since he did give him a body. So, without a word of complaint, he let the man drag him into the compound. At least it was a good excuse.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao followed with little presence.</p><br/><p>Even before they were in, the middle-aged man\u2019s excited voice could be heard, \u201cDad, Grandpa, come out, look who is here to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first to come out running was a middle-aged woman with an imposing manner, as if she was ready to swear and yell given the chance. However, when she saw You XiaoMo at the rear, her reaction became the same as the middle-aged man and she ran back in excitement to report his coming.</p><br/><p>What a passionate family!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt the sweat forming on his back.</p><br/><p>Once they were inside, everyone had already rushed over to the living room. Pairs and pairs of bright eyes stared at You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Jiang TaoEr\u2019s uncle came from the back supporting an elderly man.</p><br/><p>Even though the elderly man looked like he was in his sixties, You XiaoMo knew this was his Great Grandfather.</p><br/><p>Once the elderly man laid eyes on You XiaoMo, the look of excitement was stronger than anyone. He walked over and with emaciated arms gently held his hands, as he spoke \u201cChild, Great Grandfather being able to see you again in this life, it\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since You XiaoMo was taken away, the TianXin Sect had told them that it was likely he would never see him again. For practitioners, time was the least valuable item. That was why when they saw You XiaoMo they were so excited.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, You XiaoMo felt slightly uncomfortable but the elder\u2019s words infected him, from his trembling hands a wave of emotion washed over. This was kinship, in his past life, even when his parents were alive, he rarely felt it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Grandpa, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>With these words, the elder\u2019s eyes were filled with hot tears.</p><br/><p>This was his second son\u2019s only grandchildren. The one he raised. Even though he was reluctant a few years back about sending him to the TianXin Sect, he knew You XiaoMo missed his father. How could he stop him from searching for his only father?</p><br/><p>\u201cSweet child, quickly, come inside.\u201d The elderly man guided him inside.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That was excluding PiQiu and CatQiu, who often played hooky; they hadn\u2019t been cultivating as much as they should.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked into the Magic Herb fields and, seeing that the Hidden Dipper Stink Bug seemed to be doing fine in their second stage of transformation, grabbed Piqiu and CatQiu who were playing around in the fields.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo brought them up to eye level, saying with a smile, \u201cYou two, let me, your owner, tell you something. If you continue slacking off from cultivating, then I\u2019ll throw you both in the beast cage for the next month. I\u2019m sure Xiao Hei and the others will be very pleased.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu hugged his finger with his two claws. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, master.\u201d</p><br/><p>CatQiu imitated whatever PiQiu did. \u201cMeow~\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was unmoved. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can elicit any sympathy from me like that. Tell me your decision now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two immediately hung their heads in surrender.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo put them down, satisfied. \u201cNow, go and cultivate next to the lake. Unless it\u2019s your turn to work, you won\u2019t be leaving the lakeside. If you behave, I can give you a day off.\u201d</p><br/><p>For these two who took every day off, a day off meant nothing.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo calmly said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like holidays, then we can get rid of that. I\u2019m a very generous owner, and will respect your choices.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu and CatQiu immediately hugged his legs tearfully.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo huffed.</p><br/><p>Walking to the lakeside, You XiaoMo gazed at the egg at the center of the lake. It hadn\u2019t reacted at all yet. Could it be that this egg was dead already?</p><br/><p>The more he thought, the more it seemed possible. You XiaoMo hurriedly turned to PiQiu and said, \u201cPiQiu, go and fish that egg up.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu turned. \u201cArf?\u201d Why?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cuffed him over the head. \u201cTalk like a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m going down now.\u201d</p><br/><p>CatQiu looked at PiQiu in shock. That wasn\u2019t what you said.</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he assumed a human form, butt-naked and bits hanging. Just as he prepared to dive into the lake, something strange suddenly happened to the spiritual water and the surface of the lake began to swirl like a whirlpool.</p><br/><p>This movement brought SheQiu and the others out of their cultivation. They opened their eyes, looking at the whirling water with shock.</p><br/><p>SheQiu asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sharp eyed Xiao Hei replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s that egg in the center of the lake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hei only spoke like a normal person to SheQiu, who was stronger than him.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu said, \u201cNot I think, it just is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing their words, You XiaoMo gazed into the lake with curiosity. And then he immediately regretted not getting someone to fish the egg out. After the whirlpool swirled for a full five minutes, the water level visibly fell. Where it was originally only twenty or thirty centimeters from the bank, the water level had suddenly fallen by almost half a meter.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>PiQiu and CatQiu also widened their eyes.</p><br/><p>Only SheQiu and the other two were unmoved, as if even if the sky fell it wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with them. Although if the sky did fall in this dimension, it really wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, quick, fish it out!\u201d You XiaoMo finally recovered and hastily ordered. If it continued, the spiritual water would all be gone. Then he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself from killing that egg.</p><br/><p>By the time he had finished yelling, the water level had fallen by another half a meter. The only good thing was that the egg had finally stopped absorbing the water. However, with such a large lake of spiritual water suddenly reduced to half, You XiaoMo\u2019s heart ached. The spiritual water replenished itself very slowly. The amount it grew by each day wasn\u2019t even enough for him to use.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo threw PiQiu into the lake, snarling, \u201cFish it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu shuddered. This was the first time he had seen his master so mad and he was afraid to say anything more, instantly grabbing the egg.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held the egg, wondering if he should fry it or boil it.</p><br/><p>However, after sucking up half a lake of spiritual water, the demon beast egg was no longer grey and dull. Instead, it had changed to a shimmering fire red. It seemed like it had a life, jumping like a heartbeat with a \u201cthud thud thud\u201d.</p><br/><p>SheQiu suddenly spoke up, sounding like he had been enlightened. \u201cSo it\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu began to explain, \u201cThat egg had been in the palace for too long without spiritual energy, causing its lifeforce to steady weaken. That\u2019s why it had been unresponsive until now. After half a year of soaking in the lake, it had plenty of spiritual water to help it, so it recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s expression was pinched, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for it to absorb half of the lake though, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, I\u2019m not sure about. It\u2019s possible that a full recovery would require a lot of spiritual energy. You haven\u2019t properly checked in a while, but the water in the lake had been decreasing by a thousand drops each day.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy probably had been harboring these suspicions for a long time, but never told him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised the egg in his hand. \u201cSay, would it be worth it to cook it for dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu said, \u201c\u2026 Before it took half of the spiritual water, you wouldn\u2019t lose much if you ate it, but now its definitely not worth it. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a normal high grade demon beast, and won\u2019t your heart ache if you ate half a lake\u2019s worth of spiritual water in one go like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied with sadness, \u201cIt would, but thinking of how to sucked up so much spiritual water, I just really, really want to have it for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished speaking, the egg started moving from where it was lying quietly on his palm, jumping onto the ground and away.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared, but then saw the direction in which it was heading in and startled. He hurriedly yelled, \u201cAaaahhh, stop it! Don\u2019t let it jump into the lake!\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu lunged, but was dodged.</p><br/><p>CatQiu tried to block its way, but it just bounced off CatQiu\u2019s head, causing the beast to run back over tearfully.</p><br/><p>At the crucial moment, Xiao Hei\u2019s foot came down and held the egg in place.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lunged over and gave Xiao Hei a thankful look, only to get a roll of the eyes in response. He picked up the struggling egg and threatened it, \u201cIf you keep struggling, I\u2019ll barbeque you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The egg fell silent.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grinned, but didn\u2019t even have the time to say a second sentence when it started struggling again, as if it was unfazed by the threat.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu spoke up: \u201cIt might not be afraid of fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked in surprise, \u201cThen what is it afraid of?\u201d</p><br/><p>MaoQiu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but the higher the level of the demon beast, the less its afraid of.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knocked on the egg\u2019s shell. \u201cDo you think it\u2019ll be afraid of Ling Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>MaoQiu: \u201c\u2026 Definitely!\u201d</p><br/><p>In this world, the number of demon beasts that weren\u2019t afraid of the boss could be counted on one hand.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo realized that as the word left MaoQiu\u2019s lips, the egg finally stopped struggling, lying in his arms like it was playing dead. Even when he put it on the ground, it still didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was elated. \u201cWow, it really stopped moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>MaoQiu didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Though the egg\u2019s lifeforce had been rather weak in the past half a year, it could still feel how powerful Ling Xiao was and had a vague understanding of the situation outside. It wasn\u2019t afraid of normal attacks, but if it was that guy, he could probably crush it between two fingers and might even squeeze out some \u201cyolk.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo picked it up again. \u201cYou guys keep cultivating. I\u2019m going to show it to Ling Xiao.\u201d</p><br/><p>The egg wanted to struggle, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>Before he left, he went to take one last look at the Hidden Dipper Stink Bugs. The second transformation would take a while. Then, You XiaoMo left with a single thought and fell directly onto the bed, and the resting Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hummed lightly, embracing him and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re rather eager!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scrambled up. \u201cWait a second, I want to show you something, huh? Where\u2019s that egg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took a red egg out from the covers. \u201cYou mean, this egg?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded joyfully, but thinking of what the egg had done to his lake, his face fell again. Ling Xiao asked him what was wrong and he explained everything.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled, saying, \u201cThis egg really isn\u2019t a normal egg. You\u2019ll see when it hatches. If you think it\u2019s wronged you then just make it work for you after it comes out to repay you through labor.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the cowering egg and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grabbed his waist, running his hands across You XiaoMo\u2019s body and grinned, saying, \u201cNow, let\u2019s fulfill that promise from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, You XiaoMo\u2019s expression froze. He had only just realized he had been sitting right on that gradually awakening part of Ling Xiao.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He only manages to catch a glimpse of Ling Xiao before losing consciousness.</p><br/><p>Soul force overuse? One look and Ling Xiao can see that there is a problem with You XiaoMo\u2019s condition. He frowns. He is not that well versed with mages and their practices. But he knows that usually a mage is able to tell how much soul force he has left when refining magic pills. So, most mages, when they feel their soul force running low, they would stop refining magic pills and take the appropriate amount of rest before starting again. If not, they could incur some sort of aftereffect. Such as exhausting their soul force and being unable to recover for some time. Or being extremely fatigued, unable to move for a few days, and things like that.</p><br/><p>And here, You XiaoMo actually overuses his soul force while refining magic pills. Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t get it. Yet he still lifts him up. Unexpectedly, this young boy is lighter than he imagined. After placing him on the bed, Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes fall on the magic pill firmly grasped in his hand. Is this that magic pill?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pries open his fingers one by one and takes the magic pill. It\u2019s only a level one magic pill. Looks pretty common. The spiritual energy it contains still cannot compare to the place where he used to live.</p><br/><p>But \u2014\u2014- this level one magic pill is quite different from the one he ate yesterday. It\u2019s as if the energy contained inside is even more pure, even more concentrated. Most importantly the impurities is much less compared to the ones from yesterday. This point amazes him. Looks like this convenient Little brother can really give him such a pleasant surprise <i>ne</i>!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrows his eyes, conveniently tossing the magic pill into his mouth. After a few chews, he then swallows it straight into his stomach. Just like that, the magic pill that You XiaoMo risked his life for, overusing his soul force, is simply eaten and gone!</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, Ling Xiao feels that this is the best magic pill he has ever eaten. Although the amount of energy contained in the magic pill is not much, but it is especially pure. Spreading out from his throat through his four limbs, it has been a long time since he experienced this weightless feeling throughout his whole body.</p><br/><p>After finishing the magic pill, Ling Xiao walks towards the wooden table. Three bottles and bits of magic herbs are scattered on the simple and crude wooden table. Each bottle holds several magic pills. In a sweeping glance he sees that they hold from ten to fifty magic pills. After tasting each one, he can\u2019t help but raise his brows. They all taste different. Furthermore, none of them are as good as the one he just ate.</p><br/><p>A vague expression flashes across his face. He then switches his attention to You XiaoMo who is still passed out on the bed.</p><br/><p>A thin and weak body. A slender neck. He only needs to exert a little force to make him disappear from this world. But this young boy, so weak that he is almost not worth mentioning, can actually refine magic pills that perfectly suits his taste. This phenomenon has not happened before, not even with many high level mages. One can\u2019t deny that his interest in him is getting stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering your contribution in the matter of refining magic pills, I\u2019ll give you a helping hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao bends over. From the back, it looks as if his whole body is pressed onto You XiaoMo. He grips his lower jaw with one hand and gives him a breath of air. That breath of air seems to have a magical effect. You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes that were originally tightly shut suddenly start to move. After ten breaths the eyes slowly open. What fills his field of vision is a magnified face. Although it is a very handsome face, he jumps up in fright.</p><br/><p>A shudder run through his whole body. He tries hard to bury his head under his pillow, \u201cYou you you \u2026\u2026. what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing him in such a frightened state, Ling Xiao\u2019s lips curve up suddenly, \u201cYou fainted, so I gave you a breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGave me a breath?\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly raises his voice, his eyes bulging in disbelief. He then covers his own lips, like someone who had just been taken advantage of, looking at the gleeful Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of reaction is this?\u201d asks Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lowers his eyes and says resentfully: \u201cNo \u2026 nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liar, Ling Xiao can obviously read the \u2018You\u2019re bullying me\u2019 accusation on his face, \u201cLittle brother, good children don\u2019t tell lies.\u201d</p><br/><p>I am not a child!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts and asks after some hesitation, \u201cElder brother Lin, you \u2026 how did you give me, uh, give me a breath?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, before Ling Xiao could explain, he already starts to blush. He really doesn\u2019t want have crooked thoughts, but those words really makes one think that way.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stares at his face, causing You XiaoMo to get redder and redder, almost to the point of hyperemia. Only then do his lips start to curve upwards slightly, saying softly, \u201cOf course it\u2019s mouth to mouth <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if being struck by lightning under a clear sky, You XiaoMo is dumbstruck. Inside his head, those three words \u2018mouth to mouth\u2019 reverberate. <b>*wu wu*</b> His first kiss is gone just like that. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s with a man!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gets more and more intrigued by his expression. This is the first time he has seen someone with so much expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Even though he finds it very amusing, Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t forget to get to the important matter, resuming, \u201cLittle brother, did your brothers not tell you about the dangers of overusing your soul force?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d You XiaoMo looks up both resentful and flustered, just lacking two streams of tears down his face.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao straightens his body and sits down by his side, explaining, \u201cThe reason why you fainted just now is because you overused your soul force. Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t realize that <i>oh</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, You XiaoMo jumps up and cries in alarm, \u201cThat\u2019s right, my magic pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, he jumps from the bed and rushes over to find the magic pill. Ling Xiao didn\u2019t touch the few bottles of magic pills on the table. Although he did take one each but You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t notice because the one he is looking for is not one of those. He\u2019s searching for the very last magic pill that he refined. But no matter how hard he tries, he doesn\u2019t find it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thinks back. He remembers that before he fell back, that magic pill seemed \u2026 seemed to be firmly grasped in his hand? As if from a <b>psychic connection</b>, You XiaoMo turns around and immediately crashes into those smiling eyes of Ling Xiao, tinged with mischief and hidden meaning.</p><br/><p>This type of expression is the one that You XiaoMo loathes the most. Because during that night in He Ping town, that was the exact expression Ling Xiao had when he finished off several bottles of magic pills.</p><br/><p>Seeing him look at him, especially that look of suspicion, Ling Xiao laughs and says wickedly: \u201cIf you are looking for that magic pill, I\u2019m sorry to say, I ate it.\u201d Saying this, he licks his lower lip, as if savoring the aftertaste!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo warns himself, I must endure!</p><br/><p>Notes:magical rhinoceros horn \u2013 psychic connection________________________________________<wbr>__________</wbr></p><br/>\n</div>"}

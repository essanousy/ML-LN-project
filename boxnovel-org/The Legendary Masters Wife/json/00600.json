Ling Xiao simply smiled without a word, clearly wanting no part of this.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could only decided for himself. To be completely honest, he hadn\u2019t thought of contracting a Weasel Beast, it just reminded him weasels. As the saying goes, a weasel giving his respect to the chicken has ulterior motives.</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t comparing himself to a chicken, he was just questioning its motives. Otherwise, why would it suddenly come and ask to be his contract demon beast.</p><br/><p>As everyone knows, once a demon beast enters a contract, it will lose its freedom. Thus, if it wasn\u2019t for a special reason, normally a demon beast wouldn\u2019t be willing to enter a contract.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to be my contract demon beast? What\u2019s your reason?\u201d After he gave it some thought, You XiaoMo thought it was better to lay everything out into the open. His situation was different from before, every contract he formed must be with caution. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the Weasel Beast was from this remote to the point of no outer world contact place, he would have immediately rejected it.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast had already thought of an excuse. Looking earnest, he said, \u201cEver since last time, where I thoughtlessly offended you, I had been reflecting over my past actions. As learned from this painful experience, I was drawn in by your magnificent image and decided to become your follower. I hope you could grant me this insignificant wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt his mouth twitch the whole way through. No wonder he was the boss, that sure was an exaggerated, heartfelt speech. Clearly it wasn\u2019t his first time.</p><br/><p>If he took him in, he felt that he would\u2019ve taken in another idiot and he already had enough in his ball team. if he didn\u2019t take him in, he felt like this beast wouldn\u2019t give up either.</p><br/><p>Ah, what to do!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Weasel Beast kneel in front of him and yelled, \u201cMaster, please take me in, I beg you, I\u2019ll kowtow!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo jumped in surprise, and once again looked towards Ling Xiao for help. Ling Xiao laughed till his shoulders started shaking.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew then he couldn\u2019t count on him, clearly this bastard was just having fun at his expense. Thus he replied unhappily, \u201cGot it, got it, I\u2019ll take you in, stop with the kowtow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you master!\u201d The Weasel Beast said unable to control his glee. He quickly got up and stood to the side, well-behaved, as his stared at You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>With reluctance, You XiaoMo made a contract with him.</p><br/><p>Currently, the Weasel Beast was only a level ten demon beast, so he could only command Rat Beasts of level ten or below. Unless his cultivation increased, even if he had this commanding skill, those above him in level would be able to resist it.</p><br/><p>After he knew about this, You XiaoMo made an interesting expression.</p><br/><p>This thing was actually more troublesome than any other member of the ball team. First of all, his level was the lowest, by now, even CatQiu and PiQiu were five and six star level tens respectively. Also, for his commanding skill to work, he needed to push him to cultivate and feed him magic pills to help increase his level.</p><br/><p>No matter how he thought about it, he was on the losing side.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give you your first assignment. Go and find out where we are and what\u2019s the fastest way to return to land.\u201d You XiaoMo said as he took a deep breath in. It didn\u2019t pay to not use it when he could.</p><br/><p>With an excited expression the Weasel Beast said with vigour, \u201cYes sir, I promise to fulfill my mission!\u201d It was his first assignment, he must complete it flawlessly to leave a good impression on his master.</p><br/><p>Finally someone who was hardworking, unlike the others who needed threatening or persuasion. You XiaoMo felt a little calmer. \u201cThen hurry along. If I\u2019m happy with the result, I\u2019ll give you a reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast knew that his master was a mage and a high leveled one at that. Hearing that there was a possible reward, he could already guess what it was, making him even more energized.</p><br/><p>Once the Weasel Beast left, You XiaoMo turned to stare at Ling Xiao bitterly, \u201cYou already knew, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Ling Xiao laughed out loud, \u201cIt turned out well, didn\u2019t it? His ability is pretty nice and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true that the Weasel Beast was lacking in the fighting department but an ability like sound waves was indeed a surprise, but it needed more testing. After all, even amongst rodents, there was difference in bloodline. If he could even command the royalties, then that was truly a unique skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d You XiaoMo said furious.</p><br/><p>With complete seriousness, Ling Xiao said, \u201cAnd an idiot just like you, if you don\u2019t take him in then who?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He should have known that nothing good would come out of that mouth of his. He was too naive.</p><br/><p>After he put his cauldron away, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao talked for another half an hour in the room before finally deciding to leave soon. Also, he decided to take the White Tiger\u2019s Life Blood in three days time. With his current cultivation level, he was just away from being four stars, one drop of Life Blood should be enough.</p><br/><p>The situation was a bit rushed since after every level was an adjustment period. Also, he had been advancing way too fast, even from one star to two star it was the case. Thus, even more so, now, he needed this adjustment period.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, are you going to use the other four drops to advance too? Do you want a Heart Meridian Pill?\u201d You XiaoMo asked. If he needed it, he could refine a few more pills. Even though he knew of Ling Xiao\u2019s strength, if they could reduce the risks, spending a bit more time refining pills was worth it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had planned on rejecting, but a thought occurred to him as You XiaoMo was talking, \u201cThen give me a pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, You XiaoMo pulled out a jade bottle and gave him a freshly refined pill. \u201cTake this for now, if you need more, come and ask. That batch of transcendent level magic herbs are reaching maturity, when that happens, I\u2019ll refine a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, You XiaoMo hunted down two Red-Crowned Turkeys in the forest. Without the interference of the Weasel Beast, it didn\u2019t take him very long this time.</p><br/><p>But just as his Beggar\u2019s Chicken was about to be ready, the Weasel Beast returned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, master.\u201d The Weasel Beast said as he rushed in front of You XiaoMo. After that, he continued out of breath, \u201cI have sent out an order like you asked, it shouldn\u2019t take more than five days to get a response.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo widened his eyes, and stared quizzically at the overly excited Weasel Beast, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s in five days?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast nodded with certainty, \u201cFive days and that\u2019s because this is pretty remote with little nearby islands. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t take more than three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting for your good news.\u201d You XiaoMo was very satisfied with his speed, at first he thought it was going to take at least half a month. This speed was really unexpected, so he asked, \u201cRight, I made two Beggar\u2019s Chicken, do you want-\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast cut him off excitedly and was even panting afterwards. The only reason he rushed back was for the master\u2019s Beggar\u2019s Chicken. One of his underlings had told him that the master was making really good turkey.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at him confusedly, what\u2019s with this huge reaction?</p><br/><p>Behind him, Ling Xiao was laughing so hard he felt as if though his stomach was going to pop.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned around only to see Ling Xiao\u2019s yet to be retracted smile. It was so exaggerated that he was even more confused. With a scrunched up expression, he asked, \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied calmly, \u201cI\u2019m training my facial muscles.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The residents of this world were getting harder and harder to understand. Training facial muscles?</p><br/><p>Did he think he was a three year old? That easy to prank? But, if Ling Xiao didn\u2019t say, he wouldn\u2019t be able to guess what he was laughing about.</p><br/><p>With a stomach full of questions, the two Beggar\u2019s Chicken were finally done.</p><br/><p>Using a dagger, You XiaoMo dug up the Beggar\u2019s Chicken from the ground. The fragrance was long-awaited. He didn\u2019t even need to call on anyone before they all sat down by the table. The most exaggerated one was the Weasel Beast, the moment he smelled the fragrance, his saliva started flooding. Even the corner of his mouth had a suspicious water mark.</p><br/><p>Taking away the outer layer, You XiaoMo split up the turkey. Other than the Metal Swallowing Beast and the Golden Winged Insects getting a smaller portion, the Weasel Beast was given a fourth, and Ling Xiao a half. Perfectly dividing a turkey.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to eat one yourself?\u201d Ling Xiao stared at his plate then at You XiaoMo\u2019s.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said giddily, \u201cOf course, this Beggar\u2019s Chicken is considered my reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was displeased, \u201cGive me half.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d You XiaoMo rejected it without a second thought.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao thought about it and said, \u201cHalf is not filling for me and I eat more than you. How about you give me a quarter of yours, so we split this evenly.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cI can give you a quarter, but on one condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stared at him thoughtfully, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled, \u201cIf you tell me what you were laughing about earlier, I\u2019ll give you a portion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost muttering to himself, Ling Xiao said, \u201cKnowing too much is not always good.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo made a threatening sound, \u201cEven if it\u2019s not good for me, I want to know. After you tell me, then it\u2019s my problem, not yours. If you don\u2019t, then this Beggar\u2019s Chicken is all mine. No matter how you beg me, I won\u2019t share it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I want half.\u201d Ling Xiao said, beating the iron when it\u2019s hot.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d You XiaoMo agreed without hesitation. He couldn\u2019t finish it by himself and anyways, after eating it for so long, he wasn\u2019t nearly as greedy for it.</p><br/><p>With a meaningful smile, Ling Xiao asked, \u201cDo you know why the Weasel Beast wanted to be your demon beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>The called upon Weasel Beast silently lowered its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You XiaoMo quickly asked, he was truly curious. He didn\u2019t think his it was due to his charm, or maybe partially due to his charm?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026he\u2019s interested in your Beggar\u2019s Chicken.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, this was the legendary, <em><strong>digging your own grave</strong></em>? He planned out so much just for this? Was he an M?</p><br/><p>With grace, Ling Xiao took half of the Beggar\u2019s Chicken from his plate.</p><h5>(Jouissance Note: Digging your own grave was originally translated as no zuo, no die, why you try, no try, no high give me five, which basically means if you don\u2019t do it, you won\u2019t have to face the consequences.)</h5><br/>\n</div>"}

Brother, you\u2019re befriending You XiaoMo.\u201d Teng ZiXin looked at Teng ZiYe coldly, waiting for a pause before telling him what she had witnessed.</p><br/><p>She had always thought that Teng ZiYe would cut ties with You XiaoMo after knowing about the bad blood between her and You XiaoMo. Yet it hadn\u2019t been long and they were already such good friends. She was honestly very disappointed; after all, it was her who was Teng ZiYe\u2019s sister.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiYe looked at her silently.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin wasn\u2019t particularly surprised though, continuing, \u201cBrother, you know I won\u2019t forgive him. Why are you getting close to him? Do you want to help him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiYe narrowed his eyes, curling his lips as he said, \u201cIn your heart, getting close to him equals to helping him? I\u2019ve simply just met him a few times, we aren\u2019t close.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin paused in surprise for a moment, joy flashing through her eyes. She hurriedly stifled her excitement and said, \u201cBrother, are you\u2026 Are you getting close to him for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiYe didn\u2019t confirm or deny it, only speaking quietly as he brushed past her, \u201cI don\u2019t care why you hold such a grudge against him, but remember, your words and actions all represent the Teng Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin watched him as he left, both red and green faced. With her intelligence, there was no way she\u2019d misunderstand what Teng ZiYe was hinting at. He was accusing her of her actions being an embarrassment to the Teng Family.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t all bad; she had managed to confirm that Teng ZiYe had nothing to do with You XiaoMo, because Teng XiYe didn\u2019t lie. If he said they had simply met a few times, then that must be so.</p><br/><p>By the time You XiaoMo departed from the cultivation center, three days had passed.</p><br/><p>He had wanted to go to the red card zone to check if Ling Xiao was still inside or not, but since he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get in, he gave up on that idea.</p><br/><p>Leaving the Cultivation Center, he headed directly to his room. As he approached, he realized that there was someone in the room. Apart from Ling Xiao, most people couldn\u2019t enter without the owner\u2019s permission.</p><br/><p>That person just walked out of the room when You XiaoMo threw himself at them without thinking.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was afraid he would fall and hurt himself, so he grabbed You XiaoMo around the waist.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo clung onto him, excitedly saying, \u201cYou finally came out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled, replying, \u201cBecause I can\u2019t bear the thought of leaving you alone at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched. He didn\u2019t think that this phrase was suited to describe him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao brushed his hands against You XiaoMo\u2019s body, suddenly saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve achieved a breakthrough. Seems like Gravity Mountain is doing rather good for your training. Your body seems more flexible, too. We might be able to try a few positions with a higher difficulty in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me like that.\u201d You XiaoMo was flushed by Ling Xiao\u2019s movements, especially when Ling Xiao stroked his sensitive waist. However, when he heard the last part, he immediately glared at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao picked him up and into the room, asking with a laugh, \u201cHas anything happened recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng Zi\u2019s situation immediately came to mind. You XiaoMo didn\u2019t hesitate, explaining everything to Ling Xiao. \u201cI think, Teng ZiYe must know about the situation between me and his sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cYour whole situation has blown up. It\u2019s impossible that he hasn\u2019t heard of it. However, he\u2019s different from Teng ZiXin. He\u2019s smart and calm, knowing how to not expose himself. If he were really to fight you, you wouldn\u2019t have a chance. Make sure to stay away from him in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded. \u201cBut I still owe him a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cDo no more than what you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked, \u201cBut what if he asks for something that troubles me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao thought for a moment. \u201cIf he does do that, then act as if nothing happened between you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him wide-eyed. How could he say that? But, it did seem like something Ling Xiao would say. If it came to it, he might actually act as Ling Xiao had told him to.</p><br/><p>Next he brought up the Mage\u2019s Hundred Man Rankings.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t be long until the Trial in the mountains begun and many people had already found a mage to work with. Some had even finished their contracts, pairing up and provoking many of the still \u201csingle\u201d people.</p><br/><p>Recently, pairs were common over in the arena. Mostly because they wanted to improve their teamwork.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked, \u201cHow is the Hundred Man rankings for mages ranked?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cI think you have to purify a magic herb in a set amount of time and they test it for purity at the end. I hear that the instrument used to test it is much more precise than the previous ones. The full score is a hundred.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cThen you should find time to take the test.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Mage\u2019s Hundred Man Rankings was similar to that of practitioners. The first fifty had to be challenged, and the latter fifty only needed to take the test for purifying herbs. However, they had to go to the specially set testing area for this. If their score was higher than the hundredth person, then they would be able to ascend the rankings.</p><br/><p>The following day, Ling Xiao went to the testing area with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Usually, there weren\u2019t many people there, but recently more and more people were coming to take the test.</p><br/><p>By the time the two arrived, there were quite a lot of people at the testing area already, talking among themselves, mostly about the Trials and the Hundred Man Rankings.</p><br/><p>Not long later, an elder walked out from behind.</p><br/><p>With his appearance, everyone quietened down, staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for me to explain the rules here. We\u2019ll start testing now. Every round ten people will go up and test. You can pick a stone dais to stand at yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The speaking elder was very straightforward, not bothering to say anything extra.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a look at the crowd around him. There were over fifty people here. If he waited at the back, it would probably take a long time before he got to the front, so he informed Ling Xiao he was going up to the front before heading off towards the nearest dais.</p><br/><p>There was a cauldron ready for him at the dais and a level seven magic herb.</p><br/><p>He had seen this herb in the old man\u2019s Magic Herb Handbook. It was a Diamond Herb. It had a very peculiar form; it was golden and both the stem and leaves were very hard, increasing the difficulty of purification.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had heard that the school would pick a new herb out of a group of herbs with a similar difficulty in purification as the Diamond Herb to test students with. This year it was the Diamond Herb, the one known as the hardest to purify and the easiest to fail at among all level seven herbs.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally understood why no one had ever gotten a full score.</p><br/><p>It really was very hard. He wasn\u2019t even certain if he could get above a ninty.</p><br/><p>When the hourglass began to run, everyone started to move. The lowest score on the Hundred Man Rankings was fifty-three, so they only needed to be better than that to enter the Hundred Man Rankings. Even if they weren\u2019t among the first fifty, it was ok.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, You XiaoMo immediately cleared his mind of irrelevant thoughts and threw the herb into the cauldron.</p><br/><p>The purification of herbs tested a mage\u2019s control over his Soul Force. This, You XiaoMo was certain, he wouldn\u2019t lose to anyone in. After staying in the Gravity Mountain for a month, he was even more confident about it.</p><br/><p>Plus, after experimenting recently, he had learned a faster way of purifying herbs.</p><br/><p>However, this method could, for now, only deal with one herb at a time.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, You XiaoMo immediately separated his Soul Force into two and then wrapped them around the Diamond Herb in the cauldron one after the other. One stick of incense burned, and then another\u2026 By the time half an hour had passed, everyone began to come to a stop one after the other.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo put the powdered herb into a vial, wiping the sweat from his forehead. The amount of times he had purified this herb was both expected and unexpected, because he had managed to purify it nine times. There was still time remaining. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he couldn\u2019t manage to clear out any further impurities, he would want to try for another time.</p><br/><p>As the first group finished, the second group quickly followed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and the others walked to the side to test their herbs. The person that was helping him do that was a middle-aged man. The man had him place the herb into the measurer.</p><br/><p>After pressing the button, the instrument began to whine quietly. When the number on it broke past seventy and continued to rise, a group of spectators all looked his way, eyes full of surprise.</p><br/><p>Seventy was good enough to get into the top seventy of the Hundred Man Rankings, but this number was still rising. This made everyone very shocked, especially since You XiaoMo didn\u2019t seem very old.</p><br/><p>The number was still rising, until it broke past ninety. It jumped a few times before stopping at ninety-seven. The middle-aged man stared at the instrument in shock. It had been years since he had seen a number over ninety, even approaching a hundred.</p><br/><p>The crowd around him was cacophonous; the academy hadn\u2019t had a score that was so close to a hundred in a long time.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, the middle-aged man spoke up, saying, \u201cNinety-seven points. You\u2019re ranked number fifty-one.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded. Now, he no longer had to worry about the Hundred Man Rankings. As expected, splitting his soul force into two had a great effect. Though he hadn\u2019t managed to reach a hundred, he was already very satisfied with his score.</p><br/><p>After him, none of the others managed a test as spectacular as his.</p><br/><p>Though he felt a little like he had reached the sky in one step, You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t very surprised.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the curious and startled stares of the crowd, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao left the testing area, directly heading for the registration area for the Trials. A practitioner had to confirm their temporary contract with a mage before they could apply.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people there to register, but they bumped into a pair who were arguing over something.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was surprised to notice that he recognized the girl. It was An XinRui, who he had met twice before. He didn\u2019t recognize the other, but if they were here, they were probably here to apply. He would\u2019ve thought she would have struggled for a bit longer.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked in the direction of his gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo answered, \u201cAn XinRui doesn\u2019t seem very willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say before that she liked someone else? She obviously wouldn\u2019t be willing to contract with someone she doesn\u2019t like. It\u2019s probably an attempt to grab their attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded.</p><br/><p>Just as Ling Xiao\u2019s words fell, An XinRui and that mage walked towards them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

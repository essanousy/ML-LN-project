When everyone finally saw who stopped Ling Xiao, they couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised. It was actually QiHang from the Mage Guild!</p><br/><p>QiHang was a level eleven Mage and his rank wasn\u2019t low in the Mage Guild. His attack power wasn\u2019t as weak as the ordinary Mage and with his power, he could totally be on par with a Divine level powerhouse. Furthermore, he also had a lifebound contract demon beast. While it wasn\u2019t an emperor beast, once master and beast joined hands, an average person would have to stand aside to avoid them.</p><br/><p>No one expected it to be him.</p><br/><p>Previously when You Ming ordered him to take action, QiHang would be reluctant and find ways to decline. Yet, now when You Ming was dead and even You AnTai wasn\u2019t Ling Xiao\u2019s match, he actually stood up.</p><br/><p>This move utterly puzzled many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore like he\u2019s profiting from somebody\u2019s misfortune.\u201d With one look at him, Qiao WuShuang saw through his plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old fella\u2019s really cheap.\u201d Xiong Xiao somewhat looked down on QiHang. In his eyes, a real man should be frank and forthright in whatever he did, whereas QiHang was just a villain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe damage caused by the explosion in the area was unusually large. Even You AnRan was so spooked he fled. I reckon Ling Xiao\u2019s injuries aren\u2019t light. Looking at the situation, he most likely won\u2019t be QiHang\u2019s match. Should we help him?\u201d Qiao WuShuang said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait. I feel there\u2019s something strange about the situation. It doesn\u2019t seem that simple.\u201d HuangFu Li looked towards the two people in the sky as he stroked his beard.</p><br/><p>QiHang was very proud of himself. Yes, he was preparing to take advantage of someone\u2019s misfortunes.</p><br/><p>If Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t injured, naturally he wouldn\u2019t have such thoughts. But if he was, then it would be a waste if he didn\u2019t attack.</p><br/><p>Two Elemental Essences and one Metal Swallowing Beast were worth taking the risk.Ling Xiao\u2019s brows furrowed. This person must have thought he was in a hurry to leave because he was injured. In truth, he was only trying to find a place to let You XiaoMo out because he realised that something was happening in his dimension.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you must be heavily injured. If you give me the Elemental Essences and the Metal Swallowing beast, I can guarantee that you\u2019ll leave here safe and unharmed.\u201d Seeing as he remained silent and not looking too good, QiHang thought he had guessed right.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld fella, get lost if you are done yapping. I have no time to play with you!\u201d Ling Xiao said impatiently.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his words, a trace of anger flashed across Qi Hang\u2019s face. Just as he was about to yell at him angrily, the man before him raised his hand and pushed his palm out. It was simply a gust of wind, but how could a fist from a peak seven star powerhouse be ordinary.</p><br/><p>QiHang\u2019s expression finally changed. How could a man with this sort of power be fatally injured!</p><br/><p>Due to the shock, QiHang barely managed to dodge that attack. When he retreated about a dozen steps, steadied himself and looked towards Ling Xiao\u2019s direction, he saw a figure appear in the air right above him. That person screamed as he fell straight down and Ling Xiao extended his hands to catch him.</p><br/><p>That person seemed to be frightened. His nerves had yet to settle as he clutched onto the man\u2019s clothes tightly. That person was none other than You XiaoMo. His hair was as messy as a straw nest and patches of black and blue appeared on his clean face as if someone had scratched him.</p><br/><p>Seeing how pathetic he looked, Ling Xiao\u2019s serious expression morphed into one where he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only didn\u2019t pay attention to you for a moment and you end up like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I want to? That Metal\u2026 Uh, for some reason it suddenly appeared and attacked us. If not for the Metal Swallowing\u2026 uh, that fellow, you wouldn\u2019t see me anymore!\u201d You XiaoMo aired his grievances.</p><br/><p>No wonder Ling Xiao didn\u2019t let him put the Metal Elemental Essence into his dimension. That thing was really that powerful. Although he could fight, that thing wasn\u2019t human but made from Elemental Essence. Normal attacks would be useless against it.</p><br/><p>PiQiu wasn\u2019t very strong either. The Metal Elemental Essence\u2019s intellect was similar to the Wood Elemental Essence and it tended to be mature. It was a crafty fellow and if not for the Metal Swallowing Beast stopping it in time, he would definitely be worse off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? So what\u2019s the situation now?\u201d After You XiaoMo was done grumbling, he finally realised the odd situation around him. When he looked down, he found a large group of people looking towards him with pairs of stunned eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>Still in his puzzled state, he finally realised that he was being carried by Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo forced a smile before he said to Ling Xiao, \u201cLooks like your battle isn\u2019t over yet. How about you let me down first and go settle it later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Ling Xiao spared him a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! Isn\u2019t there still the old guy? Is he not a person?\u201d You XiaoMo immediately pointed to QiHang who was opposite them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you wish to say it like that, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Ling Xiao replied plainly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had nothing to say. After a moment, he tried to change the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat said, who is that old guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>QiHang was silent throughout.</p><br/><p>Hearing his question, Ling Xiao stared at QiHang meaningfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHim? Someone\u2019s who is about to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>QiHang\u2019s expression changed. Till now, how could he not tell that Ling Xiao didn\u2019t even see him as a threat at all. All of it was just his wishful thinking. He didn\u2019t dare to stay any longer as he immediately fled with the people from the Mage Guild.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, too, didn\u2019t really intend to kill him. Before he successfully had a breakthrough from Divine level to Sacred level, it would not be beneficial for him to become sworn enemies with the Mage Guild.</p><br/><p>After people from the Mage Guild left, NanZhan also led his men away from the June Mountains. Xiong Xiao and Qiao WuShuang exchanged looks with each other and thought for a while before walking towards Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo together with HuangFu Li.</p><br/><p>When they discovered their arrival, Ling Xiao\u2019s face remained unchanged whereas You XiaoMo went on alert instantly. He knew nothing about what happened previously but he knew they were after the two Elemental essences and the Metal Swallowing Beast.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang stepped forward and smiled, \u201cFellow XiaoHa, do you have to be so guarded against us? If we wanted to take action, we wouldn\u2019t wait till now.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was embarrassed for a moment. Oh how he wanted to tell him to stop calling him fellow XiaoHa.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow XiaoHa, you don\u2019t have to worry. I won\u2019t make enemies of people from the QiLin clan. My original goal was the Metal Swallowing Beast. The Elemental Essence is just something along the way.\u201d Xiong Xiao also walked over with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what you said, it seems like you still want the Metal Swallowing Beast.\u201d You XiaoMo replied.</p><br/><p>To that, Xiong Xiao just shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason why I want the Metal Swallowing Beast is different from the others. It\u2019s like this, soon it will be one of my juniors\u2019 birthday. I want to give him a Metal Swallowing Beast as a gift to make him happy. Since the two of you have taken it, then there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. It\u2019s not like it must be the Metal Swallowing Beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was utterly speechless. Using a Metal Swallowing Beast to make your shidi happy? What kind of shidi was so precious?!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiong-laoge, the shidi you\u2019re talking about, is it the one that your master made an exception for and accepted two hundred plus years ago?\u201d Qiao WuShuang voiced You XiaoMo\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>XiongXiao nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so many years and he hasn\u2019t gotten over his complex. That\u2019s why my master got me to take the opportunity to cheer him up on his birthday. But I feel that if he doesn\u2019t get over his issues, then this way of doing things won\u2019t address the root cause of the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of complex does your shidi have?\u201d You XiaoMo asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao shook his head and unexpectedly replied, \u201cActually, to be exact, he\u2019s still not my master\u2019s disciple yet. Even though my master has said before that he was, he never agreed. Furthermore his vocal chords have been damaged before. He can\u2019t speak for a period of time and even after my master cured him, he wasn\u2019t willing to speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>From what he said, that shidi did seem rather pitiful, but You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t about to give up the Metal Swallowing Beast just because he was pitiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about this. What are your plans from now?\u201d Xiong Xiao said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked towards Ling Xiao and pondered for a while before speaking, \u201cXiong-laoge, will the Cang Alliance find out about everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao didn\u2019t expect him to talk about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally they will. The Cang Alliance\u2019s intelligence network is spread across the whole Tong Tian Continent. They can find out about everything but it depends on how difficult the information you are trying to find is,\u201d he replied.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes scanned around. \u201cCan we speak in private?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao nodded.</p><br/><p>Before they excused themselves, You XiaoMo said to the other two, \u201cQiao-dage, and this elder too, could you wait for us for a bit? I also have something to speak with you about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang was slightly surprised and he nodded his head, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>He and HuangFu Li then returned to where the Beast Transfiguration Guild was at and left the space for them.</p><br/><p>After making sure no one could hear their conversation, You XiaoMo began.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiong-dage, I need a favor from the Cang Alliance. I need the alliance to help me find out about a person but this matter is very important and concerns many things. It will be better if fewer people know of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can be rest assured about this point. Even if you don\u2019t say it, we won\u2019t tell others about your situation. This is the most basic professional ethic,\u201d Xiong Xiao laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was glad. Then, he looked towards Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Understanding his intention, Ling Xiao spoke, \u201cWe\u2019ve come to the Southern Continent this time to find a person. He was kidnapped by the people from the main family of the Vermillion Blood Clan and his name is Feng ChiYun. The person who kidnapped him was NanShen from the Vermillion Blood Clan. We want to know where he is held.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao was dazed for a moment. He finally knew the reason why they kept provoking the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What looked to be normal, common, white mist was actually immensely poisonous. As soon as a little was breathed in, the weaker victims would immediately die of the toxicity, so only those Spiritual level and above would be able to pass through safely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about mages?\u201d You XiaoMo asked, hearing them talk about practitioners and wondering if there were no limitations for Mages.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are limitations for mages as well, but it\u2019s not according to your level. You\u2019ll know when we get in; it won\u2019t have any effect on you, though.\u201d Ling Xiao hadn\u2019t done any research beforehand, but he managed to guess the way it worked upon taking a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>To confirm how many helpers the level ten Demon Beast had, Fairy FuRong had sent her people to slip into Mirage Sand Sea some time ago. After the sacrifices of several female disciples, they had finally obtained reliable information. The level ten demon beast knew he couldn\u2019t monopolize the entire ley line, so used the ley line as a lure to get nearby level ten demon beasts to help. Boundless Sea had more level ten powerhouses than even the North Continent. To secure the Elemental Essence, the demon beast had invited a total of ten level ten demon beasts, promising them each a tenth of the Spirit Gems.</p><br/><p>Luckily, those invited demon beasts weren\u2019t stronger than that demon beast, but with him included, there was a total of eleven. As for them, their side only had eight Emperor level elites. If each of them took on one Demon Beast, there would be two left over. It was a good thing that they had discussed this yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already given you all the data we could get on Mirage Sand Sea\u2019s demon beasts. After entering, everyone should go and find their own opponent. If you have any problems, use the Transmitter Stones. If no one has any objections, then let\u2019s begin this operation.\u201d Fairy FuRong said in a tender tone. Since the information had all been obtained by Fairy FuRong\u2019s people, it was agreed that she would be given a whole percent for her work at the meeting. After that, everyone split into groups.</p><br/><p>There were only eight groups at first, but DaoXin Academy split into three groups led by Hei Tian, Duan QiTian and Yan Fa. Yan Fa actually wasn\u2019t as strong, and would have a hard time against a level ten Demon Beast, so most of the students would be with him. Then, it was time for the Emperor level powerhouses to open up a path, leading the ten groups inside Mirage Sand Sea.</p><br/><p>Though Mirage Sand Sea only had the poisonous gas on the outer edges, the outer edge continued for over ten thousand meters, consuming a lot of Soul Force. You XiaoMo finally understood why Ling Xiao said the poisonous gas barrier had no limits for levels, because it mostly just consumed one\u2019s Soul Force. If you could replenish your Soul Force whenever, even low leveled mages could enter and exit at will. Ten thousand meters wasn\u2019t too far to go. It was barely an hour before they reached the other side.</p><br/><p>Instantly, their eyes met wide open space, blue skies and seas, and a row of red crowned cranes even flew overhead. It looked like paradise. It was hard to believe that a bloody battle would soon erupt here. By then, the ten teams had already separated. Yan Fa had taken them to some shallows, surrounded by quiet mountain ridges. White fog blanketed the area and the sound of waves was audible. With the warm ocean breeze, everyone felt rather drowsy.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo closed his eyes, taking a deep breath and feeling the dregs of sleep cling to him. Suddenly, there was the thwack of a slap and he opened his eyes, he saw that it was Ling Xiao. Holding his burning cheek, he asked in anger, \u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sighed. \u201cThis is an illusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was stunned for a moment. \u201cIllusion? No way, it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cThat\u2019s because the one casting the illusion is a level ten demon beast, of course you wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just them, even Yan Fa hadn\u2019t realized. What good luck, meeting a level ten demon beast so quickly!</p><br/><p>As they spoke, Yan Fa finally noticed and quickly broke through the illusion with the other elders. The blue skies and seas disappeared from before their eyes, replaced by large stones covered in moss beneath them. In front of them, there was a withering, rotting forest with no hint of green grass or life.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeheh\u2026 I hear you\u2019re the vice-principal of the DaoXin Academy, Yan Fa. Seems like the rumors weren\u2019t false. You\u2019re truly very strong, able to break through this little lady\u2019s illusion\u2019s so quickly.\u201d With the alluring laugh and voice, everyone noticed a group of people standing on one of the hills. The person heading the group was an extremely beautiful woman, even more seductive than Fairy Fu Rong, wearing naught but a fine veil on her body. She had remarkable breasts, long slender legs, a fine specimen. A level ten demon beast, one that was proficient in illusions, no less, this must be one of the only two female level ten demon beasts \u2013 the Monster Fox.</p><br/><p>The Monster Fox\u2019s name was simply just Monster Fox, a fox demon beast just like CatQiu, but with a less impressive bloodline. CatQiu\u2019s ancestors were the ancient Nine-tailed Demon Foxes, so as long as she continued to cultivate, she would achieve a strength that even Monster Fox wouldn\u2019t be able to ever achieve. Monster Foxes had one tail and that tail was their life. If they ever lost it, not only would they lose all their spiritual power, they wouldn\u2019t be able to regain it in ten thousand years, a harsh consequence. So Monster Foxes always took great care of their tail. The woman in front of them wore a revealing red veil in a human form, but behind her swayed a massive white tail. Though their tail might\u2019ve been their weak spot, it was also a great boost to their combative ability, so that\u2019s why she dared to keep it out. If she hid it, she would only lose quicker.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave this Monster Fox to me and the three elders. The others are up to you to deal with.\u201d Yan Fa\u2019s expression was extremely severe. Though they had more people, their opponent was a level ten demon beast. The gap between a level was nothing like the gap between a star; it was immense.</p><br/><p>\u201cShifu, don\u2019t worry about us and focus on the Monster Fox,\u201d Gao Yang called out. Yan Fa nodded at him and led the three elders to meet Monster Fox.</p><br/><p>Monster Fox was a ruler of a section of the Boundless Sea and had many powerful soldiers under her command. Among them, were three level nine demon beasts. The remaining two elders took a level nine demon beast each as their opponents, leaving the last one to Gao Yang and the others. It was good that they had all fought against level nine demon beasts before and weren\u2019t at any disadvantage when facing it together.</p><br/><p>The battle erupted and soon became chaotic. You XiaoMo might not be very strong, he wanted to contribute, but\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao, who was standing beside him, with black lines on his face. \u201cWhat did you come here for? Aren\u2019t you going to help?\u201d With Ling Xiao\u2019s power, it was a waste to fight these small fry. However, if he didn\u2019t go, people would talk, because he wasn\u2019t low on the hundred man rankings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so serious? They\u2019ll win,\u201d Ling Xiao replied lightly.</p><br/><p>Monster Fox hadn\u2019t brought many helpers, and Yin Ge and the others weren\u2019t normal Spiritual Level experts either. They all had powerful ace techniques, and many methods for keeping themselves from certain death. You XiaoMo was speechless. Of course he knew they\u2019d win; that wasn\u2019t what he was worried about.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao kicked a person who wanted to sneak attack You XiaoMo and sent them flying. Then, he took You XiaoMo in another direction and kicked another enemy flying. It was uncertain if it was on purpose or not, but the enemies that were sent flying streaked towards Monster Fox like falling meteorites. The human ammunition hadn\u2019t even gotten close before they were blasted into smithereens by Monster Fox. Though it was an insignificant attack, it gave Yan Fa and the others a small window of opportunity\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cYou did that on purpose, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at him. \u201cDo you have any objections?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo slowly bit out, \u201cNo, I wanted to say, kick another few over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Because of Ling Xiao\u2019s interruptions, Monster Fox was unprepared for the attacks, letting Yan Fa and the others take the upper hand. If this continued, victory was certain.</p><br/><p>After blasting her own underlings for the tenth time, Monster Fox was angry enough to start blowing steam, her figure not nearly as casual as before, but rather inelegant. She glared over at Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo, who had caused all this, having noticed them. It wasn\u2019t just Monster Fox that noticed this, but Yan Fa and the others as well.</p><br/><p>Some people wanted to copy Ling Xiao, but\u2026 They didn\u2019t have the skill. A battle between level ten powerhouses wasn\u2019t something you could easily influence. The slightest mistake might cause trouble instead. Monster Fox had wanted to shake off Yan Fa and the others to kill Ling Xiao, but was continuously seen through by Yan Fa and was clung to, unable to shake them off.</p><br/><p>Eventually, she couldn\u2019t bare it anymore and hollered out in anger, \u201cFrost Lion, until when are you going to stand there and watch for? Come out and help already!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Monster Fox, I can\u2019t believe that a ruler of Boundless Sea like you would be pressured like this by some younglings. How embarrassing\u2026\u201d A man had walked out at Monster Fox\u2019s yell. He had blue hair and an intense aura, marking him as a level ten demon beast for sure. He was exactly as the information they had gotten said him to be. He was the Celestial Frost Lion they were told of. Everyone widened their eyes. Why was the Celestial Frost Lion here?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

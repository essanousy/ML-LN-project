Though he hadn\u2019t specified who he was talking about explicitly, anyone would know who he meant. Plus, these words were even said in front of very people he was talking about, so the effects were even more impactful.</p><br/><p>The only one who knew the full situation was Ling Xiao, who silently gazed skywards.</p><br/><p>Yet, what was unexpected was that the Vermilion Blood Clan\u2019s people didn\u2019t erupt in rage then and there.</p><br/><p>Hu KangNing\u2019s complexion had turned ugly, but, as if being held back by someone, didn\u2019t act despite how he was trembling with rage, red-eyed, and looking as if he wanted to rip You XiaoMo to shreds.</p><br/><p>The person who was stopping him was You QingShan.</p><br/><p>It was then that Cheng DongQing from the Mage Guild glanced at You XiaoMo with an insincere smile and said to You QingShan, \u201cBrother QingShan, I truly admire your restraint after being insulted like that by this buffon!\u201d</p><br/><p>You QingShan was unmoved, mildly replying, \u201cYou said yourself that he was nothing more than a buffoon, so arguing with him is just going to bring us down to his level. I don\u2019t have the time for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng DongQing\u2019s complexion shifted slightly, remembering how he had argued with You XiaoMo before. But it couldn\u2019t really be considered arguing, and he quickly pushed it out of mind, agreeing with the other weakly, \u201cBrother QingShan is very right.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had received such a counterattack by an opponent and You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know how to react..</p><br/><p>After a moment, You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sighed softly. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that you shouldn\u2019t talk to people with \u2018nostrils for eyes\u2019? But you didn\u2019t believe me. Don\u2019t you know that talking with them can get you pregnant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft-\u201c You XiaoMo laughed so hard that his chest hurt.</p><br/><p>He was wrong; this was the real final boss!</p><br/><p>Around them, the expressions of those who heard this twisted. You\u2019d get pregnant hearing someone talk, that truly was a new phrase. Most people were like You XiaoMo and couldn\u2019t hold in their laughter. However, they were more reserved, turning to chuckle into their hands.</p><br/><p>Hearing this sentence, You QingShan\u2019s gaze turned cold enough to create ice. Yet he didn\u2019t want to get into anything with them, because of what he had said before. This was the fabled, \u201cdigging oneself into a ditch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to bother with them. It\u2019s almost time. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Ming came out to help him the out of the awkward situation.</p><br/><p>Cheng QingShan glanced at You XiaoMo darkly, his gaze baring murderous intent. Though he hadn\u2019t acted, he had etched You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao\u2019s appearance into his mind.</p><br/><p>If You XiaoMo knew what he was thinking, he would tell the other that their appearances were fake.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao and Qiao WuShuang looked at You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, not knowing if they should cry or laugh. It was hard to believe they could come up with something like that. They had managed to completely destroy any chance of a good relationship with You QingShan today. None of the Vermilion Blood Clan\u2019s people were forgiving.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao was the first to let go of his reservations. In reality, he had long since began to look on the clansmen of the Vermilion Blood Clan with distaste. They were all arrogant like they had gotten ten thousand two five eights*. If it wasn\u2019t for his position, he would\u2019ve done something like that ages ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two really exceeded my expectations.\u201d Xiong Xiao was exuberant, laughing freely. \u201cBut that was great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was nothing!\u201d You XiaoMo said humbly, smiling so much that his eyes were slits.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang shook his head with a smile. After entering the Underground Palace, the Vermilion Blood Clan would certainly come after them, yet they could still smile like that.</p><br/><p>As the time got closer, tension began to fill the air.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang seemed to see someone he knew and suddenly said, \u201cI have something to do, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he began to walk towards a group of people on a distant mountain. They were powerhouses that had just appeared, radiating an intense aura.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao said, \u201cThey\u2019re from the Beast Transfiguration Guild.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cQiao-dage is from the Beast Transfiguration Guild?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao replied with surprise, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You don\u2019t know?\u201d Qiao WuShuang was very famous in the Southern Continent. Logically, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone who hadn\u2019t heard of him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed and said, \u201cNow I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>This really was an effortless find when they had no idea how to proceed. With their relationship with Qiao Wu Shuang now, it\u2019d be easier for him to learn Beast Transfiguration.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao glanced over at the Broken Valley, saying to them, \u201cThe entrance of the Underground Palace is about to appear. You guys be careful. I need to go and meet up with the others, so I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved at him.</p><br/><p>There were many people who had rushed here to the June Mountains. Apart from the a superclan like the Vermilion Blood Clan, there were quite a few other groups, all powerful sects of the Southern Continent and some infamous names, too. As time went on, these people all pressed towards the entrance of the Broken Valley.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were rather far back, but they had an eighth of an hour, so they weren\u2019t very worried.</p><br/><p>After about ten minutes, an excited voice yelled out from the front, \u201cThe entrance to the Underground Palace has appeared!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the voice rung out, the crowd raced forwards with impatience.</p><br/><p>The crowd swarmed into Broken Valley like ants. Even the weaker practitioners and mages ran towards their deaths as if bewitched.</p><br/><p>The result was as expected. None of them lived and were all torn asunder by the sharp winds, falling at the entrance in gruesome pieces. The people\u2019s minds finally cleared at seeing this, sorrowfully looking at the already dead people and afraid to reckless charge inside. All they could do was stand at the entrance looking and sighing.</p><br/><p>As for the Vermilion Blood Clan and other groups, they darted inside under the guidance of their elites.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly pulled Ling Xiao over. They hadn\u2019t even entered the Broken Valley when they felt a cold, dark presence, as if their very souls were trembling.</p><br/><p>After entering with the others, two towering cliffsides appeared in view, covered in moss that formed jagged shapes on the walls, looking foreboding. In front of them were the raging winds, emitting chilling howls like screaming ghosts.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his head and looked up, seeing a small crack in the air as he had thought he would.</p><br/><p>This crack had been here for many years and more and more Spatial Force drifted out from the crack, so only Emperor Level and above cultivators could endure it.</p><br/><p>No one dared to approach the crack, avoiding it with their lives.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could see the Vermilion Blood Clan at the front, their figures blurring. The others followed them like an osseous disease. They were all so careful, terrified of getting lost.</p><br/><p>But this was understandable. Though everyone knew that Broken Valley was where the Underground Palace would appear, the valley was massive. From the outside, it might only seem two hundred meters wide, but it was thousands of meters deep and the dangerous winds raged everywhere. They couldn\u2019t find it by walking through the entire thing. So the best method was to follow the Vermilion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ling Xiao grabbed his hand and pulled him forwards.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo followed at once. Though they already knew where the entrance was, they couldn\u2019t show it or else the Vermilion Blood Clan would suspect them to be the perpetrators of the incident at the castellan.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know this, but You Ming, near to the front, was indeed observing them.</p><br/><p>When he saw You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, they immediately caught his attention, especially that Ling Xiao. This man made him feel as if he could see through the other, yet as if he couldn\u2019t at the same time, enveloped in a mirage and difficult to identify.</p><br/><p>Though he wasn\u2019t sure if it was them that killed Hu Yin and Hu Lu, he was already suspicious of the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone advanced, a sharp scream suddenly rung out. Two seconds later, with the poof of a small explosion, the scream came to an abrupt halt.</p><br/><p>Some poor guy had managed to get himself carried over to the crack by the winds. He had only just approached when the special force coming out of the crack killed him. The air was filled with blood, the winds carrying it further. Some people didn\u2019t dodge in time and was splattered with a face full.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hid behind Ling Xiao, using him to block the blood.</p><br/><p>Of course, the rain of blood didn\u2019t touch Ling Xiao, not even the corners of his clothes.</p><br/><p>After a while, You XiaoMo was dragged back in front by Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wife, it\u2019s just a death. It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t witnessed death before. This is just a small thing; there\u2019s no need for fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolled his eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s still disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Human bodies were still fragile. Organs like the liver and guts had been blended into the rain of blood as well. If it really had splattered on his body, he would be sick for days.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cI\u2019d rather never get used to it.\u201d That was because getting used to it meant that he might be met with even more similar situations.</p><br/><p>That was when the crowd came to a halt.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the entrance to the Underground Palace had been found. The powerful groups, including the Cang Alliance and Beast Transfiguration Guild, gathered around. The large group seemed to be confirming if this was the entrance to the Underground Palace or not together.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

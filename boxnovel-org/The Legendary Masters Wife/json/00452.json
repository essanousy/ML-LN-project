There was no point in reasoning with them since he believed that he was reason.</p><br/><p>It was just a normal fight till the younger brother came out. Upon seeing his older brother defeated, he wouldn\u2019t let it go until he gave a beating to the one who won against his brother.</p><br/><p>Although, it was the first time something like this had happened, for those in the Central City, it was pretty common and because of that, their reputation was already at the bottom. However, there was nothing to be done, they had their fists and it was very strong. Except for the other nine people who were of the same title, or another Sacred leveled practitioner, there was no one who could oppose him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t stupid enough to make that choice, even if Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t there.</p><br/><p>This life had been smooth sailing for him, but even then, he had met a few oddballs, however, this situation was a first. What Old Eagle said really pissed him off, he felt like he was going to explode in anger, but even then, his brain wasn\u2019t muddled.</p><br/><p>If he were to really choose, he would choose the third option.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t answer and instead, slowly moved backwards.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Old Eagle gave a contemplating smirk and with an eerie smile he said, \u201cI\u2019ll count from three, if you don\u2019t choose by then, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t really in a hurry, after all, he had a teasing personality, this wasn\u2019t the \u2018schoolground playful\u2019 kind of teasing, rather what he appreciated was the expression people made during times of despair. It got his blood boiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne!\u201d Old Eagle called out slowly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo twisted his foot, about ready to run.</p><br/><p>A black silhouette quickly rushed out from the crowded and pulled You XiaoMo along by the arm.</p><br/><p>Old Eagle blanked for a moment before suddenly laughing again. He didn\u2019t think anyone dare stand up for You XiaoMo, much less a level ten demon beast. Although it was surprising, too bad it was way too weak.</p><br/><p>Liao Ya looked distressingly at his guild master, seeing that You XiaoMo was about to escape.</p><br/><p>Old Eagle was peaceful and calm, without a hint of nervousness. All he did was effortlessly wave in the direction that You XiaoMo and the dark shadow were escaping to when that space around it warped.</p><br/><p>The dark shadow, unable to stop, could only forcefully take the hit and as a result, was sent flying. It wasn\u2019t until ten or more meters before he stopped, and a line of blood dripped down from the corner of his mouth</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly rushed over and said with worry, \u201cShe Qiu, are you okay? Don\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who saved him was She Qiu, when the conflict first started in the inn, he had already known. He didn\u2019t immediately appear because he saw that You XiaoMo was already level ten.</p><br/><p>Not only that, he also knew You XiaoMo, if it wasn\u2019t something he could do, he wouldn\u2019t have done it. Thus, when he decided to fight One-Eyed Scarface, he didn\u2019t budge in. To be completely honest, he didn\u2019t think One-Eyed Scarface would have such an \u2018amazing\u2019 little brother who really took the words \u2018power is everything\u2019 and \u2018one of a kind\u2019 to the next level.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s just some internal injuries.\u201d She Qiu stood up, covering his wounded chest.</p><br/><p>The moment You XiaoMo heard of his internal injuries, he pulled out a Sacred magic pill for him to take, \u201cEat this and you will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>She Qiu didn\u2019t waste time with courtesy and chucked it into his mouth, like he was chewing candy or something. Instantly his injuries became much better and he shielded You XiaoMo behind him before saying, \u201cMaster, go ahead and leave this to me. I\u2019ll try to fend them off as long as possible, it won\u2019t take long before Boss comes back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d You XiaoMo said, the moment he heard he was going to take on Old Eagle alone, how could he be at ease with that? \u201cI can\u2019t leave you guys, even if I expose myself, I\u2019ll make sure you guys are safe and sound.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even She Qiu became sentimental at that, but even if he was moved, his attitude didn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>At this moment Old Eagle spoke, \u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two quickly turned towards him, alert.</p><br/><p>Old Eagle laughed and looked at You XiaoMo as he said, \u201cYou seem to be a level ten mage. I won\u2019t kill you, you will make pills for the Old Eagle Guild till I\u2019m satisfied. Then I\u2019ll consider sparing your life as well as your friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo spat in response.</p><br/><p>Instantaneously Old Eagle\u2019s expression darkened, \u201cLooks like you guys want it the hard way. Since you want to die so much, I\u2019ll grant you your wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing murderous intent, She Qiu quickly pushed You XiaoMo away as he made a low shout, \u201cQuick, go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you can get away!\u201d Old Eagle said in a chilling tone. With that, he stepped forward with his right leg and his body suddenly disappeared. Then his bottom flashed in front of the two of them with his hands above You XiaoMo, ready to hit his head.</p><br/><p>She Qiu didn\u2019t have time to pull him away so he could only use his body to block. With an attack from a Divine leveled practitioner, he felt his insides crush with the impact. Forcing back the blood that wanted to come out of his throat, he quickly retreated with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was furious and disregarded the fact that he wasn\u2019t Old Eagle\u2019s opponent. Instead his hands rapidly formed his hand seal, with strings of soul force and the natural soul energy, a Black Seal slowly formed in his hands. He had wanted to form the Earth Seal. However, he was still unfamiliar with such a seal and there wasn\u2019t any time for him to waste so the moment it was complete, he locked on Old Eagle\u2019s direction and released it.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he actually wanted to fight back and with some kind of a seal that looked decent at that, Old Eagle made a chilling smile and said, \u201cThat\u2019s all you got?\u201d</p><br/><p>With that he held out his hand to grab the Black Seal.</p><br/><p>Even before You XiaoMo could express joy, the Black Seal shook a few times in his hands and slowly weakened, then it disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince your performance is over, it\u2019s my turn. You should feel honored, since today I\u2019ll be letting you get a taste of the power of the Corrosive Yin Claw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Eagle shook his sleeves and from his right palm appeared black air, and it sinisterly twined around his hand. In the next moment, it turned into a huge black claw and locked onto You XiaoMo, coming towards them with an appalling air.</p><br/><p>As one of the ten gods, there was no way he didn\u2019t have a signature move but compared to the open and honest techniques of most of them, Old Eagle\u2019s attack were just like his personality, sinister. Thus, most of it had to do with poison and things of a similar nature.</p><br/><p>Take the Corrosive Yin Claw for example, supposedly it was created by killing countless young girls then used the hand to cultivate Yin and after refining it for many years, it could become an incredible Yin poison. Those who were hurt by the technique would not only get their flesh eroded but also their soul would be harmed as well. It caused a huge uproar before.</p><br/><p>For a mage, the soul was incredibly important, once it was damaged, fixing would be difficult, and it would have a lasting effect on one\u2019s level. Thus, even if it was going overboard, one could tell the sinister intentions of Old Eagle; if you can\u2019t have it, destroy it.</p><br/><p>Although She Qiu didn\u2019t know the power of the Corrosive Yin Claw, he could tell that if they didn\u2019t dodge it, it was a death sentence.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to push You XiaoMo away, You XiaoMo got ahead of him and pulled him towards an empty area by the collar. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t a fitting time, She Qiu felt his lips twitch.</p><br/><p>But no matter how fast they were, they couldn\u2019t dodge the black claw that had already locked onto You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Unless one of them took it head on, even if it seemed like suicide, there wasn\u2019t another other. Realizing this, She Qiu lifted his hand and steeled his heart, then slapped You XiaoMo\u2019s back to send him away.</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t realize was that You XiaoMo grabbed onto him with unbreakable force, as if afraid he would face it alone. Therefore, when his hand met You XiaoMo\u2019s back, he did send him flying, but\u2026at the same time he was dragged along.</p><br/><p>She Qiu was almost strangled to death.</p><br/><p>What was odd was that She Qiu flew in front of You XiaoMo, as if he was thrown back by You XiaoMo, when the two landed, it was You XiaoMo who didn\u2019t fall far from the original spot.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo climbed up, the huge black claw was already in front of him. Just as it was about to devour him whole, an arrow attached with a purple flame on its feathers appeared, slicing through space. It went past You XiaoMo and solidly landed at the center of the black claw.</p><br/><p>Under the shocked gaze of the crowd, the black claw, as if it met its match, with incredible speed vibrated and, in a few seconds, stopped struggling and was split down the middle by the arrow.</p><br/><p>Before You XiaoMo realized what had happened he fell into someone\u2019s embrace. A nonchalant tone of the person spoke above his head, \u201cStupid, did you have fun fooling around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Stupid\u2019 melted in his embrace and argued, \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t playing around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulled him out from his hug and made him look at him eye to eye.</p><br/><p>\u2018Stupid\u2019, instantly was met with a pair of deep, onyx eyes that contained some complex feelings that he didn\u2019t understand. He couldn\u2019t help but shrink his neck and, in an attempt to reduce his sentence, started to complain in a pitiful fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cSob sob, It wasn\u2019t my fault, it was Old Eagle who didn\u2019t play fair. He refused to accept his loss and even wanted to kill me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he summarized the situation for Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>At this point, the commotion caused by the flaming arrow and black claw finally died down. Thus, the silhouettes of Old Eagle and his opponent finally showed itself to everyone, who looked on with amazement.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao tilted his head, and from within his piercing gaze flashed something that was stunningly fierce. As it locked onto the anxious and doubtful gaze of Old Eagle, he gave a light smile and said, \u201cJust you watch, I\u2019m going to turn this Old Eagle into a little chickling.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With them both being the youngest son of the family, the level of doting BaiLi XiaoYu gets is higher than his, he can\u2019t express any jealousy in front of BaiLi XiaoYu. Chai Jun then shifts his vicious gaze onto You XiaoMo and very much looks forward to You XiaoMo possibly embarrassing himself in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s group of three actually aren\u2019t surprised by this number, being able to become a level four mage at this age, how could one possibly not have a bit of capabilities, and just like what Tong YueXu said, with his current level, being able to distill magic herbs six times is already extremely outstanding.</p><br/><p>Elder GuanYong who had constantly been standing on the side with an indifferent expression finally reveals a hint of a smile and nods his head in satisfaction before saying, \u201cBaiLi XiaoYu, pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu is next, his distillation of seven times heightens the atmosphere in the hall.</p><br/><p>But everyone\u2019s expectations for him were very high in the first place, so this number isn\u2019t out of people\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu doesn\u2019t say anything extra, he retreats back to BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s side and stands together with him. He then looks towards You XiaoMo and Teng ZiXin, the last two who haven\u2019t been tested yet.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at the association member who\u2019s standing next to the testing instrument but never helped him undergo the test and is at a slight loss of whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>His magic herb powder has already been put inside for a long time, but for some unknown reason, this person actually never pressed it down for him, it\u2019s like as if he\u2019s purposely waiting until the others finish testing.</p><br/><p>He wants to say, although he doesn\u2019t plan to keep a low profile this time, don\u2019t be so painstaking.</p><br/><p>But no matter how much he looks at the other person and stares with a x-ray like gaze, the other person is just completely aloof and indifferent.</p><br/><p>It isn\u2019t until Tong YueXu finishes his test that this man finally starts to move, but at the same time he moves, Elder Guan Yong standing to his side also takes action, it\u2019s unknown whether it\u2019s just a coincidence or if it\u2019s something else, the two people almost press the button on the testing instrument at the same time.</p><br/><p>Following their movements, two rays of dark green light that are almost on par with each other instantly erupt, the flickering light causes the faces of the surrounding people to be full of astonishment in a split second.</p><br/><p>Green rays of light that are almost on par with each other, what does this represent, this represents that You XiaoMo\u2019s number of distillations has a 99% chance of being the same as Teng ZiXin.</p><br/><p>The entire hall suddenly becomes quiet.</p><br/><p>The original lively atmosphere becomes dead silent in an instant.</p><br/><p>One can only see that on the front of the two testing instruments lies two numbers emanating green rays of light \u2014 eight!</p><br/><p>Eight times, this is the highest value that has appeared from the beginning to the end of this assessment, everyone in the hall could\u2019ve guessed that Teng ZiXin would definitely have the highest number this time, the truth shows that everyone\u2019s predictions weren\u2019t wrong, but in their hearts, Teng ZiXin\u2019s number should be the only one of its kind.</p><br/><p>In the end this You XiaoMo actually gave them such a big surprise.</p><br/><p>The number of distillations of magic herbs done by a level four mage is actually the same as Teng ZiXin, someone who\u2019s a level five mage.</p><br/><p>Does this mean, You XiaoMo\u2019s strength can already \u2026 rival that of a level five mage?</p><br/><p>Every single person thinks of this point in horror, if this is true, then one can only fear that this You XiaoMo\u2019s potential is higher than Teng ZiXin\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin looks at the number on the instrument with a stunned expression, this number \u2018eight\u2019 deeply and painfully stabs at her two eyes.</p><br/><p>She actually barked up the wrong tree, who would\u2019ve thought, the You XiaoMo whom she didn\u2019t pay attention to just a moment ago is actually standing on the same level as her at this very moment. Although she reserved a bit of her strength appropriately this time, but the difference between a level four mage and a level five mage isn\u2019t small.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin quickly omits the shocked expression on her face and looks at You XiaoMo who\u2019s standing to her side with a gaze showing he\u2019s absorbed in his thoughts. Even though the Teng family isn\u2019t lacking geniuses with high potentials, but if they can draw a genius like this to their side, it\u2019s still beneficial for the Teng family.</p><br/><p>Amidst the crowd, Chai Jun eyes are wide open and looks at this scene in disbelief.</p><br/><p>He only snaps out of it after a very long time, his expression becomes temperamental in a split second and his gaze gradually reveals a hint of hate.</p><br/><p>This person whom he\u2019s always looked down upon, always waited to be embarrassed actually already stands at the high altitude he still hasn\u2019t reached. This makes his complacent from just a while ago directly turn into great mockery. This strike isn\u2019t small.</p><br/><p>This result also leaves Elder GuanYong in great surprise, to the point where his eyes uncontrollably reveal his clear emotions. Back then when he saw You XiaoMo and Teng ZiXin finish at the same time, although he didn\u2019t know the other\u2019s number of distillations, but the feeling this youth gave him was quite special, that\u2019s why he purposely planned for the two people to be tested at the same time. He didn\u2019t think that the surprise would be so big!</p><br/><p>Other than Elder Guan Yong, a few of DaoXin Academy\u2019s daoshi\u2019s gazes towards You XiaoMo also become unusually fiery, the one who\u2019s the most excited is NingJing -daoshi. Her beautiful face is even slightly flushing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis You XiaoMo makes me so surprised.\u201d Ning Jing -daoshi says as she pouts her lips.</p><br/><p>Hearing that her voice is like she\u2019s talking to herself, Gao Yang also nods his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not only a surprise, I\u2019m almost going to stop breathing, it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019ll become a level five mage before the age of 19. Back then, Teng ZiXin also rose a level at this age.\u201d</p><br/><p>NingJing-daoshi is pleasantly surprised, \u201cGaoYang, you really have found a good student for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She tested You XiaoMo herself, so strictly speaking, she is qualified to have the priority of being his daoshi, but You XiaoMo also has to agree with this.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang smiles, \u201cIt\u2019s you who has good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind these two people, Ling Xiao folds his arms and looks at You XiaoMo who\u2019s feared, admired and envied by everyone, the corner of his lips reveal a smile with a hint of pride. Although he also likes the You XiaoMo from before, the You XiaoMo who\u2019s now the cream of the crop attracts him even more, his heart beats frenziedly and his blood boils.</p><br/><p>After a long time, those people who accidently went into stagnation finally take a deep breath in, the sounds of people whispering under their breaths become louder and louder, the gazes that look at You XiaoMo now aren\u2019t belittling like before because with this level of strength, his achievements in the future might not be less than Teng ZiXin.</p><br/><p>Elder Guan Yong adjusts his mentality, he looks towards You XiaoMo full of satisfaction and nods his head a few times in a row before smiling, \u201cPretty good, pretty good, I announce that both You XiaoMo and Teng ZiXin pass!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he willingly wanted to have such a high profile, You XiaoMo is still very excited, he doesn\u2019t pay any attention to the fiery looks other people are giving him, instead he runs over to Ling Xiao without consulting anyone and can\u2019t help but say, \u201cLing Xiao, I\u2019m number one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao is very happy that the other ran over to tell him first, hints of pampering are revealed in those eyes beneath the mask, \u201cCongratulations to you, continue to work hard, I believe you can do even better.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is excited and horrified.</p><br/><p>This is Ling Xiao\u2019s first time using this kind of tone to speak, he\u2019s not really\u2026 used to it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shivers, \u201cWhat about you congratulate me in a different way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao is angered that he laughs, he lifts his hand and knocks at the other\u2019s head, \u201cOkay, what about this way?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo clutches his head and tears stream down his face, he really is looking for cruelty.</p><br/><p>Because of You XiaoMo, Ling Xiao who was originally mingled quietly within the crowd now also catches everyone\u2019s attention, seeing their intimate actions together, a few people start to predict his background. A man with such a temperament, maybe he comes from some powerful aristocratic family, but they haven\u2019t heard of such a person before.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, some people can\u2019t help but also become suspicious of You XiaoMo\u2019s background, a young genius with such strength could probably only be trained with the power of a big family.</p><br/><p>Just as they\u2019re thinking of random thoughts impetuously, NingJing-daoshi asks exactly what they\u2019ve all been dying to know.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo, my question might be a bit bold, but I don\u2019t know whether or not you have a shifu and who your shifu is, can you tell me?\u201d Being capable of mentoring such a pupil, his Master\u2019s reputation is definitely not small, NingJing-daoshi instantly goes through those high level mages who have been famous for a long period of time in her mind.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is taken back and suddenly thinks of Kong Wen.</p><br/><p>Although Kong Wen is his shifu by name, but he\u2019s never taught him.</p><br/><p>This kind of person can\u2019t be considered to be his master, he also doesn\u2019t want people to investigate into people from TianXin Sect.</p><br/><p>But before he can open his mouth, Ling Xiao answers on his behalf, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a shifu.\u201d</p><br/><p>NingJing\u2013daoshi astonishingly says, \u201cHow could he not have a shifu, then he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao answers, \u201cHe is able achieve what he can today purely from his own hard work.\u201d</p><br/><p>NingJing-daoshi instantly becomes silent.</p><br/><p>Those who had their ears perked up and were secretly listening on are stunned by You XiaoMo once again, their bodies sway and they clean out their ears with all their might. They didn\u2019t hear incorrectly right? This genius who has a very high chance of being able to compete with Teng ZiXin is actually self-taught? Holy shit, he is clearly just a fudging abnormal!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

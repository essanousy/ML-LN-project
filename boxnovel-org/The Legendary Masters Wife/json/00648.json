Ever since the rise of Lin ShaoYi, the Qilin Clan had become an item in his pocket.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao possessed the qualifications to inherit the position as Qilin Clan\u2019s head, but due to the rejection of the clan members and his resistance to staying in the same place with them, even if he knew the current head of QiLin Clan didn\u2019t reject him, he still didn\u2019t bother interacting with the other members.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, one of the reasons also started from Lin Gu.</p><br/><p>Since Ling Xiao\u2019s father was imprisoned by the Qilin Clan, Lin Gu never had any good impression toward the Qilin Clan, which was why he didn\u2019t let the young Ling Xiao stay inside the clan, and he would often teach him all the bad deeds of the Qilin Clan.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even though both of them were candidates for the succession, Lin ShaoYi had more inborn advantages. He was the most outstanding youth among the three generations, he was skillful and crafty, and he knew how to win over people.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the entire Qilin Clan, except the clan head, had taken side with Lin ShaoYi, including Ling Xiao\u2019s grandfather, Lin Tian.</p><br/><p>As the result, it was almost impossible to inquire information about Ling Xiao\u2019s father inside this impenetrable defense of the QiLin Clan, but fortunately, nothing was absolute.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu didn\u2019t waste those thousands of years not gaining anything.</p><br/><p>Back in the day, Ling Xiao\u2019s father had plenty of followers, even though not all of them remained loyal to him until this day, but some of them still stayed in touch in secret.</p><br/><p>From their words, Ling Xiao learned that his father was imprisoned inside the Purgatory tower.</p><br/><p>The Purgatory tower was used by the Qilin Clan to punish traitors, the tortuous punishments were set to aim directly at the clan members.</p><br/><p>For the ordinary clan members, one year inside was far more than what they could handle. Thus, unless one had an exceptional tenacious willpower, one would go crazy after thousands of years inside.</p><br/><p>Sadly the informant was not able to enter the Purgatory tower because his status wasn\u2019t high enough, so he had no way to know the current situation of Ling Xiao\u2019s father. In addition, Lin ShaoYi\u2019s eyes were everywhere inside the Qilin clan so he didn\u2019t dare to make a big move.</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t investigate the Purgatory tower, that man decided to switch his investigation to the man, Lin ShaoYi, himself.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi\u2019s whereabouts was full of mystery. Every month he would disappear for some days, and everytime he came back, his aura would become more and more dangerous, sometimes a faint bloody smell could be sensed from him.</p><br/><p>Except for Ling Xiao, no one knew what he was up to.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Following Ling Xiao\u2019s aura, You XiaoMo found him standing inside the pavilion with both his hands behind his back while looking at the distant mountain ranges. He went closer.</p><br/><p>The more they learned about the Qilin Clan, the more they discovered that the QiLin clan was a super-hard-to-chew bone. Back then You XiaoMo didn\u2019t understand why Lin Gu couldn\u2019t find Ling Xiao\u2019s father despite all the effort after thousands of years, now he knew, it wasn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t try hard enough, it was because the enemy was too strong.</p><br/><p>Originally they could just expose Lin ShaoYi\u2019s true face as the leader of the Black Spider because as long as this news went out, it wouldn\u2019t be just the Qilin Clan but also the True Dragon clan that would point their spear against him, which was enough to make him flustered. But when You XiaoMo thought about Ling Xiao\u2019s father who was still imprisoned inside Qilin Clan, if they really provoked Lin ShaoYi, they wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee that Lin ShaoYi wouldn\u2019t make a move on this father-in-law whom he had yet to meet.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took back his line of sight, his eyes flashed with a ray of light, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Dong Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t keep up with his thinking, why did they have to leave for Dong Zhou so suddenly? Even though both Da shixiong and second shixiong were there, it was quite strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why Lin ShaoYi helped the Gu Ma tribe unify Dong Zhou?\u201d Ling Xiao slightly raised his lips and revealed a suggestive smile, his eyes flashing as if he was calculating something.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You XiaoMo asked again.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t know why he would spread his hand toward Dong Zhou, but later on when I asked Tian Dao to investigate, I finally figured out his goal is very likely to be the the Five Blessing Spirit Eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the Five Blessing Spirit Eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dong Zhou\u2019s biggest treasure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Five Blessing Spirit Eye was Tong Tian continent\u2019s top ranked blessed place. The place was created by the spiritual energy of the earth and heaven\u2019s five elements. Whether it was practitioners or mages, as long as they cultivated around the Five Blessing Spirit Eye, their cultivation could increase drastically. Moreover, it had no backlash. Especially toward mages, the Five Blessing Spirit Eye could change their soul\u2019s quality.</p><br/><p>Just this effectiveness alone was enough for every mage of Tong Tian continent to rush like ducks and fight manically for the Five Blessing Spirit Eye. After all, there was a reason for Dong Zhou to be called the mage\u2019s paradise during the ancient battles.</p><br/><p>The place where the Five Blessing Spirit Eye was first discovered was in Dong Zhou. It was later deducted that Dong Zhou was the most suitable region to nurture the Five Blessing Spirit Eye, and only by then was it exploited without restraint.</p><br/><p>However, the Five Blessing Spirit Eye didn\u2019t exist forever. What practitioners and mages cultivated around the Five Blessing Spirit Eyes was in fact the energy they absorbed from the Five Blessing Spirit Eye itself. From ancients time to the present, some the Five Blessing Spirit Eyes had been fully absorbed.</p><br/><p>For example, the Gu Ma tribe\u2019s Five Blessing Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>The reason why so many transcendent level mages with high level appeared inside the Gu Ma tribe was thanks to the the Five Blessing Spirit Eye. But judging from their usage, their Five Blessing Spirit Eye must have disappeared.</p><br/><p>The loss of Five Blessing Spirit Eye could mean that transcendent level mages may not appear in the future again. The answer to their problem? Stealing other\u2019s Five Blessing Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>Not many people knew about the Five Blessing Spirit Eye because, after all, it was a treasure that defies heaven, hiding alone wasn\u2019t enough, who would announce it publicly. Like Gu Ma tribe, maybe the only people who knew about it were Mo Ma and Xia Yin who had extremely high status.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was extremely looking forward to it, because his current cultivation progress had reached the bottleneck. He had progressed too fast previously, and every since then, the speed went down gradually. If he didn\u2019t grab an opportunity soon, he afraid that it would take him another year to breakthrough to grade five.</p><br/><p>The Five Blessing Spirit Eye sounded like it was prepared just for him. Right now, even if Ling Xiao forbid him from going, he would still go Dong Zhou, and also to visit his two shixiongs.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s main purpose wasn\u2019t to destroy Lin ShaoYi\u2019s plan. In his opinion, Lin ShaoYi had stretched his hands way too far. The matter with Xi Jing alone was already enough to make him unable to stretch out anymore.</p><br/><p>After Tian Dao\u2019s investigation of the Five Blessing Spirit Eye, Ling Xiao immediately thought of his wife, but at the time he was busy fighting to death with Tong Tian palace\u2019s master, so the plan was delayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will we leave for Dong Zhou?\u201d You XiaoMo was somewhat impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn two days.\u201d Ling Xiao answered, he knew You XiaoMo would respond.</p><br/><p>Without Ling Xiao to push him, You XiaoMo had already fully prepared for their departure, all that was left was for Ling Xiao to finish entrusting the Tian Gou\u2019s business and they could leave right away.</p><br/><p>Since Ling Xiao was here, they only brought the Metal Swallowing Beast and Xiao Ping along. Xiao Pong was borrowed by Tian Dao since it was the killer of restriction barrier, it would be too wasteful not taking advantage of it.</p><br/><p><strong><em>Ra: Husband the multi-purpose tools\u2026Who need contracted beasts when you have a multi-purpose husband &lt;_&lt;</em></strong></p><br/><p>After the collaboration between the Weasel Beast and Tian Dao\u2019s intel network, Tian Dao sent the Weasel Beast to work everyday. In order to reward him, You XiaoMo gave him the turkeys that had grown quite a lot inside his dimension as food, he also wrote down the recipe for beggar chicken so that they could study it by themselves.</p><br/><p>PiQiu and CatQiu also wanted to follow them to Dong Zhou as well because they hadn\u2019t been together with their master much during those years, they really missed their master\u2019s\u2026care, but they were thrown back by Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew that during these past few years he hadn\u2019t spent much time with his contracted beasts, but they had no choice, there were too many troubles following them. Probably not until they solved all the problems did they finally have a chance to get together.</p><br/><p>Two days later, they set off for Dong Zhou.</p><br/><p>This was the second time they went to Dong Zhou, yet the atmosphere was obviously different compared to before.</p><br/><p>After the war among the three tribes broke out, Dong Zhou was filled with tension with the strained atmosphere. The scenes of people wearing different symbols and clothings clashing their swords against each other could be seen everywhere.</p><br/><p>The two of them intentionally went to Gu Ma tribe\u2019s town, the building that Yan Hui and Su Lang stayed before had been unoccupied since, there was dust everywhere.</p><br/><p>The situation inside the Gu Ma tribe was not so good at the moment. Even though Xia Yin had colluded secretly with Moqi XiYuan, on the surface, she still hadn\u2019t gone against Mo Ma. Although Mo Ma was also doubting Xia Yin, but since she was a holy maiden, her reputation within the Gu Ma tribe was extremely high, so unless he had evidence to prove that Xia Yin had betrayed the tribe, Xia Yin\u2019s status in the tribe could not be shaken by one-sided words alone.</p><br/><p>But Mo Ma wasn\u2019t a fool, he was trying to push Xia Yin to rebel.</p><br/><p>With Lin ShaoYi\u2019s help, Mo Ma restricted Xia Yin in every aspect as he secretly made moves to go against her. Mo Ma avoided letting Xia Yin know all the secret incidents and missions. He thought this move could drive Xia Yin to a corner, but who would have thought, he was the one being used by Xia Yin instead.</p><br/><p>The Gu Ma tribe\u2019s biggest enemies were Shui Xi and Wan Sha, yet Mo Ma didn\u2019t deal with the enemies, instead, he wholeheartedly focused on pushing his own people away.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin let some people spread out the rumor, and now everyone knew about Mo Ma\u2019s conducts and deeds. The holy maiden was their moral pillar, how could the tribe head Mo Ma do such a thing. In that moment, doubts against Mo Ma had seeded inside everyone.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin\u2019s chance to betray the Gu Ma tribe was when one of her men was killed by Mo Ma\u2019s trusted aide in front of many people.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin purposely set up this plan, and then she left the Gu Ma tribe openly with honor, while stirring up the water inside the Gu Ma tribe even more. She also took with her a group of strong practitioners who were loyal to her, which enraged Mo Ma even further.</p><br/><p>All this happened before You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao arrived in Dong Zhou.</p><br/><p>Mo Ma used three days to suppress those voices that spoke against him. The Gu Ma tribe had changed to a dictatorship. In order to annex Shui Xi and Wan Sha, he even promised to give the Black Spider the first Five Blessing Spirit Eye they discovered. One must know that, Mo Ma was asking a tiger for its skin, furthermore, the Black Spider had never revealed their true intentions to them.</p><br/><p><strong>t/n: asking a tiger for its skin = asking someone of evil characters for a favor, which was against his interest</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

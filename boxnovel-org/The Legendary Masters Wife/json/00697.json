After he saw him, he didn\u2019t immediately rush over and plaster himself to him like he had in the past; instead, he looked at him with a face full of hidden bitterness.</p><br/><p>Father and son both had the same exact bitter expression.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had always thought it was very mysterious. He knew that You XiaoMo was a soul from a different world, so logically speaking, the two of them weren\u2019t really father and son. But often times, their expressions were both mysteriously similar.</p><br/><p>Whoever dared to say that they weren\u2019t father or son would definitely be considered crazy!</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t look so miserable. Things aren\u2019t actually as serious as what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d You XiaoMo hugged his dad\u2019s arm and looked at him, all smiles.</p><br/><p>But You JunQi couldn\u2019t be happy at all. Instead, he snorted at him and complained, \u201cWhat\u2019s not as serious as what I was thinking? My son is about to ignore me, how can I not run over immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his head awkwardly.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t do anything about it either. If he didn\u2019t do this, his clingy dad wouldn\u2019t have come over.</p><br/><p>After all, the Vermillion Blood Clan was a major clan. Even though You ZhenTian was dead, the clan wouldn\u2019t break up in a short amount of time. They still had many experts in the clan.</p><br/><p>He had heard his clingy dad say before in the past that many of the previous generation actually supported him. Those people were the true treasures of the Vermillion Blood Clan, as some had even survived from before the ancient war and had personally witnessed the beginning and end of it.</p><br/><p>The only thing was that those old farts ignored worldly affairs and hadn\u2019t been involved in clan matters for many years already.</p><br/><p>So after his clingy dad had been falsely accused and You ZhenTian monopolized the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s power, they didn\u2019t make an appearance and help out, but that didn\u2019t mean that they didn\u2019t want his clingy dad to return.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hoped that his clingy dad would return to the Vermillion Blood Clan, implying that he needed to become the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s head, but his clingy dad who had been living free for quite a while definitely wouldn\u2019t agree. So he told Tian Dao to tell him that if he didn\u2019t come back, he would ignore him from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t misunderstand. Actually, you might not necessarily have to become the family head,\u201d You XiaoMo hurriedly explained. He didn\u2019t want his clingy dad to go do something that he didn\u2019t want to do either.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You JunQi looked suspiciously at his son, who had pressed his lips together into a smile, as if he was turning some clever idea over in his head. For now, he would listen to him talk a bit.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo saw his expression relax a little, he immediately told him what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Vermillion Blood Clan only lacked an expert who could keep everything under control. An outsider definitely wouldn\u2019t do, since they would undoubtedly incite the backlash of the clan\u2019s members. As a result, the most suitable one was You JunQi.</p><br/><p>Of course, You XiaoMo would also work. After all, on the surface he was still You JunQi\u2019s son, but he had many things to do. Lin ShaoYi\u2019s and Ling Xiao\u2019s grudge still hadn\u2019t been resolved, so he and Ling Xiao would be unable to remain in South Continent one day. Therefore, the best pick was only You JunQi.</p><br/><p>If he wouldn\u2019t be the family head, then he could just be the acting family head.</p><br/><p>After stabilizing the Vermillion Blood Clan, he could select the person who could really become the family head. However, this person had to be on their side, or else there would be another You ZhenTian, and You JunQi might as well be the family head in that case.</p><br/><p>As for a candidate, that wasn\u2019t actually that hard to find. The Vermillion Blood Clan was a large clan, and besides You ZhenTian\u2019s bloodline, there were still quite a few other factions. There would definitely be a lot of people who secretly refused to accept You ZhenTian.</p><br/><p>After listening to him, You JunQi also felt that this method was okay. He indeed wasn\u2019t willing to see the Vermillion Blood Clan decline like this. The only reason the Vermillion Blood Clan ended up where they were today was 99% due to You ZhenTian, but they also had no choice but to obey You ZhenTian. You JunQi was willing to give them a chance.</p><br/><p>Finally, the father and son duo reached an agreement.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo successfully persuaded his clingy dad to assume control over the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, they told Fu CangQiong about their decision, and Fu CangQiong indicated that he wouldn\u2019t meddle in this matter. Furthermore, if he had to, he could dispatch someone to come help.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was waiting for him to say that.</p><br/><p>They had too few people on their side. If they wanted to subdue the thorn that was the Vermillion Blood Clan, they couldn\u2019t depend on just his clingy dad, even if he was a superior Sacred Realm expert.</p><br/><p>Fu CangQiong let You JunQi take his smartest disciples, who were also the best at administration, Yue QianShan and Yu Bu. With them at his side giving advice, things should progress very smoothly.</p><br/><p>Standing on the path at the bottom of Amaranthine Mountain, You XiaoMo sent off the reluctant to part You JunQi, who looked back every three steps. You XiaoMo smiled till his face grew stiff. Since he couldn\u2019t go with You JunQi, his clingy dad had thrown a fit the entire day until You XiaoMo finally managed to comfort him.</p><br/><p>Two days later, he and Ling Xiao set out for Xi Jing.</p><br/><p>Tian Gui didn\u2019t go with them since he went with You JunQi to the Vermillion Blood Clan. Tian Gui was good at fighting, and was also someone who was vicious, merciless, and bloodthirsty. With him there, You JunQi could ask him to help take care of matters that weren\u2019t convenient for him to appear at.</p><br/><p>By the time they returned to the Ghost Tomb Mountain Range, two more days had passed. As a result, they ended up seeing someone who they never thought they would meet at Weeping Ghost Shore.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao casually swept a glance over him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked suspiciously between the two of them. It seemed as if he had never met this uncle before, but Ling Xiao knew him. Who could it be?</p><br/><p>It was as if Lin Ming didn\u2019t see the somewhat unwelcome expression on his son\u2019s face. He turned to look at You XiaoMo, his gaze assessing. After a while, he laughed. \u201cYou must be You XiaoMo. Sure enough, you\u2019re just like what A-Gu said.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked and finally knew who he was.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s father, the fake Qilin Lord. He had always been a mystery, but now he appeared in front of them in broad daylight. He felt as if something wasn\u2019t quite right, but Ling Xiao\u2019s father was just about the same as what he had been imagining: bold and powerful, heroic and honorable-looking, his features honest, almost two meters tall, extremely tall. His appearance seemed extremely masculine.</p><br/><p>He looked completely different from Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Before, You XiaoMo had thought that it was very likely that Ling Xiao had inherited his father\u2019s genes. Now that he had personally seen the father in question, he finally knew how wrong his assumption had been.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu saw that the atmosphere was going awry, and he hastily stepped out to help Lin Ming explain. \u201cLing-er, this time, when your father came over, he isn\u2019t planning on leaving again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lifted an eyebrow slightly and sneered. \u201cExposed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gu nodded his head awkwardly.</p><br/><p>But Lin Ming wasn\u2019t embarrassed in the slightest. He suddenly reached out a hand and forcefully patted Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder, who didn\u2019t move at all. Lin Ming didn\u2019t care either, and he said, \u201cLin ShaoYi is already in control of the Qilin Clan. Two days ago, he suddenly brought people and burst into the Qilin Clan before exposing my identity in front of everyone. He even framed the previous Qilin Lord\u2019s death as my doing. All those old farts believed him. At this point, Lin ShaoYi should have become the new Qilin Lord. Son, you must be careful; the Lin ShaoYi now is different from before. It seems as if his plan has succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao frowned. \u201cEven those old farts believed Lin ShaoYi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t mention anyone by name, Lin Ming seemed to know who he was referring to. His face darkened a little. He didn\u2019t need to say anything for the answer to be self-evident.</p><br/><p>Never mind the fact that Lin Tian was both father and grandfather. In reality, he was incredibly indifferent to familial loyalty. He had never really looked at his son Lin Ming or his grandson Ling Xiao or cared enough about them to ask after them. Of course, he might have also never had anything to do with Lin Ming ever since he was young.</p><br/><p>Ever since Lin Ming was young, he had been brought up by the Qilin Lord. In terms of affection, perhaps he was closer to the Qilin Lord. As time passed, father and son nearly became estranged. Even when something happened to Lin Ming, Lin Tian didn\u2019t have anything to say.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming had long since abandoned all expectations for this father of his.</p><br/><p>It was even more impossible for Ling Xiao. He could count on less than three fingers the amount of times he\u2019d seen Lin Tian before while growing up. On this matter, they knew Lin Tian\u2019s choice since the beginning. However, once he stood on Lin ShaoYi\u2019s side, that meant that a day would come where they would meet on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, it\u2019s up to you now. If you don\u2019t quickly destroy Lin ShaoYi\u2019s plotting, according to the next step in his plan, he will target the Demon Phoenix Clan, True Dragon Clan, and Black Turtle Clan. Seizing them means he\u2019ll seize Xi Jing. When that time comes, he will definitely continue expanding his influence.\u201d Lin Ming spoke with concern. It wasn\u2019t that he liked to worry about the country or its people; it was that when Lin ShaoYi succeeded, the first people that he would deal with would definitely be them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on what you\u2019re implying, Lin ShaoYi still hasn\u2019t reached that realm yet.\u201d Ling Xiao pondered.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming said, \u201cHow could it be that easy to reach the realm? However, I imagine it\u2019ll be soon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like he\u2019s planning something big. I suspect that the TongTian Emperor has already been killed. That day, when he burst into the Qilin Clan, some of the TongTian Emperor\u2019s underlings were among his, but the TongTian Emperor himself has disappeared. We most likely don\u2019t have much time remaining.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, he left with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming originally wanted to talk with him privately, but Ling Xiao ended up running away when he wasn\u2019t paying attention. By the time he wanted to call out for him to stop, Ling Xiao had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t force him. Give him some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gu just knew that it would be like this. In any case, what he had was time.</p><br/><p>But Lin Ming didn\u2019t have as good of a temper as Lin Gu had to indulge Ling Xiao. After hearing that he immediately laughed and scolded him. \u201cDon\u2019t spoil him too much. I can see that that damn brat is clearly purposefully stringing you along. It\u2019s most likely because I didn\u2019t tell him the truth last time so he bore a grudge until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t tell him the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a stretch of silence, Lin Gu\u2019s emotionless voice suddenly sounded.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming silently cursed in his head. He had accidentally let it slip.</p><br/><p>A second later, while standing in the doorway of the Smile Pavilion, Tian Dao saw someone dragging somebody else away by the ear. His stiff expression revealed an imperceptible smile.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, everything has a weakness!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

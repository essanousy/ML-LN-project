Furthermore, that was only a movie, and its name was \u2018Human Meat Buns.\u2019</p><br/><p>He was sort of a coward, and after You Bo found out, he often forced You XiaoMo to watch horror movies together with him. This was one of those movies. After he watched it, he didn\u2019t dare to eat steamed buns for half a month, and it left a deep impression. But, all in all, it was still only a movie. Yet now he had come across the real thing.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was so disgusted that he didn\u2019t even dare to continue eating the sugared lotus root chips.</p><br/><p>He was extremely thankful that, fortunately, the snacks that the innkeeper sent him the day before only included peanuts and sugared lotus root chips, or else he was ready to throw up all of the food that he ate the day before.</p><br/><p>By the time it was completely cleared away, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t have any desire to eat anymore.</p><br/><p>Thinking back on it now, the innkeeper\u2019s actions the night before were actually very suspicious.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo carefully thought back to the innkeeper\u2019s expression at the time. Even though he had already refused, the innkeeper still forced him to accept the two free bowls of snacks, and then he had even sent him side dishes. There was no way that the innkeeper was such a warm and hospitable person.</p><br/><p>With a hint of an idea in his mind, You XiaoMo glanced at Ling Xiao\u2019s situation again before leaving.</p><br/><p>He remembered that there were still two outsiders who checked into the inn at the same time they did. Since the quality of their clothing was very high, You XiaoMo was certain that they were the same as him and Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Considering JiJiu Town\u2019s circumstances, there was no way the innkeeper would dare to chop up the people from JiJiu Town and turn them into stuffing. So, if his guess was correct, it was very likely that those two foreigners had been murdered.</p><br/><p>The inn was built around a small inner courtyard, and one could see what was happening in every room if they opened the window or door. There were four corridors on the second floor, and the two foreigners\u2019 room was on the corridor to the left of You XiaoMo\u2019s room, very close together.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir!\u201d Suddenly, the innkeeper\u2019s voice came from behind him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo jumped in fright and almost shouted out loud, but luckily, he steadied himself in time and turned to look at the innkeeper, who had sent him the human meat buns. That disgusted feeling rose again.</p><br/><p>The smile on the innkeeper\u2019s face was as pure as a chrysanthemum. \u201cSir, where are you trying to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the inn was built around a courtyard, he could see what was happening on the second floor from the first floor. The innkeeper\u2019s counter was also built in a very clever place, and he could see everything as long as he looked up.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s expression instantly hardened. \u201cDo I need to tell you where I\u2019m going?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he thought of how this person actually killed someone and turned them into stuffing for a meat bun, he wished he could just smash his face to pieces.</p><br/><p>No wonder outsiders described Dong Zhou\u2019s people as being from an uncivilized race. If they could even do this kind of thing, then it was simply inhuman! He knew that he couldn\u2019t just place all of Dong Zhou\u2019s people into one basket. After all, the uncle wasn\u2019t that kind of person, and his personality was actually very shy. But the moment he thought of the human meat buns, he grew angry again.t/n: the uncle here is the uncle that always follows them around XiaoYao Institution.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, you\u2019ve misunderstood. I only wanted to ask if the breakfast was to your liking, I didn\u2019t mean anything else.\u201d When he saw You XiaoMo get angry, he hastily apologized.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sneered coldly before flicking his sleeves and returning to his room. It wasn\u2019t worthwhile to be respectful to someone like him. Moreover, since You XiaoMo had been discovered, it wouldn\u2019t be good for him to just swagger over and check things out, or else the concierge would suspect that he knew something.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as if You XiaoMo was afraid of them. The day before when they entered the town, he discovered that the people of JiJiu Town all generally had low cultivation bases. Their cultivation bases were mostly in the Sun Realm or Moon Realm area, and he could occasionally see a few Moon Realm or Star Realm practitioners. If he wanted to slaughter them all, it would be as easy as turning over his hand.</p><br/><p>But JiJiu Town\u2019s people were extremely xenophobic, so if he didn\u2019t come up with a comprehensive strategy, the entire JiJiu Town would most likely send a witch hunt after him and Ling Xiao once they learned that he killed the innkeeper.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t want people to disturb Ling Xiao. Plus, he was still preparing to find some medicine to treat his wounds.</p><br/><p>Dong Zhou\u2019s land was relatively infertile, and the population wasn\u2019t very high either. If they wanted to find a city or town with people, they would have to spend quite a bit of time searching without a map.</p><br/><p>The innkeeper watched the door close, and his smiling face instantly darkened again.</p><br/><p>He glanced again in the direction that You XiaoMo was about to walk in. He couldn\u2019t have been discovered, right? He shouldn\u2019t have been. If he was discovered, he would\u2019ve been found out the night before. There was no reason to wait until now.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the innkeeper used the excuse of retrieving the empty plates to enter the room, and along the way he glanced around to see if there was anything unusual happening.</p><br/><p>He believed that You XiaoMo and his companion ate everything.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, You XiaoMo considered it over and over before deciding to go outside again.</p><br/><p>He discovered that Dong Zhou\u2019s people used the quality of the clothes to determine whether or not someone was an outsider. Since it was like this, as long as he and Ling Xiao changed into the same clothing as them, they wouldn\u2019t be found out for a while.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, You XiaoMo had taken into consideration that the people who came to HaoLai Inn had problems, so he left the Metal Swallowing Beast behind to keep watch. As soon as the innkeeper did something unusual and didn\u2019t return, then You XiaoMo wouldn\u2019t have to be polite to them anymore.</p><br/><p>Downstairs, the innkeeper learned that he was leaving, and he said, \u201cSir, this is your first time at JiJiu Town, so you aren\u2019t very familiar with the situation here. Perhaps it might be better to ask an assistant to show you around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d You XiaoMo resolutely rejected him. Even though he wasn\u2019t leaving, he still had no interest in being followed by these disgusting fellows.</p><br/><p>When the innkeeper saw that he refused, he couldn\u2019t just force him either, in order to avoid being disliked.</p><br/><p>Once he left, only then did the assistant walk over. \u201cInnkeeper, it can\u2019t be that he wants to run away, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The innkeeper knocked him on the head. \u201cThis big dumb head of yours. His companion is still in the inn, do you think he\u2019ll just leave behind his companion and go off by himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d the assistant muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you muttering about, shouldn\u2019t you go and do work!\u201d The innkeeper\u2019s eyebrows furrowed downwards.</p><br/><p>The assistant instantly ran away.</p><br/><p>It took quite a bit of effort before You XiaoMo found JiJiu Town\u2019s tailor shop. Originally, he wanted to ask for directions so he could maybe find it faster, but before he could even get close, the people on the street would quickly flash away as if he carried the plague. Thus, his opinion of JiJiu Town\u2019s people worsened even more, and he kept feeling as if this was a cannibalistic town.</p><br/><p>The owner of the tailor shop was a proprietress, middle-aged but still attractive.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo went through several streets before finding this shop. It seemed that there was only this one tailor shop in all of JiJiu Town.</p><br/><p>There were five or six guests in the store, and the proprietress and her assistants were all busy tending to the customers. At first, he thought that nobody would pay attention to him, but the proprietress suddenly abandoned her guest and walked towards him, swaying her large hips.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, this Young Master is very unfamiliar. This must be your first time coming to my tailor shop, is that right? What kind of pattern would you like? I have anything you want here, and plus, my tailor shop is the only one of its kind in all of JiJiu Town. If it doesn\u2019t suit your tastes, there won\u2019t be another shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>The proprietress liked these outsiders the most, because it meant that she could extort a large sum of money from them. This was already a tacit assumption in JiJiu Town.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced around him and discovered that although the quality of the clothes was no good, there were all sorts of patterns available. He saw that the customers in the store were all picking the good patterns. It seemed that it was natural for everyone to like things that looked good.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his own requirements approximately.</p><br/><p>The proprietress instantly pulled out several ready-made outfits. Even though the patterns were nice, the craftsmanship was a little crude, and you could still tell that it was a low-quality good.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo selected a blue set of clothing that was passably acceptable. The white set was for Ling Xiao to wear, and then he asked the proprietress to ring up the bill.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, the two sets of clothing that you chose are the two finest ones in my shop, regarding both their quality and pattern, so I\u2019ll go a little lower on the price for these two sets just for you. Five hundred spirit gems per set will be enough.\u201d The proprietress\u2019 smile was brilliant, and she spoke as if it was the truth, but everyone knew that she was just swindling him.</p><br/><p>When the other customers in the shop heard this, they all looked over with eyes that carried a hint of pleasure at You XiaoMo\u2019s misfortune. In reality, the actual price of one set of clothing wasn\u2019t even ten spirit gems, and that price could still be considered high. The main reason for this was because the pattern looked nice.</p><br/><p>Every outsider who came to the proprietress\u2019 tailor shop to buy clothes was screwed over by the proprietress, without exception. But there were some who lost more spirit gems than others, and this was because the proprietress was someone who was very good at reading people. She could tell if you were poor or rich with one glance at the quality of your clothing.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was nothing to be said about the quality of You XiaoMo\u2019s clothing, so the sharp-eyed proprietress could tell with one glance that he was a spendthrift with a lot of money.</p><br/><p>If one didn\u2019t rip off a spendthrift, then they were an idiot!</p><br/><p>So the moment he asked about the price, the proprietress instantly started running her mouth like a train. Moreover, she seemed to be very adept at spewing nonsense.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew from the beginning that the proprietress would rip him off, but he hadn\u2019t imagined that it would be this much. Just now, he happened to see a customer paying the bill. One set of clothing was only five or six spirit gems; this was ripping him off almost one hundred times the original price, and he burned with anger.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t release his anger. Instead, he looked at the proprietress and smiled. \u201cProprietress, do you mind saying that one more time?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a powerful aura instantly exploded out from within him.</p><br/><p>The small proprietress was immediately caught full force by this blast and was attacked directly by this aura until both of her knees went soft. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she happened to be standing next to the counter, she would have directly kneeled down.</p><br/><p>Everyone else\u2019s expressions changed as well.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had calculated the strength of the people of JiJiu Town, and he didn\u2019t release the full pressure of a rainbow level mage. He suppressed his cultivation base to be just around the Star Realm level, but it was already enough to shock them based just on this.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a step forward and spoke again. \u201cProprietress, exactly how many spirit gems do two sets of clothing cost? I\u2019m still in a hurry to go back!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

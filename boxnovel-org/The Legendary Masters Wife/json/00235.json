After validating each and every inspection doors, they had spent almost half an hour to walk to the front gates of the academy. After entering the front gate, there is an extremely long passageway, the passageway slates are all constructed out of precious crystals, the surface gives off a thin layer of spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked up and couldn\u2019t help but become speechless, this passageway is at least more than a thousand metres long, its width is also close to a hundred metres and the entire thing is actually made out of crystals containing spiritual energy. One can tell DaoXin Academy spends money very extravagantly.</p><br/><p>Passing through the crystal passageway, they start to part ways with the Block One students and turn to the left.</p><br/><p>With much curiosity, You XiaoMo follows the crowd and enters the area that everyone will be living in the future.</p><br/><p>This place is almost like it\u2019s a huge sunken region that\u2019s entrapped in the mountain, very much like an enormous bowl shape. Standing at the end of the passageway, You XiaoMo can easily see the buildings standing in great numbers inside the \u2018bowl\u2019. He\u2019s clearly standing at a high altitude yet he can\u2019t see the end of the buildings.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi turns her head around, looks at them and says, \u201cAll the new students pay attention, from today onwards you guys are a member of DaoXin Academy. This place shall be where you live in the future. Be sure to remember that the academy has it\u2019s own rules, since you have become a member of the academy, then you have to follow the academy\u2019s rules. I don\u2019t care whether you have some kind of prominent identity outside. Everyone is equal here, if you dare to challenge the academy\u2019s authority or ignore the academy\u2019s rules, then a small consequence will be punishment, a heavy consequence will be eviction from the academy. If you understand then come with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>No one dares to have an objection, You XiaoMo also silently follows behind everyone.</p><br/><p>He got a glimpse of a bit of DaoXin Academy\u2019s thousand years of history through the jade drive. In these thousands of years, the academy has produced many strong people and is also overseen by many strong people, as a result it\u2019s a peak that even the four big families of Yan City won\u2019t dare to easily lay a finger on.</p><br/><p>Young genius ladies like Teng ZiXin whom, although has quite a famous master and the entire Teng Family to back her up, even she won\u2019t dare to be unbridled inside DaoXin Academy.</p><br/><p>After half an hour, Ning Jing DaoShi takes them to their dormitory.</p><br/><p>Because they are new students, so the first stop is the ward B, at this point in time the place they are at is the dormitory area of the ward B.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had thought that the dorm conditions wouldn\u2019t be too bad, to his surprise the situation was very much out of his expectations. It looks like a dangerous premises from the outside, it\u2019s even four people per room.</p><br/><p>If it\u2019s really going to be four people per room, he\u2019ll have to be cautious whenever he does anything in the future.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo furrows his eyebrows, not knowing if there\u2019s anything else with better conditions.</p><br/><p>Just as he\u2019s thinking along this line of thought, it\u2019s as if Ning Jing DaoShi guessed everyone\u2019s doubts and starts to explain the residence situation to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe there are a few people who don\u2019t like the rooms here.\u201d Ning Jing DaoShi especially looks at Teng ZiXin\u2019s group of people when she says this sentence, as expected they\u2019re also furrowing their brows, she then continues, \u201cBut as you have seen, the dorm conditions for any new student who has just entered DaoXin Academy is the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>A new student asks, \u201cDaoShi, other than rooms that are four people per room, are there any single rooms?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi\u2019s pair of beautiful eyes scans over each and every person, but when she sees You XiaoMo, she pauses very subtly and a smile flashes in her eyes at the same time. Looking at him with his brows tightly knit together, she knows that he also doesn\u2019t like this kind of residence condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there is, in front of you is the dormitory with the poorest conditions in ward B. If you want something better, you have to go earn some points, then use those points you earn and make a purchase. In a moment I will give every one of you a black card, the black card stores the point you earn. I will explain the specifics to you later, now we will start to allocate rooms,\u201d says Ning Jing DaoShi.</p><br/><p>Although DaoXin Academy\u2019s academic atmosphere is not one of restriction, men and women still don\u2019t mix together.</p><br/><p>This kind of situation will usually generate the problem of a room that doesn\u2019t have four people, such as Teng ZiXin.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin is actually a very arrogant women, and it just so happens that there\u2019s not many female mages, when the total number is divided by four there\u2019s still two left. She takes the initiative and asks Ning Jing DaoShi, thus she ends up sharing a room together with one other female mage.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had wanted to follow suit, but his luck wasn\u2019t good, the number of people was perfectly divisible.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi says, \u201cBaiLi XiaoYu, Tong YueXu, You XiaoMo, ChaiJun, you four will live in one room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi pushes open a wooden door, sunlight follows the open door and shines inside, lighting up the room making the inside situation clear as day. Four stone beds and a few essential living items, very simple and crude.</p><br/><p>As soon as You XiaoMo hears Chai Jun\u2019s name, he looks towards ChaiJun like he\u2019s seen a ghost, the latter also has an unhappy expression, as if he detected the other\u2019s gaze, Chai Jun angrily stares back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at, do you think I, a young master, appreciates living in the same room as you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo screws his brows together, he\u2019s gonna die, they actually want him to room with this annoying thing, this ChaiJun fellow\u2019s heart is as small as his asshole, he doesn\u2019t appreciate it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoShi, can I not room with him?\u201d You XiaoMo looks towards Ning Jing DaoShi.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi furrows her brows, she didn\u2019t think that the first person to demand such a thing would be You XiaoMo. Putting the outstanding new students together in one room is actually the academy\u2019s tradition, mainly to make it convenient for observation. But it\u2019s not like they can\u2019t be separated, for some outstanding students, the academy can consider their demands.</p><br/><p>But before Ning Jing DaoShi speaks, Chai Jun is like someone who just stepped on an echidna and viciously glares at You XiaoMo before saying, \u201cNing Jing DaoShi, I also don\u2019t want to room with You XiaoMo, I demand that he is transferred and replaced with someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi has a bit of a headache, she just knew that this sort of situation would occur.</p><br/><p>Just then, BaiLi XiaoYu also steps out and entreatingly says, \u201cDaoShi, you can approve of their demands but I want to be in the same room as XiaoMo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu says, \u201cNing Jing DaoShi, since they\u2019re all putting forward demands, why don\u2019t you move Chai Jun somewhere else and replace him with another person. This way you can have the best of two worlds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Jing DaoShi has no choice but to nod her head, \u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Chai Jun\u2019s eyes become wide open instantly, his complexion goes from green to pale white and is unusually troubled.</p><br/><p>His original intention was to shoo You XiaoMo away, as for BaiLi XiaoYu and Tong YueXu, he actually earnestly wished to room with them. This way he could use this chance and deepen their relationship, if it\u2019s possible to work together with the BaiLi Family and the Tong Family, then it would only benefit the Chai Family.</p><br/><p>But these two actually lean towards You XiaoMo\u2019s side and took the initiative to suggest that he be sent away, this result isn\u2019t what he wants.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoShi\u2026,\u201d Chai Jun wants to save himself but he\u2019s too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do that, Chai Jun, you can switch with Jiang XiaoFeng,\u201d Ning Jing DaoShi instantly makes a decision.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, it\u2019s already impossible for ChaiJun to go back on his words, because he had already laid a dead end for himself, if he wants to go back on his words this time, other people will think that he goes looking for trouble for fun, deliberately creating a disturbance.</p><br/><p>After allocating rooms, the person who Ning Jing DaoShi sent to retrieve the black cards came back and gave everyone a black card.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo holds the black card and looks at it curiously, the black card is naturally black in colour, a red number \u201910\u2019 appears before his eyes, he\u2019s taken back for a second but can faintly guess what this number represents.</p><br/><p>As expected, a short while later he hears Ning Jing DaoShi explain, \u201cThe black card that you guys are holding in your hands now is the item that I just told you guys before. The number on the black card is your point, every new student who just entered DaoXin Academy can get ten points. In the future, you can get thirty points every month. This black card is equal to your pass here in DaoXin Academy, you have to use it to enter and exit many places so be sure to put it somewhere safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also another thing, DaoXin Academy\u2019s has three types all together, these are the black card, the purple card and the red card respectively. The black card is the one you now have in your hands, it is the one with the lowest level and it\u2019s level of authority is quite low. If you guys want to change to a purple card or a red card then please go ahead and work hard to earn some points to exchange for one. If you can get a purple card then you can get 40p from the academy every month, the red card is 50p.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoShi, how do you earn points?\u201d a new student asks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWard B has all sorts of ways to earn points, if I explain in detail here it\u2019ll be a bit troublesome. I will explain it to you guys once tomorrow, but everyone can use the time now to go ask around yourselves. The people who want to change to a single room should take action immediately,\u201d Ning Jing DaoShi smiles.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s rare to see DaoShi use this kind of tone to speak, the new students\u2019 nervous mood instantly eases quite a bit.</p><br/><p>After solving another bunch of questions from everyone, Ning Jing DaoShi finally leaves.</p><br/><p>Looking at the back figure of NingJing DaoShi leaving, You XiaoMo is thinking about the practicability of her last sentence.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu is already too impatient to wait any longer, he hurriedly walks over, grabs his arm and drags him inside the room, \u201cXiaoMo XiaoMo, let\u2019s go inside and look at the new room.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiles, it\u2019s clearly just an old room.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

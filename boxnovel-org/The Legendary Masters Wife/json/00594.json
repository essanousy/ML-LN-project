When he appeared, he was already behind the cloaked man. Although Ling Xiao had internal injuries, it had no effect on his speed.</p><br/><p>His slender and incisive legs swept towards the back of the cloaked man like a whirlwind. The latter had not expected him to attack suddenly, or maybe he had misjudged Ling Xiao\u2019s strength. This was because the information he got said that Ling Xiao had advanced to a Sacred Realm expert not long ago. No matter how high his potential was, he could not have advanced by four stars in just one year.</p><br/><p>It was this idea that made him belittle the enemy, who now taught him a profound lesson. The cloaked man only had time to block Ling Xiao\u2019s attack with his hands, but it only served as a minor buffer and the kick landed firmly on his back.</p><br/><p>A full-powered attack of a Sacred Realm expert was not to be underestimated. The cloaked man quickly increased the distance between them. The qi and blood in his body churned and he could not help but spit out a mouthful of blood, the blood spread out in a halo in the sea.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin suddenly blocked his path as soon as MoQi XiYuan was about to step forward.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan was puzzled and raised his eyebrows, \u201cHoly maiden, what do you mean by this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was different from the cloaked man. He felt that something was strange about Xia Yin and Ling Xiao\u2019s dialogue, but he did not think deeply over it as Ling Xiao had launched a sudden attack on the cloaked man. Now that Xia Yin had blocked him, the doubts in his heart grew.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin laughed softly, \u201cChief MoQi, don\u2019t you think this is an opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief MoQi should know what I mean. The Black Spider is not good a partner to cooperate with. They may stab us in the back at any time. Why not wait until both sides have suffered great losses before making a move?\u201d Ling Xiao had blackmail over Xia Yin, but she would not compromise if there was a glimmer of hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe independent dimension\u2026\u201d MoQi XiYuan\u2019s desire was aroused as he listened, but this did not mean that he would take immediate action. Some things had to be distributed well in advance for one to rest assured.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin replied, \u201cThe independent dimension is not the only treasure left by the White Tiger, moreover, it is not appropriate to discuss this at the moment. Let\u2019s do it like this. We will negotiate again after this matter is resolved. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan hesitated.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin knew that he would not make up his mind if she didn\u2019t bring out a bargaining chip that could tempt him. In any case, she would have to look for him sooner or later, it made no difference whether she explained it clearly now or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief MoQi\u2026\u201d Xia Yin\u2019s mouth was opening and closing but she did not make a sound.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan was so shocked when he heard the latter part of her words that he did not restrain his expression in time. Fortunately, the cloaked man was still being tangled up with Ling Xiao and had no time to pay attention to the situation on this side.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief MoQi, you can think about this. You are a wise man. My proposal contains only benefits for the ShuiXi Tribe. You should understand the current situation of the ShuiXi Tribe. Mo Ma\u2019s actions against the ShuiXi Tribe are becoming more and more brazen. In the near future, he will probably initiate a war between the two tribes. I don\u2019t have much time, so I hope that you can give me an answer as soon as possible. \u201d Xia Yin said.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan fell silent for quite a while, \u201cAll right, I will give you an answer as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the side room, Ling Xiao\u2019s surprise attack on the cloaked man was successful, and the cloaked man grew more and more annoyed. At the same time, he was shocked by Ling Xiao\u2019s cultivation base. He did not know what method Ling Xiao had used for him to have advanced by three to four stars in such a short time. If he kept up with this speed, Ling Xiao would probably catch up with his Master in a short time.</p><br/><p>The cloaked man thought it was necessary to tell his Master this news. Otherwise, it would be more difficult to kill him when he grew up to the level of the Master. Anyone who threatened them must be killed in the cradle. This was the purpose of the Black Spider. They were fully aware of the principle that \u2018nurturing a tiger invites calamity\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cXia Yin, MoQi XiYuan, you are still not making a move?\u201d The cloaked man saw that the two seemed to want to sit on the sidelines and watch the tigers fight. He could not help shouting at them resentfully. Unexpectedly, they still had not moved.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the cloaked man immediately guessed their intentions.</p><br/><p>The Black Spider had always been the one stabbing people in the back, but this time the tables were turned on them. This kind of feeling put him in a rather bad mood. He was also one of the strongest experts in the Black Spider. There was none who dared not fear him besides the people who ranked higher than him, but now he had been continuously humiliated here.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem to have been left high and dry. What do you plan to do next?\u201d The corner of Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes lifted, and there was obvious mockery in his eyes. Just like what had happened before, there was the same contemptuous look in his eyes. Perhaps the cloaked man did not think that his situation would be reversed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to kill me? You still don\u2019t have this capability!\u201d The cloaked man coldly snorted, \u201cOthers may not know this, but I know very well that your internal injury has not healed, and you\u2019re simply unable to exhibit your former strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yin and MoQi XiYuan showed traces of astonishment on their faces. They both looked at Ling Xiao at the same time. If what the cloaked man said was true, their odds of success would be even greater.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, they did not immediately believe the cloaked man\u2019s words, because Ling Xiao did not seem like he was suffering from an internal injury. It was likely that the cloaked man had set a trap in order to incite them into making a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you test it out whether I have the capability or not?\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, Ling Xiao\u2019s figure disappeared again.</p><br/><p>This time, the cloaked man responded quickly and smashed a fist in a certain direction without the slightest hesitation. The strength of his fist was so shocking that it split the sea in half, and his momentum was extremely large.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s figure appeared in that direction, yet he did not make a single movement. The cloaked man\u2019s fist suddenly diverted from its path when it was only three or four meters away from him, before landing more than twenty meters behind his left, causing the seawater to burst apart in an instant.</p><br/><p>The cloaked man\u2019s pupil suddenly contracted.</p><br/><p>Not only he, but Xia Yin and MoQi XiYuan were also somewhat startled. They did not see any big movements from Ling Xiao at all. Based off the strength of the cloaked man, it was impossible to neutralize his strength so easily.</p><br/><p>What they did not know was that Ling Xiao had the bloodline of the Black Tortoise within his body. Although the Black Tortoise was not a demon beast with a water attribute, they had lived in the Living Waters River Boundary for many generations. Their ability to manipulate water was definitely one of the best even if it was not a good as the White Tiger. Many of his inherited memories concerned methods on how to flexibly control water.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the water around the cloaked man became turbulent as if it was following the occasion.</p><br/><p>The cloaked man was frightened and wanted to run away immediately, but he was one step too late. It was as if his four limbs had been tightly constricted by an invisible python. He made a small movement and actually found that he could not break free.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ling Xiao quickly adopted a pose for drawing a bow. The seawater formed a bow in his left hand, and his right hand was holding the fletching of an arrow that was completely made up of purple and red flames, with the tip pointing at the cloaked man.</p><br/><p>The shadow of death shrouded the head of the cloaked man.</p><br/><p>Impossible. It was impossible for him to lose to someone he looked down upon.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, he finally understood why the Master asked him not to belittle Ling Xiao. His current situation was the price for belittling the enemy, which was likely to cost him his life.</p><br/><p>The cloaked man struggled hard, and he felt that the things that were confining him were starting to loosen. He just needed a little more time\u2026</p><br/><p>But would Ling Xiao give it to him?</p><br/><p>That was obviously impossible. The flame arrow in his hand shot out. Because of the obstruction of the sea water, the distance that it could normally cover in less than one second took one-point-five seconds before it penetrated the cloaked man\u2019s shoulder. As the cloaked man had managed to struggle free from the invisible python that imprisoned him at the last moment, the trajectory of the arrow that should have pierced his heart hit his shoulder instead.</p><br/><p>But even so, the cloaked man could not be at ease.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s flames were a special type of Godfire, which had the power of devouring. Only when one had experienced it personally could one know how painful it was.</p><br/><p>The cloaked man endured the heart-tearing, lung-splitting pain with great difficulty. After stabilizing his posture, he staked the last of his strength to flee this place resentfully. He was seriously injured and staying behind would only lead to his death. He had already lost the qualifications to fight for the independent dimension and the Water Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>The reason he suffered a defeat this time was mainly because he underestimated the enemy and definitely not because his strength was inferior to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin and MoQi XiYuan looked at each other in dismay and saw the astonishment in the other\u2019s eyes. They would be fools is they believed in the cloaked man\u2019s words after that kind of performance by Ling Xiao. However, they were unwilling to give up on the independent dimension too. Furthermore, they had two people on their side and would not be at a disadvantage if they went up against Ling Xiao who was alone.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, their subordinates finally arrived.</p><br/><p>The one to take the lead was the man surnamed Fu. He rushed over and opened his mouth as if he were going to shout MoQi XiYuan\u2019s name, before he caught a glimpse of Ling Xiao\u2019s figure in the corner of his eye.</p><br/><p>Previously, he was going too fast, so he did not see the front view of Ling Xiao\u2019s face. At this time, Ling Xiao\u2019s face practically appeared in front of him. The man surnamed Fu stumbled. Fortunately, he was able to stabilize himself in time, otherwise he would fallen in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>His strange state attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had recognized him long ago, it was just that he did not have any reaction. Now when he saw him, Ling Xiao could not help revealing a strange smile on his handsome face.</p><br/><p>MoQi XiYuan silently thought \u2018not good\u2019, he assumed that Ling Xiao was going to attack Fu ZiLin and he hastily used his body to shield him. However, contrary to his expectations, Ling Xiao disappeared instead. He actually made a reckless move and crushed a teleportation talisman?</p><br/><p>Xia Yin also did not respond in time.</p><br/><p>This \u2018hand of God\u2019 move unexpectedly succeeded as she and MoQi XiYuan did not expect him to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbstruck upon witnessing this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was a massive room, filled with brownish red colored bookshelves which were in turn packed with files.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but sigh in awe at seeing this. However, he wasn\u2019t surprised by the size of the archives room, since the Dao Xun Academy\u2019s library was two, three times the size of this. What truly awed him was the countless files. From this, it was clear how much history the Thunderclap Academy had.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked over and cuffed him around the head. \u201cStop staring.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo clutched his head, chagrined, and followed the other inside.</p><br/><p>The two entered through the entrance. Though there was a lot of files here, they were very well organised. The people who worked here sorted them by year, then by the age of the students that year.</p><br/><p>The incident had occurred ten years ago, which was the year 20XX.</p><br/><p>The two continued inside. As they did, they were met with several obstacles, but the two ignored them. It didn\u2019t take them long to find the files for 20XX. The side of the bookcase had the number of students for this year noted there. Three grades of students totalled at over three thousand.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao split up the work between them. He was in charge of looking through the grade one students because of the three grades, grade one had the most victims, equal to the total for grades two and three. He had already memorized their names and appearance.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo read extremely fast, going along the shelves of files rapidly and taking out a file every now and then. Some that had the same name were also pulled out, just in case. It didn\u2019t take long for him to finish. He thought he was first to finish, but then his mouth twitched when turned to see Ling Xiao sitting at a desk and reading through a file, one leg over the other.</p><br/><p>Just as he walked over, Ling Xiao handed him a file. \u201cThis is the file for that incident. The students in there are the same as the file Johnson handed us.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo accepted the file and skimmed over it. \u201cCould it be that our guess really was wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Ling Xiao gazed at him, seeing his disappointed expression and smirking at him. \u201cThough our guess was wrong, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we came to the wrong place.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao supported himself on the table with his elbows, chin in his hands as he calmly analyzed, \u201cLet\u2019s say that the Thunderclap Academy and Johnson\u2019s files are both complete, then perhaps the person who has something to do with the You Family is among these students.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s expression turned excited. \u201cI get it now. Are you trying to say that this person might\u2019ve changed their name? If they did and entered the school with a changed name, then it\u2019s natural that we wouldn\u2019t be able to find them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also possible that their surname isn\u2019t even You in the first place. Didn\u2019t you say before that some children won\u2019t have the surnames of their parents?\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t give him a certain answer, because he didn\u2019t know what it was in the end either.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s start searching.\u201d You XiaoMo revived instantly, fully recharged.</p><br/><p>Thunderclap Academy was a big university, and they were very strict on rules. Students might be able to change their names, but they couldn\u2019t fake their information.</p><br/><p>He Ping hadn\u2019t killed these students inside the Thunderclap Academy, otherwise there would be no way he would be able to succeed with his level of skill.</p><br/><p>These students were killed while on missions outside. Every year, the Thunderclap Academy would arrange some missions for the students to undertake. First, to prepare them and give them experience, second to facilitate friendship between the three grades, so the missions would usually be assigned to groups of students of mixed grades.</p><br/><p>The killed students were very misfortunate, because He Ping had some spiritual problems. In modern terms, he was mentally ill.</p><br/><p>Though He Ping was a teacher of the Thunderclap Academy, he was a very gloomy person. In school, not only did the students not like him, but his colleagues ostracized him as well. In the end, his mental illness worsened. In the world of cultivation, cultivation, this was an omen of one\u2019s spiritual energy going into discord.</p><br/><p>Ten years ago, He Ping\u2019s issues reached a peak.</p><br/><p>Since his spiritual energy was going into discord, he was temporarily suspended.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, those students were on a mission near his home. The battle attracted him, and He Ping, already in a discordant state, saw these students away from the safety of their school and was unable to suppress the malice in him any longer. Thus, he killed all eleven of the students.</p><br/><p>At this point, You XiaoMo suddenly sucked in a breath.</p><br/><p>Noticing this, Ling Xiao raised his head to see him with his mouth opened in surprise and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s finger pointed at a certain point on the files, trembling.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao came over and glanced at it. \u201cThey were killed at the RongHua Complex. It\u2019s where He Ping lived. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said tearily. \u201cIn my last life, I lived in RongHua Complex as well, and the day of the accident is the same day they were killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao fell silent. Should you call this a huge coincidence, or an act of fate?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I have a theory.\u201d You XiaoMo said to Ling Xiao, his expression shockingly calm. Usually, he would\u2019ve jumped up by now.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded. \u201cI agree with your theory.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo kicked him in the shin. \u201cI haven\u2019t even told you my theory yet. How do you know it\u2019s the same as yours? Usually you\u2019re always saying I\u2019m stupid. You should insult me and call me an idiot at a time like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lifted his leg, looking back at the other and saying, \u201cBut I\u2019ve also complimented you and said you were smart as well. I have to admit that sometimes you really are quite smart, like now. I haven\u2019t even said anything and you\u2019ve already gotten it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you say I\u2019m hopeless this time,\u201d You XiaoMo grumbled.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao helplessly said, \u201cFine then. From a certain point of view, you really are hopelessly stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt melancholy. \u201cBut that day I really did smell gas, and there really was an explosion. Perhaps it was just an accident. I couldn\u2019t possibly be that person.\u201d After being angry with himself for a while, he glanced at Ling Xiao. \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d Suddenly finding out that he had been killed, not by an explosion caused by a gas leak, but because he was unfortunate enough to get caught up in a battle, he felt terrible.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should ask yourself what you should do next!\u201d Ling Xiao tossed the question back at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo contemplated for a while before deciding, \u201cI still want to go and see them.\u201d His goal of coming here was to go and see his family, and find out of the You Family was the You Clan. That was secondary though. The TongTian Continent was very peaceful now, so this issue wasn\u2019t very important anymore.</p><br/><p>He just wanted to know how his family was doing!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go and see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, they went to the capital to gather information on the You Family. That was when they found out that the You Family was famous in the capital. However, they weren\u2019t officials in the capital, but entrepreneurs.</p><br/><p>This had You XiaoMo letting out a breath of relief because in his memory, the You Family didn\u2019t have any members that took the government route. This meant that the You Family was still that same You Family from his memory. Apart from concealing the fact that they were cultivators, they hadn\u2019t concealed anything else from him.</p><br/><p>However, the You Family\u2019s position in the capital really was very high. They might not have a background with the government, but they were a top tier powerhouse family, especially in the most recent ten years. You Lu and You Bo continued to shine, pushing the You Family to new heights. However, the real reason they commanded so much respect and gear was because they were a cultivator family, and no ordinary cultivator family either.</p><br/><p>Now You XiaoMo understood why the vice principal of the academy had made an envious expression when You Bo gifted them two magic pills. It wasn\u2019t without reason.</p><br/><p>Apart from having extremely powerful experts, another reason the You Clan was so powerful in ancient times was because of their famous family mage lineage.</p><br/><p>The You Family here had clearly inherited the You Clan\u2019s talents as well. Though there were much fewer pill recipes passed down, it was far better than those clans with very few mages that could only refine low level pills, and the rare mid level pill.</p><br/><p>That vice principal was so envious of them because the You Family was one of two families in the capital that could refine mid and high level pills. The other family was the You Family\u2019s archrivals, the Song Family. They had some high level mages too, but they had less pill recipes, so many high ranking officials in the capital all wanted to get on the You Family\u2019s good side.</p><br/><p>The You Family\u2019s reputation in the cultivation world was built long ago.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s expression was conflicted. The You Family had only really shone in the capital after he died. Before that, they had kept a low profile. As expected, they had been keeping secrets from him. It was just that he didn\u2019t understand why You Bo and the others kept this from him. Could it be because he was a normal person? But that wasn\u2019t right. He was mage right now. Unless it was like Ling Xiao said\u2026 he was adopted?</p><br/><p>At this, You XiaoMo\u2019s spirits plummeted.</p><br/><p>He was definitely adopted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear wife, even if you were adopted\u2026\u201d Ling Xiao seemed to want to comfort him, but he didn\u2019t get to finish before You XiaoMo grabbed him around the neck with one arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, you! This is all your fault. Now even I\u2019m starting to think that I was adopted, wuu\u2026\u201d Lady You, who had managed to gain this rare upperhand, was now looking like a bullied rabbit, eyes red and tears welling up.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hugged his head. \u201cMy dear wife, if you want to cry then cry as much as you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo burst into tears. This guy didn\u2019t even comfort him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

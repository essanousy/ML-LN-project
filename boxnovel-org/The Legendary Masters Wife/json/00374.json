However, he did not have the slightest reaction at all, and instead, started asking about Qiu Ran.</p><br/><p>If You XiaoMo was here, he would definitely be able to tell that Duan QiTian\u2019s entire personality had changed after he came out of secluded cultivation. In the past, You XiaoMo would still be able to tell his moods, but it was somewhat hard to tell now that he was more reserved.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis lifebound contract beast, Hong Yun, saved his life. But it\u2019s absolutely impossible for him to completely recover after two consecutive serious injuries this time. He probably wouldn\u2019t show up again in the next few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who replied was the Second Elder, as he was the one guarding the hidden thirty-first room in the Red card area, and Duan QiTian had been in secluded cultivation all this while inside this hidden room.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian struck the table as he muttered to himself, \u201cIf it\u2019s like this, wouldn\u2019t it be very difficult if I want to find him later?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Second Elder sighed, \u201cThis can\u2019t be helped. The Long Xiang Continent is so huge. It\u2019s generally quite difficult to find a level ten mage who is deliberately hiding. Oh yes, have you heard about the matter with your disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian, \u201cAre you talking about that dunce?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Second Elder discovered that Duan QiTian\u2019s temper was always very spirited in the past when he would scold using this word, \u201cdunce\u201d. It was unlike the present, where there was completely no expression on his face when scolding people. It looked like the results of cultivating these few months in the hidden room were quite good, but it is possible that Duan QiTian may have overdone it a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your third disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still remember that Divine Realm practitioner that appeared in the Boundless Sea? He\u2019s the Ling Xiao who is always with your little disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think it\u2019s him.\u201d Duan QiTian narrowed his eyes. Although he had always felt that that man was a little strange, he had never thought that Ling Xiao was actually a Divine Realm expert who had been residing inside DaoXin Academy all along.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine right? Who knows what his motive is.\u201d The Second Elder questioned in concern. The principal was currently out of the academy. If he really harbored harmful motives towards DaoXin Academy, they would not be able to stop him with their current strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry that he will harm DaoXin Academy.\u201d Duan QiTian had seen through his thoughts in a single glance, \u201cIf he had such motives, he would have made a move long ago. Is there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I have discussed with the Great Elder to prepare to let you negotiate with him. You are You XiaoMo\u2019s shifu and I believe that he would give you some face.\u201d The Second Elder immediately explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, if there\u2019s nothing else\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going now.\u201d The Second Elder took the initiative to leave before he was chased away. Though there were a few changes, his innate character still had not changed.</p><br/><p>When the incident involving You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao swept over the North, no one within DaoXin Academy even had the leisure to gossip as there were demon beasts bursting through Ward A every day since the barrier had been destroyed. So as to resist the demon beasts from the mountains, everyone had to run to the frontlines to help. Currently, the entire Ward A was so busy that they were beaten black and blue.</p><br/><p>However, there was still a clear change.</p><br/><p>There were now more people peeping at them. In the past, those people would be gossiping in front of them, but they did not dare to do so now, and would only converse far away from them.</p><br/><p>Each and every one of those who had grudges with You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao seemed to have disappeared off the face of the earth.</p><br/><p>For example, Tang YuCheng and Chai Zheng. Many people who didn\u2019t like them popped out now, mocking the two.<b></b>You XiaoMo had not thought about them for a long time. They had already tasted defeated at his hands. If he continually thought of them, would he not be dragging himself down to their level?</p><br/><p>They had a few relatively quiet days after that.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had been meditating in the room to transform Chen QingEr and the others cultivation bases into his own.</p><br/><p>There were many that made an excuse to find You XiaoMo for the purpose of catching a glimpse of Ling Xiao, fooling them to kill some time was fun enough for You XiaoMo. However, he had expected that the first who would knock on his door would be the old geezer instead of Yin Ge.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately thought of Feng ChiYun upon seeing Yin Ge and felt depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you guys be going to the Higher Level Realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you rescue Feng ChiYun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I will go with you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCertainly\u2026eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuXuan and I were originally from the Higher Level Realm. We had to come to the Middle Level Realm because of some circumstances. If you want to know anything, I will tell you everything I know about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was still a little surprised to know that they were from the Higher Level Realm. It seemed that everything that happened recently had some connection to the Higher Level Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you hold half the bloodline of a demon beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Ge fell silent, \u201cThat\u2019s right. My father is the Nine-Headed Serpent King, and my mother is a human practitioner. Due to some internal problems, I had no choice but to come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that the Heavens sprinkled some dog-blood drama in front of him again. It was definitely due to some issue like the bloodline not being pure enough or so on and so forth. However, the Nine-Headed Serpent King was not an ordinary demon beast. The Nine-Headed Serpent King was like the Four Ancients Clan, they were born as ruler. Their position was extremely lofty among the demon beasts.</p><br/><p><strong>t/n: dog-blood means melodramatic, contrived.</strong></p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cI don\u2019t know when we will set off. It\u2019ll depend on Ling Xiao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Ge, \u201cThen I\u2019ll trouble you to speak with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending Yin Ge off, You XiaoMo walked into the bedroom to take a look at Ling Xiao\u2019s situation. It appeared that the cultivation bases of three Emperor Realm practitioners were not easy to digest.</p><br/><p>Over the past few days, he learned from others what had happened during the period he was unconscious, and the whole battle sounded just entirely one-sided. However, You XiaoMo could not shake the feeling that there was some problem with Qilin that swallowed Chen QingEr and the two others. Otherwise, it was impossible for Ling Xiao to be sitting still on the bed for several days in a row.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo worriedly looked at Ling Xiao who had his eyes closed.</p><br/><p>According to Tang YuLin\u2019s description, that person called Yu WenNan did indeed say these two words \u2018blood sacrifice rite \u2018 when Ling Xiao summoned the fire Qilin out.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing something which had both \u201cblood\u201d and \u201csacrifice\u201d within its name definitely did not mean anything good.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you sighing about again?\u201d A hand suddenly clapped on his head and pushed him down until his stature immediately shrank a little. It was with astonishment that he discovered this voice was from Ling Xiao whose eyes had just been closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right now?\u201d You XiaoMo pulled his hand off and happily asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can anything happen to this husband of yours? Or do you hope that something would happen to me?\u201d Ling Xiao unconcernedly stated as he put on his shoes before he came off the bed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo decided not to dispute over these trifles with him, \u201cYin Ge came to look for me. He said that he wanted to go to the Higher Level Realm with us. And he also said that he and Zhan YuXuan both came from the Higher Level Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he wants to follow, let him follow.\u201d Ling Xiao indifferently replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo when are we going to leave for the Higher Level Realm?\u201d He was completely unclear about this aspect of the matter and could only depend on Ling Xiao to make decisions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s find a day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn auspicious day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian came knocking just as the two came to a decision. You XiaoMo really missed the old geezer quite a bit and he also wanted to know how well the old geezer\u2019s soul was recovering. But he did not dare to be too enthusiastic as he did not know whether the first or second personality would appear.</p><br/><p>However, after You XiaoMo saw Duan QiTian, he covertly moved closer to Ling Xiao\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cLing Xiao, do you think that the old geezer has been switched?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe possibility is low.\u201d Ling Xiao told him after observing for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause the look of disdain in his eyes is exactly the same as before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already heard about your situation.\u201d Duan QiTian walked in without leave, and got right to the point without any superfluous words. He was so frank it gave the impression that they were chatting about domestic matters.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo simply did not know how to react to this, but he felt that the old geezer was a little weird today. His expression and voice still had the same terrorizing force, but he was colder than usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cShifu, I did not mean to deliberately conceal it from you.\u201d You XiaoMo quickly apologized.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian immediately glared at him, \u201cI\u2019ll pluck your head off if you did it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blushed with shame. Actually one could also say that he had deliberately concealed it.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian ignored him and shifted his attention to Ling Xiao, \u201cMy disciple is not free for you to kidnap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave an indolent smile, \u201cThen I\u2019m sorry to say that he had already been kidnapped by me before he became your disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian choked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo secretly gave a mental \u2018thumbs-up\u2019 as the tiny him in his heart laughed till its teeth were showing. Ling Xiao was really too cool, to completely defeat the hot-tempered old geezer in one sentence!</p><br/><p>However, could they refrain from using such a word like \u2018kidnap? That just makes him look stupid.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued, \u201cDuan QiTian, don\u2019t push your luck. It\u2019s not because I respect you or the others that I helped DaoXin Academy to seize the Elemental Essence. If not for your little disciple, I couldn\u2019t be bothered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian swelled with so much anger that his mustache puffed up.</p><br/><p>He had another purpose for coming to find them, but he really felt a little unhappy about handing that matter over when seeing this man\u2019s attitude. He could only fiercely glare at his little disciple; it\u2019s all because of your man!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was baffled by his glare.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

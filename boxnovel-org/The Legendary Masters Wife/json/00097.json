This magic pill is what You XiaoMo refined the most during his three month seclusion. He refined about one hundred and fifty pills. Its difficulty is only second to the Reserve energy pill, also a level two magic pill that there can not be enough of. That\u2019s because it can increase the power of a martial artist in a very short time. Its side effect is the loss of power for one hour. Although there is a side effect, it still causes martial artists to rush after it like a flock of ducks.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo refined so many Blue spirit pills because he is preparing to go down the mountain and sell them for money.</p><br/><p>But he still admires Jiang Liu. He already knew long ago that he is an outstanding talent, becoming a level two mage in a short half a year, even able to refine a Blue spirit magic pill. Clearly he is much stronger than the other disciples.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, You XiaoMo smiles and nods at him before handing over the magic pill to the Senior in front of him.</p><br/><p>The Senior takes the magic pill. Its light pink color and luster is very vivid. Used to looking at magic pills with an indifferent look, he is suddenly stunned. His half-closed eyes also widen a little looking in amazement at the young man, saying, \u201cThis Reserve energy magic pill was really refined by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is stupefied by the question. If not me then who? Of course he doesn\u2019t dare to answer this way. After being stunned for a moment, he nods his head, \u201cReplying to Elder. It\u2019s me who refined it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Senior strokes his mottled black and white beard. A satisfied smile appears on his serious face. This smile is quite obvious, appearing on the wrinkled Senior\u2019s face, making him suddenly appear lively. One look and it\u2019s clear that it is a smile from the inside.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu who is standing at the side and even all those watching this scene all feel very surprised.</p><br/><p>Although the assessment only started not long ago and there are still many disciples that have yet to do the test, it is the first time they see the Senior showing such a happy expression. Doesn\u2019t this mean that that disciple called You XiaoMo refined an extraordinary magic pill?</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu bites his lips, looking guardedly at You XiaoMo whose expression remains the same from the beginning to now.</p><br/><p>\u201cReserve energy magic pill. Distilled twice. Low grade magic pill of medium quality. I declare that Earth peak\u2019s disciple You XiaoMo passes the test.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the Senior says this, he returns the magic pill to You XiaoMo and at the same time commends him with a nod saying, \u201cNot bad, continue giving it your best effort. Be sure to guard against rashness and arrogance.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo restrains his excitement, and happily takes the magic pill, \u201cThank you Elder. Disciple will try his best and definitely live up to your expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you all can go back down. Next is the fourth round of assessment. Those numbers that are called, step up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Senior waves his hand lightly. His face becomes serious once again, calling out calmly and expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turns around and is about to walk away when Jiang Liu suddenly says somewhat cynically, \u201cCongratulations Big brother You.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turns around and sees Jiang Liu smiling brilliantly, as if what he felt just now was only his misconception. So he happily says, \u201cI also have to congratulate you Junior brother Jiang. Then I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu looks at his retreating back and slowly loses his brilliant smile. He then turns around and walks back the Heaven peak disciples.</p><br/><p>Returning to the group of people, You XiaoMo is immediately congratulated warmly by all the disciples. Even Kong Wen with his constant serious face, praises him generously with a few words, the smile on his face getting a little deeper making him seem more approachable.</p><br/><p>This disciple did not let him down. It\u2019s not in vain that he made an exception and accepted him as a disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother You, I didn\u2019t expect you to be so awesome. Even refining a Reserve energy magic pill. And distilled twice at that. Even stronger than that disciple Jiang Liu. Really making Earth peak proud.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. But it\u2019s really unexpected that you actually got the Reserve energy magic pill. I remember that the Reserve energy magic pill is the most difficult level two magic pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven\u2019s peak Jiang Liu got the Blue spirit magic pill. Blue spirit magic pill is hard to refine but he took a longer time to refine than Junior brother You. The difficulty is also easier than Junior brother You\u2019s. The both of them finished at about the same time. Looking at it like this, Junior brother You is still the stronger one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe Earth peak finally have this day to walk with our heads held high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you see. Heaven peak people have very black faces <i>yo</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>All sorts of excitable and gloating voices rise up one after another. Usually Kong Wen would definitely not allow them to be so bad mannered. But now, there is no reaction from him at all, as if he can\u2019t hear the voices behind him. This tacit manner causes the disciples to get very worked up, as if having been injected with chicken blood.</p><br/><p>But the more excited they get, the more unsightly the faces of the Heaven peak disciples get on the other side. This is what is called the reversal of the Wheel of fortune!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiles helplessly. He didn\u2019t think that he would be pushed into the limelight like this. At first, he was worried that his speed in refining magic pills is too fast, attracting suspicion. So he deliberately slowed down. That\u2019s why he only finished when the time was almost up.</p><br/><p>As for distilling twice, he thought that the disciples undergoing the assessment will also do this many times. That\u2019s why he gave up on distilling three times. Only now does he realize that he forgot to factor in the time.</p><br/><p>For this assessment, the only requirement is that the disciples refine a live magic pill. As for the quality of the pill, that is only secondary. In other words, no many how times you distill, you will pass as long as it is not a dead magic pill. That\u2019s why most of the disciples would chose to only distill once whether it\u2019s because they are afraid of failing or afraid that they won\u2019t have enough time.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu chose to distill twice because of his over self-confidence. That\u2019s why he almost ran out of time. But he also actually got a little big of fame for that. If it wasn\u2019t for a certain You XiaoMo, he would definitely have been the most outstanding one for this assessment.</p><br/><p>At the entrance, seeing that You XiaoMo is surrounded by his brothers, Ling Xiao curves his lips slightly, turns around, and leaves the Hall of Mages.</p><br/><p>Zhou Peng thought he would go congratulate Little brother. Seeing him turn around and leave, he rushes to catch up, \u201cElder brother, you\u2019re leaving just like that? You\u2019re not going to say a few words to Little brother? I feel that if you were to show up, he would be very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao turns to his side and looks at him ambiguously. He doesn\u2019t think that You XiaoMo would be very happy. That fellow will definitely think that he is there to make him do things that he doesn\u2019t want to do.</p><br/><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter. After all \u2026\u2026. there will be plenty of time for that <i>ah</i>!</p><br/><p>After Ling Xiao leaves, You XiaoMo finally looks up from everyone\u2019s congratulations towards the door. But he doesn\u2019t see the one he wants to see the most. He can\u2019t help but feel a little disappointment bubbling up. Although there are times when he really loathes Ling Xiao, there are also a lot of times when he really wants to share with him the happy times.</p><br/><p>Three hours later, the assessment if finally over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo takes a quick look, fifteen of the twenty four Earth peak disciples pass the test. This number must be pretty good since the smile on Master\u2019s face does not decrease one bit.</p><br/><p>As for Heaven peak and Flying peak, they have nineteen and fourteen respectively. Three peaks have forty eight disciples passing the test altogether.</p><br/><p>This number is a little less than last year\u2019s. But it can\u2019t be helped because budding mages are hard to come by these days. The competition between the large sects are getting fiercer and fiercer. Slow one step and the promising budding mages would be snatched clean.</p><br/><p>But from this You XiaoMo can see the gap between Heaven peak when compared to Flying peak and Earth peak. On the surface, Earth peak and Flying peak are only down by four or five disciples but this also reflects the strength of the three major peaks. Heaven peak is clearly a step above.</p><br/><p>If Heaven peak were to receive the same proportion of disciples each year, then it won\u2019t even take a few years before the number of people in Heaven peak will surpass that of Earth peak and Flying peak by quite a lot. Luckily TianXin sect doesn\u2019t restrict the Elders from going down the mountain and taking in their own disciples. It\u2019s most probably because of this that the three major peaks have somewhat even number of people.</p><br/><p>Upon returning to Earth peak, Kong Wen asks the nine disciples that failed the test to pack up their things and go find Uncle Xiao. Uncle Xiao will make the arrangements for what comes next. Then he lets the rest of the people go except for You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seven <i>ah</i>. Looks like Master has underestimated you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Wen paced around the same spot before suddenly stopping and staring fixedly at You XiaoMo while saying these words.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately starts to drip with cold sweat. These words after all are \u2026\u2026. \u201cActually \u2026\u2026. Master\u2019s teaching is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Wen waves his hand, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say these flattering words to Master. Master is very clear in his heart. After receiving you as a disciple, I tossed you to Elder brother. Master really didn\u2019t undertake any responsibility of being a Master. But Master also has complicated difficulties. Hopefully you will understand. Now that you are an official and rightful disciple, there are a few things that can now be said to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I understand.\u201d I wonder if \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Kong Wen continues speaking, \u201cSeveral thousand years ago, TianXin sect\u2019s size was much much smaller than what it is now. At that time, the strongest one in the whole Mage division was a level four mage, that is the founder of the Mage division. The founder always wanted to expand the Mage division but had no way of doing so. Right until the founder by chance and good luck came across a volume of alchemical techniques.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat alchemical techniques?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pretends to be curious. Actually he already guessed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial artists require special techniques when training. Mages are no exception. What the founder found was a volume of techniques that train the soul force \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of it is pretty much the same as what Ling Xiao told You XiaoMo before. In the end, getting to the heart of the matter, Kong Wen finally decides to pass on that volume of alchemical techniques to him. But he must swear an oath to be loyal to TianXin sect forever. And he also can\u2019t tell the contents of the alchemical techniques to anyone, not even those that are closest to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster \u2026\u2026. if the oath is violated in the future, what would happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks cautiously. Regarding oaths, he always wondered, are they really effective?</p><br/><p>It must be said that before, he was an atheist. But right now, that is no longer the case \u2026\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

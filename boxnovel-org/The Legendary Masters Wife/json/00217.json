He massaged him nonchalantly, and then served him tea.</p><br/><p>At noon, You XiaoMo was finally able to move from bed, his ability to recover was clearly much faster than last time. Apart from his back, which still hurt a little, he didn\u2019t feel pain anymore.</p><br/><p>Looking at the lively You XiaoMo, Ling Xiao sighed, \u201cIt seems like if we do it again a few more times, you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo imperiously spit out these two words, \u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course Ling Xiao couldn\u2019t hear his \u2018f\u2019 word. He gave him the new clothes that were hanging on top of the screen. At first, he was going to help You XiaoMo change, but unfortunately, he was rejected mercilessly.</p><br/><p>After finishing washing their faces and rinsing out their mouths, they changed clothes, and then went downstairs. There were so many guests in the tavern. When they stepped out from their room, all kinds of voices were mixing and <b>the waves ran high</b> into their ears(t/n: extremely noisy). Many people were talking so loudly, their salivas sprayed everywhere at the same time.</p><br/><p>Although Ling Xiao already put on mask, because both of them wore white clothes, they became quite eye-catching. Some people even stole a glance at them secretly.</p><br/><p>The waiters at this tavern were very attentive, even with so many guests inside, the moment both of them sat down, the waiter who served them yesterday was already walking towards them with a business smile plastered on his face. Hearing the waiter\u2019s greeting, You XiaoMo nonchalantly chose some cheap dishes, while inside his heart, he angrily labeled the waiter as a profiteer. Even though those were just some ordinary dishes, they cost three gold coins. Even if you were a robber, you wouldn\u2019t be able to make money as fast as this tavern.</p><br/><p>Deep inside his heart, You XiaoMo thought that he must think of a plan to make more money.</p><br/><p>Before he came here, he didn\u2019t think that Yan City\u2019s living expenses would be so high, several times higher than the south. Counting from the expenses so far, he believed that the five million gold coins in his purse would soon be spent.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo put some vegetables into his mouth, while looking at Ling Xiao who ate the food gracefully, and was <b>warming the heart and delighting the eyes</b> (t/n: pleasant to the eyes), \u201cWhere are we going to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cAccording to the information, there\u2019s still half a month before Dao Xin Academy comes to Yan City for student enrollment. Because we still don\u2019t know the exact place and time, we should look for the information as soon as possible, to avoid <b>clasping the Buddha\u2019s feet when danger arises </b>(t/n: making a hasty last-minute effort)\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going to look for the information?\u201d You XiaoMo asked. Before Ling Xiao could answer him, the waiter came carrying a teapot and heard You XiaoMo\u2019s question, so he asked, \u201cAre both sirs going to gather some information?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing him speak initiatively, You XiaoMo simply asked, \u201cDo you know any information about Dao Xin Academy\u2019s student recruitment?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter laughed, \u201cIs this the first time both sirs have come to the Yan City?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted his eyebrow, you could tell just from that?</p><br/><p>The waiter said, \u201cSir might not know, but the place for Dao Xin Academy student enrollment is not fixed, sometimes at Yan City, sometimes at other northern region. But you two are very fortunate, Dao Xin Academy will hold the student recruitment at Yan City this year. Even though they still haven\u2019t announced where they will hold the enrollment, they will inform everyone in ten days. If sirs want to know as soon as possible, you can go to the Xian Ji Lou.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was taken aback, \u201cWhat kind of place is Xian Ji Lou?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter became more certain that this was their first time in Yan City, \u201cXian Ji Lou is a place specialized in selling information, it has one particular division that specializes in looking for information upon request. For major events like the Dao Xin Academy student enrollment, I\u2019m sure Xian Ji Lou will have the information.\u201d</p><br/><p>It sounded like a good plan, but You XiaoMo still had a question. He asked, \u201cIf the enrollment announcement is within ten days, doesn\u2019t it mean I don\u2019t really have to spend gold coins to buy information?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter explained, \u201cSir does not know, even though they will announce the news in ten days, there is a time limit for Dao Xin Academy\u2019s enrollment. If you cannot get it in time, wouldn\u2019t it mean that you miss this opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo still had one question that he didn\u2019t understand, \u201cDoesn\u2019t this Dao Xin Academy have a reputation that no matter what the student\u2019s origin is, as long as we meet their requirements, they will accept them? Why don\u2019t they give the location announcement at an earlier date?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter answered patiently, \u201cBecause Dao Xin Academy is very famous, there will be countless people signing up for the enrollment every time, but the people who are really able to pass are fewer than one percent. So, in order to not increase the burden for the teachers, who still have to choose students who have a true potential. It\u2019s been three years since Dao Xin Academy started to plan this system. This year is the second time they will implement it.\u201d</p><br/><p>So their luck was bad, because they didn\u2019t come ahead of time.</p><br/><p>Because he got the information that he wanted, You XiaoMo gave the waiter one gold coin as a tip.</p><br/><p>After the waiter walked away, You XiaoMo suddenly frowned. His hunch yesterday was indeed right, it hasn\u2019t even passed a day, he already had to spend some money.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rubbed the creases between You XiaoMo\u2019s eyebrow, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much, after we spend money, we should just earn it again. Just eat, after that, we will go to Xian Ji Lou to take a look. The enrollment isn\u2019t top secret, so it must be not that pricey.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo relaxed a little, what he said was true!</p><br/><p>After they finished eating, both of them asked the direction to Xian Ji Lou, and then headed there. Xian Ji Lou is located at the southeast corner of Yan City. It was a little far from their current location; if they took the Gigantic Flamebird, it would take them three days to arrive, while transport circles would only take a moment. Although Yan City doesn\u2019t permit people to fly above, people are allowed to use the Gigantic Flamebird.</p><br/><p>After they discussed it over, You XiaoMo finally consented to use a transport circle. Although he already had a hunch that this decision would hurt him for a moment, after really being ripped off, his heart couldn\u2019t stop aching nonetheless.</p><br/><p>Since the spirit stone used for transport circle is very precious, and the spirit stone here is better than the one used at Naye City, so the price became very expensive. But the speed was indeed very fast, in just a moment, the people were already looking at an unfamiliar place. They didn\u2019t even have to ask people where Xian Ji Lou was, because they could see it already.</p><br/><p>Looking at the the center where the people were flowing from, there stand a huge, magnificent dome, as if it were came from under the ground. This building was none other than Xian Ji Lou, which covers a huge area. If you compared it with the earth\u2019s <b>Forbidden City,</b> it approximately wouldn\u2019t reach 1/10 of it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hand chopped You XiaoMo\u2019s head, who was still in a daze, \u201cYou look stupid. Let\u2019s go inside and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo had just barely recovered from his surprise, Ling Xiao had already dragged him to enter Xian Ji Lou and saw two pieces of huge screens that were very eye catching. One of them already had a lot of information that had already been published, so everyone should know it. If the news was already put on top of the screen, it means you couldn\u2019t buy the information anymore. Another special thing about this place is that it\u2019s not commendatory for a shop assistant to serve the customers.</p><br/><p>On top of the screen, there was a bounty section, arranged based on the offered reward money, from high to low. When You XiaoMo took a glance, he was amazed. Ling Xiao, who was beside him, noticed his unusual behavior, and tried to follow his line of sight. Coincidentally, he spotted a bounty with the highest reward, so he couldn\u2019t help but showing a nasty smile.</p><br/><p>Two level nine magic pills. No wonder this bounty was placed on the first position. Apparently that Qiu Ran mage really would go as far as giving up his treasure for the Heavenly Soul Scripture.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the exact same information, but what took his attention wasn\u2019t the two level nine magic pills, instead, it was the bounty item that they have to retrieve. It clearly mentioned the three words \u201cHeavenly Soul Scripture.\u201d</p><br/><p>He believed that the Long Xiang Continent would not have other soul training book called Heavenly Soul Scripture. No wonder at that time, Ling Xiao could give him a soul training book easily. It was actually a \u201cstolen thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately grabbed Ling Xiao\u2019s clothes, and stared at him with eyes that looked like lasers, \u201cYou, you, you\u2026 please confess sincerely, that\u2026 don\u2019t tell me..?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s corner of the mouth suddenly curved up and became radiant, and gave him the answer easily, \u201cExactly!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him silently for a long time, and suddenly said, \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t steal it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao recalled back, \u201cDid I say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded with certainty, \u201cYou did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if he didn\u2019t, XiaoMo would still have said he did.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said beamingly, \u201cWell, even if I did say something like that, I really didn\u2019t say it wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at him with wide eyes, \u201cThe information is already out, you still say that you didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ling Xiao laughed happily, <b>\u201c</b>Because I didn\u2019t steal it, i just took it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d Was there any difference?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao touched his back, and then said to him pleasantly, \u201cEven if you struggle over this now, it\u2019s no use. It\u2019s already been a long time, and nobody knows that I was the one who did it. You can learn using that soul training book with peace\u201d.</p><br/><p>Of course he understood, but You XiaoMo remembered that a few months ago, he foolishly gave away the Heavenly Soul Scripture to his three seniors. Had he known earlier that it was a stolen thing, ah nope, a taken thing, he wouldn\u2019t have simply gave it to them. The only thing that he could be glad about, was that his seniors knew that that soul training book is very precious, so they certainly would keep it as a secret.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p><b>T/N: </b></p><br/><p><b>Forbidden City (</b><b>): </b><b>Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty\u2014the years 1420 to 1912.

But for some reason, with just a slight move, that stiff hard thing seems to get bigger, pushing against his thigh. Not only getting hotter but he can also feel it getting harder.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ling Xiao\u2019s arms, looped around his waist grips him tighter. Tightening around his waist as if wanting to snap him in two. You XiaoMo endures until his whole face is bright red. He finally can\u2019t take it any longer. He feels that if he were to keep quiet any longer, he would really be snapped in two.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, can you let me go first? I \u2026\u2026. soon I won\u2019t be able to breathe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glares at him again. Although he doesn\u2019t say anything, he loosens his grip on him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo feels it and immediately heaves a sigh of relief. He was almost crushed to death. He then steals a glance at Ling Xiao and stammers, \u201cElder brother Ling, since it\u2019s no longer early, we \u2026\u2026. should be getting out of bed? Also, you have to compete today <i>ne</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t answer, the expression in his eyes profoundly alluring. The black pupils of his eyes reflect the bright red face of You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>A youngster of seventeen to eighteen years old. A delicate and fair radiant face. Not tall but very thin and small body. At first glance, this person\u2019s appearance is not the type that would catch people\u2019s attention in one glance. But after staying with him for a while, it starts to fascinate him, making him want to understand him further.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is a man of many expressions, frequently revealing all his thoughts on his face. Someone that is very easy to understand. It precisely for this reason that Ling Xiao always finds it hard to resist teasing him.</p><br/><p>But You XiaoMo is also the one that is most able to endure out of all the people he has met before. Clearly feeling wronged, to the extent that flames are leaping in his eyes, and yet not uttering a single word and forcing it down. But what he doesn\u2019t know is that the more he does this, the more Ling Xiao will tease him, trying to find his breaking point.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that he suddenly realizes that You XiaoMo is actually quite good looking. The fair and clear face that seems to have two pink puffy clouds on each side. Looking at them, they look like plump, juicy, and fragrant sweet honey peaches. Enticing people to take a bite. In fact, Ling Xiao does just that. Lowering his head and taking a bite out of one of his cheeks. The latter, because of extreme shock, loses his soul, simply not having any reaction whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Luckily Ling Xiao only bites him lightly but it still leaves a faint mark on You XiaoMo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao licks his lower lip, revealing an unsatisfied expression. A pair of sharp cheetah-like eyes, fixed on You XiaoMo\u2019s flushed pink cheeks. As if he\u2019s thinking of taking another bite.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mind that had flown away returns to him when Ling Xiao says \u2018Really delicious\u2019. His first reaction is to cover the place where he was bitten and open his eyes wide in shock. With an expression of disbelief, \u201cYou you \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiles until his eyes turn into slits. The irritability he felt from not sleeping the whole night, immediately disappears when he sees this expression on You XiaoMo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, how can you bite me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo puts on a tiger face and says indignantly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao ponders for a moment then beams while saying, \u201cBecause I feel like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is so angry that his lips start to quiver. He glares at him saying, \u201cYou feel like it so you bite? I\u2019m not a piece of meat on the chopping block.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly raises the corners of his mouth, revealing a cynical and frivolous expression, \u201cHow do you know you\u2019re not a piece of meat on the chopping block, <i>en</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>The last syllable is said in an extremely sexy manner, making the listener feel the magnetism in that rich, deep and low voice.</p><br/><p>If the sisters of the Central lineage were here, they would definitely be squealing in excitement.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s too bad that the only other person here is You XiaoMo. His whole attention is focused on the first half of Ling Xiao\u2019s words. There\u2019s no way for him to pay any attention to how that last word is different from normal. He is already so angry that his whole body starts quivering.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gnashes his teeth. Don\u2019t think that just because he has no combat ability, so he can be easily bullied. He is also someone that can\u2019t be trifled with.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt exactly what you think it means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s smile is quite moving. The clearly manly handsome face is tinged with an enchanting elegance. His tone as light as down, as if in a pretty good mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo widens his eyes, wanting to object but looking at the brilliant smile that makes him look like a whole different person, the courage he drummed up immediately shrivels up. The expression on his face is also immediately replaced by a cute and pitiful look, like a bullied damsel in distress, \u201cWasn\u2019t it still fine last night \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao is immediately elated. This fellow was obviously in a fit of rage, and yet in just a moment, he actually went back to his original nature. And here he thought that he had grown some balls, actually daring to talk back at him. But as happy as he is, Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t plan on letting it go just like this. Making him unable to sleep the whole night, this debt must be paid.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, why do you think you ended up sleeping in my arms?\u201d</p><br/><p>He also wants to know the answer to this question. Why is it that the first thing in morning, he finds himself waking up in Ling Xiao\u2019s arms!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thinks that he has a good sleeping posture. Although he moved out to live by himself in his last life, when he was still living back home, his parents and his younger brother that lived in the same room never said that he had bad sleeping habits. So he always felt that his sleeping posture is very proper, just like that.</p><br/><p>But this belief is destroyed today. He really wants to scream that it\u2019s not true but looking at Ling Xiao\u2019s expression, it\u2019s obvious that something must have happened last night. If not, Ling Xiao would not have any reason to say these words!</p><br/><p>Thinking like this, You XiaoMo can\u2019t help but laugh in embarrassment, \u201cDid something happen last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant he changes from an indignant and justified victim to the accused. Furthermore, he is now the helpless person with all the power now being in the hands of the other person.</p><br/><p>Of course, this little lamb, no matter how it tries to disguise itself, it is still inherently a little lamb. This thing just can\u2019t be changed!</p><br/><p>A gleam flashes in Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes. He lies with a poker face, \u201cLast night, you \u2026\u2026. after sleeping for half the night, you suddenly woke up and pressed down on me. And not just that, you had this animal strength from who knows where and you suddenly wanted to tear off my clothes. If not for the good quality of my clothes, they would have been torn to shreds by that animal strength of yours long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo listens until he feels his heart shudder. Analyzing this long string of words, his heart feels like a well with seven buckets going up and eight buckets going down. Right until he hears those words \u2018tear off my clothes\u2019, it completely floors him such that he desperately wants to play dead.</p><br/><p>Oh my God, this person is definitely not him. No way. It must be an illusion. How can he do such things? But looking at Ling Xiao\u2019s expression, he doesn\u2019t seem to be lying. He is suddenly thrown into chaos. This revelation is too explosive. He had never thought that he has such a \u2026\u2026. <i>uh</i>, \u2018hot-blooded\u2019 side to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen then then \u2026. after that <i>ne</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s tongue is in knots.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raises his brows and snorts, \u201cOf course I stopped you in time, but \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately lets out his breath, this is the best thing he has ever heard. But just as he started to relax, Ling Xiao\u2019s \u2018but\u2019 again makes his heart jump up to his throat, <b>*peng peng peng*</b>, as if it is about to jump out. There\u2019s still more?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, but what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I managed to stop you, you still held on to me and refused to let go. On top of that, you wouldn\u2019t stop flailing on top of me, keeping me awake the whole night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those last words were said somewhat vengefully.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s ears appear to be flooded with blood, the temperature of his cheeks also rise to the boiling point. He doesn\u2019t dare to look at Ling Xiao anymore.</p><br/><p>No wonder this morning when he woke up, Ling Xiao also immediately woke up. So he didn\u2019t sleep the whole night. If someone were to press on him and flail about, he also wouldn\u2019t be able to get any sleep. Like this, he really falsely accused him!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is red-faced, apologizing meekly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo has his head lowered so he doesn\u2019t realize that Ling Xiao is beaming. Where\u2019s the anger? But he still doesn\u2019t want to let him go just like that. So he clears his throat and says, \u201cDon\u2019t think that it will be fine with just an apology. But I can forgive you, as long as \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as what?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo eagerly chimes in. After all, he\u2019s the one in the wrong.</p><br/><p>A devious look flashes across Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes, \u201cAs long as you help me think of a way to soften that hard stick down there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he intentionally jerks his lower body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is unable to ward off the jab. He immediately jumps up as if someone stepped on his tail. Luckily Ling Xiao didn\u2019t use much strength to restrain his waist so he breaks free in an instant.</p><br/><p>Gaining his freedom, You XiaoMo quickly scurries into the corner, looking at Ling Xiao in shock.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t look he wouldn\u2019t have known, but with one look he jumps in shock.</p><br/><p>His line of sight unconsciously moves to Ling Xiao\u2019s lower half. He sees a huge tent pitched between his thighs. Only separated by a thin layer of white cloth, the huge ferocious thing is faintly visible. Thinking that he was just jabbed by that plaything, You XiaoMo feels his scalp getting numb.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s really too big <i>ba</i>?</p><br/><p><i>Ah pei</i>, that\u2019s not the most important thing now. Ling Xiao actually wants him to help him \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>________________________________________<wbr>__________</wbr></p><br/>\n</div>"}

After having travelled for almost a day, there is no sign of <b>weariness</b> as Ling Xiao walks up to You XiaoMo and throws a book on the table.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo steals a glance at the book. It\u2019s not a new book but it has been kept meticulously. The book cover is very well kept without any damage or wrinkle. On it is clearly written [Heavenly Soul Scroll] three words. One look and you can tell that it is related to the soul since the word soul is written on it.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ling Xiao is not saying anything, You XiaoMo can\u2019t take it any longer and picks up the book. After flipping through, his whole face darkens, surprisingly he \u2026\u2026. can\u2019t recognize even a single word!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitates, looking at Ling Xiao, \u201cElder brother Ling, is this really a book of alchemical techniques to train the soul force?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, Ling Xiao raises his elegant brows, \u201cWhy? You think I would just take any old book to fool you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no.\u201d You XiaoMo quickly shakes his head. Of course he doesn\u2019t mean that, \u201cWhat I mean is, these characters, I don\u2019t recognize them at all. They are completely different from those in the books from the library. This way, how can I learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are able to understand, the other high level mages would have lived in vain.\u201d Ling Xiao snorts.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you mean that this book is written in ancient characters?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thinks of the characters on oracle bones. They are very different from the simplified Chinese characters of today. Two completely different types of characters. But the latter is still a result of continuous evolution throughout history.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow smart.\u201d Ling Xiao glances at him, his tone is definitely not one of praise.</p><br/><p>The characters of the Heavenly Soul Scroll is indeed written in ancient characters of Long Xiao continent. But if you really want to get to the heart of the matter, probably only a few people will be able to confirm it. That\u2019s because it is from over a hundred billion years ago.</p><br/><p>A hundred billion years ago, there were much more alchemical techniques to train the soul force than today. But because so much time has passed, and because some mages are not willing to pass on these alchemical techniques, the number has decreased with time. Many of them have even disappeared. That\u2019s why there are not more than ten volumes of alchemical techniques today in Long Xiao continent.</p><br/><p>But You XiaoMo is very curious. Since there are so few, how did he find this book? No matter how curious, You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t dare to ask the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, I don\u2019t understand the characters in this book. How can I train?\u201d You XiaoMo asks while holding the book.</p><br/><p>Finally a faint smile appears on Ling Xiao\u2019s face, but it\u2019s a crafty smile. He simply says: \u201cJust because you don\u2019t understand, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t expect that he would actually understand those characters. But the moment of delight disappears with the cunning tone of his voice. He realizes that it won\u2019t come easy. Of course there will be a price. He can almost imagine his purse getting flatter.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, just tell me what conditions you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>I will endure.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao reveals a \u2018so you can be sensible\u2019 type of expression. Making him run east and west, You XiaoMo is actually the first to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can translate the alchemical techniques for you. But once you make a breakthrough with your soul force, I want ten of that magic pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything is said in a non-negotiable tone. You XiaoMo knows what type of magic pill he is referring to. That\u2019s why he is depressed. Ten times more, just like that. But he finally has a book of alchemical techniques. You XiaoMo is very excited. Not just ten, even twenty he would agree <i>ah</i>. Of course, he would never tell Ling Xiao that.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, then should we start now?\u201d You XiaoMo holds the [Heavenly Soul Scroll] and looks at Ling Xiao with a pair of sparkling eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao frowns. Again with this little kitten look that makes the heart itch.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? Even if I translate it for you now, you still can\u2019t start training immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You XiaoMo blurts out after a stunned moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout anyone to show you the way, do you think you will succeed with your IQ?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raises the corners of his mouth. Again with the self-satisfied and insufferably arrogant look. No matter how you look at it, it is clearly different from the elegant scholarly look. Why is it that the others can\u2019t see it?</p><br/><p>This is clearly an insult. Where does it show that he has a very low IQ? You XiaoMo is furious.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stands up, walks over, pulls You XiaoMo by the arm and leads him outside, \u201cAccompany me for dinner. I\u2019ll find some time tomorrow to come by.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinks repeatedly, \u201cElder brother Ling, where are we going to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looks at him from the corner of his eye, and says with an ambiguous smile, \u201cOf course we\u2019re going to Earth peak\u2019s canteen <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s a while before You XiaoMo lets out a miserable shriek.</p><br/><p>At the same time, in a place where You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t know, something shocking reverberates across Long Xiao continent. It seems that the renown top level mage of Long Xiao continent, Qiu Ran has lost something very important. Because of that, he has issued an extremely high reward. He is offering ten level nine magic pills and three level ten magic pills in exchange for the thief.</p><br/><p>For You XiaoMo, that has no access to news from the outside world, he won\u2019t know about this for a very very long time. By that time, he will already think of [Heavenly Soul Scroll] as something that is rightfully his.</p><br/><p>Notes:wind and dust \u2013 weariness________________________________________<wbr>___</wbr></p><br/>\n</div>"}

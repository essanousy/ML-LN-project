In the past, Wei Bai\u2019s expression was always cold, like nevermelting ice, with a hint of gloom. He was clearly someone with a story to tell. Now, his skin was no longer so white it was practically transparent and the laughter in his eyes brought life to his expressions. Though he still seemed fragile, he had become a much brighter person overall.</p><br/><p>Seeing how he had changed, Fu CangQiong was delighted. Since his youngest disciple was in a better mood now, he had gotten much better and had less bouts of pain in the past two years.So, when he found out that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had already arrived at the Amaranthine Mountain, he knew that the Samsara Pill was probably done and brought his youngest disciple over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t beat around the bush, immediately taking out the small vial with the Samsara Pill. The sea blue colored magic pill lay quietly in the vial, faintly glowing. It was almost as if you could smell that fresh herbal scent.</p><br/><p>Wei Bai began to tremble in excitement.</p><br/><p>Back when he had heard that the Samsara Pill could heal his injuries, he had been in low-spirits, but still placed his hopes on it. However, a hundred something years had passed and there wasn\u2019t even a hint of the Samsara Pill\u2019s existence. He fell into despair once more, all the way until the little disciple his past master had taken in appeared and gave him new hope.</p><br/><p>However, Wei Bai\u2019s hopes weren\u2019t high. The Samsara Pill was from ancient times, and the recipe had been lost. He didn\u2019t dare put too much hope into it, afraid that he would only be met with greater disappointment. Now, his little Shidi had brought the Samsara Pill to him.</p><br/><p>Wei Bai thought he was dreaming.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was Fu CangQiong who took the Samsara Pill. He was no less excited than his little disciple, it was just that he was used to not expressing his excitement so plainly. He placed the small vial into his little disciple\u2019s hand, softly saying, \u201cXiaoBai, your youngest Shidi has successfully refined the Samsara Pill. It\u2019s not a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Bai stared at the pill inside the vial blankly. He really, really would be healed!</p><br/><p>After a moment, Wei Bai buried himself in Fu CangQiong\u2019s arms. Though his expression couldn\u2019t be seen, his trembling shoulders was a clear indication of his emotional state. You XaoMo dragged Ling Xiao away, leaving the room to the two.</p><br/><p>They were probably the only people to leave a room to its owners. However, they were here in the South Continent just to give Wei Bai the Samsara Pill, otherwise they could\u2019ve just asked the Cang Alliance to send someone over to the Ghost Tomb Mountains to get the pill.</p><br/><p>They also wanted to ask after Qiu Ran. Duan QiTian was You XiaoMo\u2019s first real master, and You XiaoMo owed him a debt of mentorship. If it wasn\u2019t for the other\u2019s guidance back then, his journey wouldn\u2019t have nearly been so smooth.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao had known of his and Wei Bai\u2019s relationship long ago, and heard about what was between them and Qiu Ran since he was the one in charge of investigating Qiu Ran. Every time he thought of this, it reminded him of what a serendipitous coincidence this was.</p><br/><p>\u201cA while ago I received news that there were traces that he had been in the city. His Self-Remoulding Pill is impressive; he even managed to shake off my men once. It\u2019s lucky that his cultivation base isn\u2019t high and he has no teleportation talismans, ao he can\u2019t escape the Southern Continent. Three days ago, our people found him in a small town. However, that town belongs to the Vermillion Blood Clan, so I didn\u2019t have them capture him immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought Qiu Ran\u2019s current circumstances were rather amusing. A man who was at the top of the world in the LongXiang Continent had become a wanted criminal, forced to hide and flee. It definitely wouldn\u2019t be a good feeling for him. He could practically imagine how Qiu Ran felt then.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao laughed, saying, \u201cOf course, we\u2019ve caught him now. It was my eldest Shixiong Zuo Yan who personally brought him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, sending Zuo Yan to catch Qiu Ran was a bit of a waste of Zuo Yan\u2019s talents. However, Qiu Ran was very important to their youngest Shidi and their master didn\u2019t want any further developments, so he had Zuo Yan bring him back. Reality proved that this decision was a good one.</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Blood Clan was also looking for Qiu Ran, but they had different reasons.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian wasn\u2019t looking for Qiu Ran to kill him because the former already knew that it wasn\u2019t the latter that had sent YuXian City into chaos. In any case, Ling Xiao was doubtlessly a practitioner and acted as one back then, while Qiu Ran was a mage. It was clear that the perpetrator wasn\u2019t Qiu Ran.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian\u2019s idea was simple.</p><br/><p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend. If Qiu Ran could be used, he was willing to help the other.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, You ZhenTian\u2019s people weren\u2019t nearly as fast as Fu CangQiong\u2019s disciples. By the time the people from the Vermillion Blood Clan arrived, Qiu Ran was being taken away by Zuo Yan. The two sides had met outside of town, but they weren\u2019t a match for Zuo Yan and easily dealt with.</p><br/><p>This incident had You ZhenTian enraged, and he had, rumor has it, completely blown up over this. Due to this, the Southern Continent\u2019s fragile peace was once again broken. You ZhenTian sent people to attack the Cang Alliance\u2019s towns, but they didn\u2019t manage to gain anything from it. With Zuo Yan personally overseeing things, there was little to no chance that they would manage to take the town without You ZhenTian personally getting involved.</p><br/><p>Plus, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the Cang Alliance didn\u2019t initiate any attacks, then the Vermillion Blood Clan would probably be on the losing side of a one-sided battle.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao took You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao to see Qiu Ran. Qiu Ran had become a prisoner now, kept in the Cang Alliance\u2019s dungeons. The dungeons were damp and all those who were imprisoned there were either traitors or horrible criminals that had committed the most terrifying of crimes.</p><br/><p>The three arrived at the last cell.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked, unable to recognize the person inside as Qiu Ran because he was far from how he looked before. He had become a white-haired old lady?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth?\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s surprise was visible.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao began to laugh uproariously. \u201cBrother You, I forgot to tell you, when my eldest ShiXiong found him, he was like this. Even I never would\u2019ve thought that he would disguise himself as an old woman. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that my people had been keeping an eye on him, when he really would\u2019ve managed to slip away. To escape and survive, he really hasn\u2019t shown himself any mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Qiu Ran really didn\u2019t hold back!</p><br/><p>It would be fine for him to disguise himself as an old man, but he chose to pretend to be an old lady, which was indeed very unexpected. Normal people wouldn\u2019t do such a thing unless they didn\u2019t want to make a name for themselves in the future.</p><br/><p>Once something like this was dug up, then no matter how powerful that person was, they would still be looked down on by people. However, this was also a show of Qiu Ran\u2019s endurance and what he was willing to do to himself to live. At the same time, to achieve his goals, he was also willing to use any method no matter how cruel.</p><br/><p>Someone like that had to be killed before they could grow further. Otherwise, who knows what would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo?\u201d Qiu Ran, who had been sitting in the corner of the cell, raised his head upon hearing their voices and immediately saw You XiaoMo. Since he hadn\u2019t changed much from before, Qiu Ran recognized the other immediately, his expression disbelieving.</p><br/><p>He had only been here in the TongTian Continent for a few months. In these days where he was forced to run and hide, he had heard a lot about him and Ling Xiao. Back then he was shocked and furious. It had only been a few years since they last saw each other and they had already become legendary figures in the TongTian Continent. He knew that he had no hope for revenge anymore.</p><br/><p>After that, he had been hunted, so he didn\u2019t have the energy to think so much. Now, seeing them here, he had a moment of enlightenment. His intuition told him that his current situation was probably their doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest ShiXiong Qiu, it\u2019s been a few years, have you been well?\u201d You XiaoMo looked at him with a look of enthusiasm. It was a bit dark, but their eyesights were enough to clearly see one another.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ran could hear the mockery in his words, his expression twisting viciously. He could practically see himself reflected in You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes, and the hatred in his heart overflowed. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that his Self-Remoulding Pill\u2019s antidote had been taken, then he wouldn\u2019t be stuck with his horrible body.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ran lunged at the bars of the cell, his eyes flashing maliciously. He glared at You XiaoMo. \u201cIt was you. It was you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo backed away a few steps, avoiding his spittle. \u201cSo what if it was me, so what if it wasn\u2019t? You\u2019re the only one to blame for your current situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though Ling Xiao\u2019s actions, which was the really reason that the other had landed in this situation, were purposeful, so long as Qiu Ran made any sort of name for himself in the TongTian Continent, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to escape such a fate, because there was no way Wei Bai would forgive him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo, I curse you, you\u2019ll die a horrible death and\u2026 ah!\u201d Seeing that he wasn\u2019t denying it, Qiu Ran immediately decided that it was all You XiaoMo\u2019s schemes that had landed him here. His eyes glared, bulging like brass bells and filled with malice.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ran hadn\u2019t even finished saying his spiteful words before there was an eruption of energy that struck him suddenly. His body flew back, slamming against the wall with huge sound. Dust fell from the impact and the fallen Qiu Ran coughed, unable to get up again\u2026</p><br/><p>Afterwards, You XiaoMo and company left the dungeons.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ran\u2019s fate was clear. There was no more need to waste any effort on someone like him anymore. You XiaoMo originally also wanted to ask him about his master, but seeing Qiu Ran\u2019s state, even if he was willing to talk, it wouldn\u2019t be anything good. If he had to, then he could just wait until everything was dealt with over here to go back and visit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

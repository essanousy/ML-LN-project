They had clearly shaken them off not too long ago, yet they miraculously ran in front of them again. Could it be another pair of beautiful sisters?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo repeatedly comforted himself.</p><br/><p>However, after he saw the two beautiful sisters, Mo Fei and Mo Xue, with his own eyes, he finally knew that this many dislikable coincidences truly did exist in this world.</p><br/><p>About a hundred meters ahead, Niu XuYang, Mo Xue, and Mo Fei were currently being surrounded by a crowd of people. Considering the way that crowd of people were dressed, as well as their behavior, they should be the so-called Dong Yu bandits.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did they get in front of us?\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask Ling Xiao. Even if they used all their strength to press on with their journey, it was impossible for them to get in front of them so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey probably used some kind of method.\u201d Ling Xiao couldn\u2019t say precisely why either. Everyone had their own secret tricks, or they had an item that could allow them to shorten the distance.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded his head, not quite understanding. However, this did seem to be the first time that he had encountered a \u2018hero rescues the beauty\u2019 scenario. It was a pity that he didn\u2019t want to save them, it was truly a hard opportunity to come by!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly fished out a magic fruit from his dimension and handed it to Ling Xiao. \u201cLet\u2019s watch as we eat fruit from the side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took the fruit and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to go find the White Tiger\u2019s right eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said matter-of-factly, \u201cThat\u2019s not urgent. In any case, besides us, nobody else knows where it is either. This is the first time I\u2019ve encountered a good \u2018hero rescues the beauty\u2019 show, so of course I want to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he took a bite out of the fruit with a crunch.</p><br/><p>Before them, Niu XuYang and the rest had just encountered the Dong Yu bandits not too long ago. Even though the three of them felt that it was very unexpected, they didn\u2019t show any signs of panic, especially the two sisters. Their expressions were calm and collected, as if the bandits surrounding them were just like the men who worshipped them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys look so ugly, you should scram at once out of my sight, or you can just wait and see what happens.\u201d Mo Xue wore an expression of haughty, cold elegance and her eyes held disgust as she looked at the bandits.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue\u2019s aesthetic standards were extremely strict. In her eyes, men who looked ugly were all dirty objects, and dirty objects should beat it far, far away from her. As for her standards for ugliness, one could refer to the delicate, pretty, and adorable You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>As for Mo Fei, although she wasn\u2019t as obsessive over people\u2019s outer appearances as her sister was, she had already been imperceptibly influenced by her sister over the years. Her requirements for looks shot straight up like a rocket. For example, Niu XuYang could actually be considered a handsome young fellow, but in the two sisters\u2019 eyes, he was just average.</p><br/><p>The two sisters naturally enslaved the men who looked just average. In their hearts, they even felt that Niu XuYang should be honored.</p><br/><p>This kind of woman was very terrifying. Their ability to cause trouble was directly correlated to their nitpicking over looks. Niu XuYang could also be considered getting what he deserved. Who told him to like this sort of top-notch woman like Mo Xue.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, this girl has quite a temper!\u201d A bandit immediately started to laugh loudly after he heard Mo Xue\u2019s words. They were already defenseless, yet she was still telling them to scram. Wasn\u2019t she just acting recklessly!</p><br/><p>A man with a face full of hair rubbed his beard and smiled lewdly. \u201cNo matter, no matter. I like this kind of forceful woman, it feels great when you do them on the bed!\u201d</p><br/><p>The others instantly revealed lascivious expressions, and they all started to laugh.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue turned livid with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cA crowd of reckless dirty objects dares to speak so insolently about my older sister? If we were to tell you who we are, it\u2019d scare you to death!\u201d Mo Fei instantly leaped forward. Even though they were twins, her figure wasn\u2019t as full or impressive as Mo Xue\u2019s. She looked fairly frail and weak, but the bandits still felt that she seemed very lively and cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man hasn\u2019t tried out twins before!\u201d When the bandit chief saw Mo Fei, his eyes immediately lit up. \u201cLittle girl, why don\u2019t you tell us who you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Fei\u2019s face turned red from anger after his first sentence. When she heard what he said after that, she said viciously, \u201cListen well. I am the Guma Tribe\u2019s second young mistress Mo Fei, and the great Guma Minister is my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re the second young mistress. Many apologies for not recognizing you. This humble man has failed to recognize your eminence.\u201d The bandit chief suddenly saw the light.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you know. Now, everyone slap their mouths one hundred times for me. After that, scram far, far away. It hurts my eyes just to look at you all.\u201d His flattering words were very useful against Mo Fei.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue still looked at them coldly.</p><br/><p>The band chief suddenly snorted coldly before his previous attitude vanished in a heartbeat. \u201cI was just giving you face since you really thought you were the second young mistress. Brothers, get them! Seize these two little girls, I\u2019ll share them with you all after I\u2019m done enjoying them. As for the man, kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>His subordinates instantly started yelling gleefully and vied with each other to be the first to pounce at Mo Fei and Mo Xue. Ever since they had become Dong Yu bandits, it had been a very long time since they encountered such high-quality women.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang turned pale with fright. He hadn\u2019t imagined that they would act as soon as they said so, and he was about to rush over when the bandit chief abruptly blocked his path.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, your strength level isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s too bad you met this old man.\u201d The band chief had realized what his cultivation base was long ago. He was only one star lower than him. Although the gap wasn\u2019t large, he still couldn\u2019t be his opponent.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang instantly went on alert.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Mo Xue\u2019s flustered and exasperated voice suddenly rang out. \u201cNiu XuYang, what are you standing around in a daze for! Why aren\u2019t you coming to rescue me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xue\u2019s level of strength was only at the Emperor three-star level. In reality, it wasn\u2019t low, but all of the subordinates under the bandit chief also were around the same level. If she fought them one-on-one, it could perhaps result in a draw, but it was impossible if it was two-against-one.</p><br/><p>They had just started fighting, and Mo Xue was already at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang was so worried that his eyes turned red. He wanted to charge over and rescue Mo Xue, but the bandit chief abruptly launched an attack towards him. It was a deadly blow, causing him to be unable to go over.</p><br/><p>Mo Fei was in even more dire straits than Mo Xue. In the first place, her strength was worse than Mo Xue\u2019s, and she was seized at once. The two bandits leered at her as they manipulated her, and the young woman was so scared that she almost started crying, continuously shouting for her sister to come rescue her.</p><br/><p>How could Mo Xue go rescue her? She was unable to even protect herself, but when she heard her little sister\u2019s cries for help, she accidentally got distracted. A bandit caught her around the neck, and her pretty face went red with a lack of air.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, we\u2019ve caught them.\u201d That bandit immediately shouted happily and excitedly at the bandit chief.</p><br/><p>When Niu XuYang saw Mo Xue fall into their hands, his heart jumped, and it was hard to avoid making a mistake. He accidentally let the bandit chief strike him in the chest, and he spat out blood as he went flying, his internal organs almost displaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cA useless good-for-nothing like you also wants to be a hero? More like a coward.\u201d The bandit chief snorted coldly before walking towards the captured Mo Xue. She finally knew to be afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you guys want to do? If my dad knows about this, he definitely won\u2019t let you go!\u201d Mo Xue howled wrathfully, although her body had already started to shake in fear.</p><br/><p>What she didn\u2019t know was that the bandit chief had never once listened to what she was saying. It didn\u2019t matter if she was telling the truth or lying. In any case, he had already offended her, so he might as well offend her to the end. Moreover, it was worth it if he could get a taste of the Guma Tribe\u2019s first and second young mistress.</p><br/><p>The bandit chief reached towards Mo Xue\u2019s chest with a hideous grin. With a ripping sound, the clothing at her chest was torn off, revealing her pink undergarments. Two large round white mounds sat at his beck and call.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue screamed and seemed like she was about to faint.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeast!\u201d Niu XuYang\u2019s eyes were red as he watched, and he seemed like a crazed bull.</p><br/><p>The bandit chief\u2019s grimy hands stretched even closer to Mo Xue\u2019s undergarments, and Mo Xue looked like she was going to pass out. In this moment of extreme crisis, a fruit pit flew over out of nowhere and smashed into his hand. There was quite a bit of strength behind it, and it made his entire hand go numb when it slammed into him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d The bandit chief covered his hand and stared in shock in the direction that the fruit pit had come flying over from. He actually hadn\u2019t known that there were other people nearby, could it be that their strength was above his?</p><br/><p>His cultivation base was at the Divine two star level. If he showed off this kind of strength outside, many people would definitely invite him to join their courts. However, he would much rather stay in Dong Yu and lord over other people, only because this place was more lax than other places. Nobody cared if they raped and looted, and moreover, with his strength, there were few people who could be his opponents in Dong Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ling Xiao still held a half-eaten fruit in his hand. He looked at You XiaoMo, whose hands were both empty, and he raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose guiltily. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t like that pair of beautiful sisters, violating women in broad daylight is a bit too obscene.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly revealed a thin smile, heavy with meaning.</p><br/><p>Outside, the bandit chief, who didn\u2019t receive a response, was about to send his men in to take a look, when another wave of people appeared. They weren\u2019t bandits; they were an exploration party of about ten or so people. When they discovered the situation over here, they instantly charged over.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Dong Yu bandits. Everyone, get them!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t succeed a hundred percent of the time, after all the pills he was refining weren\u2019t low or middle level pills. No matter how good he was, he wouldn\u2019t be able to refine high level pills with a hundred percent success rate, so he failed a couple of times.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stretched. In reality, he hadn\u2019t originally planned on isolating himself for over a month at once. It was good that this wasn\u2019t the first time, though.</p><br/><p>Tidying up the vials and bottles on his desk, You XiaoMo washed his face with spiritual water and tidied himself up a little before leaving the interior room. He had only just opened the door when he got a scare from the people outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked in surprise at the awkward-looking Qiao WuXing and the delighted Tian Xin, who was pulling the former along, her eyes bright as she looked at him. Behind them was Yan Hui and Cheng XiangRong, and behind Cheng XiangRong was Jiu Ye standing at his door, arms crossed as he leaned against the frame emotionlessly. They were all gathered in front of You XiaoMo\u2019s door for some reason.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin hurriedly pushed Qiao WuXing away and grabbed You XiaoMo\u2019s arm. \u201cXiaoHa, you finally came out. I\u2019ve been waiting for you for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately felt goosebumps rise across his body. Why did it feel like that \u2018XiaoHa\u2019 had a strange layer of sweetness to it. Had something happened while he had been isolation?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled weakly, tugging his arm from her grasp and asked, feigning nonchalance, \u201cHow come you\u2019ve all run over to my place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, Cheng XiangRong and I just passed by, that\u2019s all,\u201d Yan Hui hurried to find an excuse for them.</p><br/><p>The honest and well-behaved Cheng XiangRong immediately nodded his head in agreement.</p><br/><p>Only Qiao WuXing wore an expression of helplessness, saying apologetically, \u201cSorry, are we we disturbing you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head. \u201cNo, you came just in time. I don\u2019t plan on continuing my closed-door cultivation. What a coincidence that you\u2019re here just when I come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, everyone\u2019s expressions twisted.</p><br/><p>In reality, it wasn\u2019t a coincidence. Before You XiaoMo went into closed-door cultivation, he had told everyone that he would be doing so for a month and a half. Today was the day he was due to come out of isolation, so Tian Xin had come here early to wait for him. The others were here for the possible drama that was due to occur. Of course, no one would tell him this, but they couldn\u2019t promise that he wouldn\u2019t guess it himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Tian Xin asked, seeing that he seemed to intend to head out.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo backed away a step smoothly. \u201cI have some business to do, so I\u2019ll be leaving XiaoYao Institution for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin followed, stepping forwards a step and saying with a beaming smile, \u201cWhat a coincidence, I also need to head out. How about we go together?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cNo need. I really have some very important business to attend to. It won\u2019t be convenient for you to follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin kept coming closer. \u201cThat\u2019s alright. You can go and do what you need to, I won\u2019t follow you.\u201d It was rare that she would like someone so much, so she naturally wouldn\u2019t back down so easily, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be Tian Xin.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Qiao WuXing for help.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing understood his plea and pulled her away. \u201cTian Xin, behave, alright?\u201d He had practically used up all his energy trying to discourage Tian Xin this month.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin bit her lip in chagrin, looking at You XiaoMo in hope.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held his forehead. He could feel a headache coming on. He suddenly felt a little jealous of Ling Xiao. He would just ignore people he didn\u2019t like and wouldn\u2019t push himself to give in to the other. If only he could be so blunt.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Tian Xin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call me Tian Xin.\u201d Hearing You XiaoMo address her, Tian Xin\u2019s mood immediately rose, looking at the other with adoration.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose. \u201cAlright, Tian Xin, I actually need to tell you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, not wanting to drag it out, quickly said, \u201cI already have someone I like. I really like him, and don\u2019t ever want to separate from them. So\u2026 er, sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin\u2019s smile faded from her face.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the hallway immediately became heavy. Everyone looked at each other. They probably hadn\u2019t thought You XiaoMo would be so blunt. However, this was the best choice. The earlier one made things clear, the less the other would have lingering thoughts.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin\u2019s complexion went pale. She realized that everyone was looking at her with pitying and sympathetic gazes. She couldn\u2019t help but wipe her face harshly and lift her chin, saying, \u201cWhat does you liking someone have to do with me? What are you sorry for? It\u2019s not like I like you, don\u2019t read too much into things. I would never like a weak-looking guy like you in that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, she ran off.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing glanced at You XiaoMo apologetically before chasing after her.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was speechless. This was a personal attack!</p><br/><p>So what if he was weak looking? This was a world where strength spoke for everyone. One couldn\u2019t judge someone by their appearance. No matter how weak-looking he was, he was still stronger than the majority of people here.</p><br/><p>However, he knew of Tian Xin\u2019s pride and sense of dignity. She probably felt that his rejection would lose her face, so used this to retort. It was good that he had been prepared.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui patted his shoulder in comfort. \u201cBrother, don\u2019t think too much of it. You rejected her, so she had to find some way of maintaining her pride.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. In the time you spent in closed-door cultivation, she came to check up on you daily. We can tell that she really does like you. Try to forgive her; it hasn\u2019t been easy for her.\u201d Cheng XiangRong thought that he was sad about it all, but he sympathized with Tian Xin. She had just fell for the wrong person.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo silently glanced towards the room next door to him. Should he check up on things when he goes past? \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t mind. Alright, I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing him hurry off, Yan Hui scratched his head. \u201cHe\u2019s in quite the rush. Could it be that Ling Mo is coming back so he wants to personally welcome the other back? How about we tail him secretly and go see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong was prepared to return to his room and frowned upon hearing this. \u201cThis is his personal business, you can\u2019t suggest something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui raised his hands in surrender. \u201cI know, I\u2019m just joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong said, \u201cIn the future, you shouldn\u2019t joke about something like that, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be good if you\u2019re overheard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye had long since disappeared, having watched his fill.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the corridor, Qiao WuXing had planned on consoling Tian Xin with a few words after catching up and telling her to not think too much of it. However, he found her teary-eyed, as if she\u2019d start crying in the next moment, but wearing a determined expression. He couldn\u2019t help but soften at this.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry. It\u2019s his loss if he doesn\u2019t like you. You\u2019re the young miss Tian Xin of the Beast Transfiguration Guild. There are plenty of people pursuing you. You can\u2019t let others see you like this, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin wiped away her tears and said in disappointment, \u201cHe\u2019s my first love. It\u2019s not so easy to forget him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing helplessly asked, \u201cTian Xin, I actually always wanted to ask, what about him caught your liking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin flushed. \u201cI just feel like he\u2019s a good guy, someone who\u2019s worthy of me, and he\u2019s different from others. He knows who we are but never tried to kiss up to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s why, then that isn\u2019t love. You just have positive feelings for him. The two are different. Listen to me. He isn\u2019t suited to you. When you meet the right person in the future, you\u2019ll know that that\u2019s the person you\u2019ve been waiting for all along.\u201d Qiao WuXing patted her cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I really meet that person?\u201d Tian Xin looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Qiao WuXing nodded in certainty.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin forced out a smile. \u201cRemember what you said today. If I don\u2019t find one, then brother WuXing, you\u2019ll owe me one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing smiled. \u201cAlright, how about I give you WuShuang?\u201d He didn\u2019t hesitate to offer up his cousin.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, that guy only ever bullies me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he bullies you because he likes you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After You XiaoMo left XiaoYao Institution, he didn\u2019t pause at all and headed for the ShuangYu Hotel. He had told SheQiu and the others to meet him at ShuangYu Hotel before he had gone into closed-door cultivation, because this was the last day of the three month promise Xiong Xiao had given them. Though they didn\u2019t know if he would send the info over as promised, he still had to check.</p><br/><p>ShuangYu Hotel was near XiaoYao Academy, so it didn\u2019t take You XiaoMo long to walk there.</p><br/><p>The hotel was as lively as always. Even during the day, there was still a never-ending flow of customers coming to gamble. There were many people sitting in the lobby, excitedly discussing things about gambling. It was very noisy.</p><br/><p>After making sure he was in the right place, You XiaoMo walked inside.</p><br/><p>SheQiu and the others lived in the room that he and Ling Xiao had lived in originally. Familiar with the place, he easily found the room.</p><br/><p>Just as his figure disappeared up the stairs, an elderly man who had brushed past him, prepared to leave the hotel, suddenly turned, contemplatively gazing at him before turning and heading for the entrance of the casino.</p><br/><p>If You XiaoMo had seen, he would know that the elderly man was one of the two protecting Wu Cheng in the underground casino from before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Do you know your crime?\u201d</p><br/><p>The newcomer\u2019s voice was hoarse and low as if he had been choked. His entire body was shrouded underneath his black cloak, leaving only a pair of gloomy eyes, and he was staring expressionlessly at the startled Hei Xiong.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong finally reacted and hastily cupped his hands. He said respectfully, \u201cSo it turned out to be Mister Emissary. If Mister Emissary could impart his judgment, Hei Xiong does not know much, and those people also have no relation to Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black snorted coldly. \u201cI trust that you wouldn\u2019t dare. I\u2019ve come this time to inform you that there is a secret assignment for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease tell me, Mister Emissary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXing Qi\u2019s mission failed, and ZiRan City is an unavoidable location on the way to Living Waters River Boundary. Therefore, from now on you must strictly guard the city gates, and you cannot let any of the people from the Tortoise Clan through,\u201d the person in black said darkly.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong hesitated for a second. \u201cBut if we allow people to know that we are hunting the Tortoise Clan\u2019s people, won\u2019t we offend the Psychic Black Turtles?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although ZiRan City wasn\u2019t a part of the Psychic Black Turtle\u2019s territory, it was situated in the north just like the Psychic Black Turtle. If they became angry because of this, he most likely would have no way to continue lording over ZiRan City.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you to hunt the Tortoise Clan\u2019s people in broad daylight. As long as you find the people who look like Mo Jing and deal with them secretly, that will suffice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Xiong understands.\u201d After finishing, Hei Xiong was just preparing to walk away when he suddenly saw that the person in black had no intention of leaving yet. He couldn\u2019t help but pause. \u201cDoes Mister Shi Zhe have some other important matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black said, \u201cWho was the man that defeated you not long ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong was extremely surprised that he would ask about this. He answered honestly, \u201cHei Xiong did not recognize him, but he should be a level twelve expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in black glanced at his missing arm. \u201cIs your arm his doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that I removed my arm in time, I\u2019m afraid that right now it wouldn\u2019t just be my arm.\u201d Thinking of this, Hei Xiong couldn\u2019t help but laugh bitterly. The level twelve expert was indeed on another unreachable level from him, and their levels in strength differed just as much.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me what happened at the time,\u201d the person in black said lowly. It was a little abnormal for a level twelve expert to appear for no reason. He thought of the man Xing Qi had talked about who had torn off his arm. They both lost a hand, so could it be that the two of them were connected somehow?</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong didn\u2019t understand why he was so curious about this matter, but he still repeated exactly what had happened without leaving anything out.</p><br/><p>\u201cA master of fire, a level twelve expert?\u201d A light bulb suddenly went off in the person in black\u2019s head, and he suddenly raised his head. \u201cCould it be that man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Hei Xiong hadn\u2019t imagined that he would actually associate him with somebody.</p><br/><p>The person in black also hadn\u2019t thought that he would receive such great news today; it was truly the heavens helping him. Hearing Hei Xiong\u2019s uncertainty, he explained, \u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard of this man before. If my guess is correct, he is most likely the number one rank on the Ten Divine Gods Ranking, Ling Mo, who defeated You AnTai and the old Eagle. There\u2019s a lot of chaos going on outside right now, so even if you haven\u2019t heard of him, if you ask around just a bit you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong was startled. Of course he\u2019d heard of this person. \u201cBut isn\u2019t he a peak seven-star level eleven expert? How did he change into a level twelve expert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I must quickly notify Master of this. Also, think of a way to send someone to go follow them. We have to know their whereabouts, and we\u2019ll make a final decision after I hear back from Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong could only swallow his arguments. \u201cYes sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the person in black left, Hei Xiong stood in his original position with an unreadable expression.</p><br/><p>Telling him to send his men to go tail a level twelve expert? Wasn\u2019t it the same as telling him to send his men off to die? This kind of thing was nice to say, but the problem was that there was absolutely no way to implement it.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong thought for half a day before finally deciding to dispatch a few relatively weak men. If they died, then it wouldn\u2019t be too tragic.</p><br/><p>At the same time, two hours had just passed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s contracted beasts appeared outside the city gates punctually. A big crowd of people was still pretty eye-catching, and the guards outside of the city gates glanced over multiple times.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu gave a lively retelling of what happened outside of the inn, including how she punished the proprietress and how she disfigured her.</p><br/><p>There were some people who were disfigured who could use magic pills to recover, but there were also some that couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Although they were both women, this time MaoQiu had delivered a killing blow. There was no way for an ordinary magic pill to restore her looks, and this was something MaoQiu had calculated.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong was an intelligent person. The proprietress had caused him to make a fool out of himself in front of everyone, and she had also forced him to pay a large sum of Spirit Gems. Nobody would have feelings of affection after seeing the disfigured proprietress, so the downfall of the proprietress would most likely be extremely tragic. She would probably have to wait a long time to get a magic pill that could restore her looks.</p><br/><p>Seeing MaoQiu\u2019s haughty smile, everyone shivered.</p><br/><p>There was indeed some truth behind the saying \u2018I would rather offend an ordinary man than offend a woman.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment, they didn\u2019t know that it was already becoming extremely rowdy outside, and that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were actually the center of attention.</p><br/><p>After the Vermillion Blood Clan confirmed that Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t from the Qilin Clan, they decided to capture You XiaoMo and take him back. Therefore, they specially sent people to the XiaoYao Institution, but they then learned that they weren\u2019t there and that nobody knew where the two of them had gone.</p><br/><p>Although the matter was still unfinished, it had already spread around.</p><br/><p>In order for the Vermillion Blood Clan to justify capturing You XiaoMo, they accused him of stealing. Furthermore, because his surname was You, this counted as the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s \u2018family business,\u2019 so outsiders had to withdraw.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know about any of this, and right now, he was already rushing towards Living Waters River Boundary.</p><br/><p>The Living Waters River Boundary was a winding river. The river swept towards the north part of Xi Jing, and the river water surged and raged. Although it was called a \u2018river,\u2019 it was as wide as the sea.</p><br/><p>Besides the Psychic Black Turtles who lived inside the Living Waters River Boundary all year round, there was also all sorts of aquatic demon beasts which depended on the Psychic Black Turtles.</p><br/><p>After You XiaoMo left ZiRan City, they traveled for an entire day before finally arriving on the afternoon of the second day at River Town, which was also a port town at the Living Waters River Boundary.</p><br/><p>River Town wasn\u2019t very developed. There were ordinary humans and also small demon beasts who basically all kept out of each other\u2019s affairs. They were separated to the east and west; the humans lived in the east, and the small demon beasts lived in the west. Furthermore, they were all creatures that lived in water.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the east and west territories was Peace Street.</p><br/><p>Peace Street was River Town\u2019s most rowdy area. No matter if it was a human or a demon beast, they could all do business on Peace Street. They weren\u2019t allowed to cause trouble, or else their offence would be recorded, and they could even possibly be chased out of River Town.</p><br/><p>The end of Peace Street just happened to be Living Waters River Boundary\u2019s port.</p><br/><p>At one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, a crowd of strangers suddenly appeared at the port, attracting the attention of the port\u2019s residents. River Town was always a little wary of outsiders, and usually they wouldn\u2019t make conversation with outsiders on their own accord.</p><br/><p>This crowd of strangers was You XiaoMo and the rest.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the ships in the port. They were all very simple and crude small boats, and even the ones that were slightly bigger could only fit three or four people. Furthermore, it was very likely that they would be washed away if they encountered a big wave.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like we can\u2019t all go at once.\u201d You XiaoMo said awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just let them stay at River Town.\u201d Ling Xiao walked alongside the ships in the port. Several dozen small boats were anchored in the port, and they were all about the same, big or small.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought a bit before he turned around and said to PiQiu and the rest, \u201cThen you guys can just stay at River Town. The two of us can go find the Psychic Black Turtles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, I want to go with you two.\u201d PiQiu pouted and looked at him eagerly. Although his outer appearance had matured, his personality was still the same as before.</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. He had to get used to the adult PiQiu, and he soon said seriously, \u201cNo, you guys also saw how the small boats can only fit two or three people. Also, even if you guys go, you won\u2019t be much use. More people will only be a hindrance. If you guys stay here, you can ask around River Town, and if you hear anything about the Psychic Black Turtle you can notify us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPiQiu must be an obedient child!\u201d MaoQiu walked to PiQiu\u2019s side, smiling, and she patted his head.</p><br/><p>PiQiu\u2019s shoulders shrunk and he looked at her, a little scared. He had just heard about MaoQiu\u2019s savage accomplishment, and he was a little afraid of her when she revealed a smile. \u201cI will be obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you guys can head back first.\u201d You XiaoMo instantly drove them away, since having a crowd of people follow them made it easy to attract other people\u2019s attention. It wasn\u2019t good to be too obvious either.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu instantly dragged the unwilling PiQiu away, and the other people followed on their own.</p><br/><p>River Town had an inn. It wasn\u2019t very big, but it was River Town\u2019s only inn. This was something they had known before they arrived, since Tian Dao had told You XiaoMo about River Town, saying that this was the place that the Psychic Black Turtle was most likely to appear.</p><br/><p>After they left, You XiaoMo ran to Ling Xiao\u2019s side. It was indeed better when it was just the two of them, free and unrestrained, and the atmosphere became much fresher.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich boat should we take out to sea?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe first have to ask someone. We still don\u2019t know if River Town\u2019s fishermen would be willing to lend us a boat.\u201d Ling Xiao had already noticed how the port\u2019s fishermen didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with them. It seemed that things wouldn\u2019t go as they wished, since their main objective wasn\u2019t actually a small boat but to ask the fishermen about the Psychic Black Turtles.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In his heart he fears that he won\u2019t be able to escape from all this today. Unexpectedly, a hoarse voice filled with anger suddenly rises by his ear. Turning around, he sees that it is the old man that guards the library.</p><br/><p>The old man looks sullen. After walking over he shifts his gaze onto the one that just said he wanted to teach You XiaoMo a lesson, Li Jun. His face is very solemn, his serious expression is filled with anger, making others feel anxious. He then speaks coldly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t give old me a good reason, don\u2019t even think of taking half a step inside the library for a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, it\u2019s not just You XiaoMo that gets anxious. Li Jun is also anxious.</p><br/><p>Li Jun hastily explains, \u201cElder Sun, it\u2019s not my fault. It\u2019s You XiaoMo\u2019s fault. He spoke insolently to me. That\u2019s why I wanted to teach him a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he repeats the insolent words that You XiaoMo said to him. Of course, he only does so selectively. He doesn\u2019t mention one word of what happened before. In short, whatever he can push onto You XiaoMo, he hammers onto him. In the end, he also pulls in the one watching the drama from the side, Jiang Liu.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Sun, every word of what I said is true. You can also ask Younger brother Jiang. He was there at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes bulge open. This person is really shameless. Inverting black and white and he still doesn\u2019t feel any shame.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu deliberately looks at You XiaoMo. The he puts on a troubled face and hesitates before saying, \u201cWhat big brother said is right. But Big brother You didn\u2019t say it that way on purpose. Elder Sun, please don\u2019t blame Big brother You. I believe he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, You XiaoMo can\u2019t help frowning. These words seem to be begging for leniency. But he is not in the wrong, so why beg for leniency? Like this, it\u2019s basically providing irrefutable proof.</p><br/><p>If it isn\u2019t Elder Sun standing in front of them right now, but some other person, after hearing both their words, he would most probably fix the blame on You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Then, as Li Jun smiles while delighting in the misfortune of others as he waits for You XiaoMo to be condemned, the serious-faced Elder Sun, not revealing the least bit of his thoughts, suddenly speaks to You XiaoMo, \u201cTell me what actually happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, everyone is stunned.</p><br/><p>Those that come to the library often, all know that Elder Sun can be considered as the most serious person in TianXin sect. He never takes sides, not caring which disciple is the Grand Master\u2019s disciple. His thinking can be described as pedantic, because he places a huge importance on rules.</p><br/><p>Thats why Li Jun\u2019s face changed when he saw him coming in because he broke the rules of the library.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s also because of this that Li Jun fought to be the first to throw accusations because he knows that as long as he shifts the blame to You XiaoMo, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting punished.</p><br/><p>But he never expected that Elder Sun would actually ask You XiaoMo of his own accord. Thinking of how You XiaoMo could reveal everything that he failed to say, Li Jun immediately starts to panic.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo also didn\u2019t expect Elder Sun would actually ask him. He rejoices as he says, \u201cElder, what happened is \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t have the heart of the Virgin Mary. Li Jun actually dares to frame him so don\u2019t blame him for telling the truth. Furthermore, it\u2019s someone that is hostile towards him so of course he is not going to go easy. So in a few words, he clearly explains the sequence of events.</p><br/><p>Li Jun\u2019s face at his side turns deathly white \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Just as expected, after listening to You XiaoMo\u2019s words, Elder Sun\u2019s piercing eyes looks threateningly at Li Jun. He says with a rather cold expression, \u201cOld me has already said before. While in the library, you can only take one book at a time. As an senior, not only did you not serve as a role model, you also caused difficulties for your younger brother and disregarded the rules of the library. Old me would like to know when the books of the library become yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this, he flings down his sleeves forcefully, the anger on his face extremely terrifying.</p><br/><p>Li Jun feels his knees go weak as his face turns pale. He says with trembling lips, \u201cDisciple \u2026\u2026. knows he is wrong. Elder please issue the punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Sun snorts coldly, \u201cLi Jun disregarded the rules of the library and disturbed the order of the library. The punishment is you are not allowed to enter the library for one year. If you have any objections, ask your Master to come discuss it with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Li Jun have the nerve to tell this to his Master? He says weakly, \u201cDisciple \u2026\u2026. has no objection.\u201d</p><br/><p>TianXin sect\u2019s library is very comprehensive, seemingly containing books of all kinds. Researching information, reading books as relaxation, all these are beneficial for training. So unable to enter the library for a year, for a lot of people, is worse than torture.</p><br/><p>After punishing Li Jun, Elder Sun looks at You XiaoMo. The latter has an expression much like looking at death calmly in the face. A smile flashes across his face and then he says indifferently, \u201cAs for you, making a racket in the library, the punishment is you are not allowed to enter the library for three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is stunned. This is too \u2026\u2026. lenient. This basically doesn\u2019t hurt him nor make him itch. He quickly regains his senses and cups his hands while speaking respectfully, \u201cYes Elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone is stunned. If they can\u2019t tell that Elder Sun is being partial towards You XiaoMo, then their two ears would have grown in vain. Elder Sun who is famous for being stern is actually partial towards You XiaoMo. This is a really shocking thing!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is already considered a minor celebrity in TianXin sect. It seems as if everyone in the Warrior and Mage divisions also know his name. Before, even if Li Jun didn\u2019t say his name, everyone would still be able to recognize him.</p><br/><p>But this person that everyone regards as a nobody in their hearts, is actually liked by the library\u2019s Elder Sun. This is incredible news!</p><br/><p>Darkness flashes across Jiang Liu\u2019s eyes. After waiting for Elder Sun to leave, he says with a regretful expression to You XiaoMo, \u201cBig brother You, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know that Big brother Li is actually that kind of person. If I had known that he was like that to you earlier, I would have definitely not let him frame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo reveals a rather obvious forced smile, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s only expected that you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother You, you don\u2019t blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu looks cautiously at his face while speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never blamed you. I know that you didn\u2019t know what happened. That\u2019s why you said those words. Luckily the truth is out now!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shakes his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu immediately heaves a sigh of relief. Then he ingratiatingly hands that troublesome scroll on high level magic beasts over to him, \u201cBig brother You. I\u2019ll let you look at this scroll first <i>ba</i>. Take this as my apology for my wrongdoing. You must accept it at all costs. Otherwise I will take it that you won\u2019t forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA \u2026\u2026. alright, it would be impolite for me to decline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing him speak so seriously, You XiaoMo can\u2019t help but accept it.</p><br/><p>Actually, he didn\u2019t really have to look at this particular scroll. There are still a few mid-level magic beast scrolls that he hasn\u2019t read. He wanted to read those first while waiting to see if other brothers finish reading theirs. Unexpectedly, he ran into Jiang Liu, resulting in all the stuff that followed.</p><br/><p>After that, Jiang Liu leaves early after not being able to find one for himself.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo takes the scroll that he was given. He said he didn\u2019t mind but that\u2019s actually not the case.</p><br/><p>Although his relationship with Jiang Liu is not very close, they are after all from the same place. Furthermore, it\u2019s not as if he didn\u2019t bring up the fact that Li Jun was wrong. Not only did he not help him out, he actually ganged up to accuse him, actually asking him to apologize.</p><br/><p>And also those words that seem to be begging for leniency. Now, thinking it over, he feels that it is not quite right. That was clearly pushing him into the fire pit <i>ah</i>. Actually, at that time, a huge lump immediately rose inside his heart.</p><br/><p>As for the apology after that, although he accepted it, some things are very hard to remove once they have emerged. So You XiaoMo secretly makes a decision. If he were to see him again, he must absolutely keep a distance away from him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu has no idea as he leaves, that his fake ingratiating behavior didn\u2019t have the slightest effect.</p><br/><p>Returning to Earth peak, You XiaoMo is a little depressed that he can\u2019t go to the library for three days.</p><br/><p>Ever since Elder brother told him about the Paradise realm, he can\u2019t wait to hole up in the library for a few days. He urgently needs to get some information.</p><br/><p>But thinking of Li Jun\u2019s punishment of one year, he no longer feels depressed, making him feel much better.</p><br/><p>That night, You XiaoMo spends two hours digesting the information he recorded down speedily in the library. The next morning, while he is fetching water for washing up to keep up appearances, he discovers that the news of yesterday\u2019s incident has already spread.</p><br/><p>Many people are talking about how Elder Sun punished Li Jun angrily. And also how he was partial towards You XiaoMo. Although most of them don\u2019t dare to say it openly, they still whisper about it among themselves. Most of them are saying how lucky You XiaoMo is.</p><br/><p>But even though Elder Sun\u2019s punishments were rather partial to You XiaoMo, the punishments he gave out are reasonable. That Li Jun really did break several rules of the library so he should be punished for a year.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t expect that the busybodies of TianXin sect would be so amazing. Every time something happens to him, it would be get around in the shortest time, making him extremely depressed.</p><br/><p>But You XiaoMo is a little hopeful that Ling Xiao will come look for him once he hears about this. But after waiting for a day, and still no sign of Ling Xiao, he would lying if he says he isn\u2019t disappointed.</p><br/><p>But he definitely doesn\u2019t know that the reason why Ling Xiao hasn\u2019t come looking for him is because Tang Fan ordered him to not go running to Earth peak all the time. In order to play the part of Lin Xiao, Ling Xiao has been obediently acting as a worthy \u2018disciple\u2019 these few days.</p><br/><p>Two days later, after You XiaoMo refined a huge heap of level two magic pills, he finally decides to try refining level three magic pills, charging forward towards becoming a level three mage.</p><br/><p>________________________________________<wbr>__________I don\u2019t speak Chinese.

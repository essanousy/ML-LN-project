However she lost her chance as Tong YueXu had already shaken off the two people hampering him, and was blocking her way to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeng ZiXin, you\u2019re so despicable!\u201d Tong YueXu gravely said.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin gave a cold snort, \u201cBattle royales have always been like this. Or did you assume that others would show mercy to you? Tong YueXu, you would be na\u00efve to expect this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu said, \u201cSince you\u2019ve said as such, then don\u2019t blame me for not showing mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin sneered, \u201cYou really think too highly of yourself, Tong YueXu! You are not my match regardless of what happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu calmly replied, \u201cWhether that\u2019s true or not, we\u2019ll only know after we compete.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he assumed a ready-to-attack stance. Just as he was about to make a move, You XiaoMo unexpectedly stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d You XiaoMo endured the pain as he stood up.</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu guardedly peered at Teng ZiXin before he walked to You XiaoMo\u2019s side. As he supported You XiaoMo\u2019s arm, he asked with worry, \u201cHow are you? Is the injury serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s of no importance, I can still hold on for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, You XiaoMo was slightly afraid of pain, because he seldom got injured since his childhood. Although it was hard for him to withstand pain, he did not want to see Teng ZiXin\u2019s proud and superior-looking face, and he wanted to let her know the consequences of sneak attacking him.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was looking awful and yet was clenching his teeth, Tong YueXu probably understood his insistence and did not say anything else. He just circuitously asked, \u201cDo you need my help?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately replied, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu said, \u201cHow do you want me to help?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cYou just need to stand at the side and keep an eye on Teng ZiXin\u2019s every move. Don\u2019t let her wound me again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu said, \u201c\u2026 \u2026Okay!\u201d</p><br/><p>He assumed that You XiaoMo wanted him to stand at the side to watch Teng ZiXin, and prevent her from having another chance to perform another sneak attack.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pulled his arm away from Tong YueXu who was supporting him, and walked two steps forward. Then he pretended to touch his magic bag. In actual fact, he took a small bottle of spiritual water from his dimension, which only had five drops of spiritual water inside. Raising his head, he drank all of the spiritual water.</p><br/><p>This competition did not stipulate that participants could not use other means to restore their soul force. You XiaoMo dared to openly drink his spiritual water since he took advantage of this loophole.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Teng ZiXin\u2019s eyes flashed twice.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo threw the empty bottle into his magic bag, looked at Teng ZiXin and grinned, \u201cI remember that there was a day where someone easily lifted my magic bag as I came out from Shifu\u2019s courtyard. There happened to be a small bottle of spiritual water inside, did Teng-shizhi happen to have seen it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin\u2019s expression chilled, \u201cOn that day, I left earlier than you. How would I\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When she said that, Teng ZiXin trailed off as her expression suddenly changed, and she could not continue her sentence.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo let loose an extremely proud smile, \u201cAiya, I did not say when it was, and Teng-shizhi actually knew what I was talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not clearly state what he was implying, but people who use their heads would know what it meant once they heard it.</p><br/><p>Hearing their conversation clearly, Tong YueXu\u2019s eyes widened a little, and he looked at Teng ZiXin with incredulity. He knew that You XiaoMo\u2019s magic bag had been stolen. With his intelligence, he probably understood the truth from these few sentences.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo abruptly lowered his voice, \u201cIn all likelihood, you haven\u2019t finished that bottle of spiritual water yet right? Now\u2026do you dare to use it in front of everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin\u2019s face showed fear and anger. Although he hit the mark, she was not stupid enough to step into his provocation, \u201cI do not understand what you are saying one bit. You must be dreaming if you\u2019re trying to stall for time!\u201d</p><br/><p>She immediately molded a hand seal as she finished speaking, thinking of taking advantage of the time before You XiaoMo\u2019s soul force had fully recovered to attack him.</p><br/><p>In front of her, a majestic and powerful soul force rapidly condensed into a large palm. Teng ZiXin lighty tsk and the large palm swept towards You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Feeling the oppressive aura emitting from the large palm, You XiaoMo lifted his hand. A solid and thick spiritual barrier instantly condensed at his palm. In an instant, the large palm smashed into the spiritual barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two attacks collided, and invisible soul fluctuations rapidly spread out from their point of contact. The fluctuations created a hurricane that cut into the ground, shattering the stone tiles and sending the fragments flying around. Some of the spectators who were at the edge of the competition stage were frightened into letting out loud cries of alarm as they fled away.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at Teng ZiXin opposite him. Suddenly, his hands covertly formed a few hand seals, gathering a wave of soul force at his fingertip. Availing himself of the time before the hurricane had yet to disperse, he shot the soul force at his fingertip out.</p><br/><p>Two fingers of soul force shot through the soul hurricane, mixing into it. It was too late for Teng ZiXin when she discovered this. Her hastily built defense barrier was broken through, and the remaining soul force hit her right shoulder. Blood was immediately seen.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin was frightened and angry as she clutched her injured shoulder.</p><br/><p>After ten seconds, the soul storm finally dispersed, and the situation on the competition stage was revealed at last.</p><br/><p>The spectators surrounding the stage let out sounds of confusion. Why was Teng ZiXin\u2019s shoulder also injured after just a blink of the eye?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Feng ChiYun\u2019s side had distinguished the winners from the losers. Despite Qing Qiu\u2019s strength being pretty good, against the experienced Feng ChiYun, she was not match at all. She was soon at a disadvantage, and was forced down the competition stage by Feng ChiYun.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin\u2019s two helpers were injured by Tong YueXu, and had lost half of their fighting strength. Therefore, there was only one Zhong JingShan left on Teng ZiXin\u2019s side. Unfortunately one Zhong JingShan was not much help at all.</p><br/><p>The situation had reversed in an instant.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cDo you admit defeat or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin pursed her lips and remained silent.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smirked, \u201cIf you don\u2019t admit defeat, I\u2019ll just beat you until you do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication was that he did not plan to strike Teng ZiXin off the competition stage. Instead, he wanted her to take the initiative to throw the towel in. It need not be said that this move was quite malicious. Compared to being knocked out of the stage, it would be an even greater blow to make a proud person voluntarily surrender.</p><br/><p>Zhong JingShan recalled that he had helped Chai Zheng scheme against You XiaoMo. He did not know if You XiaoMo would hold a grudge. He took the initiative to jump off the competition stage for fear of dealing with You XiaoMo. Looking at the situation on the stage, they did not have a chance of winning at all. Rather than standing on top in humiliation, it would be better to simply give up.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Teng ZiXin was unable to follow Zhong JinShan\u2019s example and simply give up.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo did not find that surprising. It was even better for him if Teng ZiXin did not admit defeat, as he would have a reason to beat her up.</p><br/><p>Hai Lan then hastily walked over to Teng ZiXin and whispered, \u201cZiXin, we have already lost. It\u2019s more advantageous to admit defeat now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin darkly glanced at Feng ChiYun who was about to walk over, and bitterly looked at You XiaoMo, before she finally decided to give up. If she continued to fight, she would be the one to lose out. However, it was impossible for her to take the initiative to surrender.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Teng ZiXin turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately threw out a burst of soul force.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin\u2019s expression slightly changed, and she had no choice but to dodge to one side. After she found her footing, she angrily stared at You XiaoMo, \u201cYou XiaoMo, don\u2019t think that I\u2019m afraid of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo happily laughed, \u201cOf course you\u2019re not afraid of me. You, Missy Teng, have always been fearless. No matter when, there\u2019s always a \u2018I alone am superior and aloof\u2019 expression on your face. How can you be afraid of a small potato like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Lan was furious as she listened to his nonsense, \u201cYou XiaoMo, we have already admitted defeat. Don\u2019t you dare go too far! Have some shame, you\u2019re still a man!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was surprised, \u201cDid you guys say that you admit defeat just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dumbstruck, Hai Lan was unable to form a reply.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo continued, \u201cWhat can just turning around represent? How could I know if she was preparing to concoct a killing move, or trying to make me lower my guard in order to perform another sneak attack on me? As a precaution, it\u2019s only natural that I am obliged to strike first and gain the upper hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the time they took to exchange words, Feng ChiYun and his friends had already blocked off the retreat of Teng ZiXin and her group.</p><br/><p>Unless they took the initiative to surrender now, Teng ZiXin and her group could only continue to fight on.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin glanced around with an extremely gloomy complexion.</p><br/><p>Although Feng ChiYun and his friends had used up a lot of their soul force, Teng ZiXin and Hai Lan also did not have much soul force left in their reserves/running on fumes. If they really started fighting, their chances of victory were less than thirty percent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo, you win, I surrender!\u201d Teng ZiXin bitterly spat this sentence out. Then, along with Hai Lan and her other helper, she left the competition stage.</p><br/><p>Their departure marked the end of the battle royale.</p><br/><p>Under the efforts of You XiaoMo and his group, Teng ZiXin, Chai Zheng and Qing Qiu who had the strength to contend with the top three people, were finally and unexpectedly wiped-out.</p><br/><p>Immediately, You XiaoMo excitedly beckoned Feng ChiYun and the rest over, \u201cQuickly come over here, let\u2019s distribute the scores for the five places.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was taken aback. That\u2019s right! There could be high and low scores for the five places. But what was You XiaoMo trying to do that made him so excited?</p><br/><p>It was not only just the audience who were bewildered. Even Tong YueXu and the rest did not understand what You XiaoMo was trying to do.</p><br/><p>Off the stage, Ling Xiao looked at You XiaoMo with surprisingly bright eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was an inner room and an outer room, and the necessary furniture was all present and of good quality.</p><br/><p>Compared to the suite they had in Ward B, this place could only be described as ordinary. And, as Elder Tang had said, the saturation of spiritual energy in the room was the same as it was outside the room.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked into the inner room. The bed inside was rather large, able to fit three people without worry. However, he was still a little confused as to why the accommodation of the two wards were different.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shucked off his shoes and crawled onto the bed, rolling across the surface happily. Then, he turned to lie on his front on the edge of the bed, asking, \u201cLing Xiao, why do you think there\u2019s no spiritual energy here? Wouldn\u2019t Ward B be better, being able to cultivate at any time and all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked over and sat beside him, chin in hand, and said, \u201cIf you like Ward B, we can go back, but I doubt the Fifth Elder will agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo punched him with a fierce look. Ling Xiao knew that wasn\u2019t what he meant. \u201cCome on, tell me. Does it have something to do with the ley line?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao spoke as he took off his shoes, \u201cDo you remember how SheQiu told you that the ley line will eventually run dry?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately nodded. He definitely remembered; it had made a lasting impression.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued, \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, Dao Xing Academy\u2019s ley line has existed for tens of millions of years already. Something called a Ley Line Core will form in the center of such ancient ley lines. So long as the Ley Line Core is in tact, the ley line can be repaired.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was still confused, asking with impatience, \u201cWhat does that have to do with the spiritual energy in the rooms of the two wards?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes at him, \u201cCalm down, I\u2019m about to explain, or do you want me to wait a few days?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately smiled endearingly, saying, \u201cGo on, go on, I promise I won\u2019t interrupt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued, \u201cIf my guess is correct, Ward A should be right above the center of the ley line, that is to say, right above the Ley Line Core. One of the reasons that these rooms aren\u2019t saturated with spiritual energy is so that the spiritual energy from the ley line isn\u2019t wasted; another is that there\u2019s a better place for cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked. \u201cTong YueXu also mentioned that. What is that better area for cultivation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao calmly replied, \u201cThe cultivation area is most likely referring to Spirit Gem Daises.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked again. \u201cSpirit Gem Daises? Didn\u2019t we get a Spirit Gem in the Paradise Realm? Is that what you\u2019re referring to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulled You XiaoMo into his arms, pushing his hand through You XiaoMo\u2019s hair and continuing to speak in satisfaction, \u201cMore or less. However, the Spirit Gem you obtained isn\u2019t as saturated with spiritual energy as the Spirit Gems belonging to ley lines. Spirit Gems are something that every ley line will produce. They grow near to the Ley Line Core and the older the ley line, the more Spirit Gems it will produce.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo decided to ignore the hand that was mussing up his hair and guessed, \u201cSo what you mean is that if we cultivate on top of these Spirit Gems, then it\u2019ll make the process much faster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. In addition, the closer to the Ley Line Core you are, the faster your cultivation will go.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought for a moment and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat do you mean when you said the ley line could be repaired so long as the core is in tact?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as is. If the people of the Academy continue cultivating like this, the Ley Line core and Spirit Gems will eventually run dry. When the core disappears, the entire ley line will become useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao leaned against the post of the bed, lazily running his hands through You XiaoMo\u2019s hair. When he had entered the Academy, he had already noticed the ancient ley line running underneath it, and knew that it\u2019s life was coming to an end. However, it didn\u2019t have anything to do with him, so he had ignored it, only remembering it when they started talking about it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his head, saying, \u201cI remember SheQiu said that even if the ley line withered, there\u2019s a chance to save it. Do you know how?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave him a casual glance, unable to help but turn his nose up at the continuous questioning. \u201cWhy are you asking so many questions? Do you want to save it or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose. \u201cOh please, even if I do have good potential, I\u2019m aware of my limits. Saving a ley line sounds like a huge thing that an insignificant person like me can\u2019t help with and might even get in the way of. I\u2019m just curious, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cIf you have the time to think of these boring things, then you should use it to figure out how to get stronger. Currently, you\u2019re still pretty weak. I\u2019m still waiting for high leveled magic pills to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo mumbled under his breath, \u201cGlutton.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly waved his hands, smiling, \u201cNothing, I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cI suddenly remembered something, last time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo interrupted him with a \u201cah!\u201d and hurriedly struggled from his grasp. \u201cI also remembered something. Ever since I enrolled in Dao Xin Academy, I\u2019ve barely gone to organize the stuff in my dimension. Every time I go in, I rush out again. I wonder how SheQiu and the others are doing. Since I have some time now, I\u2019m going to go inside and tidy up. I might come out rather late, so you can sleep first. No need to wait for me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even finish his last sentence before he disappeared.</p><br/><p>Looking in the direction You XiaoMo had disappeared from, the corner of Ling Xiao\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cThere are plenty more opportunities!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though it was an excuse to escape from Ling Xiao\u2019s grasp, he really did need to tidy up his dimension. Thinking back, it had been half a year since he last tidied this place up.</p><br/><p>Seeing the scenery change, You XiaoMo let out a breath of relief. He didn\u2019t know what Ling Xiao was going to say, but his gut told him it wasn\u2019t something he wanted to stay for.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo headed to the edge of the lake. Since he had to move to Ward A, She Qiu and the others couldn\u2019t stay outside. He had put them all inside his dimension before leaving, including the restless PiQiu and CatQiu.</p><br/><p>Seeing him enter, PiQiu and CatQiu immediately lunged over. The two thought that their master was going to take them out and were particularly excited.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cleared his throat, telling to the two, \u201cGo and play elsewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu stared at You XiaoMo mournfully, tearfully asking, \u201cMaster, do you not want us anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>CatQiu, \u201cMeow?\u201d Master, you really don\u2019t want us anymore?</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched. He was a little depressed. PiQiu was getting better and better at his heart-wrenching acts and had been a bad influence on CatQiu as well. It seemed like letting them play together was a bad idea.</p><br/><p>It was then that MaoQiu drifted over in their androgynous human form, lightly saying, \u201cLast time they ran out of the suite again and saw a couple arguing outside. The woman had said something similar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could feel black lines on his face. So that was the reason.</p><br/><p>But what was the weirdest was why that damn PiQiu felt the need to imitate an arguing couple.</p><br/><p>Seeing his master radiating an intense pressure, PiQiu sensed danger and quickly took two steps back, throwing a warning cry at CatQiu before running off.</p><br/><p>CatQiu wasn\u2019t slow either, retreating rapidly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t even have the time to react before the two had disappeared. They sure were fast at fleeing, but he wasn\u2019t here to argue with them about these useless things, so he ignored them.</p><br/><p>Walking into his wooden house, You XiaoMo stopped in front of a set of cabinets.</p><br/><p>There were many cabinets inside the wooden house that held all sorts of different things. Some were organized already, but the others contained things he had shoved in hurriedly and hadn\u2019t had the time to organize.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opened the first cabinet. There were two training manuals and a high-level pill recipe scroll from the Paradise Realm inside.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t need the two skill training manuals. One was for practitioners and though the other was a low grade high level soul training manual, it wasn\u2019t as good as the Heavenly Soul Scripture. He wouldn\u2019t discard a higher level one for a lower one. As for the scroll, there were five different magic pill recipes, but he didn\u2019t need them right now.</p><br/><p>The second cabinet had an unknown level eight pill. It was unfortunate that it had been in the palace for too long without careful protection, so the power it held had dispersed a little. However, the effect should be the same. The reason he hadn\u2019t given it to Ling Xiao wasa because he wanted to take a closer look at it first.</p><br/><p>The third cabinet held a multitude of colorful magic herb seeds. Since he wasn\u2019t sure what kind they were, he hadn\u2019t planted them and almost forgotten about their existence.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>It was only after he had organized everything in the drawers that he walked out of the wooden house.</p><br/><p>He then headed to the lake to see that egg, and also see how the Hidden Dipper Stink Bug was doing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

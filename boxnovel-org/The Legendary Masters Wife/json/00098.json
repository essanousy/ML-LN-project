He then explains the general points on oaths that relate to mystics. In brief, oaths are like a checkpoint type of barrier. If you break an oath, no matter if you\u2019re a mage or martial artist, this oath will follow you forever, like an inner demon. It would only disappear if you manage to defeat it, or \u2026\u2026. if you yourself disappear.</p><br/><p>If you are a mage, it is a hundred percent certain that you will remain at that same level from that point onwards. If you are a martial artist, it is even worse. When training to have a breakthrough, the oath will wind around you. At the least, it will leave you with a severe injury. At the worst, it would leave behind a hidden danger making you stuck in that state. That\u2019s why a lot of martial artists and mages won\u2019t swear an oath lightly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo listens until he starts to drip with cold sweat. Luckily he didn\u2019t break the oath he swore the last time at the Central lineage. If not that plaything would latch on to him like an infection that reaches the bone. Then he will have no hope of ever rising in rank.</p><br/><p>But speaking of being loyal to TianXin sect, You XiaoMo feels that he definitely doesn\u2019t feel much attachment to TianXin sect. Furthermore, he has no need for TianXin sect\u2019s alchemical techniques. If he were to let himself be controlled by TianXin sect for a useless volume of alchemical techniques, isn\u2019t that just not worth it?</p><br/><p>Luckily Kong Wen didn\u2019t ask him swear the oath right away. Passing on the alchemical techniques is a serious matter. Even though he is one of the three highest level mages of TianXin sect, he still can\u2019t pass on the alchemical techniques to his own disciple without prior authorization. He still has to report to the higher ups and wait for the elders to discuss it before making their decision.</p><br/><p>This lets You XiaoMo heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Seven, this is as far as Master can help you. What comes next will depend on your own efforts. Also, Master promised you the last time that if Elder brother and Second brother passed Uncle Ye\u2019s test, Master would grant you a request. This matter is now valid so have you thought about what you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Wen says warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Master. But I still haven\u2019t decided. Can it wait until I have decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>He almost forgot all about that matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You can tell Master whenever you have decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kong Wen nods his head.</p><br/><p>After taking his leave from Master, You XiaoMo trots all the way back. He comes across a lot of brothers on the way. Seeing him, all of them become very excited, congratulating him one after another for passing the assessment. Some of then even slapped him forcefully on the shoulder, praising him greatly for beating the most outstanding Heaven peak disciple, Jiang Liu. All of them can\u2019t hide the joy in their hearts, especially the brothers that were mocked by Heaven peak before.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubs his nose helplessly. He didn\u2019t think that this matter would spread so quickly.</p><br/><p>After bidding farewell to those brothers, You XiaoMo returns to his own room. He finds out that the brothers next door have not returned. Remembering that two of the brothers also passed the test, he guessed that they must be out celebrating with everyone.</p><br/><p>Pushing open the door, You XiaoMo is just about to walk in when his steps suddenly come to a halt. He feels that there is an additional familiar scent in the room. Raising his head, he sees a figure stepping out from behind the folding screen. Dressed in a set of magnificent white robes, the man\u2019s body is slim and graceful.</p><br/><p>Seeing him, You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes immediately light up, \u201cElder brother Ling, how come you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Are you not happy to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrows his eyes slightly but a smile escapes from his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m also looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly shakes his head, bouncing happily up to Ling Xiao, \u201cElder brother Ling. I have some good news to tell you. I already passed the test and am now a formal disciple of TianXin sect. Now I can go down the mountain whenever I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao places his palm on his head and smiles lightly, \u201cI already know. But these things you\u2019re telling me, the last bit is what you really want to tell me <i>ba</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughs <b>*hei hei*</b>. That is exactly his intention.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe matter with the auction, I\u2019ve already arranged it. When the time comes, you just have to prepare the things and we can go at any time. But before that, we must first settle the thing with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That is the reason why Ling Xiao is here.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? What about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks in surprise.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly pinches his nose and snorts, saying, \u201cAre you telling me that Kong Wen didn\u2019t bring up the matter regarding that volume of alchemical techniques?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is unable to breathe and hastily pulls away Ling Xiao\u2019s hand, saying in surprise, \u201cHow did you know? Master really did bring it up, just before this. Also, he said I would have to take an oath if I wanted to study them. I was just thinking about discussing this matter with you <i>ne</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding the fact that he would be the first one that he looks for when something happens, Ling Xiao is very pleased with that. Because this proves that You XiaoMo is already starting to get used to his presence. He is also starting to depend on him more and more. He supposes that with time, this dependence will make him unable to leave his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is not hard to understand. You displayed extraordinary talent in the Hall of Mages, taking down Heaven peak\u2019s disciple in one fell swoop. Based on this alone, it is enough to make TianXin sect regard you with importance. Although your innate talent is a restriction towards your future development, not all core disciples of TianXin sect are high level mages. In light of your stellar performance, if Kong Wen doesn\u2019t reel you in, that would mean that he just appears more impressive than he really is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao speaks confidently. Although he did go see the assessment for himself, all these are just guesses.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at him in admiration, praising him sincerely, \u201cElder brother Ling, you\u2019re really incredible. The assessment just ended and you already know so much. Then, what do you think I should do? I already have the Heavenly Soul Scroll. TianXin sect\u2019s volume of alchemical techniques don\u2019t seem to be of much use to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He doesn\u2019t want to take the pledge. He doesn\u2019t want to be restrained for no reason by an oath just for a useless volume of alchemical techniques. But he can\u2019t refuse because once he does, that would mean that he has no intention of being loyal to TianXin sect. If that happens, the result would be even more disastrous than taking the pledge. He can even imagine Master\u2019s abrupt change in expression at that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat volume of garbage is really of not much use to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walks towards the inside.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately follows him while trying to flatter him, \u201cElder brother Ling, you are so powerful. Do you have a way for me to not take the pledge and yet not make Master suspect me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glances at him with a twinkle in his eye. He lifts up his hand and raps him on the head, \u201cSo you\u2019ve actually learned the art of <b>flattery</b>.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts as he covers his head. He curses in his heart that he is only doing what he must!</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walks to the bed and sits down, beckoning him over with his finger.</p><br/><p>The smile on his face is clearly a gentle one yet it undeniably makes You XiaoMo feel as if a big-tailed wolf is waving to him. That appearance, one look would make the heart feel ill at ease but he has no other choice. The person he can rely on the most now is Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Walking over as slowly as he can, You XiaoMo gives out a silly laugh, \u201cElder brother Ling, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake off your shoes and get on the bed. Then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looks at him teasingly, pointing to the space at his side.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face slowly starts to get a little red. He is obviously thinking of things that he shouldn\u2019t be thinking of. The feeling gets stronger and stronger until he really wants to turn around and leave, but he can\u2019t \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Taking off his shoes, he slowly climbs onto the bed. You XiaoMo sits cross-legged in front of Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly moves closer to him, the tip of his nose not even one centimeter away from him. The hot air from his breath is like the steam rising from boiling water, spraying onto You XiaoMo making his ears turn red.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sounds like a kitten, not knowing where he should put his hands.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raises the corners of his lips slightly, \u201cNo need to worry. First I\u2019ll tell you how oaths are made.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinks. How oaths are made? It seems Master actually didn\u2019t tell him. He only roughly described the restrictive and harmful effects that oaths have on mages and martial artists.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why oaths are effective on martial artists?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asks.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shakes his head. This is what he really doesn\u2019t understand. If oaths are really effective, all the people of the twenty first century would be wiped out since they always swear oaths only to break them again and again.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t expect that he would know. He says wistfully, \u201cOutside the universe, there is a void. In it live peculiar creatures that are called the void. When a martial artist swears an oath, it would break through the void and enter the oath-taker\u2019s body, attaching onto the surface of the soul. If the martial artists breaks the oath, the void would drill into the soul much like an evil infection that reaches the bones, only disappearing when the oath-taker is destroyed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s feels his hair stand up in terror. He rubs his arms vigorously, \u201cIs there really no way to defeat this void?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiles, saying, \u201cThere isn\u2019t. One can only rely on willpower to defeat the void. Only this way will one be able to shake off the void forever. But after shaking off the void, there is a tremendous benefit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat benefit?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes light up as he asks hurriedly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looks at his sparkling eyes and suddenly feels an itch in his heart. He narrows his eyes saying, \u201cThe benefit is, you no longer have to fear the void anymore when swearing an oath. Because the oath would make a different void appear. If the void that appears is smaller than the one before, then even if you break the oath, nothing would happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch good benefit <i>ah</i>. Then \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo exclaims happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes <i>ah</i>, so do you want to try?\u201d Ling Xiao smiles deviously as he asks softly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at his expression and immediately comes back to his senses. He hastily waves his hand laughing <b>*hei hei*</b>, saying, \u201cI\u2019m just joking.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>Note:</b>beat horse fart \u2013 flatter</p><br/>\n</div>"}

PiQiu and CatQiu followed. They were relatively weak, so they didn\u2019t go over to Weeping Ghost Shores, staying in the palace with Metal Swallowing Beast and the others.</p><br/><p>The demon beasts raced to get inside, but upon seeing that Ling Xiao was sitting next to their master, they all settled down.</p><br/><p>Their master had been in the dimension taking care of Boss Ling Xiao recently, and without anyone to keep them in check, they went wild. Originally, there was still You JunQi to keep an eye on them, except he wasn\u2019t the most reliable either.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the most reliable was the weakest Weasel Beast. However, with the pills and life crystals You XiaoMo had provided, his strength had improved by a lot. Now, he could command more and more rodent demons, and stronger ones, too.</p><br/><p>Though Ghost Tomb Mountain Range was still that dangerous ancient warzone, he had plenty of eyes placed here now. He would be the first to receive the news if anything happened in the Ghost Tomb Mountain Range or White Bone Town, even sooner than TianDao.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s current favorite was the Weasel Beast. Seeing him reminded You XiaoMo of the black robed man he had given to the Weasel Beast to take care of. After coming back, he had spent most of his time in his dimension taking care of Ling Xiao, so he didn\u2019t know much about what had happened recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that man doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that is master was looking over at him, the Weasel Beast replied, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t woken yet, but his injuries are mostly healed. He\u2019ll be fully healed in a few months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince his injuries have healed, how come he hasn\u2019t woken up yet?\u201d You XiaoMo asked in confusion. You XiaoMo had heard from the Weasel Beast that though the man had sustained heavy injuries, his regenerative abilities were very powerful. Logically speaking, he should\u2019ve been awake by now.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast scratched his head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. Master, do you want to go and visit him?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked, \u201cWho is this man you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately replied with excitement. \u201cDo you remember that black robed man we saw in the Peach Springs? That\u2019s him. I saved him on my way out from the TongTian Palace. He\u2019s your helper, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Back then, he hadn\u2019t only saved the black robed man, but also two members of TianGou. Though they had both been injured, their injuries weren\u2019t severe, so the two went back to Weeping Ghost Shore directly, just missing the black robed man that was in You XiaoMo\u2019s dimension back then.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s expression was a little strange. \u201cHave you informed TianGou\u2019s people? What about your demon beasts, are they not here?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked. \u201cWhy would I inform them? Do you mean SheQiu and the others? TianDao borrowed them not long after we came back, saying there was something important he needed help from them with. I let them go, seeing that he seemed after anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t reply, directly saying to the Weasel Beast, \u201cSend someone to the Weeping Ghost Shores, tell them that the person they\u2019re looking for is over here with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast looked at You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded back for him to obey, feeling delighted. This wasn\u2019t the first time Ling Xiao had ordered his contracted demon beasts. It was, however, rare that his demon beasts didn\u2019t immediately obey and instead asked for his opinion first.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what you just said, did you mean that black robed man a member of the TianGou? Ah, is it that TianGui?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the Weasel Beast left, You XiaoMo put together Ling Xiao\u2019s words and finally figured out the black robed man\u2019s identity. Of the members of TianGou, TianGui was the most mysterious and often disappeared without warning, so even his companions rarely saw him, nevermind PiQiu and the others.</p><br/><p>No wonder PiQiu and CatQiu didn\u2019t have any reaction upon seeing the black robed man. In addition, all those that had met him were with TianDao now, so TianGou still had no idea that TianGui was here with him.</p><br/><p>As for You JunQi, all he cared about was his son, and no one bothered him anyway, so even if he knew that TianGui was a member of TianGou, he wouldn\u2019t see a need to inform TianGou, seeing that the man was ok.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted that you finally figured out who he is,\u201d Ling Xiao said without sincerity.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for him this time, TianGui might\u2019ve been hidden here until he spoke up himself. If he recalled correctly, TianGui was going up against a three star enemy. It seemed like he had sustained heavy injuries while killing his opponent.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s gaze drifted. To much had happened as of late; he hadn\u2019t had the tie to consider other things like that.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast was very fast at sending messages, and TianGou knew within the day. TianDao almost thought that TianGui had been taken by TongTian Palace\u2019s people and had sent plenty of people to look for the other over the course of these three months. Knowing that TianGui was at the palace, he calmed, merely telling the Weasel Beast to tell them to let TianGui stay and heal for now.</p><br/><p>However, the Weasel Beast secretly told You XiaoMo afterwards that, when he had told TianGou about TianGui, their expressions had twisted terrifyingly.</p><br/><p>Perhaps other people wouldn\u2019t understand, but the Weasel Beast knew that the TianGou had been up in arms over TianGui\u2019s disappearance for a full three months. It was just that, back then, he hadn\u2019t known that TianGui was the black robed person.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo decided to would be for the best if he didn\u2019t go to Weeping Ghost Shores for now.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was strong, and in three months, his internal injuries had mostly healed. He had heard of the sacred level practitioner in White Bone Town, but he decided to leave this be for now.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was more concerned about the overall situation in the TongTian Continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, let me show you something.\u201d You XiaoMo remembered the pill he had taken from the stone platform. Afterwards, he had checked his DanQing Ancestor\u2019s jade drive, but hadn\u2019t found anything, so he was doubting if this was a magic pill at all.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took the pill. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that there were things that even Ling Xiao didn\u2019t know, You XiaoMo\u2019s enthusiasm was immediately peeked, informing Ling Xiao of everything the middle aged man had said three months ago, including the stuff about the rules and the master. This was something he couldn\u2019t figure out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Ling Xiao immediately organized all these scraps of info and asked, looking at You XiaoMo, \u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo slowly began,\u201d This pill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao immediately understood what he wanted to say and held the pill up to him. \u201cStrictly speaking, this isn\u2019t a magic pill, but you could call it that if you really wanted to. I\u2019ve never seen something like this before either. It should be a method the TongTian Emperor and that middle aged man thought up, to transcend into the level of the Almighty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Almighty?\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat level is called the Almighty, but there can only be one, so if one were to transcend into the Almighty, then no one else will be able to. Since the last one is dead, it\u2019s unsurprising that the TongTian Emperor wants to become the Almighty.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smacked his lips and said, \u201cBut that middle aged man said that the master of the rules has already died. If he\u2019s really that powerful, then how did he die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a huge secret, and very few \u2013 definitely less than five \u2013 people know. It\u2019s doubtful that even the TongTian Emperor knows.\u201d Ling Xiao suddenly adopted a mysterious tone of voice.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up and asked in a low tone, \u201cThen do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at him. \u201cOf course I do, do you want me to tell you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately nodded, \u201cTell me, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao beckoned at him with a finger.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo leaned in and just as he offered up his ear, it was bitten. A wet tongue licked over his ear, even attempting slide inside. With a shudder, he tried to push away, but was dragged back, a pair of hands groping his body and making his limbs feel weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me or not?\u201d You XiaoMo straightened his clothing. That guy had just had his rut yesterday, and it went on for several hours. He really couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao could only hold him, staring hungrily at the soft body hidden within his clothes as he replied mysteriously, \u201cYou have probably heard of the previous Almighty, the first master of the TongTian Palace. Though there can only be one Almighty at a time, this isn\u2019t certain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The first master of the TongTian Palace was similar to the current TongTian Emperor. He was a man who looked serious and honest, but was actually petty and deceitful. He had become the Almighty a thousand years before the ancient war. Because he was afraid of the power of the Four Ancient Beast Clans, he triggered the ancient war in an attempt to destroy the Four Ancient Beast Clans.</p><br/><p>He did this because he had figured out that after he became the Almighty, the Four Ancient Beast Clans were the biggest threat to his position through the legacy of their blood.</p><br/><p>The reason why he felt threatened by the Four Ancient Beast Clans as the Almighty was because, in a time more ancient than ancient times, there was a legend about the Four Ancient Beasts. A being far more powerful than the Four Ancient Beast Clans would be conceived through the perfect amalgamation of the bloodlines of the Four Ancient Beast merged. This being\u2019s power could even rival the Almighty.</p><br/><p>It was this being that the Almighty felt threatened by.</p><br/><p>However, never mind the palace master\u2019s thoughts, the Four Ancient Beasts wouldn\u2019t allow this being to be conceived. After all, who was willing to be ruled over like that?</p><br/><p>The Four Ancient Beast Clans were all prideful creatures. They had been at the top of the TongTian Continent for so long, enough that they even snubbed the Almighty. In addition, this being would only be created from a perfect amalgamation of the bloodlines of the Four Ancient Beast Clans, which meant a fourth of the blood of each clan. The Four Ancient Beast Clans looked highly upon the purity of their blood, so it was clear to see that this being could never come into existence.</p><br/><p>However, the Almighty wasn\u2019t convinced. The Four Ancient Beast Clans were still threats.</p><br/><p>And so he plotted the ancient war.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

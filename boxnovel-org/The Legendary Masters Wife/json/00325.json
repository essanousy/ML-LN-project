The two pressed their foreheads together, their breaths unusually heated. The heat made You XiaoMo\u2019s face redden.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pushed a leg between his two, the heat of his body seeping through their clothes. His low voice spoke up once more, \u201cAre you really certain?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lowered his head, his embarrassment turning to irritation as he yelled, \u201cShut up! If you\u2019re going to do it, then do it.\u201d Ling Xiao actually asked if he was certain for this sort of thing. Didn\u2019t Ling Xiao remember who it was that forced him to this point?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao chuckled lightly, \u201cI was afraid you only agreed out of sympathy.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the so called giving an inch, taking a mile!</p><br/><p>It was a shame that You XiaoMo hadn\u2019t realized that he was being manipulated by Ling Xiao. SheQiu knew, but he didn\u2019t have the chance to say anything. Even if he did, he probably wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Usually, his laughter sounded heartless, but it was different today.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s heart had been swayed, so he thought Ling Xiao was giving a strained laugh.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gritted out, \u201cWho would feel sympathy for you? Do you think your backstory could be more tragic than mine? Your parents are still alive, but mine are dead\u2026\u201d He was talking about this life. This was what Jiang Liu had told him in the beginning.</p><br/><p>If they continued down this road, they might go off topic</p><br/><p>The atmosphere he had managed to create would be ruined, too.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hurriedly turned things back on track. He lifted You XiaoMo\u2019s chin and kissed the words from his mouth. This soft and tempting taste was something he hadn\u2019t had in five days.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s other hand roamed over You XiaoMo\u2019s body. After training in the Gravity Mountains, the young man\u2019s body had become far more flexible, his skin soft but with an inner strength; he couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s lips were parted, submissively accepting Ling Xiao\u2019s rather rough kiss. It might\u2019ve been because it was their first time outside and any man or beast could easily walk in on them, that he was more excited than usual, his body trembling. He didn\u2019t even notice it when his sash was loosened to reveal his under clothing.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao impatiently tore off his clothes, gaining contact with an expanse of smooth, tender skin, familiar enough to make him sigh in pleasure. You XiaoMo\u2019s body startled slightly and soon, a tent formed below.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao felt it, his smile widening and causing You XiaoMo\u2019s heart to skip a beat. He suddenly reached out and took off Ling Xiao\u2019s mask, revealing his uniquely handsome face, enchanting under the light.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but grind against the leg between his, bold and open enough that Ling Xiao began to react as well, his breaths coming out rapidly. He tore off his outer robe and casually threw it to one side before leading down to bite at those lips again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt a sting, but didn\u2019t retreat, instead biting back. This caused Ling Xiao\u2019s delight and desire to rise as one.</p><br/><p>It was only until You XiaoMo could barely draw breath fast enough that Ling Xiao released his lips, gently kissing them. One hand grabbed his waist, hiking him up against Ling Xiao\u2019s own body, while the other ripped open his inner robe. The delicate pale flesh was exposed, including the two buds on his chest, tempting Ling Xiao into lowering his head and taking one into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but cry out, his hands tightly hugging Ling Xiao\u2019s head. It felt so intense, making him want to flee and take more at the same time.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pressed him heavily against the tree, not forgetting the other nub. His fingers twisted and pinched at it restlessly, the two points of stimulation causing You XiaoMo\u2019s legs to weaken. It was much more intense than before\u2026</p><br/><p>An hour later, Ling Xiao lay on top of You XiaoMo, panting, the two hugging each other tightly and basking in the aftermath.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gently let his legs down and then held You XiaoMo\u2019s limp body up, his voice a little raspy and desire still present in his eyes. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo let Ling Xiao take all of his weight, his legs still trembling. He said, \u201cI\u2019m never \u2018battling\u2019 in the wild again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since his back had been up against a tree, his entire back was burning, as well as below, soaked. This was too intense; no wonder Ling Xiao would bet with him. He couldn\u2019t take it. One time was enough for this sort of lovemaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s a shame.\u201d Ling Xiao rubbed his head.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo slapped his hand a way. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said with a smile, \u201cBut didn\u2019t you enjoy it greatly as well? You were more excited than usual.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flush on You XiaoMo\u2019s face had yet to die down, and now it had deepened, with Ling Xiao\u2019s words. He stuttered, \u201cWhat are y-you going on about? I-I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao picked up the clothes and mask they had discarded. \u201cGo into your pocket dimension and come out after washing yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t have the courage to appear in this condition in front of anyone, pulling Ling Xiao into the dimension with him.</p><br/><p>By the time they got back out, no traces of their passions were visible.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even if it wasn\u2019t for gambling, they would want to check it out, so he had already expected You XiaoMo to call him again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the employee who had an expression of \u2018just as I expected\u2019 to the point that it was a bit annoying.</p><br/><p>You are an employee, you don\u2019t need to use your brain, just an \u2018able-bodied\u2019 person is enough.</p><br/><p>Before they walked out the door, You XiaoMo stopped the employee, first slowly walking past him and then casually throwing out the words, \u201cYou know what? I could just call another employee to guide me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Employee, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of the employee they arrived at the entrance of the underground gambling house. It was a four to five meter wide entrance with a staircase extending downwards and even had a red carpet laid on top, giving the appearance of high-end luxury. Bustling noises kept appearing from below and from the entrance one could briefly see the shadows of gamblers walking around.</p><br/><p>As the employee brought them down, he explained, \u201cIf the two guests want to play, you can exchange for chips. The smallest amount is one spirit gem and the largest being one million.\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing on the last step, the employee pointed towards a huge counter to the right of the exit and told them that was the place to exchange for chips. It was similar to 21st century Earth, since if the amount was large, putting a huge pile of spirits gems would be unsightly. It might also attract unwanted attention.</p><br/><p>The employee simply brought them to the gambling house and after taking You XiaoMo\u2019s one spirit gem, he left.</p><br/><p>Before he left though, he told them that if they wanted to play but didn\u2019t know how, they could ask one of the attendants and they would help them learn the basics.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t find one and instead went to the counter to exchange for five one spirit gem chips. He then looked excitedly at Ling Xiao, \u201cDo you know how to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a straight face he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched, and here he thought he would say he knew. Since the gambling house looked famous, he thought Ling Xiao would have been here before.</p><br/><p>After pondering for a while, You XiaoMo decided to exchange for fifteen more chips, giving ten to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we can learn together.\u201d</p><br/><p>With an unchanging expression Ling Xiao held onto the chips and said, \u201cYou would have to keep up with me then.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused for a few seconds before realizing what he had said. As \u2018disabled\u2019 person who was used to being \u2018hurt\u2019, his tolerance was getting better and better. He would even say outright that he had low IQ, not wavering a bit, at most he would just spit on him a little in his heart.</p><br/><p>Since the beginning of time, the most prevalent game in a gambling house was dice.</p><br/><p>The Shuang Yu gambling house was no exception, not only that, there was different kinds of dice. Not only were there a six-sided dice but also eight-sided dice, different dice also had different games. After taking a look around, You XiaoMo felt that the high-low dice game was the easiest, with a 50% chance of winning, but luck was very important too.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, how about we play this?\u201d You XiaoMo said with excitement as he dragged Ling Xiao to a table and watched them gamble. It made him itch for a shot too.</p><br/><p>After taking a look, Ling Xiao stated with distaste, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to play with high and low?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at him unhappily.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a teasing voice cut in, \u201cThen you would be wrong, any kind of a gamble has its exhilarating nature and riskiness. Most people are here for those kind of feelings, even if its something like high-low dice game, there are still people who enjoy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two turned at the same time to find a cleanly dressed middle-aged man. Seeing that they were looking his direction, he walked over. \u201cThe two of you, it\u2019s your first time here at a gambling house, correct?\u201d The middle-aged said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ling Xiao asked back.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man smiled coolly and said, \u201cI simply saw that you were troubled by what to play so I couldn\u2019t help but give a suggestion, that\u2019s all. If the two of you are playing for the first time then I would recommend high-low, to get a hang of things first, before playing others.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took another look at him and smiled hearing this, \u201cThank you for your suggestion, uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man nodded and opened his mouth as if to speak.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly pulled Ling Xiao away to another table, as if he hadn\u2019t noticed the middle-aged man wanting to say something.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man, who had been rude, looked at their backs and curled his lip before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne who is unaccountably solicitous must be hiding evil intentions!\u201d You XiaoMo muttered as he looked around.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao twisted his head properly to face the six o\u2019clock position before saying, \u201cThere, a table without many people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Much to You XiaoMo\u2019s surprise, that table was playing high-low, and had exactly two spots left. Without courtesy he quickly took a spot and that\u2019s when the dealer had a glint in his eyes. Behind them, those who saw this all gloated over the others misfortune.</p><br/><p>For those first-timers, if they weren\u2019t accompanied by a familiar face, they were most likely going to be tricked.</p><br/><p>The dealer shook the dice cup intensely before placing it back onto the table, \u201cPlease place your bets.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked Ling Xiao, \u201cShould we bet high or low?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao casually looked at the bets placed by two others on the same table and answered, \u201cThen, bet small.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo placed on chip on the word \u2018small\u2019.</p><br/><p>The dealer stared at the chip, mouth slightly twitching, before lifting up the cup to see the number. With excitement he said, \u201cOne, one, three, small. Congratulations, such a great opening, lets keep up the good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that he threw a chip back at You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Even though it wasn\u2019t much, You XiaoMo still showed it triumphally to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>On the second round You XiaoMo still asked Ling Xiao about what to bet and Ling Xiao told him to continue betting small.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo continued betting one chip, it was still small, he won another chip\u2026then the third round, the fourth\u2026until the tenth round he was still winning by betting on small. Even the dealer\u2019s hands started to shake.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was still betting one chip, no matter if he won or not he never changed his mind. However, slowly the dealer was getting impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur honorable guest, if you are so lucky today, why not bet a little more? Aren\u2019t you here for the exhilarating feeling? If you only bet one chip at a time, over time you would still get bored, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they say that small wagers are good fun, but large ones are dangerous?\u201d You XiaoMo looked up at him, blinked and continued, \u201cAlso, I don\u2019t find it boring, in fact I find a quite fun\u2026\u201d \u2026looking at your colorful expressions.</p><br/><p>The dealer was taken back, something seemed off.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I can see, aren\u2019t you just a pitifully poor person with no spirit gems?\u201d From the crowd appeared a mocking laugh. Once You XiaoMo turned around to check, he couldn\u2019t find the person and the person seemed to have no intention of revealing themselves.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned back to the dealer asking, \u201cAre we continuing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dealer\u2019s whole face twitched slightly.</p><br/><p>The voice sounded again, \u201cPoor people should just be kicked out of the gambling house. So, disgusting to look at.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rowed his eyes and muttered to himself, \u201cThen that\u2019s perfect, I\u2019ll stay here just to disgust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t on\u2019t know if it was because they were left with no words, but there wasn\u2019t any response. You XiaoMo continued to bet small, but this time he had ten chips. Looking up at the dealer, in a \u2018fine-I\u2019ll-play-along\u2019 voice said, \u201cNow it\u2019s fine right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The dealer, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling heavily tricked, the dealer decided not to throw the long line to catch the fish and instead opened the dice cup with three, four, five, big, eating away the ten chips from You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, see, the moment I add more I lose. If it\u2019s like this how dare I add more.\u201d With a sign You XiaoMo said looking at Ling Xiao, \u201cYou were right, it\u2019s too boring betting on high-low dices. I don\u2019t want to play anymore, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two stood up, ready to leave and that was when five people appeared out the crowd, blocking them. None of them appeared friendly and their auras were not weak either.</p><br/><p>Behind them, the dealer walked over without the fake smile that was to trick You XiaoMo to bet more and instead it was replaced with a sinister smile. Looking at the fearful expression of the others, one could tell he was behind this.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re already here, then don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perplexed, You XiaoMo asked, \u201cDaGe, we don\u2019t have a grudge, do we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pleased, the dealer laughed, \u201cWe don\u2019t have one, but you do with my brother. If you mess with him, you mess with me. Consider yourselves unlucky, you could\u2019ve messed with anymore, but you choose my brother. Since he wanted me to get back at you, if you don\u2019t leave something behind tonight, where would my face as Wu Cheng go? But you know, I was going to look for you, didn\u2019t think you\u2019d arrive right at my doorstep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Automatically, You XiaoMo\u2019s head flashed over a certain someone\u2019s silhouette, if they had a grudge against someone, then it could only be that extremely petty youngster. Didn\u2019t think he would be on brotherly terms with someone of the gambling house.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing, this person here is at peak seven-star Emperor level, what do we do? I\u2019m not a match for him at all, we are so dead.\u201d You XiaoMo said with apocalyptic expression as he ran behind Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Without any grace, Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing his cowardly gesture, the crowd started laughing, with the hitters who blocked their way, laughing the hardest.</p><br/><p>Just as Cheng Wu was about to speak with a face of disdain, a sudden cry of pain sounded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was hesitant since it was related to his secret. If he chose not to tell and they came again, the commotion would not go unnoticed by the Vice Principal.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked over at Ling Xiao, if he had known earlier, he could\u2019ve fully prepared a proper testimony with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>That was when Ling Xiao spoke directly in his mind, \u201cJust leave this to me, you just need to nod.\u201dYou XiaoMo blinked in response, an indication that he understood.</p><br/><p>A while later, Yan Fa finally brought them to their destination, a meeting room. Inside, five people stood wearing serious expressions, emitting a suffocating and oppressive pressure.</p><br/><p>There was only one-person You XiaoMo recognized and that was the Fifth Elder Dong Han.</p><br/><p>As Yan Fa walked in, he gestured in obeisance towards the Elder who stood in the center wearing a black cloak and spoke, \u201cGrand Elder, I have brought them both.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the black cloaked Elder nodded with a frigidness, his piercing gaze landed on Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt his heart race as the tension caused him to break out in a cold sweat. The Elder\u2019s imposing manner was so nerve-wrecking that with just a glance, You XiaoMo\u2019s knees almost buckled beneath him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao too, showed a little sign of weakness as his face paled, to not raise suspicion, but not to the point of You XiaoMo of course.</p><br/><p>With the corner of his eyes, You XiaoMo caught this and couldn\u2019t help but curse at Ling Xiao\u2019s award winning acting skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn detail, recall the events you saw at Uneven Slopes,\u201d the Grand Elder finally spoke, his voice didn\u2019t sound old, but instead a hint of youthfulness in it.</p><br/><p>As Ling Xiao was about to speak, the Grand Elder suddenly turned to You XiaoMo and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll speak instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes widened immediately. Did they need to be this cautious?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare look over to Ling Xiao since everyone was staring at him, as if to find some sort of clue.</p><br/><p>At this point, You XiaoMo was sweating all over. He quickly tried to reorganize his scattered brain, attempting to find the right answer. After a while he finally stuttered something out, \u201cI-it\u2019s\u2026a-a-actually\u2026ummmm\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yan Fa listened to this horrific response, he felt the slight urge to palm his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush, talk slowly,\u201d he advised.</p><br/><p>Instantly You XiaoMo turned to Yan Fa and responded, \u201cYou are all looking at me and it makes me nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Yan Fa\u2019s lip twitched.</p><br/><p>The reality was, facing so many dignified Elders, You XiaoMo felt the nervousness of being pulled out during class to recite a poem from memory. To someone of little presence as him, that kind of emotional pressure was beyond great. Not only that, he still hadn\u2019t been able to organize his thoughts, much less communicate it.</p><br/><p>After a few seconds of staring, the Grand Elder finally gave up and turned towards Ling Xiao, \u201cYou speak instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>With unchanging expression, Ling Xiao started, \u201cYes Grand Elder, what happened was\u2026\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s rendition of the events at Uneven Slopes transformed them, the main characters, into bystanders. As the two sides fought, they sneaky slipped in and when the level nine demon beast went to spectate, they dug up the Ling Cao. As for who was fighting? They had no idea.</p><br/><p>Although when Dong Shen come find them again, the lie would be exposed, but to deal the Grand Elder, this was the only answer. They didn\u2019t have a better reason as to why they were able to complete the task.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that all, were you able to catch their appearances?\u201d Asked the Grand Elder.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it was too far away but this student did see a gigantic demon beast appear above Uneven Slopes. That beast was of a deep blue color, as were his eyes, very beautiful just like the Sirens. This student can tell, it was stronger than the Bird of Pride of Uneven Slope.\u201d Ling Xiao replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it have been\u2026the Netherworld Siren?\u201d Yan Fa immediately thought of this demon beast and according to his description, it was most likely the case. However, how could an Emperor Beast appear on Long Xiang Continent?</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that person dared kill one of our students, we will find them no matter what!\u201d The Grand Elder spoke turning to You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, \u201cYou may go now, remember, do not speak a word about this to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Assenting to this, the two left.</p><br/><p>After they walked out, then did the Second Elder speak, \u201cGrand Elder, do you think they lied?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the Grand Elder replied, the Elder wearing yellow, the Third Elder explained, \u201cWhy would they have an incentive to lie? I went with the Grand Elder to the scene, according to the scent left behind, I\u2019m almost confident it was that Netherworld Siren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose people wouldn\u2019t have appeared at Uneven Slopes without a reason. For the time being, keep a close eye on it, if they have an objective, they will appear again.\u201d Concluded the Grand Elder.</p><br/><p>Once out of the meeting room, You XiaoMo let out a sign of relief.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to speak, Ling Xiao stopped him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly covered his mouth. He knew, the walls had ears, although there were really no walls surrounding them.</p><br/><p>In this unscientific world, something like science could just disappear!</p><br/><p>Looking at his face that spelled \u201cI know\u201d across it, the corner of Ling Xiao\u2019s mouth twitched a little, but he said nothing.</p><br/><p>Once You XiaoMo saw the accommodation area, he couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer, \u201cCan I talk now?\u201d He felt as if he was going to suffocate to death with all the queries he had.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked over, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo opened his mouth to speak, the corner of his eyes caught sight of everyone staring at them and quickly said, \u201cNever mind, let\u2019s talk later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as if he saw an idiot, Ling Xiao looked at him and quickly walked on.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose feeling a little guilty and followed suit.</p><br/><p>Once they were back, You XiaoMo conscientiously closed the door and just as he was about to walk in, there was a knocking sound. Impatiently he turned to find Tang YuLin at the door, probably seeking information.</p><br/><p>Before he said anything, You XiaoMo spoke, \u201cThe Grand Elder told me to not say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Puzzled, Tang YuLin asked, \u201cWhat \u2018thing\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Anxiously You XiaoMo replied, \u201cWhat else could it be, it\u2019s about the death of the six students!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin looked at him hesitantly and said, \u201cMy deepest condolence to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sounded so familiar!</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin patted his shoulder in comfort, \u201cPeople can\u2019t come back to life, I know you\u2019re sad, but you still have to give me your points.\u201d As he spoke, he pulled out his magic bag. As You XiaoMo was attending the Trials, he was gathering some high-level magic herbs and it cost him a bunch of points. So, the moment You XiaoMo came back, he rushed over for repayment.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>He was wrong, Tang YuLin was not on the same wavelength.</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel Nine Magic Herbs were hard to find, it took me three hundred points to get two immature stalks and twenty or so Level Eight Magic Herb seeds.\u201d Tang YuLin spoke with glittering eyes as he stared at You XiaoMo. One hundred and fifty points for one immature magic herb stalk didn\u2019t sound that bad, but this was the result after his constant bargaining. To obtain this deal for these two stalks of magic herbs, he went to find the seller every single day to \u2018converse\u2019, and only stopped until the seller sold to him.</p><br/><p>The higher level the Magic Herb, the less likely it was on the market, thus most of what Tang YuLin found were seeds. It was fortunate that was exactly what You XiaoMo had wanted.</p><br/><p>Including the delivery fee, You XiaoMo gave Tang YuLin five hundred points in total. Level Eight Magic Herbs\u2019 seeds were worth a lot, but also not that much since it took hundreds of years to blossom. It was usually a hard sell so twenty or so seeds for one hundred points was not cheap, and a hundred points were for the delivery.</p><br/><p>Really, who could be this generous!</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin was usually an opportunist.</p><br/><p>Sending away the miser Tang YuLin, You XiaoMo was finally going to lock the door, no matter who knocked, he wasn\u2019t going to open it. But alas, as he was about to lock it, \u201cknock, knock\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo peeked out behind the door, as he saw Tong YueXu, he laughed, \u201cTong-dage, are you here for gossip?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu felt his words get stuck within his throat, \u201cNo\u2026I\u2019m just here to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you saw me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t see you out then!\u201d With a slam, he shut the door.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

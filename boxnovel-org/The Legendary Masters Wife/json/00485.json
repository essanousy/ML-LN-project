However, this year they were two months ahead of the schedule.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was a little surprised.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong became very agitated when he saw them. His eyes were narrowed into a thin line, making it impossible to tell what he was thinking but You XiaoMo felt a murderous gleam in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The people of Qing Feng Sect were very shocked when they saw Hu village with only two people left.</p><br/><p>At first they thought that the villagers of Hu village must have fled because they heard that Qing Feng Sect would arrive ahead of time, but seeing that the magic herbs were still in the fields, they felt even more puzzled.</p><br/><p>There were about two hundred households left in Hu village and almost every household had moved out completely, leaving nothing behind. With the actions of mere mortals, it would have been impossible to move so fast if they hadn\u2019t been prepared long beforehand. Furthermore, orders about the decision to bring forward their visit were only given yesterday.</p><br/><p>However, this doubt they had only briefly flashed across their minds before it was soon forgotten. The people that Qing Feng Sect had sent immediately had their attention drawn to the magic herbs in the magic herb fields.</p><br/><p>It was even better now with the ordinary people of Hu village gone. They only needed to bring the magic herbs back and they would be done with their task. They didn\u2019t even have to lay down a single crystal coin.</p><br/><p>The Hu village was a human village. There was no need to send a lot of people to deal with a few ordinary humans with no fighting power, so this time Qing Feng Sect only sent five people, including one low level mage.</p><br/><p>As there was no one in the village, they had to dig for the magic herbs themselves.</p><br/><p>As the saying went, someone who hadn\u2019t worked before would never know how tough work was for the working people. The people from Qing Feng Sect finally experienced it this time.</p><br/><p>They only dug for one hour and their tempers had already flared.</p><br/><p>Except for that mage who had it easier with the help of soul force, the rest were already suffering from back aches and sweating buckets. Their mouths never stopped cursing and they began to blame all they were going through on the villagers who had left.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Weng Gong who were hiding in the house heard their voices clearly.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong peered through the window and saw the magic herbs in the fields being dug up by them one by one. He turned around and looked towards You XiaoMo.\u201cAre you not going to stop them? Those are things you bought with your spirit gems. Don\u2019t you feel angry that the magic herbs are just dug up and taken away by them?\u201d He asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo let out a laugh, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Weng Gong looked at him for a few seconds before suddenly saying, \u201cI understand now. Your objective from the very beginning wasn\u2019t these magic herbs, that was just an excuse right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s lips curled up. He didn\u2019t try to hide it, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have said a single thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, my objective was to get the villagers to leave Hu village.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Weng Gong stared at him with burning gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you already know?\u201d You XiaoMo replied calmly.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong shook his head, \u201cYou are not related to Hu village, so how can it be that you\u2019re doing this to help our villagers? You must have some other motives right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled but didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong knew he guessed right but he only sighed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what objective you have, you have indeed helped us out. Otherwise, we definitely would have been beaten up and scolded by the people from Qing Feng Sect when the time came had we not be able to dig up the magic herbs in time. I thank you on behalf of the rest of the villagers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeng Gong, you don\u2019t have to thank me. You just have to treat it as we are taking what each of us need. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong was just about to open his mouth to speak when a sound came from the door. It sounded like it was the doing of the wind but not even a second later, a loud \u2018bam\u2019 was heard. The door was kicked open and a booming voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Ge, there\u2019s someone here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the people in the magic herb fields immediately dropped what they were doing and ran over. Wang Ge was their leader but this Qing Feng Sect was only a small fry. They were so weak! Tsk, tsk, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t even bear to look at them straight.</p><br/><p>Wang Ge walked in and saw an old man and a young man inside. He recognised Weng Gong because he usually came to collect the magic herbs but he didn\u2019t recognise You XiaoMo. However, he also didn\u2019t recognise every villager who lived in Hu village so he thought You XiaoMo was one of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s still people hiding here. Tell me, where have the villagers moved to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ge kicked the nearest chair to the ground and stepped on it with one foot, his attitude extremely arrogant. Every year, the villagers of Hu village would plant a few hundred thousand magic herbs for them and although the amount wasn\u2019t much, it was a source of income for Qing Feng Sect nevertheless. If the villagers were to all run away, they wouldn\u2019t have a next batch to collect after this one if they couldn\u2019t find people to plant the magic herbs for the next year.</p><br/><p>They had already checked out the neighboring villages and only the plot of land that the Hu village was on was suitable to grow these magic herbs.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong snorted coldly and didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>Wang Ge didn\u2019t plan to ask that old fella anyway. Every time he looked at them, it was like they were the enemies who had killed his father. He also knew about the old fella\u2019s situation but he wasn\u2019t the person who came to collect magic herbs ten years ago, it was his superior. His superior was promoted afterwards, so this job landed on him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ge looked towards You XiaoMo\u2019s completely unfamiliar face and said, \u201cHey kid, I\u2019m asking you something so answer me truthfully. If I so much as smell a lie, I\u2019ll make your life a living hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Ge is it? Sorry, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ge pulled out his sword immediately and slammed it on the table, \u201cNow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one told me, how would I know?\u201d You XiaoMo exclaimed in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like talking nicely doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Wang Ge picked up his sword and smiled sinisterly with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong immediately retreated behind You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>This was the first time someone sought him for protection so You XiaoMo was rather shocked. Usually he was the one who sought protection from others.</p><br/><p>Weng Gong thought he was unhappy about it, so he started grumbling, \u201cWhat, shouldn\u2019t an able-bodied young lad like you protect a weak and vulnerable old man like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of You a XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. Oh please, you\u2019re still moving around so quickly, he thought to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo Wang Ge, it seems like this person wants to fight us. Looks like if we don\u2019t teach him a lesson, others will think we are pushovers.\u201d Wang Ge\u2019s underling immediately started to laugh mockingly before continuing, \u201cWang Ge, just leave it to us to take care of this type of small fry. We\u2019ll easily deal with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, but don\u2019t kill him.\u201d Wang Ge said indifferently.</p><br/><p>His underling immediately patted his own chest as a gesture of reassurance.</p><br/><p>In the end, he was easily beaten by You XiaoMo. You XiaoMo even had the underling\u2019s head under his foot.</p><br/><p>With this kind of presence, Wang Ge\u2019s opponent was clearly stronger than him. Wang Ge was frightened by him and he suddenly wasn\u2019t as confident as before. Nevertheless, he was still a member of Qing Feng Sect and he didn\u2019t believe anyone would dare to go against Qing Feng Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA passerby.\u201d You XiaoMo raised his head and puffed out his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know the consequences of going against Qing Feng Sect?\u201d Wang Ge glanced at where the door was and said at the same time.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but what I do know is that if you continue to move back, I will let you know the consequences of going against me. Now you should consider whether to continue moving back or return to your original position.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ge stopped taking steps back and glared at him menacingly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked towards Weng Gong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeng Gong, how do you think we should punish him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Weng Gong stared at Wang Ge for a moment before suddenly turning his head away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou caught the person. How you want to punish him is up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo touched his nose and suggested, \u201cWell, what about killing them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Weng Gong\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>At his words, Wang Ge immediately shot up and roared. He drew his sword and charged all out at You XiaoMo like he was willing to die doing that if he had to.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight you to the death. \u201d</p><br/><p>Wow, what a short-tempered man he is!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally understood why Ling Xiao always liked to say that to him. It was a very subtle feeling. However, Wang Ge\u2019s power was only at the moon level. There was no sense of accomplishment in defeating him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, who had easily dealt with Wang Ge, didn\u2019t notice that when Weng Gong looked at him, his eyes were wider than ever before. When You XiaoMo finally turned his head, he retracted his gaze as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took care of the other three people together and then locked them all up in one house. Side by side they laid together, all knocked out by You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Although he said that he would kill them, he really didn\u2019t want to kill people for no reason, especially people much weaker than him. You XiaoMo got Weng Gong to wait for him while he ran back to the old couple\u2019s house to retrieve the Metal Swallowing Beast and the Golden Winged Insect. As they had a huge reaction when he brought them to the cave, he decided to just leave them in the house.</p><br/><p>When he returned to Weng Gong\u2019s house, a bloody smell drifted out from inside.</p><br/><p>As he walked in, he saw Weng Gong lifting a walking stick high up in the air before striking down hard on Wang Ge\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could feel his view of life exploding into pieces.</p><br/><p>Such a withered old man with a whole head of white hair actually killed without batting an eye. He even picked the head to strike. If not for his lack of strength, Wang Ge\u2019s head would have been smashed like a watermelon that had fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>How much hatred must he have to make such a decision?</p><br/><p>Seeing that he had returned, Weng Gong quietly wiped away the blood on the walking stick and limped as he came over, looking extremely lonely and pitiful.</p><br/><p>Hey, old guy, isn\u2019t it a bit too late to act pitiful?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the horrible state the five people were in. What was odd was that he felt nothing at all. He clicked his tongue. As expected, Ling Xiao had badly influenced him.</p><br/><p>Closing the door, You XiaoMo walked out of the house.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

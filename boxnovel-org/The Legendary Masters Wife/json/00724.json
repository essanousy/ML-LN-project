Thus there was no worries of someone intruding by accident, making it the perfect place for the negotiation.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao rode in the same car as the You Family members to their destination. During this period, they were assaulted three times and only when they were close to the academy did the attackers stop.</p><br/><p>Just as the car arrived, they met with the Li Family representatives by the gates of the academy. Before they spoke, the other\u2019s mocking tone arrived, \u201cGod\u2019s really blind, to think multiple assassination attempts skill couldn\u2019t kill some people. Truly, bastards live for a thousand years.\u201d</p><br/><p>The way he said it, it was easy to misinterpret it as they were the ones who attacked the You Family. However, it didn\u2019t matter to the Li Family. Ever since they completely turned against each other, they had fought in the dark countless time. Assassination attempts were just the basics, so even if they explained, the You Family might not believe them. Of course, that wasn\u2019t saying it wasn\u2019t them who sent those people over.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the You Family looked over, the one who spoke raised his chin up with a complacent expression.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a look at him with surprise. The one who spoke was a young man, with decent looks, but compared to You XiaoMo and You Lu, his sparkle seemed very dim. It was just sad, he clearly had been used as comparison to the You brothers often as he looked at them with so much hatred, as if he would eat them whole.</p><br/><p>However, the You Family had a tradition and that was when faced with people they disliked, they usually ignored them, treating them as air.</p><br/><p>As the young man finished, other than You XiaoMo no one even batted an eye and walked straight passed them to the Thunderclap Academy. You could tell he was pretty furious about it.</p><br/><p>The other Li Family member\u2019s expression also darkened. Just by this, clearly there was no chance of reconciliation. You XiaoMo didn\u2019t understand what those dying to reconcile the two families were thinking. Couldn\u2019t they tell that the Li Family were just a bunch of dumb-asses?</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, the You family\u2019s so mean.\u201d Li Lin turned around and complained to the middle-aged man beside him.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was Li Hong, the head of the Li Family. He had always been in competition with You Rong. The two families were both known for their magic pills, so Li Family not being as good as the You Family was one thing, but the real reason lies in appearances. He and You Rong were from the same generation with not many years between them, but their looks were from one end of a spectrum to another.</p><br/><p>You Rong was a graceful, handsome young man that had an aura of royalty around him. However, Li Hong was a beer belly middle-aged old man, even though he wasn\u2019t ugly, he definitely wasn\u2019t handsome either. He was just a normal middle-aged man. His son didn\u2019t inherit his appearance, probably inherited his mother\u2019s instead.</p><br/><p>Li Hong stared at the backs of the You family members with a darkened expression and said venomously, \u201cJust they wait, they won\u2019t be laughing for much longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Remembering their plan, Li Lin instantly smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re right, they only have now to laugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The place of negotiation was the Thunderclap Academy\u2019s meeting room. The massive room had already been filled up by two-thirds. Other than the You and Li family, everyone else was also important figures of Jindu. The kind that would shake the county with one move. If anything happened to these people, all of Country Z would be affected.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were already called over by the leader Qiao Sen, who was by the doorway.</p><br/><p>Escorting the You family members safety to their destination meant their mission was almost over, however that was just a part of it. Now, they had to help make sure the negotiation runs smoothly.</p><br/><p>Although there was a lot of important people who wished for their reconciliation, there was also those who wanted the opposite, otherwise the You family wouldn\u2019t have been attacked on a regular basis. Thus, they needed to be guard in case someone came to ruin the negotiation. Even though, from You XiaoMo\u2019s perspective, even without a third party, the two families wouldn\u2019t reconcile, but he still followed his orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas there anything abnormal during the two days you guys had been guarding the You family?\u201d Qiao Sen asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBasically nothing abnormal,\u201d You XiaoMo answered, and as if just thought of it, added, \u201cLast night, someone intruded the You house, but they also bit their tongue and committed suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Sen had wanted to ask if they got anything out of them, but his latter sentence stopped him. Instead he said, \u201cThose people may not stop there, you guys should pay extra attention. If you find anyone suspicious, don\u2019t act, tell me first, you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood?\u201d You XiaoMo nodded with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>Qiao Sen frowned at his casual attitude, but didn\u2019t say anything more. The fact that they could safely transport the You Family to the ThunderClap Academy was enough proof of their strength. As long as they did what they were told, he didn\u2019t care about anything else.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stood outside the meeting room and looked onto the tense atmosphere inside with glee. The negotiations hadn\u2019t even begun and they were already at each other\u2019s throats, he wondered if they could be so calm in their arguments when the real BOSS appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, when do you think that person will come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao leaned against the wall with a carefree attitude. Hearing his question, he grinned and said, \u201cI\u2019m not him, how should I know? However, eighty percent chance that he\u2019s going to come at the height of the negotiation. You people here are all like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his disapproving tone, You XiaoMo replied with a mocking tone, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying the people of the TongTian Continent aren\u2019t like this? You talk as if you\u2019re so special or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m I not special?\u201d Ling Xiao smiled back deviously.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo responded with a kick, \u201cYou definitely deserves a beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed out loud at his antics.</p><br/><p>His laughter \u2018infected\u2019 others, including those in a heated argument in the meeting room. Almost all of them looked over at the same time, it was quite the scene. Usually these kind of antics were exclusively You XiaoMo\u2019s but this time it was for Ling Xiao. You XiaoMo thought that was quite amazing.</p><br/><p>The air was silent for a moment until a cousin once removed of the Li family, Li Long, slapped the table and rose up, \u201cWhere did these unruly people come from? Don\u2019t you realize we are in a meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>This person had seen You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao walking together with the You Family, so he thought they were together. He just hit a brick wall with the You Family and thus he spread the anger onto Ling Xiao. However, he was clearly unlucky, even if he had picked on You XiaoMo it wouldn\u2019t have been as bad as choosing Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Compared to the You Family\u2019s habit of ignoring them, Ling Xiao truly didn\u2019t care and with a \u2018I\u2019m higher than you\u2019 attitude, as if looking down on meek creatures. He wasn\u2019t like this before, but ever since he became the Almighty, that feeling became clearer. Other than close family and friends, everyone else received the same treatment.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao casually took a glance over and the scorn in his eyes enraged the other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this person?! Are his eyes growing behind his head or something? How dare you openly disrupt our meeting! Are you looking down on everyone here?!\u201d Li Long exclaimed angrily, clearly trying to drag everyone along with him.</p><br/><p>Before anyone else reacted, You XiaoMo picked his ear and said with confusion, \u201cWhy have I been hearing dogs barking these days? Even at the school gates I heard it, am I hallucinating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard, what are you saying?\u201d Li Long said to You XiaoMo, with his eyes spitting out fire.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo exclaimed in surprise, \u201cUncle, could you be deaf? Did you not hear me? Too bad, I have no interest in repeating myself. You know what, just pretend I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Now the Li family head, Li Hong was finally angered as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo! Don\u2019t say anymore!\u201d At the same time, Qiao Sen spoke as well.</p><br/><p>Before You XiaoMo realized what was wrong, Ling Xiao, who stood beside him, coughed. By the time You XiaoMo came to his senses, four burning gazes were already on him. The heat made him want to jump. He didn\u2019t even to look to know that they must be shocked. He completely forgot that Qiao Sen knew his name, because he didn\u2019t think they would met up with You Bo and the others so quickly and didn\u2019t change his name.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tried his best to ignore those gazes as his neck slowly inched backwards, until his whole body was behind the wall and those inside couldn\u2019t see him anymore. Then, he latched himself onto Ling Xiao, with only one thought left in his mind.</p><br/><p>He was so screwed!</p><br/><p>Him revealing it and being exposed were two completely different things. He had thought about this problem before, his original plan was to wait till this thing finished and then reveal himself. However, once he knew about his family\u2019s attitude towards him, he wavered. Now, even as he hid behind the wall, he could still feel four penetrating gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWwwwwww, what should I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal with it yourself!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Take it out and see if the old geezer\u2019s information is there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, I nearly forgot about that.\u201d You XiaoMo was reminded, and promptly took out the jade drive. Using a hint of soul power, he rapidly scanned through the information on the jade drive before passing it to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The jade drive from Ning Jing-daoshi did not just contain profiles on all the high level mages, but it also included information on the other teachers. Most of the teachers were mentioned on the drive, and the data was quite complete.</p><br/><p>Besides the data, the jade drive also included portraits of a couple of the teachers. You XiaoMo recalled the information, but did not find any images that matched the old geezer. In addition, the highest level mage included was that of a peak level nine mage. The old geezer said that he was a level ten mage, but the jade drive did not even contain a single level ten mage.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould that old geezer have been lying to me?\u201d You XiaoMo could not help but hold some suspicions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t lie to you. He really is a level ten mage.\u201d Ling Xiao said. Even though his level was deeply hidden, Ling Xiao saw through him in an instant when they met in the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why isn\u2019t his profile on the jade drive? From his tone, he seems to be from DaoXin Academy.\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so strange about that? Qiu Ran was also from DaoXin Academy. It\u2019s highly likely that his master would be a teacher in the academy. That old geezer\u2019s level is quite high. your Ning Jing-daoshi probably doesn\u2019t have the authority to know of him.\u201d Ling Xiao lazed about on the chair with no indication of surprise.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked over at once and sat on another chair next to him, \u201cThen should I take him as my Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>That old man was very strange and erratic. You XiaoMo really did not know if taking him as a master would be good or bad. He was currently very cautious about apprenticing to a master.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my opinion\u2026\u201d Ling Xiao stroked his chin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell?\u201d You XiaoMo immediately moved closer and looked at him expectantly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grinned at him, and suddenly grabbed his neck. Before You XiaoMo could even let out an exclamation, Ling Xiao kissed him, and taking advantage of You XiaoMo\u2019s opened mouth, thrust his tongue in.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo saw Ling Xiao smile at him, his mind sounded an internal alarm. This guy really had some sort of objective! However, You XiaoMo did not have the time to retreat before his neck was grabbed, and a tongue thrust into his mouth. In a flash, a burst of intense pleasure coursed through him, and only when he was panting heavily did Ling Xiao release him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao licked off the saliva at the corner of his mouth, and with a hint of satisfaction, said, \u201cThat old geezer would be very useful to you right now. There\u2019s no harm in apprenticing to him. If you really dislike it, just wait until he is of no more use before kicking him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolled his eyes. Do you think apprenticing is like paying house? If he really does that, he would really have to carry a criminal charge of \u2018deceiving master, shaming ancestors\u2019 for the rest of his life. \u201cLet\u2019s put the matter of apprenticing to the side. I feel that Ning Jing-daoshi knows that old geezer. I\u2019ll find another chance to ask her. First, I need to apologize to the teacher from Class Three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Ling Xiao said, and without waiting for a reply, he picked You XiaoMo up and walked toward the exit of the pavilion.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo started struggling when he saw that Ling Xiao wanted to walk out while carrying him. \u201cPut me down, I will walk by myself.\u201d If someone saw this scene, his image and reputation, that took much so effort to build, would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao loosened his grip, and You XiaoMo dropped down. Fortunately, he was prepared but with a height of less than fifty centimetres, it would be hard to fall flat on one\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo spent a lot of effort to find the teacher\u2019s residence as he did not know where he lived.</p><br/><p>The teachers and elders in the academy lived in a different area from the students. However, both areas were not too far apart. The teachers for Block Two lived in the Chrysanthemum Courtyard. The place was very scenic, with mountains on one side and bodies of water on the other. The environment and living conditions were much better than the Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter Courtyards.</p><br/><p>When the Class Three teacher heard that the student who played truant this morning came to look for him, he did not want to see You XiaoMo, and instead, wanted to demonstrate his authority. But when he thought of You XiaoMo\u2019s potential, he reluctantly allowed You XiaoMo to enter.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo did not deliberately conceal his level. Thus when he entered, the teacher discovered his advancement. His plan to severely reprimand You XiaoMo was disrupted, and his heartbeat increased. Could it be that since You XiaoMo advanced, he went to Class Four for lessons?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo did not have any mind-reading abilities. But even if he knew what the teacher was thinking, You XiaoMo would not dare to lie as the truth of the matter could be easily found. Thus he sincerely apologized and explained the things that happened in the morning.</p><br/><p>In the end, the teacher had the same reaction as Ning Jing-daoshi. His expression changed and he impatiently dismissed You XiaoMo. Since the teacher did not seem prepared to look into You XiaoMo\u2019s truancy, You XiaoMo was very happy and relaxed as he left the teacher\u2019s residence with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The time limit of three days passed in a flash. You XiaoMo did not even have the time to investigate the identity of the old man before he came knocking on their door early in the morning.</p><br/><p>As the old man could not enter the pavilion, he stood outside and loudly shouted You XiaoMo\u2019s name. As a result, he woke up the person who was bundled up in bed and having a nice dream. Streams of loud curses were suddenly heard, and this frightened You XiaoMo out of bed. Thus he hurriedly ushered the old man into the pavilion.</p><br/><p>As SheQiu and the rest were put into his dimension, there were only Ling Xiao and him left in the pavilion.</p><br/><p>Seeing a yawning Ling Xiao descend from the stairs with rumpled clothes, the old man\u2019s eyes bulged and he pointed at Ling Xiao while shouting in anger, \u201cWho are you?! Why are you in my disciple\u2019s pavilion?!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly realized that this turn of events was far from good.</p><br/><p>But Ling Xiao was already energized by the shout. He lazily leaned against the stairs while casting a sidelong glance at the old geezer, and with a beaming smile, he said, \u201cBecause I am sleeping here ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSleeping? Isn\u2019t this my disciple\u2019s pavilion?\u201d The old man had not caught onto Ling Xiao\u2019s implication.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is also my pavilion.\u201d Ling Xiao boasted with exuberance.</p><br/><p>The old man still did not get the hint, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a single person pavilion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled and nodded, \u201cYes, it\u2019s a single person pavilion.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man stared blankly, \u201c? ? ?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we sleep in the same bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d The old man fell silent for a second, before he abruptly exploded, \u201cYou-you-you\u2026 \u2026Why are you sleeping in the same bed as my disciple?! What ambitions do you have?! You better heed my warning and move out immediately! If not, there will be consequences!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao let out an infuriating smile, \u201cWell then, I\u2019m sorry to say that I not only slept on the bed, I also\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, you shut up!\u201d You XiaoMo bellowed as he was finally shamed into anger.</p><br/><p>This time, Ling Xiao obediently shut his mouth. His wifey looked as if he was about to shoot flames at him if he did not.</p><br/><p>The old man was shocked by You XiaoMo\u2019s roar and was startled out of his temper. But he was very pleased, as the one that his disciple bellowed at was not him. The old man was so gratified that he lost his sense of measure and put on airs as he needled Ling Xiao, \u201cDid you hear that? He told you to shut it, ne. You can leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also shut up!\u201d From the side, You XiaoMo\u2019s menacing voice immediately floated over.</p><br/><p>The old man immediately shut his mouth. This disciple\u2019s temperament was even worse than his.</p><br/><p>Seeing the two finally quiet down, You XiaoMo calmed his temper and walked towards the tea table to pour a cup of tea. The old man thought that You XiaoMo \u2018saw the light\u2019 and had decided to apprentice to him. He cleared his throat while waiting for You XiaoMo to offer tea and was raising his hand to accept the cup\u2026 \u2026but in the next moment, his glass heart was shattered into numerous shards.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo heard a laugh. He turned his head and saw Ling Xiao leaning against the railing of the stairs. His shoulders were shaking, and he looked as though he was about to burst into gales of laughter. Following Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze, You XiaoMo saw the old man\u2019s expression after he was dealt a heavy blow and was immediately puzzled. He put down the cup of tea he drank a mouthful from, and asked in surprise, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing happened. When are you going to accept me as your master?\u201d The old man was afraid that Ling Xiao would blab about his gaffe, and hurriedly changed the topic.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pursed his lips, \u201cI can be your disciple, but you must earnestly teach me!\u201d He specifically emphasised the word \u2018earnestly\u2019, in hopes that the old man would immediately pass the Heavenly Soul Scripture to him.</p><br/><p>The old man promptly patted his chest and guaranteed: \u201cDo not worry, if you become my disciple, I will not let you suffer any losses.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words did not have a guarantee, but You XiaoMo was not afraid that he would not be \u2018earnest\u2019. As Ling Xiao said, if the geezer really duped him, he would just have to fire this master.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was not very clear on the formalities of becoming an apprentice, so he just kow-towed to the old man a few times. The old man did not nit-pick on his actions and was extremely happy to take in this apprentice. He also gave You XiaoMo a \u2018meeting for the first time\u2019 gift. It was a beautiful white jade box with unknown contents.</p><br/><p>After sending his master off, You XiaoMo returned to the pavilion and immediately opened the gift.</p><br/><p>Just by opening the lid a crack, an extremely rich herbal fragrance rushed out. It caused the sleepy Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes to widen and he muttered, \u201cA level nine magic pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo set the lid of the jade box to one side. Inside the box was a bright yellow magic pill. At a first glance, it is mostly likely a middle grade level nine magic pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat old geezer is really quite generous to just hand over a level nine magic pill to his disciple without any conditions.\u201d Ling Xiao took a deep breath \u2013 only magic pills of level nine and above were of use to him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallowed. This was an unexpected turn of events, seemed like it was quite a good decision to take the old geezer as his master. You XiaoMo then passed the jade box over to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised his eyebrow in surprise, \u201cAre you giving this to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blushed and rubbed his nose, \u201cI know that my level is too low and the magic pills that I refine are not much use to you. Anyway, since I don\u2019t need this level nine magic pill, I might as well give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao silently looked at him, and suddenly pulled You XiaoMo into his arms. He gently exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m very touched that you gave the magic pill to me. To repay you, I have decided that tonight we will do it one more time, ba.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s head was momentarily filled with a pile of spider webs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Who knows if there\u2019ll be any retribution in the future!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao already knew what You XiaoMo\u2019s answer would be, \u201cOkay, then what do you say we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks towards the streets that are becoming more and more deserted and suddenly sees the the back of a stooped figure that\u2019s standing with their back facing them in a corner. His eyes sparkle and immediately he walks over to ask, \u201cThis old lady, do you know the locations of the closest taverns or inns?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old lady slowly turns around, a face suffused with black suddenly appears in front of You XiaoMo. When she sees him, she grins and starts to laugh, revealing two rows of teeth that are so black they look like they haven\u2019t been cleaned for a few hundred years. She stares at You XiaoMo with austere gloominess and chuckles, \u201cHey young boy, my house has rooms to stay in. Do you want to go back home with granny?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo becomes petrified in an instant.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suppresses his laughter and walks over, facing the old person who clearly has a problem. He softly spits out one word, \u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old granny is startled and without needing Ling Xiao to say a second word, she immediately disappears out of sight.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, who\u2019s just taken a blow, is feeling blue and lets Ling Xiao hold him. After a quarter of an hour, they find a tavern that can\u2019t be considered to be upscale but isn\u2019t simple and crude either. Due to the fact that there are many people who seek lodging, all the fairly good rooms have already been booked. There\u2019s only a low class single room left, however the price is still not cheap. It actually costs ten gold coins, the same price as a top class room in NanYe City.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao simply pays the gold coins, he can still afford to dish out ten coins.</p><br/><p>The room is small, as expected. It also only has a fairly small bed, but compared to You XiaoMo\u2019s room back in the Peak, it\u2019s not that much smaller. Ling Xiao, who\u2019s already used to squishing on a bed with You XiaoMo, doesn\u2019t mind.</p><br/><p>As soon as You XiaoMo recovers from his petrification, he\u2019s dragged by Ling Xiao to take a bath.</p><br/><p>The tavern doesn\u2019t have a hot spring, if one wants to take a shower, only the HaHa[1] lad can heat the water. The lad is quite hardworking and fills up an entire large bucket of hot water in no time. Taking the single gold coin given by Ling Xiao, the lad has a huge smile on his face when he leaves.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao just moves toward You XiaoMo and wants to help him take off his clothes. You XiaoMo immediately takes a few steps back, using his hand to prevent the other from walking over and quickly says, \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shrugs his shoulders like he doesn\u2019t really care and the other person turns around right away.</p><br/><p>Just as he\u2019s in the middle of undressing, You XiaoMo suddenly hears a ruffling sound coming from behind him, he turns around to see Ling Xiao already halfway through taking off his clothes. Startled, he asks, \u201cWhat are you doing taking off your clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking a bath ah!\u201d Ling Xiao says as if it\u2019s an obvious answer.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately ties up the clothes he\u2019s just untied halfway, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 you wash first ba?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao takes off the last piece of clothing on his upper body revealing a naked and sturdy chest and grins at him. \u201cI\u2019ll give you two options. One is you wash together with me, two is I help you wash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling that the second option is fairly safe, however\u2026 You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t believe Ling Xiao is so kind. There\u2019s definitely a meaning behind it that he doesn\u2019t know about, and so, he weakly asks, \u201cIs there a third option?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is!\u201d Ling Xiao laughs and gently says, \u201cWe can go and engage in an \u2018exchange\u2019 on the bed first, then wash up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he lets out a sigh of relief, You XiaoMo is frightened by the last sentence, the third option is fudging[2] more ferocious than the first and second one. He doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019ll still be able to get off the bed after the \u2018exchange\u2019.</p><br/><p>After making a comprehensive consideration, You XiaoMo still chooses the second option, at least it sounds more normal than the first one. Then, at worst, he\u2019ll consider himself a small child who\u2026 still doesn\u2019t know how to take a bath.</p><br/><p>After hearing his answer, Ling Xiao\u2019s expression floated.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, it floated, eyes expressing a lovingly pink emotion floated on his body here and there, before changing into a glimmer of a prevailing smile.</p><br/><p>Feeling that he\u2019s just made a terrible decision, You XiaoMo sees Ling Xiao bend his back and\u2026 start to take off his pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge[3], why are you taking off your pants?\u201d You XiaoMo almost bit his own tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo take a bath ah!\u201d Ling Xiao gives an obvious answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou you you\u2026 weren\u2019t you going to help me wash up? Why are you taking off your own pants?\u201d After he finishes speaking, he really wants to just bite off his own tongue. Isn\u2019t this telling the other to take off his pants?</p><br/><p>Luckily, Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t follow through with his words but rather smiles and looks at him very treacherously. \u201cI think you misunderstood, what I meant when I said I\u2019d help you wash was for us to wash together first before I\u2019d then help you wash up.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is at a loss for words, has he just been tricked? He really is the number one biggest idiot in the world, he just knew that there\u2019s no way Ling Xiao is so kind hearted to let him off the hook. Just as expected, the other dug a hole and was just waiting for him to jump down himself and yet he\u2019s actually still taking chances. God, bring forth a strike of lightning to strike him to death!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo jumps up in rebellion but is still suppressed by force.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao especially asked the lad to get the largest bathtub the tavern has so there\u2019s definitely no problem with its capacity to fit two people.</p><br/><p>Not long after, You XiaoMo is completely unclothed, he sits on Ling Xiao\u2019s thigh in his naked glory, their skin touching. Two red blooded males taking something like a bath together is really intolerable.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly discovers that there\u2019s a thick thing against his thigh and he immediately becomes stiff all over.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s a ball of fire burning in his heart, You XiaoMo can\u2019t help but think of the last time.</p><br/><p>At that time, although he looked like he had lost his mind, he actually still has memories of it, and they\u2019re very profound too. So profound that it left a deep impression, and so, he instinctively wanted to shrink back.</p><br/><p>But after experiencing that kind of wonderful taste of overwhelming ecstasy, as an overly vigorous and not very normal man, Ling Xiao thinks that no matter what, he won\u2019t let You XiaoMo off the hook today. Plus, since last time, he hasn\u2019t touched You XiaoMo for more than a month already.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulls his face over and immediately lowers down, kissing his lips. The other person\u2019s first reaction is to shrink his neck, his face is all red from suffocation. Ling Xiao becomes aware of his movements, not only does he not let go of his mouth, he in fact tightly hooks his hands around his waistline. One hand pinches at his sensitive hip. Taking the opportunity of him being in pain, Ling Xiao\u2019s tongue strongly plunges inside, catches his tongue and begins to suck.</p><br/><p>The taste of kissing is actually quite wonderful, and before long, You XiaoMo\u2019s tongue, that was shrinking away, starts to cooperate. The two tongues hook onto each other until he finally can\u2019t breathe anymore and the two lips separate. The corner of the lips, wet from saliva pulls out a string of clear silver thread.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is weak and panting in Ling Xiao\u2019s embrace, feeling the wetness on his lips, his face uncontrollably reddens almost as if blood is going to drip from it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao presses him against his body, You XiaoMo\u2019s head rests on his slender shoulder. Looking down, he sees the two erect small red beans trembling on the chest, it\u2019s seductive and cute, as if it\u2019s waiting for him to take pity on it\u2026</p><br/><p>One of Ling Xiao\u2019s hands drags You XiaoMo\u2019s buttocks up to pick him up and flip his body over so the two people are face to face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo has no choice but to open his two legs and sit on Ling Xiao\u2019s body in a straddling position. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t look, but as soon as he does his nose feels itchy in an instant, as if there\u2019s something that wants to come out. With his naked body immersed in water, Ling Xiao is so seductive he could be the death of people\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughs quietly, bends over and envelopes one of the red beans in front of his chest into his mouth, sucking, licking and kissing. The smacking sounds of lips accompany the gasps and moans, resounding in the small, narrow room.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo only feels that his limbs and bones, plus all his internal organs, are burning a raging blaze. The heat is scurrying everywhere inside him, just like that day. It almost feels like a turbulent tide is surging inside his body, from the top of his head to the tips of his toes, in the end, his entire body is weak so he can only let Ling Xiao do as he pleases.</p><br/><p>The instant he is entered, You XiaoMo\u2019s body tightens without his control, although it\u2019s not so painful that he wants to die like last time, it\u2019s still uncomfortable. He can\u2019t control himself for a moment and opens his mouth and bites down onto Ling Xiao\u2019s broad shoulder. He doesn\u2019t go easy and directly bites until deep teeth marks appear.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao does not feel any pain at all, and instead, all the blood in his body starts to boil and he becomes more excited. The most direct reaction is that the object buried inside You XiaoMo\u2019s body swells in size, the strength of his thrusts become more ferocious like he\u2019s been possessed by the devil.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is constantly gasping for air from being thrusted into and holds onto Ling Xiao\u2019s neck, not even knowing which side the sun rises up from.</p><br/><p>The dense hot steam of the water tub changes from thick to thin before disappearing in the end. A good tub of water becomes cold, but the person who\u2019s still \u2018fighting\u2019 inside the tub doesn\u2019t have the slightest hint of stopping.</p><br/><p>The next day, You XiaoMo lies on the bed miserably on his stomach and can\u2019t get up.</p><br/><p>Now he finally knows the meaning behind Ling Xiao\u2019s words of \u201chelping to take a bath,\u201d it\u2019s using his tongue to lick his entire body everywhere, wuwu[4], taking a bath is so brutal!</p><br/><p>T/N</p><br/><p>[1]  So essentially the lad\u2019s name is HaHa which is the sfx for laughing.</p><br/><p>[2]  (Te Me) Slang way to say  (Ta Ma) indirectly as they sound similar. So in english it\u2019s like using the word fudge when you want to say fuck.</p><br/><p>[3]  This is also a slang for the actual swearword f*ck. The word originally is pronounced cao, so one slang is  meaning grass (romaji: cao but pronounced differently).  (romaji: Ci Ao) is another variation on the actual swear word, so once again, in english it\u2019s like saying fudge instead of f*ck.</p><br/><p>[4]  Crying sfx</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Living in the room next to theirs, Tong YueXu\u2019s return was something they were immediately informed of.</p><br/><p>Hearing them ask about red cards, Tong YueXu didn\u2019t hesitate to tell them everything he knew, even though he thought it strange.</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu said, \u201cIn regards to red cards, there are two ways of obtaining one. You already know the first way: you need ten thousand points. Very few accomplish this and I doubt you have the patience, so you can only rely on the second method.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was elated. \u201cJust as we thought, there\u2019s another way. Quick, tell us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu said, \u201cThe second method is very competitive and you\u2019ll have to mentally prepare yourselves. That method is The Trials.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was taken aback. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu explained, \u201cThe Trials refers to an annual competition held in Ward A and the rewards are very abundant. The winners can chose their reward, and one of the rewards is a red card, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo anxiously asked, \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu said, \u201cBut the rules of The Trials are very strict and demanding; even famous powerhouses that rank high up on the rankings might not necessarily achieve them.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was very confused.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked calmly, \u201cThere are requirements for the top five?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu continued, \u201cThat\u2019s right. From what I\u2019ve heard, there has never been more than four who could fulfill these requirements in the past years. Some might rank high, but they might not be able to fulfill the requirements, and end up with nothing but the ranking. However, the school would still give some small rewards to encourage the students.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held his own chin. \u201cThere are so many powerhouses in the school, yet some can\u2019t fulfill the requirement; how hard is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu smiled lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s just as you say. There are so many strong people in the school, so there will be many competitors aiming for the top every year. The school didn\u2019t used to have such high standards and rules, but since the competition was so intense, there would always be casualties. Some of those casualties really had potential. So, to prevent students from killing each other, the school had to establish strict rules. Now, if you want to complete The Trials, you\u2019ll have to rely on teamwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked, \u201cWhen are this year\u2019s Trials?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu glanced at him. \u201cIt\u2019s been five months since the last Trials, so there\u2019s another seven to go. There will be plenty of people signing up then.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo declared, \u201cNo matter what, we should have a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Tong YueXu suddenly seemed to remember something, \u201cI forgot to say; the Trials have requirements for signing up, too, but it won\u2019t be hard for Brother Ling. The only requirement is to be a powerhouse on the Hundred Man Rankings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao then inquired, \u201cHow are the Hundred Man Rankings ranked?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu replied, \u201cThe latter fifty are ranked by cultivation level. So long as you\u2019re a high enough level, you can get on there immediately. The first fifty are ranked by strength in battle. If you want to rank, you have to challenge someone. If you win, you can take their rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at Ling Xiao. He really wanted to say that that was too easy.</p><br/><p>The rankings for the Hundred Man Rankings were similar to the rankings in Ward B, very much independent, except\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo noticed a problem. \u201cThe Trials you just mentioned seemed to be for practitioners only; are there none for Mages?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had expected Tong YueXu to shake his head, but instead he nodded, \u201cOf course there is. There was something I hadn\u2019t mentioned yet. The Trials aren\u2019t just for Practitioners. In fact, it is a Trial for Practitioners and Mages as one.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hadn\u2019t understood. \u201cI\u2019m confused. If the competition is for both, then wouldn\u2019t Mages be at a disadvantage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not as you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao spoke up, \u201cIt\u2019s a cooperation, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu affirmed it, \u201cYou could call it that. Practitioners and Mages have to rely on one another, so on the competition each year, each participant has to have a Mage to form a temporary contract with and will only be released form it when the competition is over, so the Trials don\u2019t just test Practitioners.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo exclaimed in excitement, \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><br/><p>And he had been thinking it was a shame he couldn\u2019t participate with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Tong YueXu then added, \u201cRegarding the contract, I hear that the powerhouses on the Hundred Man Rankings have already started looking for powerful Mages to contract with though the competition isn\u2019t in until seven months later.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words weren\u2019t for Ling Xiao to remind him to hurry and find a good Mage. He knew that if Ling Xiao participated, then there was only one Mage he would contract with, and that Mage was You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>After Tong YueXu left, the two didn\u2019t continue with the topic.</p><br/><p>It was still early so Ling Xiao didn\u2019t need to hurry into this Hundred Man Ranking. However, they could only do their cultivation separately from now on.</p><br/><p>On this day, You XiaoMo gave the pills he had refined to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Though they had quite a few points stockpiled, but if they kept using points without earning more, they would be broke soon enough.</p><br/><p>Today it was his turn to go to the red card zone, so You XiaoMo decided to get Ling Xiao to go and sell pills for points.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had no complaints. It wasn\u2019t the first time he had sold pills in lieu of You XiaoMo. Plus, half the pills would end up in his stomach.</p><br/><p>The two parted outside their room and You XiaoMo headed for the Cultivation Center.</p><br/><p>To cultivate together with Ling Xiao, You XiaoMo hadn\u2019t gone to the red card zone yet. This was his first time.</p><br/><p>Outside the white, circular building, there was always quite a lot of people entering and exiting. Today, it seemed his luck wasn\u2019t very good.</p><br/><p>Just as he prepared to line up like a normal, law-abiding citizen, chaos erupted in the line in front of him as well as the sounds of arguing.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo usually wouldn\u2019t get involved in these sorts of things and prepared to turn away, but it was then that he saw Rong Xuan and Qin Zhang. The two seemed to be the main acts of this drama. He walked over curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you know what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned to a young, amused spectator.</p><br/><p>The young man didn\u2019t recognize him, didn\u2019t guess that he was a new student and wasn\u2019t annoyed, he just said, clearly enjoying the misery of those involved, \u201cTwo new students got on the wrong side of Stone Gate. They\u2019re pretty unlucky to have met Stone Gate. Stone Gate is infamous for being unreasonable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stone Gate? Was that an organization in Ward A?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked in confusion, \u201cIsn\u2019t the Cultivation Center a public area? Are there also specified areas for different groups?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the young man scrutinized him, \u201cYou\u2019re a new student, too? No wonder you don\u2019t know. Though there\u2019s no specific designation for groups, there\u2019ll always be people who like to cut in line and the people from Stone Gate are people who always do that, unless there\u2019s someone stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo then asked, \u201cWhat sort of background does this Stone Gate have?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man seemed more than happy to share and said, \u201cStone Gate is the sixth most powerful group in Ward A, and there are about a hundred members. Apparently, their creator was from the Chai Family of the Four Families of Yan City. Though that guy isn\u2019t in the school anymore, his authority lingers, and I heard the young master of the Chai Family, Chai Zheng, has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ch-Chai family?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo narrowed his eyes; where these devils everywhere?</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, he immediately waded through the crowd and entered the \u201carea of affect\u201d. Those he pushed frowned, but revealed mocking expressions upon realizing where he was heading. What an arrogant idiot. He even dared to interfere in Stone Gate\u2019s business.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Rong, Brother Qin,\u201d You XiaoMo called out towards their turned backs.</p><br/><p>Hearing the familiar voice, the two turned around in shock. Their faces split into smiles upon seeing him. They hadn\u2019t seen each other since they enrolled because they lived in different areas.</p><br/><p>Rong Xuan smiled, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve caught us at quite the embarrassing moment, Fellow You.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing You XIaoMo\u2019s unimpressed look, they knew that he had figured out what happened.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cSome despicable people just can\u2019t leave things well enough alone; it\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rong Xuan didn\u2019t even have the time to turn his head when Stone Gate\u2019s people became enraged. A guy who looked about twenty five glared in anger and raged, \u201cWho\u2019re you calling despicable?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned his turn to roll his eyes at the man. \u201cI\u2019m talking about who I\u2019m talk about.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes looked like they were about to start spitting fire. \u201cYou brat, do you know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, but I know that you\u2019re one of Chai Zheng\u2019s dogs. Is he not here today? That\u2019s sad. He won\u2019t get a chance to see you get your ass kicked.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t know how to reply. He knew who this young man was now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

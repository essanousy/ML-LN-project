Of the two corpses here, none of the two were intact.</p><br/><p>All this was the masterpiece of a single man. If not for the blood-stained blade in his hands, it was hard to imagine that he had just tortured two people to death with his clean, white robes that did not have a hint of dust.</p><br/><p>The man flicked off the blood on his blade. This was the first time he killed with a blade. It felt very different his previous methods of killing people. Although it was inferior to his previous direct and efficient method, it did not matter once in a while. Of course, it would be better to do it while carrying his wife on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>A bantering tone carrying strong interest rang from behind the man.</p><br/><p>The white-robed man tilted his head and glanced at the person who spoke, yet there was no surprise on his face. This was none but the man in the black robe who had just been chasing the two other members of the Black Spider.</p><br/><p>Since he was here, it meant that the two men had been properly settled in the nether world and were reunited with their comrades. This speed was really quite fast.</p><br/><p>The black man still carried the fire stick (). The color of his clothes was too dark to tell if there was any bloodstains. However, the scent of blood wafting off him was stronger than before and there were even some bloodstains on the purple fire stick.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man consecutively cleaned-out seven or eight Immortal\u2019s Caves within fifteen days more than a month ago. Was that you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed man looked askance at the man in white. Although he had asked a question, there was an obvious certainty in his tone. It seemed that he would not believe it even if the man in white did not admit it.</p><br/><p>The white robed man\u2019s leisurely gaze moved from the scimitar to the other party, sizing him up with a shallow look. The corners of his mouth slowly curved a little, showing a faint smile, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am very interested in you. Fight a round with me.\u201d The man in the black robe had a insolent expression as he stared at the man in white with arrogant eyes. He was full of vigor and was obviously a battle-manic. With a look, one could tell that he was a man who incessantly immersed himself in bloody slaughter.</p><br/><p>The white robed man glanced at him indifferently, \u201cYou are no match for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d The man in black laughed instead of getting angry. He was an arbitrary and tyrannical man who had lived for a long time. This was not the first time someone had said this to him, but this person was the only one who made him believe his words. This was because the man in white was right \u2013 his current self was really not his match.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right, but I still want to give it a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black robed man was not a masochist. He knew that he was not a match for his opponent yet he still clashed head-on with him. The reason why he wanted to fight the man was because he firmly believed that only by fighting could he become more powerful. Making a breakthrough in the midst of danger and bursting out at the moment of life or death. This was his motto in life.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy!\u201d The man in white threw this sentence at him before he turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>The figure of the black robed man flashed and he was blocking the way of the white robed man when he reappeared. He stubbornly insisted, \u201cThat\u2019s won\u2019t do. You must have a fight with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes darkened.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the thunderstorm that had been brewing for a long time finally arrived.</p><br/><p>They could only hear a faint rumble of thunder as they were a little far off.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had to deal with the thunderclouds by himself since Ling Xiao was not here. Fortunately, he already had a lot of experience with this, plus he himself was quite strong. Therefore, he was able to handle it with ease even though the power of the lightning tribulation for a Grade Four Rainbow Level was stronger than a Grade Three.</p><br/><p>After resolving the lightning tribulation, You XiaoMo put the magic pill which had tried to escape into the bottle and when he ran outside, the Weasel Beast told him that Ling Xiao had yet to return after going out.</p><br/><p>What did he go out to do at this time?</p><br/><p>Thus, when You XiaoMo, who was full of curiosity, followed the tracks to his destination, Ling Xiao had already began to fight with the black-robed man.</p><br/><p>The black robed man\u2019s cultivation was Level Twelve two stars, which was two stars lower than Ling Xiao\u2019s. There was still a one-star gap in reality even if Ling Xiao\u2019s cultivation dropped by one star due to his internal injury.</p><br/><p>However, as a battle manic who had been dealing with all kinds of experts for years on end, it was obvious that the battle experience of the black-robed man was richer than Ling Xiao. In addition, Ling Xiao had no intention of bothering with him. As a result, the two were vigorously fighting until there were flying sand and rolling pebbles.</p><br/><p>There were traces left by their fighting within a hundred mile radius and the two corpses that had been dismembered by Ling Xiao had long disappeared.</p><br/><p>If this situation happened in normal times, it would certainly attract the people who came to the Spirit Mountain for treasure-hunting. After all, the ones fighting were two Level Twelve experts. However, everyone\u2019s goal was the peak of the Spirit Mountain at this time, so the audience only consisted of You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>The two figures tangled together in the air finally separated an hour later.</p><br/><p>The fire stick in the black robed man\u2019s hand was shining with a purple radiance, as if he was getting ready to make a big move. On the other hand, Ling Xiao was gripping the scimitar he had plundered from another Immortal\u2019s Cave. The edge of the blade that was black in color \u2013 which was a rarely seen feature \u2013 was stained with red blood that had not been cleaned up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly waved at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Ling Xiao had long discovered him and gave him a reassuring look.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the black man\u2019s arm that was being raised suddenly stopped when he heard this name. His eyes twinkled with a strange excitement, \u201cSo you\u2019re Ling Xiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze eyes shifted back to him as he calmly asked.</p><br/><p>The black robed man flicked out his scarlet tongue and licked his dry lips. \u201cOf course, your name is like thunder piercing the ears to me. I can\u2019t forget your name no matter what. I\u2019ve wanted to meet you for a long time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a period of time when someone kept talking about the person with this name. He had wanted to meet the person during time, it was just that he did not have the opportunity to encounter this person.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s unexpected encounter was truly a pleasant surprise, because this situation was completely different from the information he had. At that time, the others had told him that Ling Xiao\u2019s cultivation base was Level Twelve one star, yet it was not possible for Ling Xiao to be at one star no matter how he looked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was the person who asked this question. He felt that the black robed man in front of him was like both an enemy and a friend.</p><br/><p>Instead of answering his questions, the black robed man put the fire stick away. His action surprised them as it seemed that he was not going to continue to fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will know who I am in the future. Today will not be the last time we meet. I believe we will meet again soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black robed man moved () his two sharp eyebrows that inclined towards his sideburns, and his fierce-looking features suddenly gave rise to an awe-inspiring evilness. It was a kind of tyrannical display which was totally different from the natural charm of others, yet it was because of this that it was even more attractive.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was baffled. It seemed as if he was an acquaintance from what he said, but he was certain that he had never seen this man before. This was the most bloodthirsty () man he had seen ever since he came to this world. You XiaoMo would definitely recognize him if they had met before.</p><br/><p>The black robed man confidently walked off after he had finished speaking.</p><br/><p>Just like how he bluntly badgered Ling Xiao for a fight, he came and went like the wind.</p><br/><p>It was just that the gaze he directed at them before he left appeared rather significant. It gave them the feeling as if there were some interesting things they did not know hidden away, especially when he was looking at Ling Xiao. However, one thing was certain. The black-robed man did not have a hint of killing intent when looking at them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head and then he turned to ask Ling Xiao, \u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao wiped off the bloodstains on the scimitar and put it back into the scabbard. The scimitar was rather handy to use, so he did not intend to throw it away for the time being. He only replied after hearing You XiaoMo\u2019s question, \u201cIt is obvious that he knows us quite well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, can you guess who he is?\u201d You XiaoMo closely pursued for an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Ling Xiao replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably\u2026 means that you\u2019ve guessed who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he is a Level Twelve demon beast, it means that he is from Xi Jing. He\u2019s familiar with us, yet we don\u2019t recognize him. The most important point is that he keeps looking at us in expectation of something that is coming soon, and his gaze contains a hint of schadenfreude. Who do you think he can be?\u201d Ling Xiao revealed all kinds of clues, before he answered a question with a question.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo touched his chin and began to think. One minute passed, he could not help pulling on his hair. Five minutes passed, he tangled a layer of hair on his scalp (). Ten minutes passed, he impatiently looked at Ling Xiao, begging for the answer!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t think of it?\u201d There was a trace of disdain in Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouted and said in vexation, \u201cI remember that among the Four Ancient Beast Clans, the True Dragon Clan and the Black Turtle Clan are quite friendly to us. Since that person has a cultivation base of Level Twelve, he should be from these two clans. But I don\u2019t know who are the Level Twelve experts in their clans. How in the world can I guess who he is?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll definitely die of stupidity in the future.\u201d ()</p><br/><p>After throwing out this sentence, Ling Xiao simply turned around and walked away. He did not want to talk to You XiaoMo anymore.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rushed to catch up with him. He knew he had guessed wrongly upon seeing Ling Xiao\u2019s reaction but it was because of this reaction that he became more confused. Don\u2019t tell him that he was from the Demon Phoenix Clan? After all, it was only Ji He who had always regarded them as enemies. The others were all partial to the chick and were probably not hostile to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tell me the answer directly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao knew perfectly well that his IQ was really low, yet he still made him guess. Wasn\u2019t this the death of him? ()</p><br/><p>\u201cNot telling,\u201d Ling Xiao did not even look back. This time, he had hardened his heart and was determined not to tell You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo started crying out loud. He really disliked this type of story which was coming to the end, but stopped before the answer. He definitely would not be able to sleep tonight.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stated, then don\u2019t go sleep.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

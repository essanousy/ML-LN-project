He stared dead at the two figures who had suddenly appeared. Even if they turned into ash, he would recognize them: Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo. The two of them actually appearing at this moment was indeed outside of his expectations, but what really shocked him wasn\u2019t that.</p><br/><p>He could sense a power that wasn\u2019t weaker than his own coming from Ling Xiao\u2019s body. How could this kind of thing happen? However, that feeling of disbelief only flashed across his mind before he immediately remembered that time when he allied with the TongTian Emperor to fight Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Back then, Ling Xiao had revealed the strength of the bloodline in his body to them, but at that time, Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t as powerful as him yet, so his bloodline strength wasn\u2019t as strong as Lin ShaoYi\u2019s either.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi hadn\u2019t paid much attention to it then because Ling Xiao only had a six star cultivation base. Even if his goal was also the Almighty, there was still a large gap. At that time, Lin ShaoYi\u2019s plan was about to succeed, so no matter what he didn\u2019t believe that Ling Xiao had a way to catch up to him.</p><br/><p>Now, Ling Xiao gave him \u201ca pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi glowered at Ling Xiao\u2019s figure. Even if he was dreaming, he wouldn\u2019t have imagined his luck to be so good. Sure enough, he should have personally set out at that time in Dong Zhou.</p><br/><p>His roar startled a bunch of people at once. Everyone finally recovered and they all opened their eyes wide, staring at the two figures in the sky with shock. If Lin ShaoYi hadn\u2019t shouted one of their names, most of them would probably be unable to recognize them immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo?\u201d Lei Gong pushed aside the stone on top of his body and instantly stood up, staring at the two of them like everyone else. Since he had only seen the two of them a few times before, he wasn\u2019t very certain. This aura was much more powerful than anyone else\u2019s here.</p><br/><p>Old Man Shen furrowed his brows. He glanced at the other people\u2019s reactions. \u201cIt should be them, correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two brats finally made it! I thought that they wouldn\u2019t be able to. Thankfully they did. Next, we can only leave Lin ShaoYi to them. It\u2019s the young folks\u2019 job!\u201d Fu CangQiong said emotionally. He had long since learned from TianGou that the two of them had been in secluded cultivation this entire time, and he had guessed then that they were very likely thinking of a way to deal with Lin ShaoYi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to the two of them?\u201d Xuan Zong walked over, looking bewildered. Even though he was very happy that someone could deal with Lin ShaoYi, he was still extremely puzzled over their sudden advancement in strength, especially You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for Ling Xiao\u2019s strength to abruptly rise. Since Xuan Zong was the head elder of the Black Turtle Clan, he had once been lucky enough to hear the founder\u2019s prophecy.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what happened, in the end it was still something good!\u201d The Dragon Lord continued for him. From his point of view, as long as they could lessen the casualties for the True Dragon Clan, anything would do.</p><br/><p>The head of the Demon Phoenix Clan also nodded his head in agreement.</p><br/><p>Even though they could already tell that Ling Xiao was in the same boat as Lin ShaoYi, with both of them seemingly possessing the Four Ancient Beast Clan bloodlines, if they had to pick one from the two, they would choose Ling Xiao without a question. At least no matter how you looked at it, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t seem like someone who would scheme wildly.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The two figures in the air slowly descended in front of everybody, before finally landing before Lin Gu and Lin Ming. They hadn\u2019t walked over yet before Lin Ming violently slammed a fist on Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder and immediately started to curse. \u201cDamn brat, you really know how to choose the right moment. You purposefully pick this key moment to appear, do you think you\u2019re really impressive, really cool, really handsome? Why do I feel like you guys got here a long time ago and deliberately hid to the side, watching secretly? Answer me obediently, was that the case?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rolled his eyes at him.</p><br/><p>Sweat appeared on You XiaoMo\u2019s forehead as he spoke; not out of guilt, but just because he felt like Papa Lin\u2019s way of thinking was very peculiar. During such a dangerous time, how could they hide to the side, watching secretly? When he thought of that, he immediately tugged at Ling Xiao\u2019s sleeve.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao answered extremely calmly, \u201cIf it was just you, I definitely would\u2019ve fulfilled your \u2018wish.\u2019 But since Uncle Gu is also here, I wouldn\u2019t take that risk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gu felt both happy and helpless when he heard that: happy because Xiao-er still looked very highly upon him, but helpless because Ling Xiao still called him Uncle Gu even up till now. He actually wanted to hear a different name come from Ling Xiao\u2019s mouth more.</p><br/><p>Lin Ming laughed out of anger. He just knew that if this damn brat didn\u2019t talk back for a single day he wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable inside his heart. However, he didn\u2019t grow angry, since he was the same as Lin Gu. He always worried before that his son wouldn\u2019t recognize A-Gu. Now it looked like there was still a chance. Furthermore, begging his son\u2019s wife earlier was indeed the right thing to do. It seemed like his son was one of those people who listened only to his wife.</p><br/><p>It probably sounded a little miserable. His son always ignored him, but Lin Ming wasn\u2019t the type to be heartbroken over it, as he was someone who was quite stubborn. After all, his son had been separated from him since he was young, so it was probably a little difficult to make him formally recognize him immediately, so there wasn\u2019t really anything to complain about.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would really succeed!\u201d Lin Ming turned the topic back onto him. From his expression, you could tell he was extremely excited. Lin ShaoYi\u2019s earlier attitude had made him burn with rage, and now he could only depend on his son to restore equilibrium once again.</p><br/><p>But Lin Gu wasn\u2019t as optimistic as him. Instead, his expression grew serious as he said, \u201cXiao-er, you and Lin ShaoYi both only broke through recently. Your levels of strength are the same, you must be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stared steadily at him before the corners of his mouth suddenly lifted. The curve of his lips indicated an unbidden, extremely arrogant self-confidence. \u201cJust wait and see, Uncle Gu.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he turned and flew into the sky, meeting Lin ShaoYi in the far distance.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at Lin ShaoYi across from him with a faint smile. He said slowly, \u201cEven though you look only a little worse than me, every time I see this face of yours, I feel like I have a cramp in my stomach. I\u2019m already tired of this feeling, so let\u2019s take care of our grudge once and for all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. Before, he had already witnessed how Ling Xiao talked back to Lin ShaoYi. He was highly anticipating this time as well, and sure enough, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t disappoint him.</p><br/><p>However, not everyone else was so fortunate, as they all looked absolutely stupefied.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi\u2019s eyes twitched. He found out that even though he succeeded in becoming the Almighty, he could still be angered by Ling Xiao. Every time they met, Ling Xiao could always say something that made Lin ShaoYi want to kill him on the spot. His face immediately grew cold, and he aimed his clenched fists at him as he said, \u201cLing Xiao, you can only talk big all you want right now. In a moment, I\u2019ll show you who\u2019s the real Almighty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk big?\u201d Ling Xiao laughed lightly, looking at him with pensive eyes. His expression looked more like that of the Almighty lord looking down from the sky, unruffled and unhurried, as if nothing anybody else said could bother him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted his head, staring with adoration at his man. He had also heard what Lin ShaoYi said. He was the one who understood Ling Xiao the best; not only was he skilled at talking big, his fighting ability was even more powerful than his ability to talk big. Thinking of this, he immediately shouted loudly, \u201cLing Xiao, beat him to death! Show him how great you are! Peel off all his clothes, let him taste what it feels like to bare his butt!\u201d</p><br/><p>If there wasn\u2019t that last sentence, it definitely would\u2019ve amazing encouragement! Not only was did he speak suddenly, startling others, but with that last sentence, he instantly scared quite a few people.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi\u2019s face went ashen, and his killing gaze moved from Ling Xiao to him. He looked as if he wanted to eat someone alive with his gaze, and You XiaoMo adjusted his face to a \u2018come and eat me\u2019 expression.</p><br/><p>That kind of arrogant attitude made Lin ShaoYi\u2019s killing intent surge to its peak in a single instant. He made his move without saying a single word more. His fist smashed over, but it was blocked unsurprisingly by Ling Xiao. The fist that Fu CangQiong and the rest had to use all their strength to withstand was easily blocked by Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Now, everyone finally believed that Ling Xiao\u2019s strength was already powerful enough that he could compete equally with Lin ShaoYi. Hope replaced many people\u2019s despairing expressions, as everyone started to look a little excited.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi glared at Ling Xiao with a gloomy look, as he spread his hands before curling them into one tight fist. Those white colored threads appeared again.</p><br/><p>Perhaps other people couldn\u2019t see it, but Ling Xiao could. All around him, the threads of the rules materialized, gathering around him like sharp blades with Ling Xiao at the center. His mouth curled in disdain, and with a crook of his finger, the rule threads instantly halted before turning back to nothingness in the next moment. Just like Lin ShaoYi before, he could destroy the existing rules at his whim.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuckily you can perform these small tricks. If it was me, I would definitely feel very ashamed!\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t forget to hit him one last time afterwards, but this time after speaking, he didn\u2019t give Lin ShaoYi time to twitch his face. His figure flashed, and he immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately looked towards Lin ShaoYi. Sure enough, they saw their two figures tangle together at a speed so fast that they couldn\u2019t even see it.</p><br/><p>Two Almighty exchanging blows; the scene was awe-inspiring.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid being affected, Fu CangQiong and the rest immediately withdrew from the Qilin Clan\u2019s territory with everyone else. The space very likely wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the destruction that the two of them were creating. Even if everyone wanted to watch the state of the battle extremely badly, they still left according to plans for the sake of their lives.</p><br/><p>The Black Spider wasn\u2019t so lucky. The exit was guarded by Fu CangQiong and the rest, so unless they charged out, they could only stand and watch.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma snorted coldly and didn\u2019t move. She believed firmly that ShaoYi would definitely win. When that time came, not a single person would be able to escape.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was just watching the fight, unable to take his eyes off of it, when a familiar voice sounded next to his ear, \u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

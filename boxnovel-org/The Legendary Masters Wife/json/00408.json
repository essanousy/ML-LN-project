For example, Nan Zhan, although he was only one star, one less than You Ming, if he participated in the fight for the Elemental Essences, their chances would dim. Behind Nan Zhan were some pretty strong forces too, just those at the peak Emperor level, were quite a few.</p><br/><p>If they all decided to take a piece of the pie, it would really be up in the air who would get the Earth Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>\u201cNan Zhan, your force truly has a chance of winning, if you collude with others, your chances will be higher than ours. However, think carefully if you want to be on the wrong side of the Vermillion Blood Clan. After that, your group of bandits\u2019 position in the Southern Continent would be in jeopardy.\u201d You Ming gave a cold warning. He had finally persuaded the Mage Guild, of course he didn\u2019t want too many competitors.</p><br/><p>Immediately Nan Zhan\u2019s face turned sour, \u201cStop blabbering, if you want to take the Earth Elemental Essence, you have to go through me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As someone strong with pride and face, if he backed off with a few words from You Ming, where would he put the face of their bandit group and his Vicious Wolf\u2019s name? If he truly feared the Vermillion Blood Clan, he wouldn\u2019t have come in the first place.</p><br/><p>You Ming\u2019s expression darkened, originally by getting the help of the Mage Guild they had a fifty percent chance, however, if one added Nan Zhan then they would only have a thirty percent chance or so. This was not the result he wanted.</p><br/><p>After he thought of this, in an angry tone he asked, \u201cNan Zhan, what would it take for you to give up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Zhan made a scheming smile, \u201cIt\u2019s simple, what you promised the Mage Guild, I want the same promise. Of course, it\u2019s fair game, if someone else gave me a favorable condition, I\u2019ll help them steal the Earth Elemental Essence.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sly old fox, You Ming cursed under his breath, of course he was up to no good. Saying that he wanted to fight for the Earth Elemental Essence was just a diversion to gain some favors. However, if one left him be, it was still a problem.</p><br/><p>Although he really didn\u2019t want to, by the look of things, he would have to, since there was only one Earth Elemental Essence. If he lost his chance now, it would be difficult to find another one.</p><br/><p>However, opposite to him, Xiong Xiao and Qiao WuShuang\u2019s expressions flashed with a hint of hesitation.</p><br/><p>Neither of them was one to casually rope in allies, since in the name of greed, even allies would turn against them, unless they were truly close. Thus, they didn\u2019t believe in Nan Zhan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>However, if they let the three team-up, that would put them in a sticky situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Seeing as they were hesitant, You Ming weighed the pros and cons and was about to make the promise.</p><br/><p>However, before he could finish, the stone which blocked the well suddenly blew opened with a huge \u2018boom\u2019. The pieces of rock flew into the air and landed heavily onto the ground, startling everyone to move back.</p><br/><p>After everyone was startled, they looked alarmingly at the old well.</p><br/><p>If someone exploded the rock that was blocking the exit, then there was someone inside?</p><br/><p>With everyone\u2019s gaze upon them, a black shadow made a light leap and jumped out of the well. It was a man wearing black and as he tilted his head up, it revealed that handsome yet familiar face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!!!\u201d Recognizing the face, You Ming was the first to shout, his eyes filled with disbelief and astonishment. Since he hadn\u2019t seen them in the Hall, he thought that this man and his companion would not be able to make it here. He hadn\u2019t thought of seeing them jumping out of the old well.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao and Qiao WuShuang\u2019s eyes also widened. Much to their surprise, the one who had jumped out of the well was Ling Mo. This entire time, they hadn\u2019t seen them, so they thought that the two must have wandered off somewhere else. Or, they were outside and never came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Ling Mo here?\u201d Qiao WuShuang asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like we underestimated them.\u201d Xiong Xiao said as he shook his head, looked like he had misjudged the two.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he? You know of him?\u201d HuangFu Li had never seen Ling Xiao, so he didn\u2019t know his appearance. Seeing that everyone looked at Ling Xiao in surprise, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang explained, \u201cElder HuangFu, he was one of the two I was telling you about outside. He is called Ling Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu Li nodded while stroking his beard, \u201cHe has pretty good luck to get in before us. However, if he is the one with the Earth Elemental Essence then he is in a dire situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang furrowed his brows as his gaze landed on the old well behind Ling Xiao. He remembered that Ling Xiao never strayed away from You XiaoHa, but this time he didn\u2019t see the other. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Beside the old well, Ling Xiao did not back off in the slightest from everyone\u2019s gaze. Seeing that both You Ming and You QingShan looked at him as if they were about to kill, he actually felt happy and his lips curled. With an evil grin he made his greeting. \u201cYo, nice to see you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>You Ming\u2019s gaze shifted back and forth from him and the well, although he didn\u2019t understand why the other wasn\u2019t with him, there wasn\u2019t any time to think further. \u201cThe Earth Elemental Essence is on you, right?\u201d You Ming took a step forward and stared at him menacingly.</p><br/><p>Hearing his words, everyone\u2019s gaze towards Ling Xiao changed.</p><br/><p>No matter if it was on him or not, since he came out of the well, then eight out of ten times he would have it.</p><br/><p>With a darkened eerie expression, You Ming said, \u201cSurrender the Earth Elemental Essence, otherwise, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished, they slowly surrounded Ling Xiao and the well.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at those who were surrounding him, his smile never left his face. Hearing You Ming\u2019s words, his smile deepened, \u201cIf I don\u2019t, what are you guys going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>In a formidable force, as if splitting everything before it, a long sword broke through the air, creating a fierce air current. Just as it seemed that Ling Xiao\u2019s head was about to split open, the latter gave You Ming a look of nonchalance. That look made You Ming\u2019s heart skip a beat, a feeling of unease floated up.</p><br/><p>In the next second his premonition came true.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised his leg and in a crisp, clean fashion kicked the guard before the long sword hit. The immovable force hit the guard, making his body fly backwards above everyone\u2019s heads and land with a loud thud.</p><br/><p>As everyone saw the miserable situation the guard was in, they all gasped. His chest actually sunk inwards, an Emperor level practitioner was out-of-commission by just one kick.</p><br/><p>How strong was this kick to destroy an Emperor level practitioner, his power may be above the Divine level, one just don\u2019t know by how many stars.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really couldn\u2019t tell that he was actually a Divine leveled practitioner.\u201d Qiao WuShuang exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao nodded in agreement, \u201cNo wonder I couldn\u2019t evaluate his strength before, it looks like he was stronger than me. Truly unbelievable.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a light sigh Qiao WuShuang said, \u201cActually it shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise since he dared to oppose the Vermillion Blood Clan and the Mage Guild, he must have some sort of strength.\u201d Not only that, it was possible that Ling Xiao\u2019s force was stronger than what they imagined.</p><br/><p>You Ming\u2019s expression was scarily dark and gloomy, he had only wanted to test Ling Xiao\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Much to his surprise, with a single kick, he finished the job. It looked like he was truly a Divine leveled practitioner.</p><br/><p>At this moment You QingShan suddenly stared at Ling Xiao and calmly said, \u201cBy the look of things, your excellency was the one who captured the Metal Swallowing Beast and the one who stole the Metal Elemental Essence from the Eye of the Sun, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>In astonishment, Ling Xiao looked at him.</p><br/><p>The others, however, were frozen, the Metal Swallowing Beast and the two Elemental Essences were all on this one person? Could this be possible, if it could, then\u2026</p><br/><p>Slowly everyone\u2019s eyes became filled with greed, if he really had it, even stealing one would be great. Even Nan Zhan looked at Ling Xiao with intensity.</p><br/><p>Watching this unfold, You QingShan gave a sinister simile.</p><br/><p>To his surprise, Ling Xiao suddenly looked at him and their eyes met. His eyes flashed an eerie simile, as if mocking him.</p><br/><p>You QingShan was startled and broke out into a cold sweat. By the time he regained his senses, his expression became cold. He was born with a gold spoon in his mouth, why was he the one scared to the point of sweating. His emotions became even more unsettled.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Xiao, who was standing still before, moved.</p><br/><p>His body became a ray of black light, headed straight for You QingShan and the latter. They couldn\u2019t respond at all, it was You Ming who quickly got in front of You QingShan in a defensive position.</p><br/><p>However, the ray of black light suddenly changed course in the air and in a faster speed headed out of this barren wasteland.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, he\u2019s running away!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

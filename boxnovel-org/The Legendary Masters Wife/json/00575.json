However, this sort of thing was considered something of a dirty tool, so there were very few mages who refined aphrodisiac pills.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flipped through the recipes in the jade drive and managed to find quite a few of these. From low level magic pills to high level magic pills, there were several different kinds of each level.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo started the refining aphrodisiac the next morning.</p><br/><p>However, the materials needed to refine aphrodisiacs were relatively obscure. He hadn\u2019t gone to gather any in particular, and made do do with what he already had, managing to scrape up the materials for a mid-grade magic pill.</p><br/><p>Since Ping and Pong\u2019s mouth and body were too small, You XiaoMo only refined one.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, he split the pill in two and fed it to them before settling beside the bed and observing their reaction. He had never seen bugs mate before. What he wouldn\u2019t give for a magnifying glass right now.</p><br/><p>Not long after ingesting the aphrodisiac, the two golden winged insects seem to begin to have a reaction to it. A hint of pink creeped up their golden bodies, their eyes turning a little red, as if they had been controlled by desire. However, they still didn\u2019t act after three minutes, even moving away from each other.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was disappointed. \u201cWas the aphrodisiac not enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked over to him and glanced at the insects. \u201cTheir eyes have reddened; they\u2019re already in heat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t they moved?\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but reach other and poke one of them. The insect scurried away. \u201cXiao Ping, you\u2019re a man, you gotta take the initiative, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao picked him up, walking outside as he said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with taking initiative. You kept staying there and watching them. They\u2019re shy. Little demon beasts have dignity too.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo just wanted to ask what there was to be shy about before stifling himself at that sentence about dignity. How stingy. He didn\u2019t believe that Ping Pong hadn\u2019t peeped on him. As little demon beasts, there was nothing to look at, what was there to be shy about?</p><br/><p>In the end, his objections were vetoed and You XiaoMo was dragged out of the room by Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, they returned to the room. You XiaoMo made a beeline for his bed, but Ling Xiao stopped him by the collar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gestured for him to keep quiet and look inside.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo peeked out from behind the screen. On the white bed, he noticed the two golden winged insects, entangled with one another. Xiao Ping was being held down under Xiao Pong\u2019s body. Using his impressive eyesight, he could see the minuscule movements the two were making.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth spasmed. He had prepared himself to witness this mating, but their stamina was eye-opening. It had been two hours already and they were still doing it?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao informed him, \u201cOnce the golden winged insects enter heat, they\u2019ll continue for three days and three nights.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, Ping Pong became the very first golden winged insects who had a room to themselves for mating. Since You XiaoMo didn\u2019t want to interrupt, he had the innkeeper give them another room next door, leaving the original room to Ping Pong.</p><br/><p>On the first day, You XiaoMo was in awe over their stamina.</p><br/><p>If they were humans, they wouldn\u2019t be able to last at all.</p><br/><p>On the second day, You XiaoMo sneaked a peek through the window. They were still doing it, and he felt that Xiao Ping\u2019s movements were wilder than the day before.</p><br/><p>On the third day, the Metal Swallowing Beast ran back to report, but with You XiaoMo taking him to watch Ping Pong have sex, the Metal Swallowing Beast was enraptured, even drooling non stop.</p><br/><p>Thus, You XiaoMo successfully took his Xiao Jin down the wrong path.</p><br/><p>After three days, the aphrodisiac\u2019s effect wore off and You XiaoMo immediately ran into their room before almost going blind from the shining gold stuff on the bed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just one thread of golden silk, but a pile. Each thread was ten meters long, with nine in total. This was truly quite shockingly impressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan nine golden threads make a set of armor?\u201d You XiaoMo excitedly ran to Ling Xiao with the nine golden threads. This came from Xiao Pong\u2019s mouth, and not chrysanthemum like he had thought before.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took one of the golden threads and yanked on it a few times. \u201cSee that? Not only has tenacity increased, but it\u2019s very elastic as well. Generally speaking, two golden threads can make a set of armor, but with these, you\u2019d only need one.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo almost jumped with joy. He thought for a moment and asked, \u201cThen if I have Ping Pong go into heat again, will they make as many gold threads?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t even need to think or hesitate, flicking You XiaoMo on the forehead. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the ability to produce this golden thread whenever. Normal golden winged insects would use up all of their energy just producing one gold thread. Everything has its limit. Your Ping Pong was only able to produce nine gold threads because they have never produced any before. However, this probably used up all the energy they had. This probably won\u2019t occur again for another hundred years.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cupped his head and discarded the idea. He had wanted to give his ball team each a set of armor. Looks like that wasn\u2019t possible anymore.</p><br/><p>After mating for three days and three nights, Ping Pong didn\u2019t want to face anyone, hiding in You XiaoMo\u2019s clothes. As their owner, he really couldn\u2019t tell that they would be so shy, they were usually so thick skinned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, Xiao Jin, what do you have to report about the two you followed?\u201d After dealing with Ping Pong\u2019s heat, You XiaoMo finally remembered this and set the Metal Swallowing Beast on the table.</p><br/><p>The Metal Swallowing Beast\u2019s expression twisted.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that his expression was very similar to how Xiao Ping looked when shy, and his mouth twitched. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that your heat is approaching too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Metal Swallowing Beast nodded shyly. He wanted to have a heat too.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao almost spat out his tea, choking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You XiaoMo noticed his uncharacteristic behavior.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao wiped his mouth and said, calmly, \u201cThere\u2019s only one one Metal Swallowing Beast in the entire world. He can\u2019t change shape, so a heat is impossible, unless he\u2019s willing to mate with different demon beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked him what was wrong.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned the Metal Swallowing Beast around, revealing his round belly and soft member. He couldn\u2019t help but poke it with his finger. It was even smaller than his thumb. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have a heat, can this thing even stand up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Metal Swallowing Beast struggled to get back on his feet.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze slid down from the Metal Swallowing Beast\u2019s little dick. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it can stand up or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbfounded. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t move. \u201cSo long as the backdoor works, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and the Metal Swallowing Beast clenched their butt cheeks. That was\u2026 too harsh.</p><br/><p>Scared out of his skin, the Metal Swallowing Beast didn\u2019t dare randomly \u2018go into heat\u2019 anymore and informed Ling Xiao of everything he had heard in the manor. Ling Xiao then repeated it to You XiaoMo. This language barrier was a permanent thing. Not even contracting could fix it.</p><br/><p>After Yan Hui had given Su Lang a good wake up call, Su Lang hid inside the cultivation room, refusing to come out. It seemed that it had really struck him hard, and now he was cultivating like crazy, completely throwing his mentor\u2019s words onto the backburner. Yan Hui didn\u2019t bother reminding him.</p><br/><p>As for Yan Hui, he was constantly waiting for their master to contact them. These few days, he rarely left the manor. The two disciples seemed to put their master first. There were rarely any outsiders who\u2019d visit them, so they lived like hermits</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo contemplated for a while before deciding to continue to monitor them.</p><br/><p>In the end, the golden winged insects finally got over their embarrassment and he sent them to the manor to keep an eye on a person each. If anything happened, they could inform the other. It was very convenient.</p><br/><p>That day, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao left WuShan Town and prepared to return to their cave.</p><br/><p>When they left the cave, they didn\u2019t set any restriction barriers. It was located in a rather hard to find area, so normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to find it, or so You XiaoMo thought. However, reality rarely went as hoped.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t even neared the cave when they sensed that there were people inside, and not just one person. You XiaoMo exchanged a look with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>When they approached, they could smell a faint scent of blood.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo volunteered himself to check the situation in the cave. Yet, just as he arrived at the entrance, a cold light flashed towards him. The attacker acted ruthlessly and had calculated their angle. If it hit, his entire face would get slashed open.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swiftly stepped backwards to dodge, throwing a kick without hesitation. Immediately, a grunt and the sound of heavy objects falling could be heard, as well as several whooshing sounds.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo darted inside the cave. There were no light pearls to light up the cave, but he could still see three figures in the dim light. They wore pitch black clothing, almost melting into the darkness. The one lying on the ground was the one to ambush him.</p><br/><p>The scent of blood came from them. None of them were masked, but You XiaoMo didn\u2019t recognize them at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

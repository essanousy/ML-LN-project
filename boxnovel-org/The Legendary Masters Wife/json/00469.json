Although Yu Bu was much weaker than XiongXiao in terms of power, he was more adept at handling situations and more meticulous. According to XiongXiao\u2019s evaluation of him, he was a person who could \u2018speak human to a human and speak ghost to a ghost\u2019. Simply put, he was an expert at doing business.</p><br/><p>Previously, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t interact with him for long so he didn\u2019t experience that. This time he was beside him, so he was able to clearly see what XiongXiao was talking about. The words he said to every guest, almost none of them was repeated. Even his smiling face looked especially cordial.</p><br/><p>Just as they were preparing to walk over, a figure ran out from somewhere and suddenly cut in front of You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo fixed his eyes upon the figure and found a youth dressed in an expensive gown with a jade guan on his head. He had looks that stood out from the crowd but his chin was raised so high it was as if he hadn\u2019t seen them at all. With a fan in hand, he left them with his back view.t/n: Guan() is a headwear worn as formal headdress. Example: Link</p><br/><p>However, what You XiaoMo really cared about was the fact that that youth actually had a purple flame symbol between his brows. He remembered Ling Xiao said that this kind of flame pattern was the symbol of the Qilin Clan.</p><br/><p>After the youth walked over, an old man followed behind him. The old man was like an ancient well that had settled for many years, he seemed to be as deep and unfathomable as the well itself. The both of them didn\u2019t seem to be aware that they had jumped the queue.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought about it and ultimately decided not to argue with them.</p><br/><p>To him it didn\u2019t matter at all if they entered first or later. Furthermore, this was the Cang Alliance\u2019s territory. He didn\u2019t want to start trouble here.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo retreated to Ling Xiao\u2019s side and whispered, \u201cAre they people from the Qilin Clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at the youth\u2019s back narrowed his eyes coolly. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen him before. This person likely appeared after I left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks really arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lowered his head and gave him a look, \u201cThe people of the Qilin Clan have always been arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded his head in agreement. The person in front of him was the perfect example of this.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lifted his hand and knocked on his forehead. How could Ling Xiao not know what he was thinking?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo covered his forehead and silently cursed at him. Argh! Even thinking to himself was not allowed? Not only was this person arrogant, to top it off he was extremely overbearing!</p><br/><p>The youth and the old man accompanying him quickly passed the security checks.</p><br/><p>However before entering, the youth suddenly turned back and looked at them with eyes full of contempt and provocation.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tsked. Would it kill him to not be arrogant and condescending?</p><br/><p>The people of this world were really too hyperactive!</p><br/><p>Yu Bu, who was standing at the door, had taken in everything he saw. The Qilin Clan stood at the top of all powerhouses on the TongTian Continent, so it was inevitable that the younger generation would look down their noses at everyone else. Seeing as You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao didn\u2019t pursue the matter, he heaved a sigh of relief in his mind. His impression of them became much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you really came.\u201d Yu Bu took a step forward and smiled as he greeted them with a fist cupped in the other hand. His eyes then landed on Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my friends. They\u2019re accompanying us to attend the banquet. They should be able to enter right?\u201d You XiaoMo replied his question.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Yu Bu smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis way please.\u201d</p><br/><p>After passing the entrance, there was a long, slightly sloping flight of stairs. As it was too long, it looked like it had disappeared into the clouds.</p><br/><p>The Amaranthine mountain range was shrouded in fog, giving an ethereal feel.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was in somewhat high spirits. He hadn\u2019t walked on these kind of stairs before. Whatever unhappy things that had happened at the entrance was soon forgotten by him.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge swiftly walked over and looked towards Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split up here,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao knew he wanted to check if the people of the Vermillion Blood Clan had arrived so he agreed.</p><br/><p>The two of them then went up first.</p><br/><p>Above the flight of stairs was a cluster of colossal buildings that one couldn\u2019t see the end of. In the middle was the main hall of the Cang Alliance. The main hall was in the form of a pagoda, its exterior looking stately and solemn. In front of the main hall was a huge square. Currently, people from all around had gathered there together with the Cang Alliance\u2019s security team. It looked especially lively right now.</p><br/><p>As today was that Shidi\u2019s birthday, the square was fully draped with festive red cloth. Quite a number of guests had already arrived before them. They stood in various corners of the square and had conversations in little groups.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a look inside but Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan were nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>Due to the large number of guests, it was impossible for the Cang Alliance to attend to every guest, so You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao walked towards a place with fewer people but allowed them to see where the majority of the people were.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see anyone from the Vermillion Blood Clan?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey probably haven\u2019t arrived yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, can we grab something to eat?\u201d You XiaoMo smiled shyly.</p><br/><p>The birthday banquet that the Cang Alliance had organised consisted of both the appetisers and the main course. The appetisers and snacks were already laid out on the long table in the square and were giving off a delicious aroma. You XiaoMo had long since noticed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill you look at yourself!\u201d Ling Xiao chided lightly.</p><br/><p>While that might be what he said, Ling Xiao still brought him over anyway.</p><br/><p>They were most probably the first people who expressed interest in the appetisers as they were the only ones beside the long table. Others wouldn\u2019t even do such a thing because of their status. Furthermore, this was the best time to establish ties with other forces. Almost nobody would let this opportunity pass.</p><br/><p>As a result, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao who appeared beside the long table became particularly eye-catching.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t care how others looked at him. Only a fool would restrain themselves and not enjoy the good stuff before them. That\u2019s why it was a burden to be obsessed with keeping up with appearances.</p><br/><p>Using the plate that the Cang Alliance prepared, You XiaoMo picked up a piece of fried golden dim sum and took a bite. He couldn\u2019t help but let out an excited squeal, \u201cIt\u2019s really delicious. It doesn\u2019t taste like it\u2019s fried using ordinary magic fruit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a no brainer. How can they use ordinary things to serve esteemed guests.\u201d Ling Xiao replied nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have one too.\u201d You XiaoMo picked one up and delivered it to his mouth.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Ling Xiao opened his mouth and took a bite.</p><br/><p>The expressions on some people\u2019s faces started to become weird when they saw this scene. Although there were instances of a man being together with another man, few would show it so blatantly. Finally, someone recognised them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that man, he looks like Ling Mo, the rising star on the Ten Gods List. So he really was invited by the Cang Alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, looks like the Cang Alliance has already acknowledged his position. The invitation card is proof.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I never thought that the youth and him were in that kind of relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I heard that even two men can Dual Cultivate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, isn\u2019t the difference in their cultivation levels very large?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that this You XiaoHa is a level ten mage. The Eagle Guild\u2019s second-in-command, One-eyed Scarface, was defeated by him so don\u2019t belittle him. Not only that, he\u2019s a student of XiaoYao Institute. He came in first when he participated in XiaoYao Institute\u2019s entrance tests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst place? He\u2019s that powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s said that the Mage Guild and the Beast Transfiguration Guild\u2019s most talented individuals were no match for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really can\u2019t judge a book by its cover!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the same scene unfold, the youth who had previously provoked You XiaoMo at the entrance and sent him a disdainful look suddenly looked in Ling Xiao\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo he is Ling Mo, the man rumored to be a member of the Qilin Clan.\u201d The youth looked indifferent, his words slightly contemptuous. There was no joy at all in meeting his fellow clansman.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, what do you think of this, is he really a member of the Qilin Clan? He can\u2019t possibly be an imposter trying to take advantage of the Qilin Clan\u2019s reputation, can he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person\u2019s aura is calm/composed. I can only tell if he makes a move.\u201d The old man said.</p><br/><p>The youth closed his fan and chuckled, \u201cSince it\u2019s like this, then we\u2019ll find a chance to test him out. Anyone who dares to impersonate a member of the Qilin Clan will not be let off easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith their judgement, the powerhouses shouldn\u2019t have mistaken what they saw. This old man thinks that this matter is very likely true.\u201d The old man calmly looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen tell me Elder, who can this person be? There are only those few people in the Qilin Clan and both of us have seen them already. Where did he come from?\u201d The youth spoke slowly.</p><br/><p>The old man couldn\u2019t answer his question. Every member of the Qilin Clan were in the Clan. There might have been some who were wandering outside in the past but there were close to none now. Even if there were, they would be found and brought back by the Qilin Clan. As the number of members of the Qilin Clan were dwindling, any clan member who was wandering outside must be brought back.</p><br/><p>If he was found to be a member of the Qilin Clan in the end, the elders in the clan were very likely going to take him back.</p><br/><p>The youth must have thought of this, thus the need to confirm if what he heard was true.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t because he wanted to bring Ling Xiao back, he just wanted to prove this matter wrong. However, for some reason Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo just rubbed him the wrong way. With this in mind, the youth\u2019s voice rose suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI reckon he couldn\u2019t possibly be a member of the Qilin Clan. We don\u2019t have such disgraceful clan members in the Qilin Clan. You should try harder in impersonating one of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else kept their volume low when speaking so when the youth spoke loud and clear, he immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>The person who spoke was a legitimate clan member of the Qilin Clan. If he said no, then it was highly likely there was no such person in the Qilin Clan but was it possible that everyone present at that time was blind?</p><br/><p>Clearly his words weren\u2019t convincing enough.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Ra: Fans, please give respect to Rachel, our translator of this chap. The raw for this chapter was wrong as it merged two chaps(469 and 470) in one, and Rachel, our lovely and miserable translator, spent her brain off only to find out she has no choice but to delete half of her effort since 470 has been done by another translator.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

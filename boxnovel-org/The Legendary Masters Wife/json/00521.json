Some were graves that had been created in the ancient past, while some were graves that had been created for the big demon beasts by their descendants.</p><br/><p>The resentful energy here was particularly heavy because the demon beast graveyard held the tombs of thousands and thousands of demon beasts. The dense, black fog seemed to writhe with the shapes of countless ghosts, as it wandered all about the demon beast graveyard. Whenever something living went inside, they would instantly be attacked by the shapeless black fog.</p><br/><p>Just like right now.</p><br/><p>A black hawk flew out of nowhere. It released a piercing screech before plunging confidently into the demon beast graveyard.</p><br/><p>The black hawk pierced through the black fog very quickly. After flying low to the ground, it began to rise upwards with the attitude of a champion towards the bright and clear sky.</p><br/><p>But the second it rose out of the black fog, something strange happened.</p><br/><p>The intangible black fog suddenly began to violently churn as if it had come to life, and like an evil spirit from hell, it transformed into many hideous demon faces. They fought with each other as they rushed towards the black hawk, and the black hawk was drowned in the black fog before it even had a chance to make a noise.</p><br/><p>When the black fog dispersed, pieces of bone fell from the sky.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo drew in several breaths as he watched. No wonder the inn\u2019s owner labeled the demon beast graveyard as the most dangerous place in Ghost Tomb Mountain Range. That black hawk had at least level ten cultivation, but it had been turned into food without the slightest bit of resistance. Indeed, it was extremely terrifying!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should we get across?\u201d You XiaoMo swallowed and asked.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to walk across the ground, but it was also very dangerous to go through the air. Just now, that black hawk had been forcefully dragged back in after it had flown out of the black fog. However, after comparing, they realized that the likelihood of danger in the air was still a little lower.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I really need to say it? Of course it\u2019s through the air.\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose.</p><br/><p>After deciding to go through the air, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t call out the Roc. Now was a perfect time to practice his flying ability, as a transcendent level mage could use soul force to create a pair of wings based on his own imagination. His wings were black, just like a demon\u2019s wings, and they emitted a black light.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flapped forcefully a few times. It indeed felt much better than borrowing some other creature\u2019s wings, and it felt as if the wings had been a part of his body all along. There wasn\u2019t a problem no matter how he used it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re ready, let\u2019s go.\u201d Ling Xiao flew towards the sky first, and You XiaoMo hastily followed.</p><br/><p>Right now, the demon beast graveyard was below them, shrouded in black fog. The demon beast graveyard was extremely large, and it was vast and boundless at first glance. Broken-down, dusty and decayed graves were everywhere, and there were skeletons piled disorderly in front of some of the graves, both human and demon beast.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked down once before looking away. If he looked too much, he\u2019d have nightmares.</p><br/><p>But what he didn\u2019t know was that after he had appeared, some of the big demon beasts in the demon beast graveyard had begun to stir restlessly. Someone who hadn\u2019t entered it wouldn\u2019t know, but the demon beast graveyard wasn\u2019t actually just a graveyard for demon beasts; it was also a graveyard for humans.</p><br/><p>The race that had erupted into a huge war with the demon beasts in the past was the humans. That war was extremely chaotic, and the big demon beasts weren\u2019t the only ones to fall. Many famous, renowned human experts of that time had also died.</p><br/><p>And there was another point, which was also the most important point.</p><br/><p>The soul, flesh, and blood of mages \u2013 especially transcendent level mages \u2013 attracted resentful beings the most. What they hunted most was the delicious scent that was emitted from the soul.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xiao, who was at You XiaoMo\u2019s side, made them extremely afraid, so even though they were already salivating with desire, they could only control their restlessness and wait quietly for an opportunity.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t actually fly that slowly, but from their perspective, he flew as slowly as a turtle crawling. Many pairs of glowing green eyes followed his every movement.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s body suddenly went numb. Why did he feel as if someone was spying on him? When he looked downwards, all he saw was the extremely gloomy black fog, which had no movement whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao discovered that he had stopped, and he looked back and asked, concerned, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked over to him and nervously hugged his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just my imagination, but I keep feeling as if someone is watching me. We should leave the demon beast graveyard quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s\u2026\u201d Ling Xiao hadn\u2019t finished speaking when the black fog below suddenly began to violently churn. In the next second, a wave of black light suddenly rushed out from the black fog and dissolved into a demon\u2019s face. The face was savage and greedy, and it charged towards You XiaoMo threateningly.</p><br/><p>Finally, there was a resentful being who couldn\u2019t resist anymore and decided to act first.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao snorted coldly, and a wisp of purple flame burst out from underneath him with a popping noise. The flames transformed into a fire Qilin, and it attacked the resentful being with a roar, swallowing the screaming resentful being with one bite. This time the soul was really scattered, with no possibility of rebirth.</p><br/><p>This movement also served as a threat.</p><br/><p>Not only did the opposing side have someone with level twelve cultivation, he could possessed the fiercest flame that could restrain them. If they didn\u2019t want to be obliterated like the first one and disappear from this world forever, they could only reconsider their plan.</p><br/><p>For the rest of their journey, they didn\u2019t encounter any more obstructions, and they crossed the demon beast graveyard peacefully and calmly. There most likely hadn\u2019t been anyone who had ever crossed as smoothly as them.</p><br/><p>The swamp lay ahead of them after crossing the demon beast graveyard.</p><br/><p>When their figures disappeared from the air over the demon beast graveyard, a white spirit suddenly floated out from an empty gravestone. The white spirit transformed into a tall and thin figure wearing all white clothing, and its indistinct face continued to stare in the direction that the two of them had disappeared in for a long time before looking away.</p><br/><p>After the white spirit appeared, the resentful beings nearby all fled the area.</p><br/><p>Ghost Tomb Mountain Range\u2019s swamp was only a little less dangerous than the demon beast graveyard. The reason was because tens of thousands of water demons hid beneath the surface of the swamp, and they were the water demons that You XiaoMo had seen at Long Xiang Continent. Rumor had it that a level eleven water demon led the rest. It had a demon beast\u2019s fierceness and a human\u2019s intelligence, so it was extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>When he remembered that the water demons\u2019 original bodies were that of humans, You XiaoMo had no way to identify if they were actual demon beasts, so he hastily urged Ling Xiao to leave the swamp.</p><br/><p>Since they were flying both high and fast, the water demons most likely could also sense their cultivation level, so the swamp was peaceful without a single ripple.</p><br/><p>Right when they were about to fly out of the swamp, You XiaoMo looked back.</p><br/><p>A water demon was standing quietly on top of the swamp for who knows how long. It had the outer appearance of a human, but its entire body was clear as if it was made of water, and it was looking at them expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>The goosebumps on his arms sprang up in an instant.</p><br/><p>After they crossed the swamp, they finally reached the Weeping Ghost Shore.</p><br/><p>The endless mountain peaks were precipitous and jagged. The Weeping Ghost Shore was in the middle of all of these, so next, they had to find the Weeping Ghost Shore.</p><br/><p>The map the innkeeper had given them only marked the Weeping Ghost Shore as being here, but as for which mountain or cliffside it was, nobody knew. They could only slowly search on their own.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you send Uncle Gu a message and tell him to come join us.\u201d You XiaoMo had absolutely no interest in searching the mountains one by one. He knew that, at the very least, there were over a thousand mountain peaks here, not including shores. Each mountain peak probably had at least two to three shores.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t agree.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that Ling Xiao hadn\u2019t thought of it before, but he understood Lin Gu\u2019s personality. On the outside, he seemed refined, but in reality, he was someone who stood by his word.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo stingy!\u201d You XiaoMo cupped his chin in his hands and squatted on a big rock. \u201cThen how exactly are we going to find the Weeping Ghost Shore? You\u2019re not saying we should just wait until they appear on their own, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, we can just directly call them out.\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cHow do you plan on doing that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lifted his head and looked at the sky, which was about to dim. \u201cIt\u2019s already night, let\u2019s talk about this tomorrow. Let\u2019s first go rest in the dimension for the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour dimension or my dimension?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst go to my dimension to see that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was extremely likely that the person in white was You XiaoMo\u2019s father, but because the image that the person in white gave him was completely different from his image of a \u2018father\u2019, You XiaoMo painstakingly forgot about him. Speaking of which\u2026 last time, when he had entered the dimension naked with Ling Xiao, it seemed that they hadn\u2019t come across that person.</p><br/><p>Gah, he couldn\u2019t have been seen naked, could he have?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo only thought of this problem in hindsight. However, Ling Xiao shouldn\u2019t be unprepared.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s dimension had expanded alongside his cultivation skyrocketing, and by now, it was already several dozen times bigger than You XiaoMo\u2019s dimension, vast and boundless.</p><br/><p>Soon afterwards, You XiaoMo saw the person in white, who was tied up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d The corners of You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched as he asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao whispered, \u201cMy dimension isn\u2019t the same as yours. The people and demon beasts I put in here all retain their individual consciousness, and I can\u2019t control their behavior from outside. If the demon beast isn\u2019t very strong, then it\u2019s fine, but this man is very powerful, so I must control him well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time his cultivation hadn\u2019t yet completely recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, on the way out of the dimension last time, Ling Xiao had simultaneously placed seals on his body that inhibited cultivation. The person in white was most likely already used to it, so he hadn\u2019t had any response.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we let him go?\u201d You XiaoMo heaved a deep sigh. This was most likely his father. Since they had rescued him, they couldn\u2019t just keep him in the dimension forever.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao easily undid the seals on the person in white\u2019s body. He also hadn\u2019t planned on keeping a ticking time bomb in his dimension.</p><br/><p>The person in white stood up and smiled at You XiaoMo. \u201cMy fellow, could you tell me your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him for a long while. \u201cFirst tell me what your name is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in white said indifferently, \u201cMy name is You JunQi. You already know my identity, so now can you tell me what your name is, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo answered without even blinking, \u201cMy name is Ling XiaoMo.\u201d(Ra: I feel like saying \u201cThe wife has taken the husband\u2019s last name)</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Mo\u2019 from silence?\u201d You JunQi mulled over his name, and his expression suddenly held a bit of grief. \u201cYour name is the same as my son\u2019s. He\u2019s also called XiaoMo.\u201dT/n: You XiaoMo() = Xiao in little, small and Mo in silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s his surname?\u201d You XiaoMo unwittingly asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pressed his hand to his forehead.</p><br/><p>You JunQi laughed. \u201cYou really do like to joke around. Of course my son\u2019s surname is You, he should be twenty two years old now. It\u2019s also been twenty two years since I\u2019ve last seen him.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s entire face was red. \u201cDo you miss your son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d You JunQi said desolately, \u201cThere\u2019s no moment I don\u2019t miss my wife and son, but I can\u2019t go find them. My big brother won\u2019t let me go, and if he knew about the existence of my wife and son, he definitely wouldn\u2019t let them off either.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo really wanted to tell him: your wife and son are dead already, and moreover, the other person is already at your door. He coughed. \u201cLet\u2019s not mention things from the past anymore. I\u2019ll let you go, so now you\u2019re free. You can go anywhere you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi blinked. \u201cCan I go with you two?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbfounded. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi laughed quietly. \u201cYou two saved me, so now you\u2019re my saviors. I\u2019m unable to repay the kindness, so I can only\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re not about to say that you can only repay us with your body, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi sweated. \u201cNo, I, I wanted to say that I can do manual labor.\u201d Repaying with his body could wait until the next lifetime.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved his hand. \u201cThen there\u2019s no need, I don\u2019t need anyone to do manual labor for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you can keep me as backup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ling Xiao couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and forcefully grabbed You XiaoMo\u2019s chin, turning it to face You JunQi\u2019s face. \u201cWho does he look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked him up and down, and said extremely confidently, \u201cLike me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued, \u201cWould an ordinary person have absolutely no reaction when they see someone who looks a lot like them?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was silent for two seconds. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. So now what are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve been played.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

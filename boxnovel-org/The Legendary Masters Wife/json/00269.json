Not only so, this new disciple of his had stomped on Teng ZiXin not only once but multiple times.</p><br/><p>\u201cTu Er, Tu Er?\u201d Seeing You XiaoMo not uttering a word, Duan QiTian shook him a few times.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo then regained his thoughts, he smiled with a bit of embarrassment, \u201cDa shixiong\u2026Hi.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, his eyes stayed fixed on Qi Ran. The Heavenly Soul Scripture was one thing, but this great master right here was a level ten mage, which meant his first time meeting gift must be nowhere less than others, and he was really looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ran lifted his lips without giving any trace of moving.</p><br/><p>No wonder shifu would break his word and take in this disciple, such a personality really was fit to shifu\u2019s\u2026 taste.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know him being thick-skinned and asking for gift had mislead Qiu Ran into thinking this was the reason Duan QiTian had accepted him as a disciple. But even if he knew, it didn\u2019t matter, because getting a gift from a level ten mage was certainly never a loss.</p><br/><p>Since Qiu Ran didn\u2019t expect shifu would accept another disciple, he didn\u2019t prepare any gifts beforehand.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, You XiaoMo was his little shidi, being a Da shixiong himself, it would be too stingy if he didn\u2019t give him any gifts, so he had no other choice but to take out the gift he had prepared for his own disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything good to give it to you, however, this is a high level beast, Thousand Illusion Cat Ball. Even though it is only at level five, it\u2019s potential is high. Let\u2019s see this as my welcome gift to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thousand Illusion Cat Ball, its name had the word \u201cCat\u201d in it, yet, in the reality, its shape didn\u2019t have a slightest relation to a feline. Well, only the name at most, but not the bloodline.</p><br/><p>Thousand Illusion Cat Ball was a high level demon beast that had the shape of a sphere, giving it some imagination, and it looked like a basketball covered with a layer of fluffy white fur, with eyes, nose and ears carved on it. This was the Thousand Illusion Cat Ball \u2018s appearance, but its size was only one fifth compared to a basketball.</p><br/><p>Right now, it was on top of Qiu Ran\u2019s hand and looked at You XiaoMo with a pair of wide opened, glistening cat eyes.</p><br/><p>This was clearly a type of demon beast that used to curry girl\u2019s favor, You XiaoMo twitched his mouth while thinking.</p><br/><p>Although his inner thoughts were screaming, on the outside, he calmly received the Thousand Illusion Cat Ball while giving his gratitude, \u201cThank you da shixiong.\u201d If Qiu Ran knew he was the indirect culprit for his stolen Heavenly Soul Scripture, he wondered if Qiu Ran would regret this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf little shidi likes it, then everything is fine.\u201d Qiu Ran calmly nodded.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian looked at the Thousand Illusion Cat Ball in You XiaoMo\u2019s arms, and satisfyingly nodded. If he remembered correctly, this demon beast was originally a gift Qiu Ran prepared for his own disciple, but now it was given to his little shidi instead. This welcome gift didn\u2019t seem too shabby at all. And he knew Qiu Ran treated his disciple well, so the gift he had been prepared shouldn\u2019t be any less.</p><br/><p>Since they had finally met You XiaoMo, Yan Fa and Qiu Ran then left one after one. They themselves had other business to attend, the reason they would spend time to pay a visit was because Duan QiTian insisted on introducing them to his new disciple.</p><br/><p>Once their figures had completely vanished, Duan QiTian then happily said to You XiaoMo, \u201cTu Er, Tu Er, their gifts to you, you must treat them with care, especially the gift from your Da shixiong Qiu Ran. He gave you a Thousand Illusion Cat Ball. Don\u2019t you see that this beast has no attack power. Let\u2019s wait until it has leveled up into a high level beast, it will be very useful in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave him a nod. Although he hadn\u2019t seen any information about this demon beast mentioned in the scroll about demon beasts, but judging from Qiu Ran\u2019s position, if this beast didn\u2019t have its use, then he wouldn\u2019t take it out as a gift.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, by the way, remember to take it out for a walk frequently.\u201d Duan Qi Tian mysteriously said.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo twitched his mouth, \u201cWhy should I need to take it out frequently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian cunningly smiled, \u201cWhy, to let Teng ZiXin admire it a little bit, ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t really understand his meaning, he gave an innocent look back at him.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian lifted his chin, proudly stated, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a grudge with her? When she knows that her shifu gave the suppose-to-be-her-gift to you, don\u2019t you think she might be angry to earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian might have never meddled in the academy\u2019s matters, but his information source was more reliable than anyone else\u2019s. After he did some digging into his little Tu Er\u2019s tale, he vaguely heard about the grudge between them.</p><br/><p>Although Teng ZiXin was his Tu Sun, but between his own disciple and the disciple of his disciple, no doubt he would choose the first one. Shielding one\u2019s shortcoming was a trait that had long carved into Duan QiTian\u2019s bone, even if he just took in this disciple for a few days.</p><br/><p>t/n: Tu Sun:martial grandchild, the way to call the disciple of your disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right, if she knew her shifu\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo slapped his thigh, and when he about to reach the exciting part, his voice stopped abruptly, \u201cHuh? What did you just said?\u201d</p><br/><p>One moment of distraction, and he almost shouted out in his previous life\u2019s dialect.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian raised his eyebrows, \u201cI said Teng ZiXin, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him and blinked, \u201c\u2026You said Teng ZiXin\u2019s shifu is Da Shixiong? The Thousand Illusion Cat Ball was supposed to be a gift for her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTIan asked with surprise, \u201cYou don\u2019t know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face immediately filled of blood, \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that he recalled about it, he then finally remembered, back then when they there were at the Mage Association, Gao-dage certainly had said about Teng ZiXin having a very powerful mage as her shifu. However, he only thought that her shifu might just be some prestigious high rank mage but not Qiu Ran himself. Second of all, he didn\u2019t meet up with her more than a few times, so he never took it to the heart.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, so many coincidences, ah.</p><br/><p>Teng ZiXin\u2019s shifu was Qiu Ran, and now, Qiu Ran became his senior, destiny really had its way into everything!</p><br/><p>Not only that, You XiaoMo also found out another interesting fact, if Qiu Ran was his Da Shixiong, and Teng ZiXin was Qiu Ran\u2019s disciple, wouldn\u2019t that mean he was Teng ZiXin\u2019s shishu?</p><br/><p>t/n: when you study under the same master, your relationship with other disciples is like a family, master is your parents, and the other disciples of your master are your siblings, thus, the disciple of the disciple is your nephew/niece, and you are the uncle/aunt. Just see this like a big family chart.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that even in his dream he would still be able to laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cShifu, if next time I stumble upon Teng ZiXin, then she should call me shishu, right?\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s expression twisted, he needed to ask the old geezer about this first, so that next time he could make Teng ZiXin call him shishu fair and square.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian gave him a very firm and positive answer, \u201cOf course she has to. Or else it would be very disrespectful towards master, such person doesn\u2019t \u2018t deserve to be this Duan QiTian Tu Sun.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo heartfully hugged Duan QiTian, \u201cShifu, you are too good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian was very happy inside, but pretended to be serious, \u201cSo now you finally see how good I am huh? Next time, do your dare not to want to be my disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ra: shifu, you are sooo cute beyond words.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately answered, \u201cI won\u2019t ever again, so, shifu, when will you be ready to pass on to me your secret knowledge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even better if you quickly pass on to me the heavenly soul scripture, then I won\u2019t need to hide it anymore.</p><br/><p>However, Duan QiTian had some business today, so he told You XiaoMo to come here again tomorrow. His place was right behind this meeting room, by a stream in front and a hill at the back (t.n: nice view), It was a courtyard that had a magic herbs field. Even though he hadn\u2019t been back there for a long time, people came to clean the place everyday without failing, so he didn\u2019t need to clean up anything and could move in directly.</p><br/><p>After You XiaoMo had confirmed the location of the courtyard, he then said goodbye to Duan QiTian and left the meeting room with joy, he wanted to quickly tell this good news to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if Ling Xiao encountered Yan Fa and Qiu Ran when they left the room.</p><br/><p>When he left the room, he saw Ling Xiao was leaning against the pillar and closed his eyes to rest, but by the time he walked out, Ling Xiao immediately opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ling Xiao saw his face was full of a pink aura, and he revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave him an OK hand gesture, he didn\u2019t bother if Ling Xiao could understand its meaning and just blissfully ran toward him. \u201cA bunch of pleasant surprises, I will tell you after we go back. Right, did you happen to see two people walking out of here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao recalled, \u201cYou mean the one with the mustache, and the other one with an expression as if he just ate a fly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mustache one was certainly Yan Fa, so the one with \u2018just ate a fly\u2019 expression must be Qiu Ran. The more he thought about it, the happier he was, \u201cYup, it was those two, the man with the long mustache is Gao-dage\u2019s mentor, Yan Fa, and the other is Qiu Ran. See this, this Thousand Illusion Cat Ball was his welcome gift to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao saw the demon beast in his arms and couldn\u2019t help but lift his mouth and laugh. *hehe*, \u201cVery suitable for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not a single smile appeared on You XiaoMo\u2019s face. \u201cSuitable where? This is clearly a girl\u2019s pet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cI mean, it is suitable for your ball team.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

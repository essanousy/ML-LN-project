A once normal looking map was now covered in miscellaneous lines, making it very confusing to look at.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo snatched the map back, \u201cThose who don\u2019t help have no right to say anything. I finally recovered the broken map of the White Tigers, this is the work of my blood, sweat, and tears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo your, \u2018blood, sweat, and tears\u2019 isn\u2019t that just a bunch of crap on a bunch of crap? Like a kids doodle?\u201d Ling Xiao nodded, smiling, but not really. He sure couldn\u2019t see the hard work in it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held the map protectively in his arms. Of course he knew that his doodles looked a bit like what comes out of one\u2019s rear end, but it was still his hard work. He then tried justifying it, \u201cWhat do you know? That is the point. That way no one else knows what it is but me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t refute it. You XiaoMo felt as if he had finally won a long hard battle.</p><br/><p>On the second day, the two went inside Dong Yu.</p><br/><p>But just as they were about to get through it, they were stopped by a few strangers, one man and two women. The man was decent looking whereas the females were pretty and looked almost the same. It seemed like they were twin sisters.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Niu XuYang.\u201d The man said with a smile as he made obeisance. As if he hadn\u2019t seen the displeasure on You XiaoMo\u2019s face, he pointed at the twin sisters and introduced them, \u201cThey\u2019re Mo Fei and Mo Xue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d You XiaoMo said skeptically. Could it be that they were, once again, attracted here by Ling Xiao\u2019s face? Since not many people knew of them here, they weren\u2019t wearing masks.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang immediately followed, \u201cThe two of you must have heard of the Dong Yu Bandits, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew then, their purpose.</p><br/><p>Dong Yu Bandits was a special occupation created because of the existence of Dong Yu.</p><br/><p>Not everyone who went to Dong Yu had an adventurous spirit, rather, some of them simply wished to profit without doing anything. These types of people would often hide where the most people were and rob those who were alone or weak.</p><br/><p>These types of scenarios were common in Dong Yu and the name of the Dong Yu Bandits were well known across the land. Many adventurers were weary of them.</p><br/><p>Now with the rumor of a legendary cave dwelling, the people who came to Dong Yu doubled. The bandits were surely going to take this opportunity to make a fortune.</p><br/><p>Thus, many thought of grouping together, as the groups became bigger and stronger, the bandits wouldn\u2019t dare to rob them.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang and the sisters had been here since the morning, looking for potential teammates. First, they couldn\u2019t look too ugly, that was on the request of the sisters, and since Niu XuYang liked the older sister, Mo Xue, he granted her every request. Secondly was to be strong, no less than the Imperial Realm and lastly no females.</p><br/><p>The second and third condition was easily met, those who dared come to Dong Yu were usually strong and mostly they were men. However, the first condition was the issue.</p><br/><p>Although it was just, \u2018not too ugly\u2019, but in reality, their standards were very high.</p><br/><p>They were really picky. When Niu XuYang found someone who was relatively strong and didn\u2019t look too bad, Mo Xue was upset, saying that his nose was crooked, also that it would ruin her mood, having him on the team.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang patiently kept picking but they were either rejected by Mo Fei or Mo Xue, using all kinds of weird reasons too. Now that an hour had passed, they hadn\u2019t even acquired one teammate.</p><br/><p>Just as Niu XuYang was in a panic about what to do, he was pinched on the arm by Mo Xue. That was when he saw the sisters staring at a man who looked as if God has descended from Heaven. Their eyes were fixated on him, and the next thing he knew, they insisted on getting this man to join their team.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang felt conflicted. The man was too handsome. If Mo Xue fell in love with him, what was he going to do?</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang wasn\u2019t very willing, but pressured by the sisters, he could only brace himself and invite them. So what You XiaoMo had guessed was true, they were after Ling Xiao\u2019s looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here to invite us to your team because you feel that we\u2019re strong?\u201d You XiaoMo realized that Mo Xue and her sister hadn\u2019t shifted their gaze from Ling Xiao since the beginning. To hell with \u2018strength\u2019, they were clearly here for Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang continued, \u201cThis should be the first time for you guys right? First-timers usually don\u2019t know this, but the situation inside Dong Yu is very dangerous. Many of those bandits are of the Emperor Realm, at least four or five of them. If you don\u2019t join a team, they\u2019re very likely to pick on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want teammates.\u201d You XiaoMo rejected him outright. They were here for the treasure, they couldn\u2019t have outsiders on their team. Of course, the main issue was that he hated how the twins looked at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>If he really let them join, he couldn\u2019t be certain that he wouldn\u2019t poke their eyes out.</p><br/><p>Niu XuYang paused for a moment before showing an expression of disappointment, but inside, he breathed a sigh of relief. This way, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really won\u2019t consider it?\u201d Niu XuYang didn\u2019t want Mo Xue to realize his true feelings, so he asked again to keep up the farce.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head, \u201cNo need\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Mo Xue hurriedly stopped him, \u201cYour partner didn\u2019t say anything yet and we are mostly inviting him. Unless you can make a decision for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew that they weren\u2019t going to let the matter go easily, so he wasn\u2019t surprised to hear this. Lifting the corner of his mouth, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I can make any decision for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe want to hear his thoughts.\u201d Mo Fei lifted her chin up in arrogance. Compared to a stinky man and one that didn\u2019t consider her feelings, she was confident that with her beauty, the man would want to be with them instead.</p><br/><p>Beside her, her sister also straighten her posture, showing off her incredible curves.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt the corner of his mouth twitch. Really, another brain-damaged-overly-confident person. But the chief culprit was still Ling Xiao. Without the mask, he really attracted people like bees to flowers. He had thought that there weren\u2019t many females in Dong Yu, but when luck went around, one couldn\u2019t stop, could they?</p><br/><p>Thinking it this far, You XiaoMo turned to glare at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rubbed his nose. Without even looking at the sisters, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cOn this planet, there\u2019s bound to be people who are brain damaged. However, if we were concerned with everyone of them, don\u2019t you think your IQ would be pulled down into the triple negative digits?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A critical hit!</p><br/><p>Since he was already in the double digit negatives, You XiaoMo stood firm in not falling to the triple digits. Okay, I\u2019m a man with a big heart, and I\u2019m not going to be bothered by stupid people.</p><br/><p>Thus, the double digit You XiaoMo was calmed down by a few words of his husband. The two then went hand in hand happily inside.</p><br/><p>Behind them, the two sisters expressions, upon hearing Ling Xiao\u2019s mockery, turned very ugly. The affection in their eyes had been replaced with hatred. So, as the saying went, a woman\u2019s emotions comes and goes like a storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare he ridicule me! We\u2019re definitely not letting them off the hook. Hurry, we\u2019re going to follow them.\u201d Mo Xue\u2019s words were immediately supported by Mo Fei and the two went in without asking for Niu XuYang\u2019s opinion. All Niu XuYang could do was follow them.</p><br/><p>There was only a mountain that stood between the village and Dong Yu. Behind the crowded village was empty, unclaimed land. Even the ongoing shadows of people couldn\u2019t change that feeling. It was a place waiting to be discovered.</p><br/><p>The complete version of the map showed that the right eye of the tiger was their destination. It didn\u2019t look hard to find but the head the of tiger was the most damaged, so recovering this part took You XiaoMo a lot of time. Even now he wasn\u2019t completely sure of it\u2019s exact whereabouts, only the approximate area.</p><br/><p>The good thing was that the position of the eyes was fixed. If it could change, then he would really be searching for it till the end of time.</p><br/><p>Judging by the position of the eyes, You XiaoMo picked out two directions it could be. Due to the grand battle from before, the white tiger\u2019s head was split in halves, creating a deep canyon. He didn\u2019t know which side it was on so he said to Ling Xiao, pointing at the map, \u201cWe\u2019ll split up, you go there and I\u2019ll go here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether.\u201d Ling Xiao interjected.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the truth of the legendary cave dwelling, the ones who liked adventure wouldn\u2019t pass on something like this and it was often those people who were powerful. Working alone was likely to draw unwanted attention.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t need to ask to understand Ling Xiao\u2019s concerns and after remembering the sisters that were tailing them, he felt the need to have a close eye on Ling Xiao too.</p><br/><p>It was very interesting how the canyon was created, it started from the left eye, reaching horizontally to the right. It split the head North from South, so they didn\u2019t know which side it was on.</p><br/><p>The two of them decided to go the closer one first, the South side. As for the twin sisters, they were quickly thrown off their trail.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

On the contrary, he looked very delighted instead.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo turned his head, he saw him laughing, so he couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised the corner of his mouth, and said jokingly, \u201cYoung master, your imposing manner today is good. I\u2019ve known you for so long, I didn\u2019t know that you had such a sharp tongue.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t call me young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The heck is a young master, too much pressure!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smilingly said: \u201cYoung master, are you blushing?\u201d</p><br/><p>You really have gotten addicted to toying with me! You XiaoMo glanced at him, and then turned back to the registration point at the square.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao followed behind him, while teasing him with \u2018young master\u2019 every now and then. He really got addicted to toying around with him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was harassed continuously, and finally decided to ignore him. He had already gotten into two fights today, he didn\u2019t have much energy left. He had to rest to recharge his energy.</p><br/><p>Because they went through the back door, they finished much earlier than other people. When they returned to the square, not only had the number of people not decreased, they were spreading out like fire instead.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao found Liu Yue, who didn\u2019t have to wait in the long queue. Because practitioners only needed to determine their age and strength, the speed was much faster. There were a thousand people in that line before, now it was only around seven hundred or eight hundred people.</p><br/><p>When he saw them came over, Liu Yue was surprised. How come they had finished the registration so fast?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo realized his puzzled expression, and said: \u201cWe accidentally got through the backdoor, so we have already finished registering my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue became speechless. To be able to accidentally go through the back door, they really were too tough.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo actually wanted to bring Liu Yue through the back door too, but when he thought that he was currently registering in Ling Xiao\u2019s stead, it would be troublesome if they were found out, because it would be different than being rejected at the registration in the square.</p><br/><p>Since there were too many people, the daoshi couldn\u2019t be bothered to remember each person who came and went in detail, their observation would be much lower, so it would be advantageous for Liu Yue. As soon as he passed, both of them could return to their own identities. The ordinary face that Ling Xiao currently was using was Liu Yue\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, this line would take an hour, would you like to look for a place to rest, and then come back here after an hour?\u201d Liu Yue suggested.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head, \u201cDon\u2019t need to. I will wait with you.\u201d He didn\u2019t have anything to do anyway, and the most important thing was that he was afraid that Liu Yue would make a mistake, and then Ling Xiao couldn\u2019t join Dao Xin Academy with him. He would cry to death.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue who didn\u2019t know You XiaoMo\u2019s thoughts, was suddenly moved. He became more certain that these two were his knights in shining armor.</p><br/><p>He was always alone, even when he was a child. He didn\u2019t know know who his parents were and had been rolling, touching, and crawling on every dirty place, and he already saw many ugly things. Everyone around him got close to each other only to rob the other person. In order to survive and become stronger, he had already done many things like that against his will. He always thought that his fate was bad.</p><br/><p>Now that he had met them in this life, he decided to use this opportunity as much as possible.</p><br/><p>They calculated that their line would take an hour before they could register.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo actually wanted to look for a shorter line, but other people had the same idea as him. So when he just found one, other people immediately lined up there, so he had to go back to their place.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rubbed his head and said, \u201cI already told you before, and you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at him silently thinking, okay, I\u2019m just looking for trouble myself. Happy?</p><br/><p>Before an hour was up, the long line in the front of them was gone.</p><br/><p>When it was Liu Yue\u2019s turn, the daoshi tested his age and strength. The overall process went smoothly, but because he wore a mask, the daoshi looked at him more intently. Luckily, they were not the only ones who registered while wearing a mask.</p><br/><p>After that, they left the plaza and had to look for an inn to stay for a few nights. But the better rooms at taverns and inns were already full, so they could only look for lower quality ones.</p><br/><p>At this time, both of them still didn\u2019t know, because of the incident at the hall, You XiaoMo became famous in just a few hours. As for whether it was in a good way or bad way, everyone reacted differently.</p><br/><p>Some favored You XiaoMo, such as Gao Yang and Ning Jing, while some had nothing to do with him, they were just gossipping around with other people that with this year\u2019s recruiting students there was someone whose skill was very high, and \u2018that person\u2019 could be considered as a genius.</p><br/><p>In the past, Dao Xin Academy would take great importance with these geniuses.</p><br/><p>The genius who were taken care of with such importance would of course have a bright future, no matter whether they were from an aristocratic family or not.</p><br/><p>But some people held resentment toward You XiaoMo, and would spread bad words about him to others. Like how this year, there is a new student called You XiaoMo who is very arrogant, not only had he dared to say his age wrong to gain some fame, he even let his bodyguard injure the third son of the Chai family. He cared for nobody, was extremely arrogant, and so on.</p><br/><p>You can\u2019t say that their efforts didn\u2019t bear any fruit. At least some people who had yet to meet You XiaoMo already had a deep impression about him, and some obscure and arrogant mentors even stated that they wouldn\u2019t accept such a student.</p><br/><p>But for people who already knew what kind of person Chai Jun is, only one percent believed their words.</p><br/><p>Having said that, You XiaoMo has indeed became the hottest topic of this year\u2019s student enrollment. Originally he wanted to keep low profile, so he didn\u2019t expect he would end up becoming high profile instead. When You XiaoMo found out about this, he would most likely start vomiting blood.</p><br/><p>Inside the inn, Liu Yue and Ling Xiao had already turned back into their original forms.</p><br/><p>The former was already aware of Ling Xiao\u2019s face and identity, and he already learned his every act and movement, the pressure was especially big; the latter disliked the coarse clothes, so he wanted to turn back as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>After he turned back into himself, Liu Yue finally breathed a sigh of relief, and secretly glanced at Ling Xiao who had already turned back to his self. Surely enough, he couldn\u2019t learn anything from this master who was very talented. When he thought about that, he couldn\u2019t help but remember the decision that he made before he registered.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was just taking out Ling Xiao\u2019s mask from his magic bag, when suddenly heard a \u2018thump\u2019 sound. When he turned around to look, it was actually Liu Yue who suddenly knelt down in front of them. Since he used quite enough strength, he bet Liu Yue\u2019s knees must be hurts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d You XiaoMo asked at once.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue faced his head on to the floor, and begged: \u201cSirs, I will follow you, I ask you to accept me, I will do anything for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t expect him to do this, so he became speechless.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t get surprised at all, and looked like he had already expected him to do this.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked: \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to get your memory erased?\u201d Actually, his impression towards Liu Yue is not bad.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue immediately shook his head: \u201cNo, I really want to follow, sir, I\u2026 I want to become stronger.\u201d He felt that only by following both of them would he have the chance to become stronger.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo heard his last sentence, he couldn\u2019t help but feel moved.</p><br/><p>But he holds so many secrets, if he added another person to his side, the probability of his secret becoming exposed would increase, so he didn\u2019t want to take a risk. But he also understood Liu Yue\u2019s persistence, so he was in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can give you a chance.\u201d Ling Xiao said unhurriedly.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue brightened up, \u201cWhat kind of chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cYou should take the chance while the enrollment hasn\u2019t end yet and register yourself in, but use your original face. In addition, I won\u2019t erase your memory, but I want you to swear, never speak a word about this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Yue was actually very interested in Dao Xin Academy, he knew if he could enroll in Dao Xin academy and learn every kind of soul and skill training there, he would have a better future than struggling on his own. But he also knew he was blessed by these two\u2019s grace, if they didn\u2019t agree, then surely he would never have a chance to register. But he didn\u2019t expect that this great man would actually agree. He was so happy he was almost speechless.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue excitedly raised his hand and said, \u201cI swear, I will never tell a soul about your situation, if I go against my word, thunder shall strike upon me and I will die in awful way. I am willing to follow you sirs forever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to follow me, like I have said, I have only given you a chance, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have agreed for you to follow us. It is all on you whether you are able to grasp this chance or not.\u201d Ling Xiao interrupted his words.</p><br/><p>Liu Yue felt a little disappointed when they rejected his following, but this result was blissful enough.</p><br/><p>The him few days ago would never even dream about such places like Dao Xin Academy. And so Liu Yue hurriedly left the inn to register. Even though he had already registered once, that was when he was under another identity. Besides, the Soul Stone could only check the age, as long as he avoided the same daoshi and the registration point he had registered at before, then he was safe.</p><br/><p>After Liu Yue left, You XiaoMo finally had a chance to ask his question, \u201cWhy did you let him enroll in the academy? Aren\u2019t you worried about him revealing our secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>Until now he never thought Ling Xiao was the type that would happily help people.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed, \u201cRest assured, Liu Yue is a perceptive man, he knows what he should and shouldn\u2019t do. The reason I helped him was because people have already seen this \u201cLiu Yue\u201d at the hall, if he one day went missing then someone would surely investigate, which will increase the possibility of being exposed.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded, he was right, toward unexpected situations, even they wouldn\u2019t be able to act in time.</p><br/><p>Around the closing time of the registration, when night started to fall down, Liu Yue also came back. He was very careful, so no one had discovered him.</p><br/><p>That night, many people went to bed early, many people were busy preparing their mental state for the next day\u2019s test. Meanwhile for You XiaoMo, he took his time and went into the space while Ling Xiao was taking a bath. All the fieldwork had been done by the Qiu team, and they were in their human forms and sat by the lake and practiced.</p><br/><p>There were also those two Dipper Stink Bugs, since the Dipper Herb supply was fully stocked, everyday for them was \u201ceat until full then sleep, sleep until full then eat.\u201d The results was that a few days ago they successfully stepped into their first transformation state. You XiaoMo went and checked them out and found that they were still inactive, so he left the space.</p><br/><p>The next morning, the three once again went to the square for the upcoming test.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But because the seal on the jade drive was too powerful, and Ling Xiao couldn\u2019t undo it even as a Divine Realm practitioner, the matter continued to be pushed back. By now, many months had already passed, and he had nearly forgotten about it entirely.</p><br/><p>Remembering this, he almost couldn\u2019t control himself.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xiao had recently finished absorbing the Dragon Clan\u2019s inheritance. But in order to master a few of the Dragon Clan\u2019s techniques, he had left XiaoYao Institution in search of a far away place with no people to practice his cultivation, and he wouldn\u2019t be back before dusk.</p><br/><p>No matter how anxious You XiaoMo was, he still had to wait.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t wait until Ling Xiao came back, instead Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye came to visit.</p><br/><p>It was rare that the two of them would come at the same time to find him, so You XiaoMo invited them into his room and poured them two cups of cold tea, acting as a host. The tea was only hot when Ling Xiao was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have cold tea here, no hot tea or wine. Make do with this for now.\u201d The two of them looked at the cold tea in front of them and didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t feel that it was awkward. \u201cWhy did you come to find me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I heard that you and Ling Mo went to the ZhongTing Trade Fair a few days ago and met my master and Jiu Ye\u2019s master.\u201d Qiao WuXing said deliberately.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was nothing particularly worth hiding about this incident. The two of them had already said that those two were their masters, and it couldn\u2019t be any more normal for their disciples to know. You XiaoMo was pretty curious as for what they wanted to say.</p><br/><p>If they had received their Master\u2019s trust and come to be on friendly terms with him, there was absolutely no need for that, because their relationship right now was already pretty good. Although it wasn\u2019t a friendship for life, they could still be considered friends nonetheless. It was also unlikely that they came to trick him into telling the truth. It wasn\u2019t as if he was an idiot, so how could the matter about the Spiritual Water be casually tricked out of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s nothing much. I came to tell you about something. If you want to climb to a higher floor in the tower as soon as possible, you can try to go challenge XiaoYao Institute\u2019s special rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the special rules?\u201d This was the first time You XiaoMo heard of this.</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye\u2019s cool voice slowly said, \u201cThe so-called special rules are set up for powerful experts who cannot wait for three months. But it isn\u2019t as if anyone who wishes to challenge the special rules can challenge them. You need a recommendation from a prestigious elder in order to enter the quota.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded. \u201cWhat do you have to do in the challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing said, \u201cIt\u2019s actually very simple, you only have to compete against a teacher in the institute. If you beat him, then you can ascend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of competition is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComparing pill-refining techniques.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought about it for a bit. \u201cLet me ask, how powerful is this teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye slowly spat out a few words. \u201cAt least of the first grade rainbow level.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he compare to this? Right now, at the very most he could only refine level ten medium grade magic pills. If the opponent could refine a one-color pill then he would lose for sure. A one-color pill meant a first grade rainbow pill, since a first grade rainbow pill only had a thread of color, it was also addressed using a color.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing laughed and said, \u201cIf the teacher\u2019s isn\u2019t very powerful, then how can it be called special rules? After all, you\u2019re challenging XiaoYao Institute\u2019s rules, so it\u2019s a little more difficult. Moreover, every person only has three chances to challenge the special rules. Once you\u2019ve used them all up, you can only abide properly by the rules and climb up that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to worry too much.\u201d Jiu Ye said, smiling.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo used his eyes to indicate that he should keep talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the teacher you\u2019ll be challenging will be at the first grade rainbow level, the success rate of refining and creating rainbow pills is definitely not high. They have requirements for their surroundings and for themselves, so every time someone challenges the special rules, the teacher won\u2019t refine a rainbow pill then and there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic herbs required for a rainbow pill were extremely expensive and hard to find. If it failed, finding all the magic herbs again would be difficult, so if there wasn\u2019t above a 70-80% chance of success, there was absolutely no teacher who would dare to casually attempt it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will carefully consider this.\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you decide, you can notify us whenever.\u201d Qiao WuXing stood up. There must be a certain amount of time to prepare before the special rules.</p><br/><p>After sending the two of them off, You XiaoMo closed the door.</p><br/><p>Returning to the table, You XiaoMo picked up the cups and drank the cold tea that the two of them hadn\u2019t touched. Tsk tsk, cold tea actually tasted pretty good. Even though he was always very stupid in front of Ling Xiao, he actually hadn\u2019t lost his IQ.</p><br/><p>For Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye to suddenly run to come find him and say that it had nothing to do with their masters was something he definitely couldn\u2019t trust. It was more likely than not that this was something their Masters suggested. As for the reason, if he thought about it carefully he would know.</p><br/><p>Last time at the ZhongTing Trade Fair, although he had told them to their face that he didn\u2019t have any extra Spiritual Water, two old people who were that shrewd definitely wouldn\u2019t trust him completely. So after that, they sent their own disciples to tell him of the existence of the special rules.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing had never told him about the existence of the special rules before this, most likely because he thought that You XiaoMo wouldn\u2019t be able to beat a teacher of the rainbow mage level at that time, but if it was suggested by his master then that was a different matter.</p><br/><p>Under Old Lei and Old Shen\u2019s judgement, it was likely that they had already discovered his cultivation level.</p><br/><p>If he really agreed to challenge the special rules and if he wanted to beat the teacher at his current cultivation level, he would have to use the Spiritual Water, unless the opponent played it easy on him. He would use the Spiritual Water to promote the magic pill to another grade.</p><br/><p>This would be able to confirm whether or not he still had Spiritual Water with him.</p><br/><p>He trusted that the two old men wouldn\u2019t try to steal his things, but they would definitely wear him down to the point where he would sell them the Spiritual Water. They were truly two sinister old fellows. They knew he very much wanted to go to a higher floor, so they used the special rules to lure him in, ensuring that he wouldn\u2019t relinquish this opportunity, wasn\u2019t that right?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was very hesitant. He wanted to go up quite badly, but\u2026</p><br/><p>When Ling Xiao entered the room, he saw You XiaoMo, who had his chin cupped in both of his hands and was dejectedly heaving deep sighs. This expression didn\u2019t suit him at all, and the more he looked at him the more amusing it became.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo seemed as if he was in a trance, and he didn\u2019t notice that Ling Xiao had already returned.</p><br/><p>He only noticed when his chin was suddenly turned to the side by a hand and he was met with a handsome, heroic-looking face that was moving closer. His lips were covered by another pair of somewhat cold lips and his slightly open mouth was forcefully invaded, dazing him in a split second.</p><br/><p>It was a five minute long kiss, and You XiaoMo felt like he lost half of his life because of a lack of oxygen. His mouth was red and swollen from the kiss, and his melancholy atmosphere turned into a ravished one. Truly, it truly made his balls hurt!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao scooped him up and placed him on his legs before sliding one of his hands inside his disheveled shirt in an erotic movement, as well as the \u2018rod\u2019 below which was preparing to lift its head.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly grabbed his hand. \u201cWait a second, I have something important to discuss with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, I\u2019m doing something important right now, let\u2019s do it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sucked in a deep breath and decided go straight to the point, not giving Ling Xiao an opportunity. \u201cA few hours ago, Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye came over. Most likely their masters told them to come, and their purpose was to tell me about one of XiaoYao Institute\u2019s special rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions,\u201d Ling Xiao assessed, finally stopping his hand movements, straightening the clothes in front of his chest with some regret. \u201cIt must have something to do with the Spiritual Water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo was a little put out. He hadn\u2019t even told him about the content of the special rules, yet Ling Xiao had actually guessed it. Wasn\u2019t he just trying to deliberately infuriate him? After that he used an unhappy tone to generally describe the situation to him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao placed his chin on You XiaoMo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about their purpose, what are you hesitating over?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said haltingly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say before that if I went above the 70th floor, you couldn\u2019t go up with me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was staring fixedly at his collarbone. When he heard this, he answered, \u201cIdiot, I can\u2019t go up, but can you not come out to find me? It\u2019s not as if XiaoYao Institute has rules saying that their students must live in Giganticus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two large words flashed in You XiaoMo\u2019s mind: day school!</p><br/><p>Cold sweat involuntarily dripped down. He had almost forgotten that in his previous life, he had also gone to a high school with a day school system. His only regret had been that if he went up, Ling Xiao wouldn\u2019t be able to live in Giganticus anymore, and without his student ID, Ling Xiao also wouldn\u2019t be able to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should we do about the Spiritual Water thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The circumstances that Jiu Ye had talked about was only a possibility. There was no need for the teacher he challenged to actually not refine a one-color pill, so he also had to consider this kind of situation and come up with countermeasures before responding.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how much you promote a level ten magic pill you still can\u2019t turn it into a rainbow pill.\u201d Ling Xiao pondered. \u201cWhether a rainbow pill can be a rainbow pill mostly depends on its ingredients. Every magic herb has its restrictions. If you could change the level of a magic herb just by depending on an outside object, then people wouldn\u2019t have to differentiate magic herbs by levels.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly slapped down his hand. \u201cThe reason that a level ten low grade magic pill can use Spiritual Water to be promoted to a level ten medium grade magic pill is because the ingredients that they use are all level ten magic herbs, so they\u2019re on the same rank. A magic pill\u2019s grade can be promoted, but it\u2019s not possible if you want to surpass a magic pill\u2019s level. For example, for a level ten high grade magic pill to be changed into a one-color pill, in theory this cannot be achieved by using an outside object, correct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect!\u201d Ling Xiao bit his earlobe once as a reward.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hastily moved his head away. He didn\u2019t want this kind of reward.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed. \u201cQiao WuXing and Jiu Ye\u2019s master surely can also think of this scenario, or perhaps they\u2019ve already tested it before. So if you accept the challenge, that teacher definitely won\u2019t refine a one-color pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, it wasn\u2019t just this.</p><br/><p>If the teacher refined a one-color pill, then the special rules couldn\u2019t be called special rules, but rather death rules. There was no need to establish special rules that didn\u2019t give students a chance of success.</p><br/><p>At that moment, You XiaoMo had a feeling as if he had pushed apart the clouds and seen the blue sky.</p><br/><p>No wonder Jiu Ye said that the teacher usually wouldn\u2019t refine a one-color pill. This was the real reason, and if this happened, then he had about a 70-80% chance of success, if he remembered back to when he refined a high grade magic pill even as a mage who could only make low grade pills during the assessment at DaoXin Academy.</p><br/><p>Although the levels of the magic pills were different now, and the degree of difficulty would also increase by a lot, he trusted that he could still leap over one grade.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, the problem has been resolved. Let\u2019s go to bed and do important things.\u201d Ling Xiao scooped him up. The sun had just set, so now they could do things that were supposed to be done at night.</p><br/><p>It was only when he was placed on the bed that You XiaoMo remembered the matter that he had been repeating in his mind since the morning. This was more important. \u201cI have some business that\u2019s even more important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your business more important, or is my business more important?\u201d Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallowed, and said, unafraid of death, \u201cMine is more important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026yours is more important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dusk rose high in the sky, and by the time Giganticus sank into an expanse of darkness, when the sound of the creaking bed and cries of ecstasy finally stopped in a certain room, it was already late at night.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laid on top of Ling Xiao\u2019s body, completely naked, and his smooth, pale back was dotted with blue and purple spots, revealing the fierce situation that had just taken place. Underneath the blanket, the place where the two of them were joined still hadn\u2019t separated yet.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his fingers and said, unwaveringly, \u201cI have something important to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had a face full of satisfaction, and he patted his head and smiled. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sniffled, this was too miserable!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Sealed Jade Drive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was silent for a few seconds, as if he was remembering what the Sealed Jade Drive was, before he felt around for the Sealed Jade Drive he had dropped into his ring dimension. \u201cAre you talking about this thing? I forgot to undo it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears streamed down You XiaoMo\u2019s cheeks. He just knew that Ling Xiao forgot.</p><br/><p>By now Ling Xiao was already a Sacred Realm expert, but the opponent was also clearly an expert with high-level cultivation. If they wanted to undo the seal that he made, it truly wouldn\u2019t be easy. They would very likely attract the attention of experts hidden in XiaoYao Institute, so Ling Xiao held You XiaoMo and directly entered his dimension.</p><br/><p>(Ra: Boss\u2019s priority: Make love &gt; everything.

The overcrowding people caused the distance between them to widen, but that figure very soon shortened it, although, the situation still didn\u2019t get any better at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mo, wait for me.\u201d The young man tried to jump up, afraid that this flood of people would drown him and make the person not be able to see him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know what to say, he turned his head back and said, \u201cBaiLi XiaoYu, can you go back. I\u2019m only going to find my friend, not going on some harrowing journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>After what happened this morning, You XiaoMo felt so regretful that his intestines turned bluish (t/n: when you die, you organs turn bluish, thus means regret to death). He absolutely would never have imagined that Tong YueXu, who was originally opposed to BaiLi XiaoYu and him hanging out, would, unexpectedly, give in to BaiLi XiaoYu. He even ignored them and let BaiLi XiaoYu tag along with him. BaiLi XiaoYu himself, not only did he not get hurt by his words, but also fiercely declared that he would definitely swallow that bitter pill.</p><br/><p>So, after making the statement, on that very same day, BaiLi XiaoYu let his men help move all of his stuff out from the pavilion and then moved back into the four person room with Jiang XiaoFeng. From there on, BaiLi XiaoYu became so attached to You XiaoMo like a shadow that he couldn\u2019t shake off.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had explained to him multiple times, but BaiLi XiaoYu still assumed that You XiaoMo went out to do some hard job, thus he refused to go back and insisted on following him.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu immediately ran toward him, patted his chest and said, \u201cYou can be rest assured, I won\u2019t drag your feet.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo facepalmed, \u201cYou have already!\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu whispered, \u201cIf you give me a second chance, I will definitely become an remarkable person that can handle difficulty and won\u2019t rely on everybody.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words might have seemed unconvincing, but in the reality, BaiLi XiaoYu really followed his promise.</p><br/><p>The BaiLi clan would never imagine, their youngest son, the little boy that everyone held dear inside their palm and pampered, could become a responsible, independent man that could make decisions on his own and he, himself, even projected a slightly formidable aura. To summarize, a shota transformed into a bishonen that dissimulated a black heart. And all of this, You XiaoMo definitely was the one who had the most credit.t/n:  ( black abdomen) is a term to described the type of person that may seem nice on the outside but evil/have dark thought/sly and foxy on the inside. Also, author use shota and bishonen literally here.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026using your status, you don\u2019t have to be like that.\u201d You XiaoMo looked at his serious expression and he didn\u2019t know why, but felt his guilty conscience rise up. Seemed like he had caused the little flower of the BaiLi clan to grow crooked, and even You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t tell for sure if this crooked direction is good or bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, what you said is right. I shouldn\u2019t always rely on my family or YueXu-ge and run to them whenever I have a problem. I want to be a brave man that can solve my own problems and not go crying from everything.\u201d BaiLi XiaoYu earnestly said.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched, so before today, you were the type that will cry at everything?!</p><br/><p>Then, BaiLi XiaoYu looked at him with an expectant look, \u201cThat is why, don\u2019t shoo me away, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a deep breath and sighed, \u201cFine, you can tag along if you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeahh!\u201d BaiLi XiaoYu immediately cheered, but held back when he saw You XiaoMo looking at him. \u201cXiao Mo, where are we going to find your friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused and cogitated, then he talked as he walked, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the free four person room to check first. He enrolled in this academy at the same times as us, so he shouldn\u2019t have the ability to move away for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since BaiLi XiaoYu listened to every word You XiaoMo said he had no objection. After some wandering around, they finally found Block One\u2019s dormitory. However, there were several four person rooms there, the two of them couldn\u2019t search every single one, so You XiaoMo suggested asking someone.</p><br/><p>The lad looked at You XiaoMo and BaiLi XiaoYu with surprise, one of them was bright, cute and clever, while the other one looked like he was carved out of jade and covered with powder (t/n: fair n smooth skin ), this combination clearly indicated they didn\u2019t belong to Block One.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d The lad saw them stop in front of him, and he took back his surprise before asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, big brother, do you know where Block One\u2019s freshman reside?\u201d You XiaoMo politely asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFresh man, ah, you want to find someone? This year\u2019s freshman is a third more than last year. Their places are literally everywhere. If you want to find your acquaintance, I\u2019m afraid that even until sunset, you still won\u2019t be able to find the person. How about you guys tell me that person\u2019s name and level, I may be able to help you ask around a bit.\u201d Being stared at by those two black round eyes, the lad couldn\u2019t help but be softhearted.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and BaiLi XiaoYu spoke at the same time, \u201cReally? Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lad felt funny, \u201cNo problem, first, tell me about his situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately replied, \u201cHis name is Liu Yue, and he is a Sun level martial artist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSun level?\u201d The lad stroked his chin, \u201cI never heard of his name before, but if he is a Sun level, in fact, I might know where he lives, you can go check the Sixth Winter Courtyard, he probably is there.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying thanks to the lad, the two of them ran toward the mentioned place.</p><br/><p>Block One\u2019s dormitory was like Block Two\u2019s, it also divided into four courtyards, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and students were assigned in the respective order according to their strength from high to low. Each courtyard was also divided into six smaller yards. For example, like what that lad just told them the Sixth Winter courtyard, there was also First Winter, to Second Winter\u2026 and finally, Sixth winter, which the living condition was also in the respective order from high to low. So, Liu Yue\u2019s room was a four person room, and since his level was also at the bottom, therefore, he should be residing in the worst courtyard.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the Winter Courtyard had an instruction sign so it was easy to locate. Fifteen minutes later, the two of them finally found the Sixth Winter Courtyard that the lad had told them about. The living condition here was as terrible as Block Two\u2019s. As they moved all the way inside, they saw no one at all, even if there was, there were just a few people hastily walking by.</p><br/><p>Not until they reached the innermost part of the courtyard did they finally see some silhouettes flocking into a circle. There was non-stop cursing, sneering, giggling and loud laughter coming continuously from those bunch of people.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo and BaiLi XiaoYu approached, they found out, in the middle of the group was a man being beaten by multiple guys, as his back was shown in front of their eyes so they couldn\u2019t see the face. His clothes was covered in mud and dirt, his hair was messy, and everyone could tell that he was in a difficult position.</p><br/><p>At that time, a tough hefty dude spit on the man under his feet, his face was as hideous as he started cursing, \u201cLiu Yue, where is your arrogance ah? If you have the guts, fucking stand up! Why is that you, who dares to embarrass our third young master Chai, right now act like a chicken? Stand up ah, trash!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he lifted up his feet and ruthlessly stomped on Liu Yue a few times. The others not only didn\u2019t stop that guy\u2019s actions, they even laughed *haha* loudly at Liu Yue\u2019s sorry figure.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo expression changed from surprise to anger, he didn\u2019t expect Liu Yue to have to suffer such treatment, if it was not for that dude calling Liu Yue\u2019s name, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize this one on the ground was Liu Yue.</p><br/><p>As his anger rushed to his head, You XiaoMo pushed people aside straight away. Those people didn\u2019t expect someone would rush in, so they couldn\u2019t act in time, that hefty dude who stomped on Liu Yue was pushed behind two steps as his hateful feet were finally removed from Liu Yue\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Yue, how are you?\u201d You XiaoMo didn\u2019t mind how dirty Liu Yue was, he helped Liu Yue sweep off all the dirt.</p><br/><p>In fact, Liu Yue was a complete innocent passerby in this matter, it was not his fault. If You XiaoMo had known earlier, he wouldn\u2019t let Ling Xiao be disguised as Liu Yue, so that Liu Yue wouldn\u2019t end up in such situation.</p><br/><p>Looking at those people\u2019s attitude it seemed like this was not the first time they abused Liu Yue, they probably had fixed their attention on Liu Yue the first time he entered the academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung\u2026young master?\u201d Liu Yue eyes were swollen shut like a walnut, he couldn\u2019t fully open them fully and could barely see who arrived. Although he couldn\u2019t see the face clearly, he could recognize the voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, this is all my fault!\u201d You XiaoMo quickly helped him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it not your fault, young master.\u201d Liu Yue shook his head, he knew the reason why those people attacked him, but until now he had never put the blame on young master and that great man. If it hadn\u2019t been for them, he wouldn\u2019t be able to enter Dao Xin Academy in his lifetime. Such a hardship was nothing compared to the day when he was still on the Life and Death street, as his hands and feet were once chopped by people, and yet he still managed to handle them all.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew he was telling the truth, but he still felt guilty ah!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this brat coming from, you dare to wreck your uncle\u2019s work, do you want to die?\u201d That hefty man, after his feet managed to land on the ground steadily after the push, he saw the one who came was two brats, so he suddenly got angry.</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu didn\u2019t wait for You XiaoMo to talk, he stood up instantly and put his hand on his waist, with a robust aura that didn\u2019t lose to that hefty man, \u201cYou dare to claim yourself \u2018uncle\u2019 in front of my face?! And not to mention, you dare to hit my people? You are the one that is sick of living! What is your name, and give me the name of the one who ordered you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flock suddenly got frightened, but not because of BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s words, but because they saw BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s expensive clothing, which told them, he might not from an ordinary family. In that moment, not a single one dared to snap, after all they were just freshman, if they poked a fight with students that had some background, in the end they would be the ones who got into trouble.</p><br/><p>That hefty dude cautiously asked, \u201cSir, what is your name? We came here on Third young master Chai\u2019s order, to add some color onto this brat\u2019s face a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi XiaoYu immediately flipped, \u201cThird young master Chai, Chai Jun? That fucking grandson even dared to touch BaiLi XiaoYu\u2019s men, looks like you lot have lived too long.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing his announcement, their legs almost gave in, BaiLi XiaoYu? They might have not heard the name, but the two words BaiLi, how could they never have heard about it. The BaiLi Clan that even the Chai Clan didn\u2019t dare to provoke, no wonder he could bravely call Chai Jun grandson.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo heard their conversation, he helped Liu Yue stand up, then his expression turned gloomy in an instant, \u201cChai Jun again, I will not let him get away this time,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, don\u2019t let him off the hook.\u201d BaiLi XiaoYu added fuel to the fire.</p><br/><p>Looking at You XiaoMo and Baili XiaoYu\u2019s ill-intent expression, everyone felt a chill up their spine.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

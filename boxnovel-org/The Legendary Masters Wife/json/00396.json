The two both stopped.</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao walked over, paid obeisance and said, \u201cI\u2019m Xiong Xiao, us meeting was meant to be, how should I call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those who were about to leave, after hearing this, all stopped dead in their tracks and turned to look at Xiong Xiao, who had a courteous expression on, with astonishment. Xiong Xiao was ranked twenty-first on the Tong Tian Rankings, for him to initiate in small talk, that\u2019s really giving them face!</p><br/><p>The Cang Alliance was rich and powerful, there were many who would want to associate themselves with them. Like the Vermillion Blood Clan and the Beast Transfiguration Guild, even they would want to befriend the Cang Alliance.</p><br/><p>However, only very few could catch their attention. It was not that they were prideful and unwilling to befriend the other, rather, they were all a bunch of oddballs who didn\u2019t care about one\u2019s background. If they don\u2019t like someone, no matter who they had as backup, they wouldn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>Like Cheng DongQing for example, Xiong Xiao didn\u2019t like him, so he rebutted him without remorse, without giving him face. Although, it was the former who provoked first, however, even if he hadn\u2019t, Xiong Xiao still wouldn\u2019t have had a better attitude.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was also surprised and continued thoughtlessly, \u201cI\u2019m You Xiao\u2026.Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, a hand groped his waist at his ticklish stop, slightly scaring him a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right then Qiao WuShuang walked over and after hearing the name, made a weird expression. It was the first time he had heard of a name so strange, pairing it with the person, it was an odd sensation. Seeing that the two looked over, he said, \u201cI\u2019m forgetting to introduce myself, I\u2019m Qiao WuShuang.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sweated a little, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not You XiaoAh, but You XiaoHa.\u201d The reticent Ling Xiao slightly explained.</p><br/><p>t/n: Ha in laughter, like ahahaha &gt;_&gt; \u2026\u2026\u2026Poor lil Momo.</p><br/><p>With a guilty conscience, You XiaoMo agreed, \u201cYes, yes, yes, it\u2019s not Ah but Ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot matter if its Ah or Ha, it\u2019s just a name.\u201d Xiong Xiao said brightly and turned to look at Ling Xiao, \u201cHow would you like me to address you?\u201d</p><br/><p>With solemnity Ling Xiao replied, \u201cLing Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>t/n: Ling in Ling Xiao, Mo in You XiaoMo, and you got Ling Mo, which btw is a very beautiful name &gt;_&gt; at least better than someone which the onomatopoeia of laughter.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao didn\u2019t realize the weird atmosphere between them and happily made obeisance while saying, \u201cAh, I see, fellow Ling Mo, being able to meet you two means that today has not been a wasted effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally came back to his senses and said, \u201cWe are happy to be able to meet you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao calmed down a bit and his expression turned serious again. In a serious tone he said, \u201cFellow You XiaoHa, today you offended Cheng DongQing, from now on, you should be more careful. With his narrow-mindedness, he will definitely come and take revenge given the chance. If you guys decide to go to that place, then be careful of him and Hu Yin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the words \u2018You XiaoHa\u2019, You XiaoMo felt a little embarrassed. He imagined that \u2018the place\u2019 he mentioned was the place of the hidden treasure. He felt a slightly moved and replied, \u201cThank you Xiong-dage for the warning, we will be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was after a little more chit-chat that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao left.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang looked at them thoughtfully before saying, \u201cXiong-laoge, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen you be so interested in two strangers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know the reason either, I just find them pleasing, especially that You XiaoHa, I\u2019m especially fond of him.\u201d Xiong Xiao shook his head and couldn\u2019t help but laugh despite himself.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang knew that this feeling was hard to explain and didn\u2019t push any further, \u201cXiong-laoge, did you pay attention to that Ling Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao immediately stopped smiling and muttered, \u201cOf course I noticed him, however, I couldn\u2019t detect his level. If he didn\u2019t use any technique to hide his presence, then his power should be above mine. I believe it\u2019s the latter, since they dare to challenge Yu Xian City and the Mage Guild. If he was just at the Divine level, that wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuShuang said, \u201cHopefully they won\u2019t meet any strong practitioners from those two forces anytime soon. However, I did hear that a young master of the Vermillion Blood Clan was coming, is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Xiao knew he was trying to sound out the truth but didn\u2019t pay any mind, \u201cSince Qiao-Laodi already has the answer, why would you need to ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other hand, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao did not hurry back to the hotel.</p><br/><p>They wandered around June City for a while and bought a lot of souvenirs before going back.</p><br/><p>Once they were in the room, You XiaoMo took out the jade drive, it was black with a crystal glow flowing through. It did not have any restrictions so it was easy to read the information inside.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to dissolve the information and handed the jade drive to Ling Xiao first.</p><br/><p>As per usual, Ling Xiao was faster than him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said in astonishment, \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that beneath the June Mountain Range there would be such a huge natural underground palace and it could nurture a Metal Swallowing Beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although You XiaoMo was not an extensive reader, he still had heard of the Metal Swallowing Beast.</p><br/><p>It was a demon beast that could attack and defend, especially its defense was incredibly strong. However, it depended on what it had devoured, the rarer and stronger the metal, the better its defense would be. That would also increase its levels, so basically a demon beast that relied on eating rare metals.</p><br/><p>As for its attack, that also had to do with it consuming metals.</p><br/><p>The Metal Swallowing Beast had the metal element thus any physical damage would not affect it. Instead it could control the metal elements within a human. Killing without drawing blood, that was the real power of the demon beast.</p><br/><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t an Emperor beast, its attack and defense was stronger than most, thus people would call it a false Emperor beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the looks of things, everyone is here for the Metal Swallowing Beast.\u201d You XiaoMo thought of the power of the demon beast and couldn\u2019t help but be a bit tempted. However, he knew he couldn\u2019t push it, the jade drive didn\u2019t mention its power level, he didn\u2019t want to find an uncertain fight.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cAbout the Metal Swallowing Beast, there is actually a legend about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA legend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe legend says that the Metal Swallowing Beast is a god blessed special beast. If one could capture it, they would be above all living things. It is a symbol of power, riches, and status.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes glowed, \u201cIt\u2019s that amazing? Then, if everyone had a Metal Swallowing Beast, wouldn\u2019t everyone be at the top?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him with disdain, \u201cWhat do you think the Metal Swallowing Beast is, a low-levelled demon beast that you see everywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo let out a dry laugh, he was just making a joke, \u201cThen, according to you, the number of the Metal Swallowing Beasts is as low as the four great Emperor beasts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cThe four great emperor beasts are rare, but the Metal Swallowing Beast is even rarer, one of a kind. It will only breed once in a trillion years, what do think is its rarity?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallowed hard.</p><br/><p>Once in a trillion years? By then it was all too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it\u2019s not that easy to breed a Metal Swallowing Beast, so there is something that\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d Ling Xiao suddenly said in contemplation.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you once I confirm it. If it\u2019s as I expect, then we have to take of a piece of the pie this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo got antsy just hearing it, \u201cCan you tell me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked again, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him and with a smile said, \u201cBecause I know you would really like to know right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s feeling of resentment was as deep as the black hole after being tricked. Didn\u2019t he know that he was very curious? To purposefully not tell him because he wanted to know\u2026if he had known that, he would\u2019ve said he didn\u2019t want to know, although that sounded like a very dumb idea.</p><br/><p>For the next few days, they stayed at the hotel. Beneath the hotel was a bar, there was always someone talking about the ins and outs of June City. So, even without going out, they had learned a lot.</p><br/><p>Both the Vermillion Blood Clan and the Beast Transfiguration Association arrived the day before in June City. It was said that they both dispatched a Divine levelled practitioner, clearly with getting the Metal Swallowing Beast in mind.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had initially thought that Hu Yin and Cheng DongQing would come to the hotel to seek revenge, however since then there had been nothing. He almost thought that they had a change of heart.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xiao told him that it was because the departure day was coming close. Neither of the two Divine levelled practitioners would want to divert their attention so they didn\u2019t come find them immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d After a few more days You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask. It seemed like the Vermillion Blood Clan was already on the move while they still hadn\u2019t done anything.</p><br/><p>He thought that Ling Xiao would know, however he said this instead, \u201cHow would I know? Didn\u2019t the jade drive say that the entrance was randomized? If you want to go in, you need to find the entrance.\u201d He said in a very uncaring attitude.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pounced on him while making threatening gestures, choking him as he yelled, \u201cHow do you not know, aren\u2019t you supposed to be very strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao let him choke him, but one of his hands slide down to hold his bottom, and replied in a gloating way, \u201cThe reality is telling you that your man isn\u2019t invincible. He also has things he cannot do. However, I didn\u2019t think my wife here thought so highly of me. As your husband I feel very honored, and thus your husband has made a decision, let\u2019s dual cultivate!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wanted to bite him to death, this sex-driven bastard.</p><br/><p>And so, that was what he did. Without hesitation, he bit Ling Xiao\u2019s neck.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

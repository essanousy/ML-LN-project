The voice was extremely shrill and sharp, and almost half of the town heard it.</p><br/><p>In an instant, cursing voices drifted out from many inns, and a large stretch of lights lit up. But the weird thing was that by the time everyone wanted to know which inn the sound had come from, the voice had disappeared again.</p><br/><p>That night, there were a lot of people who couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><br/><p>However, there were two people who were exceptions: You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao. After they threw out a sound insulation Restriction, the female ghost\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t be heard anymore.</p><br/><p>The second day, the people of this inn were said to have the heaviest eyebags, so many people were very displeased with Xie Jun. But taking into consideration Xie Jun\u2019s strength, they didn\u2019t dare to say anything, and they could only get angry.</p><br/><p>A burn on the face and throat couldn\u2019t be compared to one on the arm. That kind of pain would be much greater than the pain from an arm. In addition, one couldn\u2019t scratch it, or it would get even worse, so it was normal that Mo Xue screamed for most of the night.</p><br/><p>In the latter half of the night, Xie Jun most likely fed her some kind of magic pill that could stop the pain. Or what You XiaoMo guessed was that Xie Jun was afraid of offending too many people, so he knocked Mo Xue out. It was a bit simpler, and this way she couldn\u2019t scream even if she wanted to.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, the lobby was very lively.</p><br/><p>Everyone was discussing the sound of the female ghost screaming last night. Even though there had been such a racket that they couldn\u2019t sleep, everyone was still very interested in this kind of gossip.</p><br/><p>Some people had seen Mo Xue\u2019s face with their own eyes, which was burned so badly it didn\u2019t look like a human or demon. They were so scared that they couldn\u2019t sleep the entire night, and as soon as they closed their eyes they would remember her face. It was quite terrifying.</p><br/><p>However, there were also people discussing what happened in Dong Yu.</p><br/><p>The information about the legendary cave dwelling couldn\u2019t have come from nothing, or else it wouldn\u2019t have attracted so many people. As of today, more and more people had rushed over to this place, including some major powers in Dong Zhou.</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone discuss it so fervently, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but quietly ask Ling Xiao, \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t know about the map, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>For this kind of rumor to spread out after they pieced together the four maps, if they just thought about it they could tell something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many clues, half are true, and half are fake.\u201d Ling Xiao cracked open a peanut.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo saw that he liked to eat peanuts, so while he opened some for him, he asked, \u201cThen which major power do you think the person in black who attacked us at Black Canyon is most likely from?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was well-trained and was also an accomplice, so he had to be part of a group.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao calmly accepted his service and said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have destroyed that corpse. You should\u2019ve seen if there were any symbols on his body before destroying it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for that. Mo Xue and the rest were watching from the side back then, so all I could think about was quickly destroying the corpse and the evidence. I didn\u2019t examine it very carefully, and at the time I didn\u2019t think about taking off his clothes.\u201d You XiaoMo felt a bit of regret.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao paused and stared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you\u2019re a man with a husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. Suddenly, the noise in the lobby quieted down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked in the direction of the stairs. It turns out that his fated people were coming down from the stairs, including Mo Xue, who had to wear a veil because part of her face was burned. She appeared extremely weak, as most of her body weight rested against Xie Jun. Her younger sister Mo Fei followed behind them with a reluctant expression on her face, and she occasionally glanced enviously at her sister.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had always felt that these two sisters were like exotic flowers. It would\u2019ve been better if they hadn\u2019t been born human in this lifetime. They couldn\u2019t be fox spirits either, because that was thinking too highly of them.</p><br/><p>He and Ling Xiao sat in the corner close to the window. For a while, Xie Jun and the rest didn\u2019t notice them, but Niu XuYang saw them immediately. However, he had no reaction. Instead, he was calm and unperturbed, as if he didn\u2019t recognize them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Niu XuYang\u2019s temperament actually isn\u2019t too bad.\u201d Ling Xiao spoke in a rare show of praise for a stranger.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had also noticed him, and he said disapprovingly, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that he likes Mo Xue. No matter how normal his worldview is, sooner or later he\u2019s going to be led astray.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t discovered it yet?\u201d Ling Xiao asked in return.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You XiaoMo froze.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cHe should\u2019ve already given up by now, or else he wouldn\u2019t have been indifferent to Mo Xue\u2019s face being disfigured. He didn\u2019t have any reaction whatsoever when he saw how close she and the one with the surname Xie are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be because Mo Xue got disfigured?\u201d You XiaoMo said in alarm. The story of a scumbag and a slut momentarily took shape inside his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>While they were speaking, Mo Xue had already noticed them. She couldn\u2019t speak, but there was no way the thin layer of the veil could block the resentful, bone-deep hostility in her eyes. She probably thought they couldn\u2019t tell, so the hatred in her gaze was undisguised.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had become aware of it in the first second. This Mo Xue was the typical example of someone who didn\u2019t learn her lesson. She was punished so brutally, yet she still dared to use that kind of expression to look at them. It seemed that years of having a superiority complex prevented her from dropping this kind of bad habit. Just last night she was more dead than alive, yet today she didn\u2019t seem to fear death at all.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo clicked his tongue. However, he learned the reason behind Mo Xue\u2019s reaction very quickly.</p><br/><p>The Guma Tribe\u2019s people had arrived. Their cultivation bases were even higher than Xie Jun\u2019s, and their whole body emitted an aura of \u2018I am an expert,\u2019 especially the woman in white who was walking at the very front. She had a noble air around her as she sent out a holy and pure aura, as if she was an immortal who had descended to the earth. She was even more beautiful than the two sisters.</p><br/><p>When she saw them, Mo Fei was the first to rush over in pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Xia\u2026\u201d Mo Fei bounded over to the woman in white with a hurt expression on her face, as if she was about to cry. \u201cYou must support me and my sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in white revealed a divine smile and said gently, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Who bullied my little sister Mo Fei and made her so sad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Fei didn\u2019t instantly point in the direction of the new immigrants and Ling Xiao. Instead, she pulled her over to Mo Xue and Xie Jun and said in a complaining tone, \u201cSister Xia, hurry and take a look at my older sister. She was disfigured by someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in white looked at Mo Xue, who was wearing a veil. She could see clearly that half of Mo Xue\u2019s face was disfigured and changed beyond recognition through the veil, and it seemed that the injury near her neck also was wasn\u2019t light. Her elegant brows crinkled slightly. It was actually this severe?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Mo Xue was very excited when she saw the woman in white appear, but she couldn\u2019t speak. She could only sit there anxiously, but luckily, her little sister immediately brought her over.</p><br/><p>The woman in white\u2019s expression was slightly overcast, and she asked in a cold voice, \u201cWhat in the world happened? How was Mo Xue disfigured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Fei finally found a way to vent, and she colorfully described all of You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao\u2019s offences. Her voice wasn\u2019t quiet, and she greatly exaggerated many things right in front of You XiaoMo\u2019s face. For example, she didn\u2019t include that it was because back then Mo Xue had spoken insolently first, nor did she include that You XiaoMo had once rescued Mo Xue. In any case, it was all You XiaoMo\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>Who knew what the woman in white was thinking, but when she heard Mo Fei speak, her beautiful face remained completely expressionless, as if she wasn\u2019t moved in the slightest. However, the two sisters didn\u2019t find this unusual at all.</p><br/><p>After Mo Fei finished pouring out the story, she looked expectantly at the woman in white. \u201cSister Xia, my big sister is so pitiful. You must back her up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Excellency Xia Yin, may I ask whether Mo Xue\u2019s face can still be cured?\u201d Niu XuYang walked respectfully over, sweeping away the detachment from his face.</p><br/><p>When Mo Xue heard this, she also looked eagerly at her.</p><br/><p>The woman in white finally reacted, and she nodded imperceptibly at him, though she said, \u201cThe flames that burned Mo Xue aren\u2019t ordinary flames. If I\u2019m not wrong, it should be from a kind of Godfire. Injuries that were created by Godfire are usually very hard to cure completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xue instantly stood up agitatedly, not even caring that she slammed into the table. She didn\u2019t want to be disfigured for her whole life.</p><br/><p>Xie Jun hastily supported her and said quietly, \u201cXue-er, don\u2019t get too excited. \u2018Very hard to cure completely\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s impossible to cure completely, there will definitely be a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in white glanced at him indifferently and said, \u201cI need to examine it first before I can determine whether it\u2019s curable. However, don\u2019t get your hopes up. Magic pills that can cure a burn from Godfire require rainbow pills that are grade five or up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Xue fell back onto her chair, and soundlessly began to cry. Even though she wasn\u2019t a mage, how could she not know how difficult it was to refine a rainbow pill that was above grade five? Moreover, even if they wanted to refine pills, they still needed a pill recipe.</p><br/><p>Mo Xue stroked her own face. When she thought about how she would have to carry this demonic appearance forever, the hostility that she had towards You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao took shape into a soaring resentment. She would definitely make them suffer a painful death!</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Xia, those two people are the ones who made big sister become this tragic.\u201d Mo Fei instantly pointed at You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao in the corner, a pleased expression on her face. After oppressing it for so long, they could finally get revenge.</p><br/><p>They would let them know that Sister Xia was the strongest one in the Guma Tribe, besides their own father.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s back was facing them, and he asked Ling Xiao curiously, \u201cCan you really cure a burn from Godfire?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought that it wasn\u2019t possible, or else Xing Qi wouldn\u2019t have carried around a broken arm back then. However, it was also possible that there just hadn\u2019t been enough time.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao picked up his cup of tea and took a sip before saying blandly, \u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe difference is that that\u2019s my Godfire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a lot of confidence, hm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smirked and shot him a glance. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cI like it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Self-absorbed public displays of affection were truly very disgusting!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

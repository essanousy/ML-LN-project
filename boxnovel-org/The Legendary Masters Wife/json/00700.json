The roads had expanded and the town was twice its original size with people hustling and bustling around. It was an incredibly boisterous place.</p><br/><p>The old inn owned by Wang had now become a large hotel. There was a lot of customers everyday and it has expanded to become the largest hotel in town.</p><br/><p>At the time, on the second floor, of the hotel\u2019s largest luxury suite, You XiaoMo stared at the ones in front of him. It wasn\u2019t just one or two, it was a whole group. Finally, he couldn\u2019t stand it and asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say only the Demon Phoenix Clan was meeting us? Why is the True Dragon Clan and the Black Turtle Clan here as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could understand why the Black Turtle Clan was here because he already seen the baby turtle in Xuan Zong\u2019s arms, but not in its human-form, rather in its turtle form.</p><br/><p>Once it saw him, the baby turtle started to struggle within Xuan Zong\u2019s grasp, wanting to climb onto You XiaoMo. However, there was no way Xuan Zong was letting go of his great grandson and he didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point looking at me.\u201d Ling Xiao said heartlessly, they were together all the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow You, other things can be left after the issue about the contract is solved. You already know our purpose of coming here. To tell you truthfully, NingYu is our choice for the heir, he matches all our criteria and so if nothing goes wrong then he would definitely succeed.\u201d Ji NingYu said right off the bat.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo roughly knew what he meant. The Demon Phoenix Clan head couldn\u2019t be in a contract with a human so little chick had to break off his contract with him. Otherwise, the position of head was just fictitious, no matter how perfect he was, they wouldn\u2019t let him succeed.</p><br/><p>When they first heard of Ji NingYu\u2019s contract with a human, he should have been striped of his right to succession, however, he was luckily only in a normal contract with You XiaoMo. A lifebound contract was unbreakable, unless one of them died.</p><br/><p>But, the Demon Phoenix Clan were all a bunch of self-conflicting people. They initially thought that with Ji NingYu\u2019s status, his contract with a human must be a lifebound one, so they were all really pissed. However, once they found out that it was a normal one, they got even angrier. To think a Demon Phoenix Clan member would make a normal contract with a human, it was just shameful. It caused a scene for a while before they finally all decided to have him break off the contract.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to break off the contract. So what if I don\u2019t become the head, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Little chick\u2019s rebellious words suddenly rose.</p><br/><p>The moment he finished, he was slapped in the butt by Ji Weng. \u201cYou little bastard, didn\u2019t I tell you to not say that anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the heir to the Demon Phoenix Clan, you hold the future of the Demon Phoenix Clan on your back. You\u2019re not at an age where you can be selfish anymore, do you understand?\u201d Ji Weng scolded with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>The little chick pursed his lips together and said nothing. You XiaoMo looked at the little chick, who was still a fat baby. If he remembered correctly, it wasn\u2019t even seven years since his birth.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow You, as long as you\u2019re willing to break off your contract with NingYu, then any condition, as long as it\u2019s in our power, we will agree to.\u201d Ignoring the protesting Ji NingYu, Ji Weng said directly to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at Ling Xiao before rubbing his nose and saying, \u201cOkay, I agree to break off the contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, everyone was dumbfounded. Especially the Demon Phoenix Clan, they were all mentally prepared for a harsh and grueling fight but to think it was that straightforward. It was so straightforward that they didn\u2019t even have a reaction.</p><br/><p>The little chick\u2019s eyes suddenly became teary as he stared at You XiaoMo without blinking.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled at him.</p><br/><p>The little chick paused for a second before his eyes rolled mischievously. After that, he cried and said, \u201cMaster, do you not want me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo explained with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you, we\u2019re just breaking off the contract. You can still visit me or I\u2019ll visit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The little chick said, looking as if he was about to cry.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded, \u201cReally, but I don\u2019t know if the Demon Phoenix Clan will welcome me.\u201d After he said that, as if accidentally, he glanced over at Ji Weng.</p><br/><p>Instantly the little chick turned towards Ji Weng.</p><br/><p>With a cough, Ji Weng said, \u201cOf course we welcome you. The fact that you\u2019re willing to break off the contract with Ji NingYu means that we owe you one. The Demon Phoenix Clan happily welcomes you to visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, a fight that everyone of the Demon Phoenix Clan thought would be tough was over. In a few words and without any bloodshed, the two sides even had a friendly handshake to seal the deal.</p><br/><p>On the side, Xuan Zong who had been watching this whole time finally felt a sigh of relief as the situation was resolved so easily. Before he came, he was also worried that You XiaoMo wouldn\u2019t break off the contract or make some preposterous conditions. It\u2019s not that the Black Turtle Clan couldn\u2019t afford it, but it\u2019ll leave a sour aftertaste behind. Seeing that he was so easy to talk to, he was finally relieved.</p><br/><p>The baby turtle really liked You XiaoMo. Once Xuan Zong carried him over, he, very strongly this time, broke free and climbed onto You XiaoMo with his four claws. Then he sat butt first into his lap.</p><br/><p>Xuan Zong couldn\u2019t help but feeling sour about the whole thing. The time they spent as great grandparent and child wasn\u2019t even comparable to a few month with You XiaoMo. He didn\u2019t know that his great grandson had the potential as a traitor.</p><br/><p>(: someone who lives off one person while secretly helping out another )</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was actually surprised too, as he didn\u2019t know that the baby turtle had made a one sided contract with him. If the Baby turtle said it, he maybe would\u2019ve never known.</p><br/><p>The baby turtle was different from the little chick.The little chick had been with him since it was an egg, so they had a foundation for their relationship even before birth. On the other hand, his relation with the baby turtle could only be described as a chance meeting. Now, with no reason whatsoever, even if it wasn\u2019t inducted by him, he had the power to enslave the baby turtle, so of course the Black Turtle Clan would \u2018remember\u2019 him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t want the baby turtle to suffer a loss either and it\u2019s not like you need a contract to be friends so this contract must be removed. Not only that, if he appeared generous, the Black Turtle Clan would definitely remember this favor. So there was only benefit and no losses.</p><br/><p>The situation on the Black Spider had been on You XiaoMo\u2019s mind for a while now, but since Lin ShaoYi obtained the Qilin Clan, he had gotten more powerful subordinates under his belt. TianGou\u2019s strength alone wouldn\u2019t be enough, so he had his eyes set on the other three clans for a while.</p><br/><p>Once the situation about the contracts was over, the True Dragon Clan explained their reasoning for coming. Without much surprise, they were here for the Black Spider and Lin ShaoYi. If they didn\u2019t deal with it now, no forces in Xi Jing would feel safe, especially the three clans. Lin ShaoYi was a huge threat to them.</p><br/><p>In the past few months, the three clans had fought a few more times with the Black Spider, but now, they were no longer getting the upper hand. When the True Dragon Clan calculated the wounded, the numbers became something almost intolerable for them, thus they had to think of a method to stop this once and for all, so they came.</p><br/><p>Long Yue was part of the True Dragon Clan who came as he knew You XiaoMo from before. Neither Ji Weng nor Xuan Zong left as breaking off the contract was just a part of it, the main focus was still on Lin ShaoYi and the Black Spider. Their existence heavily threatened theirs, if they leave them be, and Lin ShaoYi\u2019s plan is a success, then no one will get out free.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not the place to talk, we\u2019ll go to another place.\u201d Ling Xiao opened his mouth to say. Although the White Bone Town was their place, it wasn\u2019t completely safe.</p><br/><p>No one disagreed. They had long heard of their luxurious palace. Supposedly it was from the ancient times and made a shock even then, their White Tiger palace. They had wanted to see it for themselves since long ago, but if they knew of Ling Xiao\u2019s aim then, they would probably be pretty speechless.</p><br/><p>Right now, there was two freeters in TianGou. It was Lin Gu and Lin Ming, and as for who knew Lin ShaoYi and the Qilin Clan the best, it had to be Lin Ming.</p><br/><p>Thus, they arrived at the palace and Lin Xiao threw the burden of finding a solution to defeat the Black Spider plus Lin ShaoYi to Lin Ming and the three clans. He himself went to secluded cultivation, to further his investigation on combing his bloodlines. As for You XiaoMo, afraid that something would go wrong, went with him.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Ming was mad that he threw him such a huge burden, there was nothing he could do now, now that the other three clans were present.</p><br/><p>As for Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo, to advance their levels, they went straight to the secret room with the five blessing spirit eye. Ever since the Rainbow Spirit Eye was taken from the Five Blessing Spirit Eye by You XiaoMo, the five colored liquid stopped increasing. It became less by every drop they used and people started to say that it felt different from before as well.</p><br/><p>The main difference between the five colored liquid and spiritual water was its power to dredge. For example, if someone who has been stuck in a level for a really long time cultivated near a Five Blessing Spirit Eye, then their advancement would come naturally. If the practitioner had narrow circulation passages, then he could also expand it using the five colored spiritual energy released from the five colored liquid. What everyone said felt different was it\u2019s ability dredge. Although it could still help, it was not as effective. Like before, a year it could dredge half a centimeter, but now, it wasn\u2019t even a third. But good thing was that it still worked, otherwise the Five Blessing Spirit Eye was good as useless.</p><br/><p>Once the two went into the secret room, they didn\u2019t come out even after the others had finished their meeting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

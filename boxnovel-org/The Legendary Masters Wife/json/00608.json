Like Jiang Liu for example, his grudge was so strong from his previous life, (wanting to kill You XiaoMo even as he was about to die) that even after death, it was deeply imprinted into his mind. Even after he became a Water Demon, the first thing he wanted to do was to kill You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Thus, when it heard their conversation, the Water Demon was furious.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t afraid of him, after all, when they met Jiang Liu in Xing Luo City, he was still high grade level nine. Even now he was just a lower grade level ten so during their time apart, it didn\u2019t change much.</p><br/><p>Since Jiang Liu became a Water Demon, his strength did improve, probably because he became an evil spirit of a sorts, but it was still not enough to be You XiaoMo\u2019s opponent.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t even five minutes before the Water Demon was below You XiaoMo\u2019s feet with it\u2019s limbs severed. A thick, blue-greenish liquid poured out from it\u2019s wounds, seeping into the earth.</p><br/><p>The main weapon of a Water Demon was it\u2019s infectious properties. Air borne infections only affected normal people, for experts like them, they would only be affected by scratch wounds. Thus, when fighting a Water Demon, unless one had the strength to annihilate it immediately, most would sever it\u2019s limbs first, to protect themselves from being scratched.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had never fought with a Water Demon before, it was the young man\u2019s suggestion. The contained Water Demon made a sharp piercing scream, like the sound of scratching metal, it pierced through the ear drums. It was full of anger and dissatisfaction, but without it\u2019s limbs, it was just like a leopard without it\u2019s claws.</p><br/><p>Even if You XiaoMo didn\u2019t kill it then, just by letting it out to dry by the lake, in a few weeks, it would die.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sighed with emotion, \u201cSeeing that we used to be students of the same Academy, I\u2019ll call you Jiang-shidi for the last time as I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to be a monster like the Water Demon. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll release you from your pain now. Just a thing, if reincarnation exists, let\u2019s hope to never meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuagh!!\u201d The Water Demon let out an angry roar. It wasn\u2019t able to talk, so it could only use sounds to express his fury, but it seemed that it\u2019s enemy never understood it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his hands and smashed his fist into its head. Just like that, in a unwillingness, it\u2019s life was ended by his enemy. While the \u2018executioner\u2019 was still feeling touched at his good deed.</p><br/><p>On the side, the young man watched as the whole scene unfold. Uncontrollably, his mouth started twitching. If he guessed correctly, there should be some sort of a grudge between the two.</p><br/><p>He was somewhat knowledgeable on Water Demons. If there wasn\u2019t enmity from it\u2019s previous life, it wouldn\u2019t have looked at You XiaoMo with such resenting eyes. Since, this kind of hatred was strong enough to be remembered even as a Water Demon, that could only mean, in their previous life, it was an extreme hatred.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how he saw it, he felt that You XiaoMo was unaware of Jiang Liu\u2019s hatred for him. By the looks of things, it could very well be a one-sided hatred on Jiang Liu\u2019s part.</p><br/><p>What could be sadder. If Jiang Liu knew in the underworld, he would definitely turn over in his grave. His hated person not only killed him, and even thought that he was doing a good deed. Just to rub salt into his wounds, You XiaoMo even thought that Jiang Liu should be grateful for his kind act.</p><br/><p>The young man thought for a bit before deciding not to tell the truth to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Once they got rid of the Water Demon, the other side was also coming to a conclusion. All of the Level Eleven Water Demons had been killed, leaving only the Level Twelve one, but even it won\u2019t last long as Ling Xiao\u2019s occasional flames made it\u2019s body patchy, like the moon\u2019s surface.</p><br/><p>Once it realized that it wasn\u2019t going to win, the Level Twelve Water Demon suddenly tilted his head up and roared. If it wasn\u2019t going to be able to escape, then we should all die together.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, it\u2019s about to self-destruct.\u201d The expert from the Mage Association let out a cry of shock and quickly backed off to retreat. Everyone else who heard his words, also made a beeline to the outside without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Of course the Water Demon wasn\u2019t going to let them go, as it jumped up to chase. But, it was then when two lines of purple-red flame suddenly surrounded it from the front and the back. Not only did it stop the Water Demon, it also blocked off the escape route.</p><br/><p>The Water Demon tried escaping to the left but the flames connected itself into a circle. It tried escaping up, but Ling Xiao was there waiting for it. If it dared to come out, one punch would smash it\u2019s head open.</p><br/><p>The Water Demon let out a cry of grief and resentment. It\u2019s patience finally ran out and without anymore considerations, it wanted to self-destruct. Even if it\u2019s couldn\u2019t kill the man, it would at least gravely injure him. The self-destruction of a Level Twelve Water Demon definitely had the power to abolish half a spirit mountain.</p><br/><p>As the misama started to stir, the Water Demon\u2019s body swell up like a balloon. At the same time, the flames that surrounded it, suddenly leaped towards it under the control of Ling Xiao. It didn\u2019t take long before it was wrapped in a fireball.</p><br/><p>The self-destruction of a Level Twelve Water Demon was extraordinary, if not dealt with properly, it might come back to bite him. Ling Xiao\u2019s expression was serious. After he used the flames to wrap it up, when no one was looking, he added a sliver of The Breath of the True Dragon.</p><br/><p>Although the True Dragon Clan didn\u2019t have an incredible flame like the Qilin Clan nor the Demon Phoenix Clan, they were able to unleash the Dragon\u2019s Breath. The Dragon\u2019s Breath of a True Dragon was the strongest, with a heat that was on par with a Godfire. The Water Demons were half demon beasts that were turned into one, so no matter how strong their defenses were, it wouldn\u2019t be able to take the ultimate move of three Emperor Beasts.</p><br/><p>With the the Breath of the True Dragon, instantly the screams of terror could be heard from within the fireball. That sense of danger also seemed to have slowly died down and in a few minutes, completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>As the flames died away, there wasn\u2019t a trace of the Water Demon left. Even the liquid of it\u2019s melt body evaporated, truly it was gone without a trace.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ran over to Ling Xiao and asked quietly, concerned, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shook his head. This degree of usage wasn\u2019t enough to make his wounds worse, otherwise he would have wasted all those months of recuperation. Also, he already knew when he left the island that he was going to have to use his powers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Water Demons in the cold lake all died. If you want any magic herbs by the lake, you can get them now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that his face wasn\u2019t pale or sickly, You XiaoMo felt his heart calm down. Then, he proceeded to call upon the young man to follow and dig up magic herbs together. He didn\u2019t need much since he wasn\u2019t in need of the ones grown here. Like the Phoenix Rebirth Pill, he could replace herbs with the Samsara Pill and other rainbow pills like it.</p><br/><p>The young man represented the True Dragon Clan\u2019s and knowing that it would take them a lot of effort digging up magic herbs, since non-mages needed to pull out the roots with the soil, You XiaoMo lent a hand.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long before the others came running back.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the Water Demon was taken care of by Ling Xiao, other than the Qilin Clan, the two old men from the Mage Association and the True Dragon Clan both turned a little awkward. Now they didn\u2019t have the face to take the major share, thus they decided to give You XiaoMo half.</p><br/><p>The Qilin Clan wanted to say something about it, but seeing that they had already decided, he couldn\u2019t say anymore. Since if it wasn\u2019t for Ling Xiao, they wouldn\u2019t have gotten a single magic herb.</p><br/><p>At first, You XiaoMo was only going to take two-three stalks of each, but after hearing their decision, he gladly agreed. But, just when he dug up the last stalk, the earth started to shake. You XiaoMo fell butt first onto the black soil.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked over to pull him up and said, \u201cThe barrier around the mansion has been broken. Do you want to go check it out?\u201d They weren\u2019t familiar with the Peach Blossom Ruins but the Immortal\u2019s Cave here tended to have a lot of treasures.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very likely to be the Black Spiders.\u201d The young man ran over and quickly explained that the Vermillion Blood Clan and the Black Spider had deserted the battle.</p><br/><p>By the looks of things, they were concerned with the sixth mansion. There was a bit of a distance from here to the sixth mansion so with the Water Demon distracting them, no one realized that the Black Spiders were attacking the sixth mansion\u2019s barrier.</p><br/><p>Realizing what they had done, both the Mage Association and the True Dragon Clan\u2019s faces turned sour. Finally they decided to go check it out, if it was the Black Spider\u2019s, then they couldn\u2019t let them take the treasures.</p><br/><p>Once they hurried over, the barrier to the sixth mansion unmistakably disappeared. No matter how strong it was, after tens of millions of years, it was going to break under the combined strength of experts.</p><br/><p>Not even caring to talk, everyone rushed inside.</p><br/><p>The Black Spider\u2019s were caught by surprise that they took care of the Water Demons so quickly and were caught red-handed in the mansion. Remembering the danger the Black Spiders put them through, all three forces had a sour look on their face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell fellow practitioners, you actually took care of the Water Demons, congratulations!\u201d One expert of the Black Spider let out a eerie laugh. They didn\u2019t know if it was a truthful congratulations or a fake one but he didn\u2019t seem at all nervous.</p><br/><p>An expert of the Mage Association let out a cold laugh.</p><br/><p>It was then the young man walked out and looked maliciously at the Black Spider expert. Then he turned towards the True Dragon Clan and said, \u201cElder, I was almost hurt by the Water Demon before because someone had set a trap for me. I suspect that it was by the Black Spiders, they want us to all die under the hands of the Water Demons.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression on the True Dragon Clan\u2019s expert changed.</p><br/><p>Just at that moment, the Black Spider suddenly all moved, turning into streaks of shadows, headed towards different directions. Even that expert tried to flee. He was also the fastest, but just as he was about to exit, a pressure along with an attack came from above and smashed him silly. With a loud thud, he was smashed up against the door.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

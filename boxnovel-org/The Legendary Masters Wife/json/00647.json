Ji Feng was his greatest helper. His clansmen wouldn\u2019t be suspicious even if Ji Feng was sent out.</p><br/><p>After he finished reading, Ling Xiao handed the jade drive over to the anxious You XiaoMo, who was barely holding himself back from snatching the Jade Drive.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced at the silent Ling Xiao beside him after looking over the contents of the jade drive. From XiaoJi\u2019s description, Ling Xiao\u2019s mother\u2019s attitude seemed rather off, different from what he expected.</p><br/><p>XiaoJi had brought up Ling Xiao in their conversation, but she didn\u2019t have any reaction, not even asking after Ling Xiao at all. Was she happy but pretending to be calm and composed, or\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t understand. Ling Xiao had told him in the past that his father and mother were together despite their clans\u2019 objections out of love for one another. If they could do that, then they should be deeply in love with one another, and a child of their own flesh and blood wouldn\u2019t go unloved either. However, now it didn\u2019t seem that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps someone already told her about how you\u2019re doing?\u201d You XiaoMo stared at Ling Xiao, terrified that he would be upset. He knew what it felt like to have parents that didn\u2019t care. It wasn\u2019t good at all.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s expression was blank. Hearing his words, the hint of a smile appeared on Ling Xiao\u2019s face, \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing him smile just made You XiaoMo even more worried.</p><br/><p>Though his parents didn\u2019t care much for him either, he at least had them at his side from when he was young and would occasionally get a few words of parental love. However, Ling Xiao had been apart from his parents for many years. He had once said that he wanted to save them. It was clear that he missed them dearly.</p><br/><p>To know now that his mother didn\u2019t seem to like him much, if it was him, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be feeling very happy.</p><br/><p>Just as he was thinking about that, Ling Xiao stood and went outside.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurried after him, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo find Uncle Gu,\u201d Ling Xiao replied without looking back at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s heart thumped. As expected, he couldn\u2019t just let this go and had to question Uncle Gu. It was Uncle Gu that had told him of his parents in the first place.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu hadn\u2019t been a at Weeping Ghost Shores recently. As the bossman, he often played hooky, but only TianDao knew that each time he left, he was out to gather intel on the Qilin clan. However, he had come back these few days, and was currently at Weeping Ghost Shores.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu had gotten wind of their visit beforehand, so he had them come and find him in the tea room. Speaking of the tea room, rumor had it that Lin Gu was also a tea lover. When You XiaoMo heard of this, he suspected that Ling Xiao had gotten his love of tea from Lin Gu.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu\u2019s tea room was decorated with elegant simplicity, not gaudy or flashy, but the furniture and equipment were made of high-quality wood. They could smell the fragrance of the tea as soon as they stepped inside, and a lighter aroma of trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve arrived at just the right time. These are the top-quality tea leaves I just brought back.\u201d Lin Gu stood beside the tea table preparing the tea leaves and greeted them, motioning for them to make themselves comfortable upon seeing them.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t speak, like usual.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, worried about Ling Xiao, also stayed silent unlike usual, and thus drawing Lin Gu\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re so quiet today? Did you guys get into a fight?\u201d Seeing You XiaoMo carefully sneak glances at Ling Xiao, Lin Gu couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><br/><p>These two had been together for all these years, and their relationship had never been strained before. For them, fighting was something new to their dynamic, because one of them had a rather hard personality, while the other was much more softer, so they were often able to complement one another.</p><br/><p>Just as he finished speaking, You XiaoMo looked over at him with sympathy in his gaze.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu paused, trying to process this and figure out what was going on.</p><br/><p>That was when Ling Xiao took a seat in front of him and got straight to the point. \u201cUncle Gu, I came over because I have something I want to ask you. Please answer me honestly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this uncharacteristic solemnity, Lin Gu stopped with the teasing and raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then\u2026 Back then, what really happened between them? You didn\u2019t tell me the truth before, did you?\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t beat around the bush at all, his expression calm and words so blunt that Lin Gu froze in shock.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu\u2019s hands stopped, and he placed the teapot on the table, looking up at Ling Xiao. Though the word didn\u2019t name anyone specific, he knew what Ling Xiao was talking about. He hesitated for a moment and asked, \u201cDid someone say something to make you think that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have people in the Demon Phoenix Clan, and they\u2019ve engaged her, telling her of me, but her reactions didn\u2019t match up with what you told me. She doesn\u2019t seem to like her son much. Uncle Gu, you know why that is, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze was sharp, gaze baring into Lin Gu.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sat to the side with his head cocked, looking at him with confusion.</p><br/><p>Seeing his certainty. Lin Gu realized that he wouldn\u2019t be able to trick the other and could only say, \u201cSome things happened between your parents back then, but I can\u2019t tell you now. You can ask your father when he comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same if you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gu shook his head. \u201cXiao\u2019er, I have my reasons, but I can say this. Your mother\u2026 she does have something against your father, but she wants to be free. Once you\u2019re stronger, I still hope you can free her from the Demon Phoenix Clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stared at him for a moment. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao understood what Lin Gu was like. If he wasn\u2019t willing to say something, then no matter how much you bugged him, you would get anything out of him.</p><br/><p>Lin Gu didn\u2019t seem relieved by this. He was no longer in the mood for tea.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao calmly took the teapot and made a few cups of tea, giving one to You XiaoMo, who was looking at him with wide eyes. He only left with You XiaoMo after finishing their tea, not at all feeling as if he had ruined Lin Gu\u2019s mood.</p><br/><p>Once they got back to the palace, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and asked, \u201cAre you really alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him with a slight smile and continued walking inside as he replied, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d He even seemed rather satisfied for some reason.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt like he didn\u2019t have enough brain power to process this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d You XiaoMo ran over and grabbed his arm. His mood sure swung quick, making You XiaoMo feel like he had been hallucinating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what do I mean?\u201d Ling Xiao turned, looking at him rather helplessly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that he was feigning ignorance and said, \u201cI feel like your attitude is weird. Do you really want to know about your parents or not? How come it seems like you don\u2019t care now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shrugged, spreading his hands out to the side in a \u2018what can I do\u2019 gesture. \u201cIf Uncle Gu doesn\u2019t want to say, then what\u2019s the use in me worrying over it? Or do you expect me to throw a temper tantrum and cry until he\u2019s willing to tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201d He just thought Ling Xiao to be behaving a little strangely, but he wasn\u2019t really sure how to explain it with words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll leave this like that for now. Like Uncle Gu said, after I get my dad out, then I\u2019ll be able to find out what happened. I\u2019ve waited so many years already, what\u2019s a little while more?\u201d Ling Xiao cut him off, walking over and wrapping an arm around his shoulders so that they could head inside together.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo still found this a little odd.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t give him any chance to continue worrying. Was there a need for further consideration? Not to him there wasn\u2019t. It was as it was.</p><br/><p>Thus, he successfully distracted You XiaoMo from the topic.</p><br/><p>This was the tragedy of having a low IQ!</p><br/><p>In the Demon Phoenix Clan, XiaoJi went and talked some more with Ji SuXin after receiving word back from the Boss, however, he made no progress. Ji SuXin remained as she was before, not seeming to desire freedom at all.</p><br/><p>However, using Ji Feng, XiaoJi figured out what kind of position Ji SuXin had in the Demon Phoenix Clan. After she got with Ling Xiao\u2019s father, the Demon Phoenix Clan basically gave up on her. Only her father, Ji WuFeng, was still trying to persuade her, refusing to give up.</p><br/><p>Ji WuFeng was an ambitious man. His goal was the position of valley leader, but it was impossible for him to reach it himself, so he treated Ji SuXin as his only hope. Back then, if Ji SuXin hadn\u2019t gotten involved with Ling Xiao\u2019s father, then she could definitely take the place of valley leader, but this dream shattered without mercy.</p><br/><p>Thus, he hated Ling Xiao and his father. If he knew that XiaoJi was one of Ling Xiao\u2019s, then he would certainly become XiaoJi\u2019s biggest obstacle. Though Ji WuFeng had laid low for all these years, he had many loyal and powerful followers on his side.</p><br/><p>In response to this, Ling Xiao\u2019s reply was very simple; he told XiaoJi to become valley leader as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Once he became valley leader, then Ji SuXin\u2019s freedom could be gained with just a single order from him. Plus, it wasn\u2019t as if the Demon Phoenix Clan cared about her.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xiao still had XiaoJi ask if Ji SuXin wanted to be free or not.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that this was almost like harassment, and he doubted Ling Xiao was really trying to win the affections of this mother of his. It was more like it was an obligatory duty to him.</p><br/><p>Thus, the whole thing with Ling Xiao\u2019s mother was resolved just like that. Then they set their sights on the Qilin Clan. It was still his mysterious father that was the key, in the end.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

A map of the port was attached for fear that they did not know where the port was.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took one look at it before rolling the note into a ball and putting it into his clothes. He then turned to Ling Xiao, \u201cThe note said that just the two of us should meet them at a tiny port in the evening. Should we wait for that Hai Chu person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ling Xiao rejected it without even a second thought. A hint of a strange smile flashed through his eyes, \u201cSince the person who left the note asked only the both of us to go, then let\u2019s just do as \u2018he\u2019 wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that his expression was Ling Xiao\u2019s signature move before he committed a misdeed.</p><br/><p>However, he could only head for the small port together with him when evening approached, carrying a bellyful of doubts as he could not guess what Ling Xiao was thinking.</p><br/><p>The location of the tiny port was slightly remote. There were fewer and fewer people as they walked along the road until they could not even see a single person. The so-called tiny port was actually an abandoned port. Since the development of Whale Island, the tiny port had been abandoned for a long time because it was facing the wrong way and it could not meet the requirements of the fishermen.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could see two figures standing at the small harbor from far away.</p><br/><p>The people who asked to meet them seemed to be an old and a young man. Both were wearing cyan robes and their hair was tied up and adorned with a green hair pin.</p><br/><p>Though he had never seen the people from the Black Turtle Clan before, the image they presented did seem like those from the Black Turtle Clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is surnamed Xuan, and named Sheng. Are you two the ones who wish to find someone from my Black Turtle Clan?\u201d Hearing footsteps, the old man in the green robe turned to reveal a benevolent and aged face. With a grizzled beard akin to a goat and a bountiful smile, he did not provoke one\u2019s dislike.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave them a once over upon hearing the old man claim to be from the Psychic Black Turtle Clan. It was true that they were from the Black Turtle Clan based on their auras. He then looked up at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao did not express anything and there was constantly a smile that was yet not a smile on his face, \u201cCorrect, that\u2019s us.\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of dark joy was revealed in Xuan Sheng\u2019s eyes, \u201cThis old man heard from Old Long that it was Mo Jing from the Mystic Tortoise Clan who asked you to come. He said that there was something you had to convey to us. May I know what the matter is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he had something important to tell you, but he was ambushed in the middle of his journey and was seriously injured. So he was unable to come in person and wanted to look for people from the Black Turtle Clan to pick him up.\u201d Ling Xiao indifferently stated.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him in surprise.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he say to pass the baby turtle to them? Why was his excuse the same as the one he used before? Don\u2019t tell me that.. Ling Xiao was really going listen to his words and leave the baby turtle to him?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face was like \u2018\u2019 as he thought about it, but it was true that Ling Xiao could do this kind of thing.</p><br/><p>Yet, Xuan Sheng did not seem too satisfied with this answer. His two white eyebrows furrowed and quickly smoothed out again. Xuan Sheng spoke after several seconds of deliberation, \u201cSir, are you certain that Mo Jing only asked you to convey this message? Did he pass anything to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at the old man in the green daopao with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, shouldn\u2019t this person first ask about Mo Jing\u2019s whereabouts? Although Mo Jing was from the Mystic Tortoise Clan, they were both from Tortoise Clans. When their clan members were in trouble, would the people from the Black Turtle Clan not even ask a question of concern?</p><br/><p>He thought that he might know why Ling Xiao did not tell them about the baby turtle.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s expression suddenly chilled, \u201cWhat does Your Excellency mean by saying this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a misunderstanding, Sir. This old man did not mean that. Since there\u2019s nothing, then it was this old man who had wrongly assumed.\u201d Xuan Sheng knew that he had misunderstood upon hearing that and hurriedly clarified.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, why are you speaking so much rubbish with them? They should count their fortunes for them to be able to see us in their lifetime. There is no need to speak so politely to them.\u201d The young man beside Xuan Sheng was immediately displeased as he declared.</p><br/><p>In his view, for these two to be able to see them who were from the Black Turtle Clan was the glory of the human race.</p><br/><p>A peculiar glint flashed through Xuan Sheng\u2019s eyes and he seemed to be swayed by the young man\u2019s words. However, it was only for a moment. Then his tone chilled as he warned, \u201cAh Ze, have you forgotten the rules of our Black Turtle Clan? How can you say such words to the benefactor who helped us?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Though Xuan Ze did not utter a single word, his expression showed even more disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is said that those from the Black Turtle Clan treat people modestly. Apparently this is not so.\u201d You XiaoMo compared this man named Ah Ze with the representative of the Black Turtle Clan he met in the Amaranthine Mountains. Both were of completely different grades.</p><br/><p>Although Xuan Ming was like a slow doctor, he had a hidden shrewdness and was definitely not a person who would look down on others. No wonder one could be a representative of the Black Turtle Clan whilst the other was obscure and unknown. It seemed that their characters were poles apart even if they were from the same clan.T/n:  = infantile convulsion met a slow doctor, it means that one is so sluggish, even urgent matter can\u2019t rush them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man named Mo Jing is healing in the ChuYun Mountain Range.\u201d You XiaoMo simply gave them the answer before he pulled Ling Xiao and prepared to leave. To ask him to give the baby turtle to this kind of people, sorry, it was not possible. Maybe he ought to think about the possibility of taking the baby turtle as his own.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Xuan Sheng hurriedly called out to them. Not only did he do that, he also ran to them and blocked their path.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frowned. He was becoming more and more disgusted with this old man and unhappily retorted, \u201cWe\u2019ve already told you his location. What else do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Sheng stroked his grizzled beard and put on an insincere smile, \u201cThis old man just wanted to ask, is Sir certain that Mo Jing is at the ChuYun Mountain Range?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not surprising that he was suspicious because the ChuYun Mountain Range was where You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had met Mo Jing, who was being hunted down by Xing Qi and his companions. It was also the place where Mo Jing had nearly been killed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could not refrain from narrowing his eyes upon hearing what he said. Sure enough, there was a problem with this old man. How could a person who was unfamiliar with the situation casually question others\u2019 words and look so unconvinced unless he already knew that Mo Jing had met with danger in the ChuYun Mountain Range?</p><br/><p>It was impossible for Mo Jing to remain at such a dangerous place like the ChuYun Mountain Range even if he was seriously injured. Who knew whether Xing Qi and the rest would come looking for him again? Staying there was just like courting death.</p><br/><p>Xuan Sheng obviously knew this too, but his words made You XiaoMo suspect that maybe Xing Qi and them were in cahoots.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have constantly been questioning our words. It seems that you know what happened better than us.\u201d Ling Xiao raised any eyebrow and a piercing glint suddenly flashed through his black eyes as his tone contained an unquestionable affirmation.</p><br/><p>Even though Xuan Sheng\u2019s expression was obscure, he did not immediately refute Ling Xiao\u2019s words. This hesitation confirmed the truth of Ling Xiao\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, we should not hide it anymore since they\u2019ve seen through us.\u201d Xuan Ze had long wanted to shed all pretense of cordiality. The Black Turtle Clan really did treat people modestly as per the rumors from the outside world, but this did not include them. What he detested the most were humans and those inferior demon beasts.</p><br/><p>Since matters had reached this stage, Xuan Sheng also knew that the two would not believe him even if whether he explained again. Thus, he simply tore off his hypocritical smile. The benevolent expression was instantaneously replaced by arrogance and contempt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, we definitely know what happened to Mo Jing. You might have deceived us if we didn\u2019t. But you seem to have long recognized us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words were riddled with inconsistencies. It\u2019ll be difficult even if we wanted to be ignorant.\u201d You XiaoMo said in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou -\u201d Xuan Sheng\u2019s expression became ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou what you, did I say it wrongly? If you want to pretend, you also have to be on point. I really suspect that your IQ is lower than mine for you to have been seen through so easily.\u201d When You XiaoMo said this word \u2018IQ\u2019, he was particularly bold and confident. He, this old fellow, had been imperceptibly influenced by Ling Xiao and he was now admitting that his IQ was low.</p><br/><p>To help him save a little of his face, Ling Xiao refuted, \u201cYou are wrong. Theirs is in the negative three digits. Your\u2019s is negative two digits. There is no comparison between them.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was taken aback and he subconsciously replied, \u201cYou are right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then his expression cracked, pei pei pei! Who is in negative double digits! He was not in the double digits, he was clearly a single digit! t/n: pei means to spit (in contempt).</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you said enough? You\u2019d better tell us the truth about Mo Jing\u2019s situation, or I\u2019ll completely destroy you.\u201d Xuan Ze\u2019s aura was full of evil tendencies and a tinge of bloodthirsty killing intent was hovering between his eyebrows. His eyes were reddish and there were obvious signs that he was falling into the devil\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared blankly when he saw that appearance. This was his first time seeing a devil-path cultivator.</p><br/><p>The so-called devil-path cultivator was one who was unable to guard their mind when they advanced and was taken advantage of by heart devils. These kind of people generally had two endings. One was for their body to die and their cultivation to vanish.</p><br/><p>The other was to successfully advance, but they would be hounded by heart devils from then on. The person would become like they had been plagued by a devil and their temper would become more and more volatile. When they got angry, their eyes would become red and then their whole mind would be preoccupied with killing people. When his eyes become completely red, it signaled that he had completely become a devil.</p><br/><p>Under these circumstances, it would be very dangerous for the practitioner when they advanced again. It seemed that the resentment of this man called Xuan Ze was pretty strong for him to not have died even until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Ze, calm down!\u201d Xuan Sheng\u2019s expression could not help darkening when he saw Xuan Ze\u2019s appearance. Although the fighting strength of devil-path cultivators would double, he knew the consequences very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, what are you worried about?\u201d Xuan Ze did not understand why he was hesitating, \u201cNo one knows we called them out. Even if Hai Chu finds it suspicious later, he wouldn\u2019t be able to find any evidence after we have dealt with them. I have ways to get them to tell us of Mo Jing\u2019s whereabouts as long as they fall into our hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xuan Sheng knew that Mo Jing had met with danger, he did not know that the people who rescued Mo Jing were Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>In reality, even Xing Qi and Gao Yin did not know their identities, and only knew that two strangers who they had never met before had saved Mo Jing. The only one that knew this was Mo Jing.</p><br/><p>Xuan Sheng was convinced. They could not be away for too long, otherwise their clan members would become suspicious, so this matter must be resolved quickly. Xuan Ze\u2019s fighting strength was not any lower than Xuan Ming\u2019s. When he defeated that young man, he could go over to help him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao did not want to let people know his true cultivation level, so he would deliberately suppress his own cultivation before others unless their strength was higher than his. Otherwise, others could only see his suppressed cultivation level.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take one each.\u201d You XiaoMo animatedly told Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised an eyebrow, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d You XiaoMo nodded in affirmation. Xuan Ze\u2019s strength was at the one star Level Eleven. This progress was really remarkable at his age. Ordinary people may not have this achievement even after ten thousand years of cultivating. There was a basis to his arrogance, but the more arrogant he was, the more he wanted to beat Xuan Ze into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right then.\u201d</p><br/><p>One versus one. It looked very fair.</p><br/><p>Xuan Ze also wanted this outcome. He was more worried than You XiaoMo that Ling Xiao would interfere.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me if you have the guts!\u201d Once Xuan Ze spat this sentence out, he turned to fly out to sea.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo especially wanted to leave him hanging out at sea. His expression at that time would definitely be entertaining. However, he followed after pausing for two seconds since he proposed the battle this time.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao and Xuan Sheng were the only ones left at the tiny port.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay this old man offer Your Excellency a bit of advice. A wise man submits to circumstances. You\u2019ll come to no good end by setting yourself against the Black Turtle Clan.\u201d Xuan Sheng arrogantly eyed Ling Xiao. He did not want to battle with him if it was possible because too much of a commotion would attract other people\u2019s attention. It would be troublesome if he was discovered by Hai Chu.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him with a smile that was yet not a smile, \u201cCan a traitor of the Black Turtle Clan speak as a representative of the Black Turtle Clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Sheng\u2019s expression darkened as he sinisterly admitted, \u201cIt seems that I cannot let you go no matter what happens. You both know too much. I\u2019ll only feel at ease if you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, a vigorous soul power erupted from his body and the pressure of a mighty powerhouse rushed towards Ling Xiao like a sharp awl, as if he was attempting to overwhelm Ling Xiao by depending solely on his aura.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s calm and still figure disappeared in an instant just as the razor-sharp awl was about to crash into him.</p><br/><p>Xuan Sheng\u2019s vigor went up in smoke then and there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

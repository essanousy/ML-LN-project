There was a question in his mind that was like an itch: at first it was only slightly itchy, but then the more you rolled the bigger it became.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo heard Ling Xiao calling him, and he lifted his head to see him put down his cup of tea and look over with an expression that seemed to flash with playfulness.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao curled the corners of his lips. \u201cSeeing how conflicted you look, could it be you want to do it a few more times?\u201d His smile was extremely wicked, but no matter what feeling it gave off it still made someone have the impulse to push him down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo silently turned his head away. His entire lower body was numb, and it wasn\u2019t as if he wanted to court death. Originally he just needed to drink some spiritual water and he could recover, but after hearing this line, he quietly gave up on this idea. It was better if he had less behaviors that courted death.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 how did you know I was in Xing Luo City, and that I went to the City Master\u2019s mansion?\u201d After hesitating for a while, You XiaoMo still couldn\u2019t resist his curiosity and asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao paused while pouring tea. He tilted his head and looked at him with a hint of a smile. \u201cHow would I know why someone would purposefully run to the City Master\u2019s mansion looking for death in order to avoid me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was speechless.</p><br/><p>Could he just pretend he hadn\u2019t said anything?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued to calmly rebuke, \u201cWife, you seem to have grown a lot during those days I wasn\u2019t here. You save people and seek revenge, and in the end you even sent yourself to a dog\u2019s den, is there anything else you won\u2019t do?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo buried his head into the pillow before suddenly raising his head after a few seconds. \u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao snorted. \u201cBecause of my wonderful foresight.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo followed up with flattery. \u201cYou\u2019re so amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, he had already guessed how he knew. Only he and Weng Gong knew about the revenge, so there was only one possibility for how Ling Xiao also knew. He must have run into Weng Gong and happened to learn about it from Weng Gong himself, and that\u2019s how he managed to find Xing Luo City.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst rest for four hours, after that we\u2019ll leave Xing Luo City.\u201d Ling Xiao said seriously.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo carefully measured his expression and said, \u201cDo we have to leave today? But I agreed to help Weng Gong get revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao seemed to say something quietly, but You XiaoMo didn\u2019t hear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s slaughter him first and leave after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second day, probably the only two people who would swagger around Xing Luo City and not leave after night raiding the City master\u2019s mansion and completely looting his property were You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao. However, at that moment the news of the mansion\u2019s treasury being looted still hadn\u2019t spread yet, and Xing Luo City\u2019s Lord probably believed that they had already left, so he had only slightly increased the number of guards on patrol.</p><br/><p>The QingFeng Sect\u2019s headquarters weren\u2019t actually inside Xing Luo City.</p><br/><p>Xing Luo City\u2019s city master had jurisdiction over the inside of Xing Luo City, so placing the headquarters inside the city would only be binding their own hands and feet. Therefore, many forces who were active inside the city all moved their strongholds out of Xing Luo City.</p><br/><p>But Gao MaYuan was only someone who had slight importance in the QingFeng Sect, and he didn\u2019t even have the qualifications to enter the headquarters of the sect, so he stayed in a place called Dong Feng Building in Xing Luo City.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo only had to ask around a little before he found that the Dong Feng Building was in Xing Luo City\u2019s most famous \u2018flower district.\u2019</p><br/><p>This \u2018flower district\u2019 wasn\u2019t referring to how people would sell items such as arranged flowers or fruits for auspicious occasions. Instead, it was for all sorts of romantic affairs, and both male and female brothels basically lined the entire street.t/n: Flower district is a metaphor for red-light district.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, You XiaoMo used to believe that this kind of place didn\u2019t exist on TongTian Continent, so he hadn\u2019t experienced it before.</p><br/><p>The brothels in the red-light district weren\u2019t like the ones that You XiaoMo saw on television. The brothels here stayed open in all sorts of weather and were decorated very beautifully, but there were no pretty girls or handsome boys standing outside to solicit customers.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo craned his neck to spy inside. Even though it was broad daylight, there were still quite a few customers in the brothels with young and beautiful concubines, and all sorts of obscene and lewd words flowed out from inside without missing a beat.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grasped the collar of his robe and walked in. \u201cWant to look? Then just proudly go and look.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished the thought, everyone inside looked over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was embarrassed. Although before, he had indeed wanted to come in and take a look at this kind of place which was filled to the brim with extravagance, but he felt that now wasn\u2019t quite suitable.</p><br/><p>The person receiving them was a heavily made-up woman wearing rich, revealing clothing. The woman twisted her slender waist and watched them with an expression that carried a hint of veiled scrutiny.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo let the woman inform Gao MaYuan while they waited in a room.</p><br/><p>After a minute, Gao MaYuan came over with several people. Up till now, he had still been investigating the incident at Hu Village since he had personally promised his concubine that he would help avenge his brother-in-law. But this entire time there had been no clues, making him feel very ashamed, so when he heard Hu Village\u2019s name he hurried over immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you two?\u201d Upon seeing two unfamiliar faces when entering the room, Gao MaYuan couldn\u2019t help but be on guard.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao picked up his cup and drank a mouthful of tea as a smile glimmered in his eyes. \u201cI heard that Your Excellency was investigating the matter of your brother-in-law being killed, so I wanted to inform you of the murderer\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo spat out his water.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurderer? Who are you, and how do you know of this? What\u2019s your purpose?\u201d Gao MaYuan wasn\u2019t suspicious about how he knew of this, since this wasn\u2019t something he had taken pains to hide, but he didn\u2019t dare to just randomly trust a stranger who had appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a moment you will know what my purpose is.\u201d As Ling Xiao spoke, he pushed You XiaoMo forward and said, smiling, \u201cI\u2019ll first give you some welfare. This person is the murderer who killed your brother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed dryly. What kind of joke was this?</p><br/><p>Gao MaYuan\u2019s scrutinizing gaze landed on You XiaoMo\u2019s stiff face, and he pointed the scabbard in his hand towards him. \u201cIt was you who murdered my brother-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shot a glance at Ling Xiao, whose expression remained unchanged. That bastard, since this was the case\u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s right, I killed that brother-in-law of yours, but I only acted on someone else\u2019s instigation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho instigated you?\u201d Gao MaYuan gripped the sword in his hand tightly, and a trace of anger flashed over his face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo coughed and pointed a finger at Ling Xiao. \u201cHe instigated me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao MaYuan\u2019s face grew gloomy. \u201cAre you two playing with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao drank the rest of the tea in his cup and smiled at You XiaoMo, who had jumped aside. He curled his lips. \u201cA scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes. You\u2019ve become smarter.\u201d(t/n: \uff0c, meaning \u201cafter even a short absence, people will change and should be judged anew\u201d)</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted his chin high, pleased with himself. \u201cOnly thanks to your lucky influence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao MaYuan saw that the two of them had actually begun to chat as if nobody else was there. No matter if they were the ones who murdered his brother-in-law or not, he wouldn\u2019t let them go, since they dared to play him like he was a monkey. He angrily drew out his sword and swung it downwards towards Ling Xiao, who was closest to him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grabbed both of his arms and, with a light pinch, there came a cracking noise from the bones. Both arms were entirely broken and faced the opposite direction, and the tip of the sword slid into Gao MaYuan\u2019s body with a puncturing noise. Fresh blood sprayed onto the table, and Gao MaYuan only took his final breath five seconds later. His face couldn\u2019t even show a single sign of struggle, since the speed was too great.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallowed heavily. Too ruthless.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulled out the sword from Gao MaYuan\u2019s body, and the blood sprayed out as he handed it to him. \u201cHold this.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took the sword. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cTo cut off his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s hands shook, and he asked, not understanding, \u201cIsn\u2019t he already dead? Why do we still have to cut off his head?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you agree to help Weng Gong get revenge? How will you do it if you don\u2019t bring him the head? Unless you want to carry the entire body away?\u201d Ling Xiao asked disapprovingly in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s very disgusting, I just ate yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, it\u2019s already finished digesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026can we change the location?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, top half of the body or bottom half, pick one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026let\u2019s just go with the head then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cutting off the head was an executioner\u2019s job, so who would\u2019ve thought that he would end up stealing their work one day. Although he had seen many corpses who had died tragic deaths, this would still be the first time he personally cut off someone\u2019s head. He couldn\u2019t help but imagine the sight of blood flowing out and wanted to vomit\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gripped his hand, which was holding the sword, and gestured towards the corpse. He said quietly next to his ear, \u201cJust pretend that you\u2019re butchering a pig, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, or else I won\u2019t want to eat pork anymore.\u201d You XiaoMo spat blood. What comforting, clearly he came just to disgust him.</p><br/><p>In reality, killing someone, er no, cutting off a corpse\u2019s head was simpler than he imagined it to be. The hand rose and the sword fell, straight to the point. The head didn\u2019t even roll off the table, still joined securely to Gao MaYuan\u2019s neck, and although there was a sword stuck in between the two, there was still quite a feeling of artistry.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo loosened the sword that had become stuck in the table and laughed evilly. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao clapped his hands, smiling, and he praised, \u201cYour technique is not bad, you can\u2019t tell that you have a natural gift for this. From now on, if there\u2019s any more work like this it\u2019ll be yours to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only when they left the brothel were the bodies of Gao MaYuan and his underlings discovered, although the underlings had died quite cleanly. The most brutal one was Gao MaYuan\u2019s headless corpse.</p><br/><p>What nobody knew was that since the time You XiaoMo accidentally ran to the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s territory, not a single peaceful day had gone by on the west side. In fact, this was the trouble created all because of that mistake.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The mentor didn\u2019t take them to the rooms that had been used by those who had been kicked down. To avoid running out of space, many rooms had been prepared.</p><br/><p>Their rooms were still next to one another. Tian Xin and Cheng XiangRong were next to You XiaoMo while Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye were opposite to him.</p><br/><p>The rooms on the sixtieth floor were like what Yan Hui described. It wasn\u2019t exquisitely furnished by any means, but it felt homely.</p><br/><p>ui had wanted to switch rooms with Cheng XiangRong, saying he preferred rooms that faced the north, but before Cheng XiangRong could reply, the mentor arranged a room that faced north for him. It was five or six rooms away from the rest of them, so he ended up running back.</p><br/><p>\u201cA room facing south isn\u2019t bad either.\u201d Yan Hui gave a weak explanation.</p><br/><p>But no one really cared. None of them could stand having to live on that disgusting floor for almost ten days. Though Tian Xin had said it was only three days, she had neglected the period of time it would take for the challenges to wrap up.</p><br/><p>They were used to living in large, spacious rooms, so it was suffocating to live in a small room for so long.</p><br/><p>After dismissing Yan Hui, You XiaoMo closed the door and isolate them from everyone else\u2019s sights. The first thing he did was to lunge at the large bed in the room and roll around while exclaiming, \u201cBig beds are the best for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao wanted to say that it didn\u2019t matter if practitioners slept, but considering how the other was once a normal person, he decided against it.</p><br/><p>Once You XiaoMo was done basking in the comfort of the bed, he crawled over to Ling Xiao\u2019s side, placing his chin on the other\u2019s arm. \u201cWhere did you go the day before yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao leaned against the post of the bed. \u201cI went out to gather information. After you get to the seventieth floor, I can\u2019t follow you up anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately sat up straight. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cDo you really think that the Xiao Yao Institution would be so generous as to let people come in and out as they pleased?\u201d</p><br/><p>It could be clearly seen from the first floor that very few people would be willing to squeeze into such a small room with another. This had become an invisible deterrent, and more importantly, most people didn\u2019t do this out of generosity, very few had as pure intentions as You XiaoMo did.</p><br/><p>Even so, some were still greedy enough to plot together, so outsiders weren\u2019t allowed onto the higher floors, since all the truly valuable items were on those floors. For everything on floors seventy and under, what the Xiao Yao Institute could provide was readily available outside as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew that the academy would have its rules. In reality, he had thought it strange that the Xiao Yao Institute would allow outsiders in. It was only now that he knew of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, just focus on your studies. I hear that the situation for the floors above seventy is different from below. You might not have as blissful of a life up there,\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s eye twitched. \u201cPlease stop using the word blissful to describe things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao immediately changed his words. \u201cYou won\u2019t have a blissful life at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think for a moment that I missed that change in the connotation of that word.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk seriously.\u201d After a moment of speechlessness, You XiaoMo slapped the other\u2019s muscled arm upon realizing that the other didn\u2019t seem to intend to answer his question properly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at his hand. \u201cTongTian Continent is my home. There\u2019s a lot I\u2019ve left here. We hadn\u2019t had the chance to check up on things before. Now that I have time, I plan on going for a visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he realized that You XiaoMo was looking at him in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head. \u201cI always thought you were a loner, I never imagined you had \u2018a lot of things\u2019. What things are there, can you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he was frustrated. He had explained his whole reincarnation secret to Ling Xiao already, so he naturally had a right to know Ling Xiao\u2019s secrets.</p><br/><p>It was good that Ling Xiao didn\u2019t plan on hiding things from him, otherwise You XiaoMo would consider lunging and bearing his own sparkling white teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already know the whole thing with my parents. I told you my parents had a trusted follower, right? Everything I know about my parents came from him. It seems like in the ten thousand years I\u2019ve left TongTian Continent, he\u2019s managed to establish his own group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you plan to find that trusted follower of your parents?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn about a month and a half.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo made some quick calculations. Not long after a month and a half, it would be the end of Xiong Xiao\u2019s promise of three months. It seemed like Ling Xiao had already planned for all this. \u201cRemember to not be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though he wanted to go with, he had to settle down and focus on cultivating after running around for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you would feel empty and lonely. I\u2019ll come back as soon as I can,\u201d Ling Xiao promised, hugging the other\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The empty and lonely You XiaoMo decided to not argue over these two words considering how the other was about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, when are you preparing to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The days before one had to say goodbye always passed quickly. You XiaoMo felt like he had only sighed a few times before the time for them to part arrived. However, thinking of Ling Xiao\u2019s \u2018generosity\u2019 with his money, he didn\u2019t feel so sad anymore.</p><br/><p>After coming to the TongTian Continent, he actually hadn\u2019t event spent a hundredth of his total assets yet, so he was in a dilemma about how much to give Ling Xiao. If he gave the other more, then the other would definitely spend more. But if he gave too little, what if Ling Xiao ran out?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo debated over this for half a day before eventually settling on giving Ling Xiao more.</p><br/><p>When Ling Xiao took the storage bag, he immediately knew how many spirit gems were inside and looked at You XiaoMo with an almost-smile. \u201cDoesn\u2019t your heart hurt to give me so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit, of course it hurts.\u201d You XiaoMo rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hung the bag at his waist as he said, \u201cYou gave me so much even though your heart hurt to do so. I can\u2019t promise how much will remain.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately pushed him towards the door. \u201cHurry and go, it\u2019s better for my eyes to not have to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you wish, I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d Ling Xiao really did leave as he said this, soon disappearing from sight.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stood there for a moment. Three seconds later, he ran to the doorway and looked into the corridor. Ling Xiao really was gone. You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but curse at the other in his heart for being such a fast bastard.</p><br/><p>It was only two days after Ling Xiao left that Cheng XiangRong and company finally noticed his disappearance. At first, they had thought Ling Xiao had gone out to take care of some business, so they didn\u2019t really put much thought to it.</p><br/><p>When Yan Hui pulled Cheng XiangRong over to ask after this, they were quickly sent off with a few sentences from You XiaoMo. Usually, he and Ling Xiao were stuck at the hip, but they couldn\u2019t be together all the time.</p><br/><p>His life seemed to have returned to the peaceful but busy days back when he was alone.</p><br/><p>After the big competition, the students of the Giganticus entered a period of rest.</p><br/><p>As they were new students, they had only fought three matches and therefore didn\u2019t have to spend several days recovering like the others. Early next morning, someone knocked on You XiaoMo\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s rude to wake people from their dreams?\u201d You XiaoMo opened with door with a head of bed hair, yelling at the perpetrator in frustration.</p><br/><p>Seeing his not-fully-awake look, Yan Hui immediately pushed goody-two-shoes Cheng XiangRong forwards.</p><br/><p>Seeing him angered, Cheng XiangRong stuttered, \u201cS-sorry, I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his eyes and realized it was the uncle with the rather soft personality, immediately talking in a gentler tone, \u201cOh, it\u2019s you, uncle. Is there anything you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong glanced at Yan Hui and said, \u201cA Hui said that we should go and get our tallies from the mentors, so we wanted to ask you if you wanted to come along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a while,\u201d You XiaoMo said before returning inside.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui immediately glared at Cheng XiangRong. \u201cWhy did he use a nicer tone after seeing you?\u201d He had thought You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong scratched his head. \u201cI dunno either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui was furious.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, You XiaoMo came out groomed perfectly, a smile on his face, and the furious expression from before gone.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui couldn\u2019t help but exclaim to himself that You XiaoMo\u2019s mood really changed too quickly. Could it be that, in Ling Mo\u2019s absence, his mood had become unstable? He felt like he might be approaching the truth\u2026</p><br/><p>The tallies that Cheng XiangRong were talking about was the points system of the Giganticus.</p><br/><p>Since they were new students, they had to redeem a tally first. The tally would record all the matches they had fought while in the Giganticus, their losses, victories and ties. However, there would only be points from winning.</p><br/><p>After half an hour, the mentor handed them the created tallies. \u201cThese are your tallies. If you lose them, it\u2019ll be a pain to remake, so keep them safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo accepted the three tallies before handing Yan Hui and Cheng XiangRong their tallies.</p><br/><p>His name was carved at the top of the tally. Under his name his number of wins, losses and ties. Currently, there was only one number three under his win, and at the bottom, his total points was also three.</p><br/><p>The three had the same.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

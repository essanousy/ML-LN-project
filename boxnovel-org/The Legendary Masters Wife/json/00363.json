Apart from them, there were also a few people You XiaoMo recognized.</p><br/><p>There was the shixiong and shijie pair that would be able to win an Oscar, wait no, that were forced to hide their relationship because of their xiao shimei, as well as the said shimei.</p><br/><p>What was strange was that this xiao shimei looked immaculate. Compared to her, the others looked worn, obviously having experienced some sort of huge battle not long ago.</p><br/><p>Seeing them come back, everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>Being able to return in one piece from getting hunted down by a level ten demon beast was nothing to scoff at.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was feeling shocked, an astonished voice spoke up unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, humph, you dare appear in front of me again?\u201d The xiao shimei first expressed her surprise and then gave a strange laugh, as if spotting prey that had come to her of its own volition. Her behavior was as discomforting as ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu, please stop,\u201d The observant Lan YiLan spoke up to stop her.</p><br/><p>If it was Hai Le, she might listen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I? These two dared to insult me in the tavern. Now that I\u2019ve managed to bump into them again, I won\u2019t let them go so easily.\u201d The young martial sister watched them with malice, ignoring Lan YiLan\u2019s words completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d You XiaoMo seemed to only just notice her presence, saying in surprise, \u201cAren\u2019t you that woman who had something wrong with her head and eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you saying has something wrong with their head and eyes, ugly?\u201d The corner of the other\u2019s lips curled up, smiling softly as she retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo was about to reply when he stopped himself abruptly. This sentence\u2026 really gave him d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. He hadn\u2019t thought this dumb-looking woman was quite smart. He didn\u2019t know if it was a coincidence.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly leaned down to his ear and said with a smile, \u201cThis woman seems to be even smarter than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she was angry, her tone seemed laughing and warm. She didn\u2019t seem to be the kind of reckless person the citizens of Boundless City said she was. This could be seen from her status. She was immaculate. Either she hadn\u2019t fought, or she was rather powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you boost the enemy\u2019s morale and put out your own?\u201d You XiaoMo objected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen keep going,\u201d Ling Xiao said, uncaring.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gazed at the woman who showed no anger whatsoever on her face, yet her words could easily enrage another. No matter how he looked at her, she seemed to give off a strange feeling. \u201cWhatever, a gentleman doesn\u2019t fight petty women.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him with a smile.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked away guiltily.</p><br/><p>It was then that Yan Fa walked in front of them. \u201cWeren\u2019t you two being hunted down by the Monster Fox? How come you\u2019re here? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao explained without a hint of unease, \u201cWe were being pursued by the Monster Fox, but as we ran we met a guy in black. We don\u2019t know where he came from, but he was powerful, and he killed Monster Fox with one move and then ran off, ignoring us completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stood beside him nodding in agreement</p><br/><p>Before getting here, they had gone over their alibis together. All he had to do was turn all the questions to the flashy Ling Xiao, and let the Grand Elder confirm their statements.</p><br/><p>Yan Fa didn\u2019t continue to interrogate them. These were strange times. Suddenly having another powerhouse appear out of thin air wasn\u2019t anything strange.</p><br/><p>However, Yin Ge, who was leaning against a rock and resting from his injuries, suddenly opened his eyes to glance at them when Ling Xiao said this, before turning away without care.</p><br/><p>DaoXin Academy didn\u2019t have any casualties, but some were injured rather seriously, such as Yin Ge and two of the elders who had been injured in their fight to defeat Frost Lion.</p><br/><p>After around two hours, Hei Tian and Duan QiTian came to regroup with them.</p><br/><p>The BaiLi and Tong Family heads had left with their people after getting their promises.</p><br/><p>As for Qiu Ran, he still managed to escape in the end. He had come prepared this time, sacrificing his arm to escape the Mirage Sand Seas with a heavily injured Hong Yun. It was a little disappointing that they didn\u2019t manage to kill him here.</p><br/><p>When Hei Tian said that Old HeiYun was Qiu Ran\u2019s Life Bound Contract beast, everyone\u2019s gaze fell onto Hai Le and the other two simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian, seeing everyone\u2019s strange behavior, looked over as well. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s up with those three?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scuttled over to him. \u201cMaster, they\u2019re the disciples of Old HeiYun. Especially that woman in red. I hear she\u2019s Old HeiYun\u2019s most treasured pupil. If we use her, we might be able to lure Qiu Ran-shixiong out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian looked at them in surprise. He would, naturally, scrutinize this person that his youngest disciple pointed out. This young lady gave him a strange feeling, a bit like Qiu Ran when he was younger.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian suddenly shook his head.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was about to ask why, when there was a suddenly movement from the other side.</p><br/><p>When they looked over, two figures, one white and one blue, flew out at them, but their positions were a little strange. And that Xiao Yu had disappeared.</p><br/><p>That was when Hei Tian made a noise of derision and sent a palm of energy out at the ocean surface. The seawater erupted, and a terrible scream rang out from down below. That part of the ocean was tainted red with blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a cruel woman. No wonder Hong Yun treasured her,\u201d Duan QiTian sighed out. She had thrown her shixiong and shijie out to provide cover to give herself time to escape. Her methods were cruel and sly, like Qiu Ran and Hong Yun. However, she was very brave to run right in front of all of them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could only feel cold. It seemed like no matter how much she liked her shixiong, he wasn\u2019t nearly as important as her own life.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see? Even the person closest to you could betray you. So, you shouldn\u2019t trust so easily in the future. For example\u2026 You and DaoXin Academy, if you let your master choose between the two, which do you think he\u2019d choose?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s voice suddenly rang softly in his ears.</p><br/><p>This was a razor-sharp question!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s like asking, \u2018if your lover and mother both fell into the water, who would you choose?\u2019</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that his situation was more complicated than this, because he was one of the choices. The more he thought about it, the more he believed that his master would choose DaoXin Academy and that feeling\u2026 it was a devil that tempted him to darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis problem won\u2019t even exist. It\u2019s impossible that I\u2019ll ever have any sort of clash with DaoXin Academy,\u201d You XiaoMo hurriedly answered before his mind twisted into knots.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it impossible? The future isn\u2019t certain. You just don\u2019t want to admit that Duan QiTian would definitely choose DaoXin Academy, no?\u201d Ling Xiao slowly began to smile a strange smile.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was silent for a while. \u201cDo you think that I shouldn\u2019t give the Elemental Essence to the old man?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes, saying in a vague manner, \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo then said, \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a bit of a goody-two-shoes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201c\u2026 You should at least hesitate for moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, I\u2019ll hesitate. Er\u2026 You are!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It took a while for them to return to the topic at hand. In reality, You XiaoMo understood Ling Xiao\u2019s opinion. After being together for such a long time, he knew Ling Xiao was the kind of person who only did good on a whim, so he wouldn\u2019t easily give other people things he wanted.</p><br/><p>However, he was different. He didn\u2019t like owing other people and he had the mindset of someone from the twenty first century. He wasn\u2019t like people here who wouldn\u2019t easily trust anyone. So, when he met someone who was good to him, he would subconsciously try to return it. This was a deeply ingrained mindset of his!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you propose?\u201d You XiaoMo threw the question back to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I say anything, would you change your mind?\u201d Ling Xiao was doubtful.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flushed, turning his head and refusing to look at Ling Xiao, stuttering, \u201cIt-it\u2019s important to keep peace in the family. When husband\u2026 husband and husband disagree, ahem, we can discuss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his past life that\u2019s how his mother and father did it. If they disagreed, then they\u2019d have a family meeting. The entire family would sit together and discuss a certain problem, and they had to solve it on the day to avoid it affecting their life. This was a rule in the You family and he had attended several times in the past, but usually was on the losing side.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was stunned for a moment, before suddenly smiling.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt deeply uncomfortable with this smile.</p><br/><p>All he was doing was giving some advice from his past life, was there a need to smile so\u2026 alluringly? His heartbeat had sped up.</p><br/><p>By the time they returned to DaoXin Academy, it had been five days. These days really were quite chaotic. During the time they were absent, DaoXin Academy had been attacked. It came from the Demon Beast Gathering in the deep mountains. They had probably gotten wind of Hei Tian and Duan QiTian\u2019s absence.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, no one was controlling it and it was made out of flame, so it couldn\u2019t perform to its best. He had only intended to stall Yu WenNan with it.</p><br/><p>Yu WenNan and Chen QingEr immediately went to the Thousand Faces Purgatory Spider\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Chen QingEr looked at Thousand Faces Purgatory Spider in worry. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright. Luckily, I\u2019m wearing armor made from Purgatory Silk. It\u2019s just unfortunate that the Purgatory Armor is destroyed now. As expected of Sacred Qilin Fire.\u201d The Thousand Faces Purgatory Spider had escaped death by the skin of her teeth. Though she was sad about her Purgatory Armor, she contained her sorrow in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s destroyed. It\u2019s better than having you dead.\u201d Chen QingEr let out a breath of relief. The Thousand Faces Purgatory Spider was her lifebound contract beast. If anything happened to her, Chen QingEr would face a backlash of power and her strength would decline, causing their situation to worsen.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s figure out how we\u2019re going to complete this mission. That man called Ling Xiao isn\u2019t a normal Emperor Beast, but a Qilin, the head of the Four Great Spirits.\u201d Yu WenNan looked towards Ling Xiao solemnly. That other red flame also interested him.</p><br/><p>Before they could discuss their plans, a loud bang came from above. DaoXin Academy\u2019s strongest barrier began to vibrate faster and faster until with a boom, it shattered. The immense sound made people wish they were deaf.</p><br/><p>In the sky, intense sunlight shone inside.</p><br/><p>The roars of demon beasts also echoed inside.</p><br/><p>Someone actually managed to break such a strong barrier.</p><br/><p>The expressions of Hei Tian and the five elders twisted. This barrier was what was separating Ward A from the deep mountains, protecting the school all these years. Once it broke, Ward A was very likely to be attacked by the demon beasts of the deep mountains.</p><br/><p>Without prompting, Gao Yang immediately turned back, rushing to guard the exits with the security team.</p><br/><p>In the moment the barrier broke, several beams of light darted in from outside and appeared in the skies above. The first was Qiu Ran and then there were the two powerhouses that were working with him and their demon beasts. Apart from that, the Teng Family head, Fairy FuRong and FeiXie had all arrived as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNanShen, seems like you\u2019re having some trouble, too. How about we cooperate?\u201d That was when the man on Qiu Ran\u2019s left spoke up, looking towards Yu WenNan and his companions. From his tone, they sounded like they knew each other.</p><br/><p>Yu WenNan glanced at them with an empty smile. \u201cHis lordship even sent the two of you here. He\u2019s really putting down all his cards for this middle-plane person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it really is what we think, then there\u2019s no reluctance to be had. Aren\u2019t you the same? Even sending DongShen in the beginning. What a shame that he died.\u201d The middle aged man smiled, reveling in this misfortune.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyways, if we\u2019re going to cooperate, I\u2019ll have to make something clear.\u201d Yu WenNan didn\u2019t want to keep talking bullshit with his guy. \u201cThat man is extremely strong. None of us have the strength to oppose him. If you want to complete the mission, then don\u2019t play around or hold anything back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle aged man and his companions followed his gaze to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The middle aged man observed for a few seconds before saying, \u201cNo matter how strong, he\u2019s just one man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though he could sense that this person was special, he still wasn\u2019t willing to feel threatened by a person from the middle-plane. After all, he was a member of the Vermillion Blood family.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Yu WenNan didn\u2019t react and didn\u2019t seem to intend to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf so, then how about you two deal with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d The middle-aged man was about to agree when his companion suddenly stopped him He looked at NanShen and said, \u201cIf he\u2019s strong, it\u2019s not fair if you don\u2019t help out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu WenNan shrugged, his eyes filled with humor. \u201cSure. Then I\u2019ll leave the others to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>While they discussed their tactics, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t bother with Qiu Ran and the others that had broken in, but alighted on the ground with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>The Academy people didn\u2019t dare approach him, watching him from afar, probably because of his display of power in the air just now.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had wanted to place You XiaoMo in his dimension, but he would worry if You XiaoMo was there alone. SheQiu and the others were in the other dimension and he wasn\u2019t the owner of that one so he couldn\u2019t call them out.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp~ Chirp~\u201d As Ling Xiao was thinking, a chicken flew over unsteadily from out of the crowd.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had almost forgotten him.</p><br/><p>Because they were coming over, You XiaoMo had left the little chicken in the room.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t willing, so You XiaoMo had Ling Xiao scare him. It was only then that he unwillingly let go. Now, he had probably ran out, taking advantage of the lack of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over,\u201d Ling Xiao ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp~\u201d The little chicken immediately flew to him in joy.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao spoke gently to it. \u201cProtect your master. If even a single hair on his head is harmed, I\u2019ll pull out a feather for every one you grow, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp~\u201d THe little chicken sadly pecked at his bald wings. He had only been born a few days ago.</p><br/><p>That was when another person walked over, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll look after him for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked over. The newcomer had startlingly silver hair. It was the now recovered Yin Ge and behind him was Feng ChiYun, Yang YuLin and You XiaoMo\u2019s other friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Feng ChiYun asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing really. He\u2019s just lost a bit of energy. He\u2019ll be fine once he rests up.\u201d Ling Xiao carefully placed You XiaoMo on the ground, leaning him against a large rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d LanQiu walked over.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stroked You XiaoMo\u2019s cheek and said without raising his head, \u201cIf I want you to protect him with your life, can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>LanQiu nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting this agreement, Ling Xiao stood and turned to look at Yin Ge and the others. \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you with this.\u201d His expression was hidden by the mask, but he was accepting Yin Ge\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>Yin Ge nodded calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help, too.\u201d BaiLi XiaoYu ran over, Liu Le and Jiang XiaoFeng following. Though they didn\u2019t speak, they had the same idea as BaiLi XiaoYu.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d BaiLi TianYi said, walking over. \u201cWith your current strength, you\u2019ll only get in the way. Go wherever its calm. You aren\u2019t needed here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother\u2026\u201d BaiLi XiaoYu pouted, glaring at him in complaint.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work even if you call me dad. Now scram, or do you need me to help?\u201d BaiLi TianYi wasn\u2019t having it, cracking his knuckles.</p><br/><p>Call you dad? Keep dreaming.</p><br/><p>Jiang XiaoFeng pulled, whispering, \u201cForget it XiaoYu. With our current power, there is nothing we can do. Let\u2019s go, don\u2019t cause them anymore trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even his good friend said so, BaiLi XiaoYu had no other option. In the end, those three could only leave.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao turned his head and glanced at You XiaoMo. His feet lifted up a bit before his figure vanished mysteriously. Within the next second, his figure appeared above the sky, standing on the opposite side of Qiu Ran\u2019s party.</p><br/><p>On his right, not far behind him was Hei Tian and the Five Great Elders. Qiu Ran had destroyed DaoXin Academy\u2019s barrier, this feud was not exclusively between Duan QiTian and his first disciple anymore.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao placed his palm on his mask. Under the presence of many people, he took off the mask and an extremely handsome face appeared before everyone.</p><br/><p>Looking at that familiar face, Hei Tian\u2019s eyes flashed, but his expression remained unchanged. However, on the opposite side, Qiu Ran\u2019s expression was clearly showing a sign of change. After all, the thought that a Divine Level powerhouse was hiding inside DaoXin Academy had never occurred in his mind before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis man, was he the one who appeared at the Boundless Sea?\u201d The middle-aged man beside Qiu Ran saw the slight change in Qiu Ran\u2019s expression, and he could roughly guess what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. Back then he didn\u2019t display all of his strength, so, I\u2019m not sure about his true power. You better be careful.\u201d Qiu Ran nodded his head and warned. Even though there were more people on his side, he still felt cautious.</p><br/><p>Standing not far away, when Yu WenNan saw Ling Xiao, despite his expression still looking the same on the outside, his brain had started searching for memories of people he had seen in the Higher Realm, especially those that were related to the QiLin Clan. But no matter how hard he tried, he still couldn\u2019t find a match.</p><br/><p>Yu WenNan couldn\u2019t help but doubt the answer he had come up with. He wasn\u2019t from the QiLin Clan? Thinking over again, this could never be, because the symbol between his eyebrows was definitely a QiLin Clan\u2019s trait.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao conveniently threw the mask into his dimension. His calm, clouded eyes swept across the distance and directly fell on the Thousand Faces Purgatory Spider\u2019s body. Within a blink of an eye, his eyes shot out a freezing, spine shivering, murderous intent.</p><br/><p>The Thousand Faces Purgatory Spider felt the it running from her feet to inside her brain. She knew, if today she didn\u2019t fight with all of her power, she couldn\u2019t even think about leaving this place.</p><br/><p>While she was tangled with her thoughts, she found out the man on the opposite of her had disappeared.</p><br/><p>The Thousand Faces Purgatory Spider\u2019s expression changed drastically, no way would she forget the scalding pain from the Sacred Qilin Fire.</p><br/><p>At the time of Ling Xiao\u2019s disappearance, Yu WenNan and the middle-aged man both took action right away. Three dark shadows clashed above the sky and parted instantly\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

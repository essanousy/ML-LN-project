You XiaoMo did not want to be treated as a spectacle, so when the hour was up, he immediately packed his things, and prepared to beat it. As for the matter of cutting class, he would just have to find a chance to explain his reason to the teacher-in-charge.</p><br/><p>The old man saw him leaving and subconsciously called out to him, \u201cYou brat, stop right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s reaction was to abscond immediately. Who would stay back to be pestered endlessly? Only a fool would do that.</p><br/><p>The old man, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo did not return to his pavilion after getting away. He had promised to meet BaiLi XiaoYu to go to the sales area for magic pills after class. However, it was all ruined by that old geezer, and he could not uphold his promise now. You XiaoMo could only mentally apologise to BaiLi XiaoYu, and give him a proper explanation the next time they meet. Then he ran straight towards the sales area for magic pills.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought that the old geezer would not chase after him, or to be more accurate, never would he have dreamt that the old geezer would be able to catch him.</p><br/><p>After running for some distance, an ear-splitting roar sounded from behind You XiaoMo. It made him stumble and nearly fall flat on his face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned around for a look, and could not help gasping in surprise. The old geezer was actually chasing after him!</p><br/><p>Seeing a frail-looking old man dashing over with an exceptionally astounding speed and vigour, and with him roaring after You XiaoMo, many passers-by stopped in their tracks to watch the spectacle.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held his temples and began to moan about an imaginary illness.</p><br/><p>This old geezer was really too brazen, who knew what he would do once he caught up?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo did not want to have more entanglements with the old geezer, thus he picked up his pace. No matter how useless he was, You XiaoMo thought he could definitely outrun an old man. In the end, he was terrifically aghast when his arm was grabbed, and he was forcefully carried off in the old man\u2019s arms as the old geezer walked back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat, didn\u2019t you hear me when I asked you to stop?\u201d The old man was still very vigorous and lively. After running for such a long distance, he was not even breathing hard. His complexion was rosy and he looked extremely energetic.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, You XiaoMo was panting hard, and had no strength to retort.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell me this old geezer ate some body strengthening miracle medicine?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world are you planning to do?\u201d You XiaoMo unhappily asked once he got his breath back. It\u2019s really enough, wo. Not only did this old geezer stop him from attending class, he was also bothering him now. You XiaoMo had never seen such an annoying old geezer in his life.</p><br/><p>The old man saw that he was not struggling to run away, and slightly relaxed. When he heard You XiaoMo\u2019s question, he stated without hesitation, \u201cI want to take you as my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared blankly at him in shock, \u201cYou want me to call you Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man nodded his head, \u201cNot bad, your aptitudes are pretty good. You have the qualification to become my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>This old man was really narcissistic!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo bluntly replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, but I don\u2019t want to be your disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man immediately glared at him and he puffed up while letting out a loud outcry, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re saying?! Everyone in the academy wants to be my disciple. This great old man is giving you such an invaluable chance, and you actually want to reject me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wa, this old geezer became even more narcissistic\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded his head, \u201cI am extremely, certainly, and absolutely sure that I know what I\u2019m saying. If this esteemed elder has nothing else to say, could you release me? I still have other things to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The old man instantly shook his head, \u201cIf you don\u2019t say it clearly, I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I say it clearly enough? What more do you want me to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man replied, \u201cClearly explain why you don\u2019t want to be my disciple! What\u2019s not good about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But to stay in a stalemate was also not an option. You XiaoMo mused over it, and decided to elucidate his reason for declining the offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat good points does this esteemed elder think he has?\u201d Sprouting off the old man\u2019s defects in front of him was not a good idea. Furthermore, there was quite a large crowd surrounding them. You XiaoMo did not want to want to be crowned with a \u2018no respect for the elderly\u2019 criminal charge.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great old me is affable, amiable, accomplished, honourable, charitable, straightforward, magnanimous, indomitable, upright\u2026 \u2026. Where else can you find such a virtuous Master?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had seen narcissistic people, but not one who had narcissism cultivated to such a high level. To think he would dare to compliment his own self with so many positive character traits.</p><br/><p>Just as the two were trapped in an inescapable deadlock, You XiaoMo\u2019s lifeline dropped into his lap.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice, familiar enough to resound in his bones, was heard from behind You XiaoMo, carrying a hint of doubt and amusement.</p><br/><p>Hearing this voice, You XiaoMo was so overjoyed that he nearly cried. His knight in shining armor had finally arrived. He turned back, and gave Ling Xiao, who was curiously observing them, puppy-dog eyes. \u201cLing Xiao, quick, save me! This weird old geezer wants me to accept him as my Master, and he won\u2019t take no for an answer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the short-sighted person who wants to take you as a disciple?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze landed on the old geezer who was grabbing You XiaoMo\u2019s arm. Under the mask, surprise flitted across his face \u2013 this old geezer\u2019s strength was remarkably high.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo may be thinking too much, but he felt that Ling Xiao\u2019s words were slightly belittling him. He could not refrain from frowning as he lifted the arm caught by the old man, \u201cIt\u2019s this person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man heard the complaint in his tone, and unhappily replied, \u201cWith this great old me\u2019s strength, why would you feel aggrieved to be my disciple? The one who should be aggrieved should be me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you should stop distressing yourself!\u201d You XiaoMo instantly replied. He was sincerely hoping that the old geezer would not give grievances to himself.</p><br/><p>The old man momentarily choked on his words. This little brat was not cute at all! But the more he was rejected, the more he refused to admit defeat. In the past, no matter how people begged him, he refused to accept them. Now karma was knocking on his door.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, the great old me is a level ten mage. Besides my disciple who has graduated, I am the only one left in the Long Xiang Continent. Tell me, where can you find such an awesome master?! Here I am giving you a chance, and you\u2019re finding all sorts of excuses! You really make me so furious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a level ten mage?\u201d You XiaoMo was stunned, and eyed him up and down. He still did not believe the old man, and shook his head, \u201cThat cannot be. I\u2019ve heard that the best mage in the Long Xiang Continent is Qiu Ran. He is a high leveled mage rumored to be the closest to becoming the Number One Mage. Are you just saying this to deceive me into calling you Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this scepticism, the old man was so angry he felt as if he had a foot in his grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you that Qiu Ran is the best mage in the Long Xiang Continent? That youngster is my disciple. Have you ever heard of a disciple who is better than their master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQiu Ran is you disciple?\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, who else could nurture such an outstanding disciple? Most of the things he learned were all taught by me.\u201d The old man stuck his chest out and proudly replied.</p><br/><p>Speaking of Qiu Ran, You XiaoMo subconsciously remembered the Heavenly Soul Scripture that Ling Xiao took. This matter was always weighing on his mind. He was constantly worried that he would be discovered, so he had to be very cautious when practicing the scripture. Knowing that the old geezer was Qiu Ran\u2019s teacher, he wanted to immediately decline, but inspiration struck him upon hearing the old geezer\u2019s last sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, is it really true that you taught Qiu Ran everything that he knows?\u201d You XiaoMo hastily asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s true.\u201d The old man patted his chest, and replied without the slightest hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, please give me three days to think over it. After three days, I will give you my reply. I am staying at the Ninth pavilion in One Autumn Courtyard. If I have not replied within three days, you need not worry that I will escape.\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, remember what you\u2019ve said. When the time comes, you better not regret it.\u201d You XiaoMo did not seem to be lying. Even if he was, the old man had the ability to find him. Therefore, he agreed to You XiaoMo\u2019s terms.</p><br/><p>After the old man left, You XiaoMo let out a sigh of relief. He thought of the jade drive that Ning Jing-daoshi gave him. When he returned, he would find some time to look for information on the old geezer.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, who was watching the whole show on the sidelines, walked over with a smile, \u201cThat old fellow\u2019s strength is definitely that of a level ten mage. Taking him as your Master should be very beneficial to you. If he was the one who passed the scripture to Qiu Ran, you could find an opportunity for the old fellow to pass it to you too. Afterwards, you could practice it out in the open. In addition, he probably has many magic pill recipes on hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that Ling Xiao was actually thinking along the same lines as You XiaoMo? A cheap Master was still better than nothing, and although this old teacher\u2019s personality seemed to be a little impetuous, overall, he was still a pretty good catch. He may be a little unreasonable, but he was quite frank too.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao and asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were currently in Block Two and it could not be a coincidence for them to meet here.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took out his card, and beamed, \u201cSee what I have!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he caught sight of what Ling Xiao held, You XiaoMo was completely floored, \u201cYour Black card\u2026 \u2026how did it turn into a Purple Card?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao told him, \u201cI used the thirty middle level demon beasts that I hunted the last time to exchange for it. I guess it was counted as an important contribution to the academy, so they gave me a Purple Card.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason why Ling Xiao went to hunt demon beasts was for this Purple card. He originally planned to sell all the demon beasts he hunted. But he realized, after distributing the points out, the final amount would not be enough to gather five thousand points. Furthermore, he did not want to go into the mountains to wantonly hunt demon beasts again \u2013 experiencing that sort of thing once was enough.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally realized why he was so concerned about points. The reason was because of this, but \u2026 \u2026 \u201cWhy did you fixate on getting a Purple Card?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s response was to ambiguously lift You XiaoMo\u2019s chin, breathe out on his lips, and reply, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d If he moved a little more, they would be locking lips. Fortunately, Ling Xiao still remembered that they were in a public place with numerous people.</p><br/><p>What do I think?</p><br/><p>Based on Ling Xiao\u2019s personality that was full of defects, he was definitely thinking of R-rated stuff.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt that besides that one reason, there was no other. He really understood Ling Xiao too well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

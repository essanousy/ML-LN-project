But that person had already walked out from the Forbidden zone before they could reply.</p><br/><p>His tall figure blocked half of the door of the Forbidden zone. He had a square face, but the combination of his overall facial features were not ugly. His features were extremely dignified and his eyes were not a pure black. Instead, it was brown in color upon closer inspection. His gaze carried a sense of vicissitudes accumulated by the years, however it contained a light pressure when directed at others.</p><br/><p>The two clansmen looked at each other in dismay and did not speak.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s gaze swiftly shifted to the chick. His gaze was extremely cold, \u201cThis is Ji NingYu, the grandson of the Great Elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>One clansman answered, \u201cYes, Fourth Elder. He is the Young Master of the Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>The status of the chick as the Young Master of the Valley had been confirmed for the most part, so all the Demon Phoenix Clan members addressed the chick as Young Master and they did not think there was anything wrong with it.</p><br/><p>The old man looked back at Ji NingYu once before he calmly told them, \u201cEven if he is the Young Master, no one is allowed to enter the Forbidden zone without the consent of the Valley Master and the Great Elder. Bring him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he turned and entered the Forbidden zone.</p><br/><p>The chick did not intend to leave the matter at that. He was already here. If he did to make another trip, he still had to lose the people who followed him all day long.</p><br/><p>Just as he was preparing to burst in forcefully, a pair of hands stretched out from behind him, grabbed him under his armpits and picked him up. A gentle voice that carried a hint of a smile drifted into his ears at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t be mischievous. If the Great Elder knows about this, you\u2019ll be punished by him again.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Ji Feng who had arrived. He was now equivalent to the nanny of the chick. Though Ji Feng had always been shaken off the moment he was distracted in the past, he knew that the chick would come to the Forbidden zone again. The Young Master was excellent in all aspects, it was just that he was too curious and loved to go where he was not allowed to.</p><br/><p>In the Forbidden zone, the old man walked along the passageway to the interior.</p><br/><p>The Forbidden zone of the Demon Phoenix Clan was not a damp and dark place like a dungeon. On the contrary, the interior of the Forbidden zone was beautifully furnished and whatever there was outside was also present here. Beautiful Night Pearls were everywhere, illuminating the Forbidden zone.</p><br/><p>The old man entered a gate, and what met the eyes was a scenery of exceptional charm. Airy pavilions and pagodas stood on the running water and a figure was sitting in a pavilion beside the structures. The running water flowed down from above, running along several corners of the pavilion to the pond below, looking vaguely like a prison.</p><br/><p>The old man went to the pond and looked at the person in the pavilion without saying a word.</p><br/><p>The two did not speak for quite a while until that person opened their eyes as their gaze leisurely landed on the old man. A beautiful voice akin to that of a singing oriole slowly drifted out from between her thin lips. \u201cFather, is there something weighing on your mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the old man\u2019s expression became obscure after hearing her words and he spoke after a long moment, \u201cIf that kind of matter had not occurred at that time, the Valley Master of the Demon Phoenix Clan would have been you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman in the pavilion suddenly revealed a smile that could bedazzle the mind, \u201cFather, it\u2019s been so many years. Are you still thinking about that matter? Your daughter had said long ago that her actions were voluntary and has nothing to do with anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s expression was still unhappy, \u201cYou would not have fallen to your current plight if it hadn\u2019t been for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, why are you so strongly attached to the past? Time will not turn back and I will never regret it.\u201d The woman sighed softly. She had always known about the knot in her father\u2019s heart, but she could not help him to undo it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t regret it?\u201d The old man suddenly sneered, \u201cSuXin, you may be able to deceive others, but you can\u2019t deceive me. Why haven\u2019t you asked about your child for so many years if you really don\u2019t regret it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji SuXin fell silent in an instant.</p><br/><p>The old man whispered, \u201cSuXin, you\u2019ve been in the Forbidden zone for decades and have never ventured out. You don\u2019t know anything that has been happening outside. Do you know how your child is doing now? I can tell you if you want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, let bygones be bygones. Your daughter just wants to be alone now.\u201d Ji SuXin\u2019s eyelashes lowered with a serene expression on her face.</p><br/><p>However, the old man did not intend to give up. For many years, he had hoped that his daughter would admit her mistake so that she could come out. However, not once had he been able to understand his daughter\u2019s thoughts. She said that she did not regret what happened, but he never heard her mention anything about that man and her child.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn recent years, your child has demonstrated extraordinary talents within the TongTian Continent. He successively made enemies of many great forces for the sake of one man, and has struggled on the edge of life and death. However, his talent is really outstanding. Some time ago, the TongTian Palace was destroyed in one go by the people he led. That long-established power has now hidden themselves, and he has become a person who can stand on equal footing with top powerhouses like You ZhenTian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the midst of the old man\u2019s mild-mannered narration, Ji SuXin\u2019s expression changed a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way, your child\u2019s name is Ling Xiao.\u201d The old man knew that she had never met the child again ever since he was born. Naturally, she did not know of the child\u2019s name, so he told her without further thought. Unexpectedly, her expression suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>Ji SuXin raised her head and her expression was somewhat chilly, \u201cFather, you\u2019re sure he\u2019s called Ling Xiao? And it\u2019s the Ling from Ling Yun Zhuang Shi?\u201d</p><br/><p>t/n: Ling Yun Zhuang Shi () means to have a strong resolution to reach the clouds or lofty aspirations. The Ling () \u2013 to rise high in this case \u2013 in this phrase has the same character as Ling Xiao ().</p><br/><p>\u201cYes it is. Almost everyone knows about it with his current fame.\u201d The old man did not know why her expression suddenly changed and also did not know what was wrong with the name. All he knew was that her daughter\u2019s heart that had been as calm as still water for so many years suddenly reacted to this name.</p><br/><p>Ji SuXin chuckled a few times, \u201cFather, I\u2019m tired. Please leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anger flashed through the old man\u2019s eyes, but eventually it was suppressed before he indignantly flicked his sleeves and left. From beginning to end, he could not understand why his daughter was so stubborn.</p><br/><p>She had always listened to him in the past, but everything changed since she met that man. For this reason, he had a lot of hatred for that man, and he did not like their child either.</p><br/><p>Ji SuXin\u2019s affair was a taboo in the Demon Phoenix Clan</p><br/><p>The chick had tried asking people around him, but they remained silent and even took the initiative to change the subject every time. So he only knew that the Boss\u2019s mother was probably imprisoned in the Forbidden zone and did not know anything about the rest.</p><br/><p>The chick was not furious after being taken back by Ji Feng.</p><br/><p>The Great Elder had once said that the most important requirement for a qualified leader was patience, and the thing he lacked the least in the past few years was patience.</p><br/><p>His chance soon came.</p><br/><p>It had been mentioned before that the Four Ancient Beast Clans were in the midst of a intense and violent war with the Black Spider.</p><br/><p>The Black Spider actually could not be considered as a new force that rose abruptly. Their strength gradually entered the public\u2019s eyes when they appeared. There were many Sacred Realm experts and dozens of Divine Realm powerhouses. The number of experts were so large that the Four Ancient Beast Clans all felt apprehensive.</p><br/><p>It was only after investigating that everyone knew that the place where the Black Spider was the most active was in Xi Jing. The mysterious force that Tian Dao had vaguely perceived that year was the Black Spider. However, they did not claim to be members of the Black Spider in those days, so no one linked them with the Black Spider at that time.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, there was a fierce struggle in the Western Territory.</p><br/><p>The Black Spider had constantly expanded its territory and was already encroaching on the interests of the Four Ancient Beast Clans. At present, the Demon Phoenix Clan also had to dispatch their experts to defend their territory in order to deal with the Black Spider, so there were not many powerhouses left in the Hundred Birds Valley. Even Ji SuXin\u2019s father was not present.</p><br/><p>The chick easily shook off the people that the Great Elder sent to accompany him. This time, he was smart enough not to make a move in person, instead he let Ji Feng step in to hinder those two.</p><br/><p>Although he was only a few years old, his IQ was not low. Ji Feng did not agree in the beginning, so he made some heart-stirring promises with Ji Feng, and finally managed to persuade him.</p><br/><p>In the glittering pavilion, Ji SuXin\u2019s posture remained unchanged.</p><br/><p>The chick stood outside the pavilion, expressionlessly staring at Ji SuXin whose lashes were lowered. Was this the Boss\u2019s mother?</p><br/><p>Ji SuXin was extremely beautiful. Her white and plain clothes made her look like a holy and pure fairy in a pavilion. Her five features were rather exquisite and alluring. At that time, she had even been praised as the most beautiful woman in the TongTian Continent. Everyone knew that the holy maiden of the Demon Phoenix Clan was elegant in appearance, but passionate in heart. Otherwise, such a situation would not have happened with Ling Xiao\u2019s father.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, Ji SuXin lifted her eyelids and looked at the chick who had remained silent. The chick had the appearance of the three-year-old baby, but his cultivation base was ridiculously high.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Ji NingYu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Instead of answering her, Ji Ningyu asked, \u201cAre you the holy maiden who mingled with a man from the Qilin Clan and gave birth to a son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji SuXin\u2019s expression changed slightly, but she neither admitted nor denied it.</p><br/><p>The chick laughed, \u201cI know the answer even if you don\u2019t say anything. Do you want to get out of here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji SuXin\u2019s lower lip slightly twitched up, \u201cYou want to let me out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a contract with your son\u2019s wife. May I consider letting you go to your son if you want to escape. Do you want to get out?\u201d The chick did not deliberately address them with deference. The members of the Demon Phoenix Clan were extremely proud, and did not permit themselves and their clansmen to be meek and subservient in front of others.</p><br/><p>Contrary to his expectations, Ji SuXin\u2019s smile suddenly turned into a mocking one.</p><br/><p>He suddenly heard Ji SuXin coldly reply while he was having misgivings, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. You can leave now!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

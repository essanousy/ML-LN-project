It was probably a mix of it being the first time Tang YuLin had entered the red card zone, and with his natural talent, Tang YuLin managed to breakthrough within two days.</p><br/><p>No wonder Tang YuLin\u2019s master was desperate to change his thoughts. With Tang YuLin\u2019s cultivation speed, it wouldn\u2019t be long before another prodigy appeared on the Hundred Man Rankings.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t distract Tang YuLin from his cultivation, closing the door behind him as he left. After leaving the stone room, You XiaoMo ran to meet up with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Today was the fourth day since the Trials ended, and also the day that the top five had to go to the thirty-first room in the red card zone. The meeting point was just outside the cultivation center, so he saw Ling Xiao and the others already standing there as soon as he came out.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked over and before he could speak, BaiLi TianYi, who stood five steps away from Ling Xiao, spoke up first.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs YuLin still inside cultivating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had always looked after Tang YuLin, You XiaoMo told him, out of the kindness of his heart, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s very eagerly cultivating right now. When I left, he was still on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi looked at him in disbelief. It wasn\u2019t that he doubted You XiaoMo\u2019s words, but because Tang YuLin was the kind of person who could sit there and stare at nothing if you didn\u2019t push him into cultivating.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grinned, saying, \u201cAnyways, you\u2019ll never have to worry about him procrastinating on cultivating anymore. In contrast, you might have to worry about him forgetting everything to cultivate.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi understood what he was implying, but no matter what, he couldn\u2019t think of how You XiaoMo had managed to change Tang YuLin\u2019s opinions.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo obviously didn\u2019t seem to want to continue, running to Ling Xiao after finishing that sentence.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at BaiLi TianYi before asking quietly, \u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed to himself, telling Ling Xiao everything, including Tang YuLin\u2019s backstory.</p><br/><p>After Ling Xiao heard, he said, \u201cTang YuLin doesn\u2019t seem like someone who has experienced those things.\u201d Usually, when people were struck down over and over like that, they would easily become despairing or walk the wrong path.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cIt might be because of his master.\u201d</p><br/><p>From what Tang YuLin had told him, he could tell that the other\u2019s master was a very optimistic and good person. Tang YuLin might\u2019ve been able to keep his forward looking attitude under his master\u2019s careful guidance.</p><br/><p>\u201cNever mind him,\u201d Ling Xiao suddenly said, \u201cI heard your master was back.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo perked up. He had wanted to talk about the Heaven Soul Scripture, but then remembered that there were many people around them and lowered his voice on purpose. \u201cWhen did he get back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cYesterday he came to look for you. After hearing that you were cultivating, he asked me to tell you to go to the Magic Herb garden tomorrow. He probably plans on handing you some training techniques.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded hurriedly. This day had finally come.</p><br/><p>After five minutes, Yan Fa finally came over.</p><br/><p>The thirty-first room of the red card zone was very important as it was to do with the Leyline core. That was why they had to be cautious.</p><br/><p>The room was in the very center of the Cultivation Center. That was something You XiaoMo had already known. However, he would\u2019ve never thought that a transport circle would be necessary to get inside. Since the room was completely closed off, if one didn\u2019t use the transport circle, you\u2019d be forced to break through the wall to get in. However, you\u2019d probably be found out before you even had a chance to try.</p><br/><p>Yan Fa had everyone walk into the array before he began to transport them.</p><br/><p>It barely took a second.</p><br/><p>All You XiaoMo knew was a flash of white light and then everyone appeared in a dimly lit sealed room. The room was simpler than a poor house with only four walls; there weren\u2019t even windows.</p><br/><p>Yan Fa turned to look at everyone and said, \u201cThis is the thirty-first room. Now, you all have two hours. After two hours is up, I will come and bring everyone out.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then he left.</p><br/><p>Apart from You XiaoMo and the others who were here for the first time, BaiLi TianYi and company had already been here last year. After Yan Fa finished speaking, they each found a dais to sit down at, not wasting a single moment to cultivate.</p><br/><p>Though there was only two hours, it was enough to compare to a over a month of cultivating in the red card zone. It could be seen from this how precious these places were.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun was pulled over to be with Yin Ge. The only reason Feng ChiYun had a chance to be here was because of Yin Ge, so he didn\u2019t complain.</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi was a little disheartened. It was a shame he hadn\u2019t been able to pull Tang YuLin over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pulled Ling Xiao over to two adjacent daises. No one talked. Two hours seemed rather long, but in reality it would pass in the blink of an eye, especially when cultivating.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had wanted to speak to Ling Xiao, but the room was extremely quiet. If he spoke it would seem abrupt.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao motioned for him to hurry up and cultivate and started to do so himself.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had no choice but to keep his words to himself, sitting cross legged on a dais. These daises were different from the other daises. There was no need for you to swipe your card first. Upon sitting down, you could already feel the immense energy restlessly flowing under you.</p><br/><p>The Leyline Core was different from spirit gems, not only just producing a large amount of spiritual energy. Like how spirit gems were the sublimation of spiritual water, the leyline core was the sublimation of spirit gems as well. However, the leyline core had something of a soul. It was like a machine that could still run without an engine.</p><br/><p>There was a legend about the leyline core. It was said that the leyline core was a cultivator\u2019s ticket to Divinity. With it, breaking through to the Divine level wasn\u2019t a fantasy any longer. That meant, consuming the leyline core guaranteed a breakthrough to the Divine level. In addition, the leyline core was also a sacred item to mages, as well. It\u2019s value was in that it could sublimate a mage\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>For example, if a mage\u2019s soul was purple and they consumed the leyline core, there was a chance above eighty percent of their soul becoming rainbow colored. This was an immense temptation.</p><br/><p>Though talent wasn\u2019t the only deciding factor for a mage\u2019s success, it did limit how far one could go. For example, for someone with a purple soul, if they couldn\u2019t upgrade it, they would forever be stuck a level ten mage. That meant the highest they could go was level ten. It would be impossible to progress further.</p><br/><p>Though DaoXin Academy didn\u2019t put so much of a focus on the souls of mages, those who could achieve higher states must have better souls. Even so, no one dared to try and steal DaoXin Academy\u2019s leyline core.</p><br/><p>This was because DaoXin Academy didn\u2019t just have one or two powerhouses at its side. Just the five elders would be enough to crush any challengers, never mind the Academy headmaster or the level ten mage Duan QiTian.</p><br/><p>The more powerhouses, the less chance of returning safely.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, You XiaoMo cleared his head of any unneeded thoughts and focused on cultivating. As he began to absorb the energy of the leyline core, he finally \u201csaw\u201d pools of green energy entering his body.</p><br/><p>This was the element of wood, the purest form of energy, representing life. It was the gentlest of the five elements, able to be put to use by anyone. No wonder people were unwilling to waste even a second in the Trials.</p><br/><p>With the help of the element of wood, there was practically a one hundred percent chance of breakthrough.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo became excited as he thought of this. It would be a shame if he didn\u2019t take the chance to absorb as much of this pure Wood Element energy as he could. With a thought, the white spiritual structure in his mind\u2019s eye began to move faster and faster as it absorbed the Wood Element energy.</p><br/><p>More and more energy creeped out of the white spiritual structure\u2019s surface and it was quickly absorbed by the green spiritual core. When the color on the surface became the deepest it could get, the spiritual core suddenly split. By the time it had knitted itself back together, the color had gone to a faint light blue.</p><br/><p>With that, You XiaoMo found that he had broken through and become a mid-grade level seven mage.</p><br/><p>Since he had good foundations, breakthroughs for him were like the flow of water.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t all. He realized that his Soul Force was approaching high grade level seven. It wasn\u2019t fast, but the change was tangible. It wasn\u2019t until a sound like booming thunder rose, as if exploding right beside his ear. You XiaoMo was startled harshly out of cultivation.</p><br/><p>Opening his eyes, he found that it wasn\u2019t just him who had been dragged out of cultivation like this. It was only when he saw Vice Academy Head Yan Fa that he realized two hours had passed. He realized that the aura of spiritual energy around everyone had changed slightly from before.</p><br/><p>Those who were already very strong wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve breakthrough in a mere two hours, but they would still have gained something from this. Their presence was much more intense and some even had obvious smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>After a moment, Yan Fa led everyone out.</p><br/><p>It was only until after they left the others, that You XiaoMo asked Ling Xiao, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao made a low hum in response, \u201cThere was too little time, so it had little effect. However, it won\u2019t be long before DaoXin Academy closes that room, if they don\u2019t want to let the leyline run dry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leyline core was also called the Elemental Essence, its element was wood. As they used it, they were slowly depleting it. DaoXin Academy having used it for so long, the Elemental Essence was starting to burnout. If they didn\u2019t let it recover, the entire leyline would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>However, even if they let the Elemental Essence recover, it would need a very long time to do so, unless they found another Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>This was the method You XiaoMo had asked about which could save a leyline from drying out.</p><br/><p>However, Elemental Essences were an extremely rare object, not something you could find just anywhere. If LongXiang continent had one, then it probably would\u2019ve long since been taken by someone else.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

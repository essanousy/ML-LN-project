The mage following her was talking to her, head bowed, but she never responded to him, walking past the two of them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo only heard one sentence from the mage.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cXinRui, temporary contracts can be cancelled. If Yin Ge really backs out, I\u2019ll cancel the contract between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked Ling Xiao, who was beside him, \u201cCan temporary contracts really be cancelled?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cIf both sides agree, and then pay five hundred points, then yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo mumbled to himself, \u201cNo wonder\u2026\u201d He had a feeling that An XinRui wasn\u2019t the type to give up so easily. Now it seemed that, as expected, she had ulterior motives.</p><br/><p>But five hundred points to cancel a contract? That was daylight robbery! After registering, the mentors made pairs make contracts there to prevent people from fishing in troubled waters*. Soon enough it came to An XinRui and the mage she was with. She looked very much unwilling and after the contract was complete, the male mage was smiling brightly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was suspicious; if Yin Ge really did speak up, would this mage truly be willing to cancel the contract?</p><br/><p>This was a small bet. You XiaoMo felt that he wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Leaving the registration, the two returned to their room.</p><br/><p>Now all they had to do was wait for the coming of the Trials.</p><br/><p>Before sleeping that night, You XiaoMo asked for the demon beast egg from Ling Xiao. When it was released, the demon beast egg didn\u2019t even get a chance to react before it was stuffed into the demon beast cage by You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you can run!\u201d You XiaoMo said triumphantly.</p><br/><p>The demon beast egg shifted a little, as if taking a look around at his current situation. Then, it fell still for a while before suddenly jumping and smashing itself against the bars of the cage.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo jumped, but quickly calmed down again. He reached inside and picked up the egg, looking it over, only releasing a sigh of breath when he found no cracks, before putting it down and saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to struggle anymore. This cage was made for level six demon beasts, you won\u2019t be able to break it with your current strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon beast egg ignored him, continuing to smash itself against the cage.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo watched on anxiously, hurriedly saying, \u201cDon\u2019t slam it anymore. If you crack your shell, your shit and piss will flow out too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The demon beast egg\u2019s movements suddenly paused.</p><br/><p>Though it quickly recovered, You XiaoMo still caught it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you keep slamming yourself against the bars. I\u2019ll just buy a higher level one and see if its your shell that\u2019ll break first or the cage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because the egg really was listening to him that it suddenly stopped its slamming. The round egg swayed inside the cage. Who knows what it was thinking?</p><br/><p>No matter, at least it had finally settled down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sighed, saying, \u201cFor the next few days, behave yourself and stay inside. I\u2019ll keep you in the pocket dimension. When I\u2019ll let you out depends on your behavior. If you agree, sway.\u201d</p><br/><p>The swaying movement of the egg immediately ceased.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You brat, do you really wait to go against me like that?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lightly stroked the top of the egg, quietly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t agree. Later on, I\u2019ll have Ling Xiao cook you. By the way, I think I might\u2019ve forgotten to tell you, but I actually enjoy eating egg a lot. In the past, I would have one each day. After coming here, I\u2019ve become rather busy and haven\u2019t had time\u2026\u201d Before he finished speaking, the egg began to sway, accepting its fate.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded in satisfaction before sending it into his pocket dimension with a wave of the hand, while ordering SheQiu and the others to keep an eye on that egg and make sure it reflected upon its actions.</p><br/><p>A few days later, You XiaoMo received a letter from the old man.</p><br/><p>The letter said that it\u2019ll be a while before he could come back, and told You XiaoMo to go and self-study in Ward A\u2019s Magic Herb Garden. When he comes back, he\u2019ll teach him a new method of cultivation.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was excited as he read this.</p><br/><p>The old man was finally going to pass the Heavenly Soul Scripture down to him; he had been waiting for this moment for a long time.</p><br/><p>The following day, You XiaoMo headed to the old man\u2019s Magic Herb Garden with Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The old man had a place in both Wards. The difference was in that the value of the two were different.</p><br/><p>The Magic Herb Garden was the soul and blood of the academy, with many highly valued magic herbs. And at the heart of it, stood the old man\u2019s other pill room. That was a place not even the elders and mentors of the academy were allowed into.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s pill room was massive, a combination of a study and a room for refining pills.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wandered around for a bit, finding several level seven magic pill recipes. Apart from that, there was even a drawer full of freshly refined mid-high grade pills, emitting a herbal scent.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao held his chin as he said, \u201cWhat do you think of taking this drawer of magic pills for ourselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sweatdropped. He knew Ling Xiao would say something like that.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t get to do as he wanted.</p><br/><p>Not just anyone could enter the old man\u2019s pill room. If anything went missing, they would be the biggest suspects for certain. Plus, the old man might\u2019ve said he could enter, but he never said he could take anything, so You XiaoMo didn\u2019t dare take a single thing.</p><br/><p>However, the pill room really was a good place to be. From now on he had another place to go.</p><br/><p>From that day on, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t return to the Cultivation Center. Sometimes he would go with You XiaoMo to sell magic pills, but most of the time he would accompany You XiaoMo as he went to cultivate. The place they went to most was the pill room, with Gravity Mountain a close second.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo noticed that after bumping into Teng ZiYe on the way to the Cultivation Center, he hadn\u2019t seen him again, until the start of the deep mountain Trials.</p><br/><p>Since the registration was over, the requirements for different placements in the Trials had been declared. The first five were, as expected, very demanding. Just the third place had to capture a demon beast called Divine Snow Wasps. What was even more absurd was that it had to be female too.</p><br/><p>Divine Snow Wasps were a high grade demon beast. They only appeared in snowy, icy places. There were definitely ones that were under level nine, but it wasn\u2019t possible that there would be no level nine and above. In addition, Divine Snow Wasps liked to live in groups, so the mission was even more dangerous.</p><br/><p>At the list of missions, many others were also looking at the top few missions. He could hear the sighs coming from around him. It seemed like each year\u2019s missions would get harder than the previous.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pulled on Ling Xiao\u2019s sleeve, quietly saying, \u201cWhich mission do you think we should take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s gaze fell on the first five. \u201cAny one is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly thought of an idea and excitedly asked, \u201cHey, do you think they\u2019ll give us the rewards for two placings if we complete two or more missions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him in disdain. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled awkwardly. \u201cOk then, just pretend I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cMemorize the first five. We\u2019ll just complete whichever we find first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he left, You XiaoMo saw An XinRui. In the end, she didn\u2019t get what she wanted. However, Yin Ge didn\u2019t contract with any female mage. What was rather surprising was that his partner was Feng ChiYun.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing of this, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t believe his ears. Since when had Feng ChiYun gotten involved with Yin Ge? It had only been a month since they last saw each other.</p><br/><p>On the day of the competition, all the participants gathered in the plaza.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had wanted to find Feng ChiYun to ask him about Yin Ge, but the other had already left.</p><br/><p>When he arrived at the plaza, it took him awhile to find the other.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun only noticed You XiaoMo waving when he turned his head. He looked at Yin Ge, who\u2019s cold aura seemed to be warning everyone to not come within a thousand miles of him, and hesitated before saying quietly, \u201cSorry, my friend wants to speak to me. I\u2019m gonna leave for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Ge glanced at him, responding noncommittally.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun was used to it, turning and walking away.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could barely wait, immediately asking when he saw the other approaching, \u201cFeng ChiYun, what relationship do you have with Yin Ge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun felt that what he asked seemed a little weird and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have any sort of relationship with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cLiar, if you guys didn\u2019t have any sort of relationship, why would he choose you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun placed a hand to his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s a long story. Two days ago, I went to the testing area, but when I left, I bumped into Yin Ge and a female mage was bothering him. When I passed by them, Yin Ge suddenly grabbed me and said he wanted to contract with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wondered aloud, \u201cAnd then you really contracted with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun was a little embarrassed. \u201cActually, there\u2019s a little more to it. Yin Ge had rejected that female mage multiple times, but she was unwilling to give up, so Yin Ge had me cooperate with him. At the time, I thought I was just gonna put on an act to help him out of a pickle, so I followed him to the registration point and contracted him in front of that female mage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then he refused to cancel the contract, right?\u201d You XiaoMo asked, lips twitching.</p><br/><p>Feng ChiYun replied helplessly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. No matter what I said, he refused to cancel our contract after that, saying that if he did, then the female mage would come and bother him again.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said sympathetically, \u201cYou have my condolences.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Feng ChiYun\u2019s lips twitched.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

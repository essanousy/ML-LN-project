However, his strength was clearly above Cheng XiangRong\u2019s. Back in the XiaoYao Institution, he had concealed his true strength.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong might have potential, but right now, he was only grade one, while Yan Hui was grade two. Luckily, Cheng XiangRong wasn\u2019t a normal mage. As the son of MoQi XiYuan, he had plenty of tricks up his sleeves. With that, the two were at a deadlock.</p><br/><p>However, Cheng XiangRong\u2019s subordinate weren\u2019t having such a good time. It was exceptionally tiring to fight one against two.</p><br/><p>The guard watched as his opponent\u2019s sword descending on him, filled with resentment. If he died here, what would become of his master?</p><br/><p>That was when the unexpected happened. A stone flew out from who knows where and struck the other\u2019s temple. The latter screamed, sent flying out almost twenty meters. His face was covered in blood; he didn\u2019t get up again.</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked at his scream.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui immediately pulled away from Cheng XiangRong, looking around warily. His heart stuttered, had they been ambushed?</p><br/><p>However, when he saw Cheng XiangRong\u2019s equally as confused expression, he knew that the attacker probably wasn\u2019t from the ShuiXi Tribe. Just as this thought flashed through his mind, the other person he had brought was also attacked.</p><br/><p>Another small rock flew out from the mist, striking the unprepared man in the chest and falling him. It was no light injury, if the blood leaking from his mouth was anything to go by.</p><br/><p>With two injured and their opponent hidden from them, Yan Hui didn\u2019t have the will to continue this fight anymore. He didn\u2019t like situations that were out of his control like this. He gritted his teeth and fled, leaving the two others behind.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong\u2019s guard didn\u2019t hesitate to charge over and end the two\u2019s lives.</p><br/><p>The GuMa Tribe had killed so many of his comrades. Killing two was evening the score by two. Mercy was something unnecessary in this way of life.</p><br/><p>Seeing the actions of his guard, Cheng XiangRong sighed and shook his head, but didn\u2019t stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know which master it was that had given us a hand just now?\u201d Cheng XiangRong clasped his hands, bowing in the direction the second rock had come from. If this person saved them, then he believed that they at least wouldn\u2019t be their enemies.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked out of the mist, a smile on his face and said with a hint of delight at their reunion, \u201cUncle, it\u2019s been a while; your aura has really changed, I\u2019m surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>A familiar voice accompanying a familiar figure, the topic of his and Yan Hui\u2019s discussion not long ago was now standing right in front of him, alive and well. This coincidence was unbelievable, and he didn\u2019t know how to react.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao, XiaoMo\u2026 You, you\u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t until You XiaoMo walked up to him that Cheng XiangRong finally snapped out of his stupor. A light flush appeared on his cheeks and his words tripped over each other in a rush to express his excitement.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo chuckled at this. He hadn\u2019t changed at all. \u201cUncle, slow down, don\u2019t rush. I\u2019m right here; it\u2019s not like I\u2019ll run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to ignore his presence, Cheng XiangRong glanced at Ling Xiao, who had come out of the mist behind You XiaoMo. Then he looked back to You XiaoMo, saying with a hint of embarrassment, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to hide this from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused a for a moment before realizing what the other was talking about and replied casually, \u201cI don\u2019t mind. If it were me, I\u2019d do the same. You don\u2019t need to apologize. But, how come you\u2019re here. I heard that the TongTian Palace is holding prelims; are you not participating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrap, I almost forgot about that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until You XiaoMo reminded him of this that Cheng XiangRong remembered what he was here to do, his expression hardening.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong didn\u2019t tell him immediately, saying that he\u2019d tell him on the way, then they hurried towards their destination, opposite to the way You XiaoMo had come from and deeper into the DongYu. It was only when Cheng XiangRong explained that they got wind of that an incident had occurred over here at DongYu.</p><br/><p>The Legendary Immortal\u2019s Caves really did exist, but it didn\u2019t refer to the White Tiger\u2019s palace. Very few people knew of the existence of the palace under DongYu. What they were talking about was the Immortal\u2019s Caves that belonged to a powerful, ancient cultivator, and not just one, but a whole lot of powerful cultivators.</p><br/><p>In ancient times, DongZhou was a paradise to mages and practitioners.</p><br/><p>Legend has it that there was a Peach Blossom Spring that once existed in DongYu.</p><br/><p>However, after the war begun, the powerhouses of the Peach Blossom Spring didn\u2019t want the war to affect their home, and thus a few of them used divine power to separate the Peach Blossom Spring from DongYu, forming an isolated dimension, though the entrance was still in DongYu.</p><br/><p>The Peach Blossom Spring had opened up around a month after You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had been transported to the DaTong Ocean. After they left, more and more powerful cultivators appeared in DongYu, not just the three great tribes, but also the Cang Alliance, Vermillion Blood Clan and other powers. By now, two months had passed.</p><br/><p>Though it had been two months, the incident hadn\u2019t come to a close.</p><br/><p>After all, the Peach Blossom Spring was separated from this dimension by some of the strongest cultivators of the ancient times. Their cultivation base wasn\u2019t something that modern cultivators could match up to and the seals they had placed were immensely powerful, many of them having been forgot in time.</p><br/><p>However, they then realized that the seals of the Peach Blossom Spring would weaken for a period of time. A few Sacred level practitioners would be able to unseal it, working together.</p><br/><p>However, it would only be open for half a year. After half a year, the seals would strengthen again.</p><br/><p>By then, the Peach Blossom Spring\u2019s seals would automatically kick out everyone inside, no matter who.</p><br/><p>Unless, of course, you had the power to go against the seals, but that was impossible, because those seals were layered, extremely complex. It was better to spend your time finding treasures than researching those seals.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo listened, wide eyed and shocked. Something so significant had occurred while they were away. If it wasn\u2019t for Ling Xiao deciding to leave early, they\u2019d probably have stayed another few months on the island. By then, they\u2019d have missed this boon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we came back.\u201d You XiaoMo pulled on Ling Xiao\u2019s sleeve, excited.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded, \u201cYes, it\u2019s good that we didn\u2019t listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo decided to not argue with him over this. Life was still great and there were so many treasures just waiting to be uncovered. He should think to the future.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong smiled. He had always found their interactions to be rather unique.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, uncle, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m confused about.\u201d You XiaoMo, seeing his expression when he turned his head, felt a little embarrassed and hurriedly changed the topic. \u201cThese aren\u2019t peaceful times, and many of these powers are enemies. Will they really be willing to cooperate?\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, if there weren\u2019t any sacred level powerhouses there to oversee things, other powers might be able to take advantage of that. The risks seemed high, unless they were willing to sit down and discuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know about this, but,\u201d Cheng XiangRong began to explain, \u201cI heard from my dad that the Peach Blossom Spring had many Immortal\u2019s Caves belonging to immensely powerful cultivators, especially rainbow grade mages. Their Immortal\u2019s Caves were more valuable than practitioners\u2019. Legend has it that those Immortal\u2019s Caves had rainbow grade five and six pills in them. I haven\u2019t heard about any grade seven ones, but they might exist, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not all. There was a serious lack of materials for rainbow grade five and six pills. Some mages only had that cultivation base, but no transcendent level magic herbs. In addition, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily succeed the first time when refining pills.</p><br/><p>After being sealed away for all these years, there was sure to be an abundance of magic herbs in the Peach Blossom Spring. It was clear what sort of temptation this would be for mages.</p><br/><p>In the face of such a temptation, it wasn\u2019t impossible for the great powers to put down their grudges for the time being.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong said, \u201cThere\u2019s another benefit. The spiritual energy in the Peach Blossom Spring is very dense, and good for cultivation. Some people get stuck, unable to advance for years on end, but often they manage to achieve breakthrough after going inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up further.</p><br/><p>Was he not in the state of wanting to advance but being unable to? If the Peach Blossom Spring really was that amazing, then he\u2019d have to find a way in no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already been two months, can we still go inside?\u201d You XiaoMo asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn theory, no,\u201d Cheng XiangRong said with a frown. \u201cThat entrance is currently being guarded heavily. I can only go in because of my father, but they said that I can only bring one other. They probably won\u2019t agree to any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>That definitely wouldn\u2019t do. He had to be with Ling Xiao. Thinking of this, You XiaoMo looked to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t disappoint him, saying tyrannically, \u201cThat\u2019s not up to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately grinned.</p><br/><p>Cheng XiangRong shook his head with a laugh. He knew that it\u2019d end up this way; he\u2019d been expecting it. It would be weirder if one of them agreed to leave the other.</p><br/><p>Then, the four continued to hurry to their destination.</p><br/><p>When they arrived, they could see plenty of people guarding the entrance even from afar. Apart from the people of the great powers, there were a few explorers of DongYu. It was just that they didn\u2019t have the power, in society or in combat, so they could only watch from outside. Even so, there were quite a few spectators.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao arrived separately from Cheng XiangRong and his guard. After all, Cheng XiangRong was representing the ShuiXi Tribe. If those people thought that they were brought here by the ShuiXi Tribe to cause trouble, then it wouldn\u2019t be good for Cheng XiangRong or his tribe. Plus, the transport array was random. No one could be certain that they would arrive together.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

May the gods be with me, he prayed. Let the name on the paper be his, it must be. He promised he would not despise the name You XiaoHa anymore in future.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fella is going overboard with the mystery and suspense.\u201d TianXin also wanted to know who Zhu Hong picked but after he got the slip of paper, his actions became very slow as if he intended to create suspense for everyone and make them hungry for more.</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong didn\u2019t look at the name on the paper slip. Instead, after he was satisfied with having everyone\u2019s eyes on him, he took his time to pass the paper slip to the referee. He really didn\u2019t believe his luck was so bad that he would draw a name with less than ten percent chance of being chosen.</p><br/><p>The referee calmly received the paper slip and flipped it over to the back. His eyes shifted to the other corner of the slip with the name written on it. When he saw the name on it, his body suddenly shook slightly and an odd expression formed on his face.</p><br/><p>This slight movement was immediately picked up by the crowd and soon, the area where the spectators sat started to buzz with excited discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, what is it, what does the referee\u2019s expression mean? So did he get picked or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a hateful bunch of people. They only know how to create suspense and make us hungry for more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, if he didn\u2019t do that how can he show this historic moment of tension. From what I see, it\u2019s highly likely that he didn\u2019t get picked. The referee always likes to do things to mislead others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong also became slightly nervous from the referee\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d He asked.</p><br/><p>The referee didn\u2019t say a thing but he took out a mini jade plate.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, the crowd immediately shifted their attention to the screen on the wall and saw a name slowly appearing behind Zhu Hong\u2019s name. You XiaoHa!</p><br/><p>The crowd became silent\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Fuck, he really got chosen.\u201d Tian Xin excited voice broke the silence. She was even more excited than You XiaoMo himself. Even the swear words came out.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing covered his face in disgrace. This brat was really crazy.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was so thrilled that he grabbed Ling Xiao\u2019s arm tightly. He was too happy to even speak and his hands trembled non-stop. The gods were actually standing on his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be to excited. This outcome is normal.\u201d Ling Xiao held his wrist. Perhaps he was the calmest of his them all. Even Jiu Ye\u2019s cool expression cracked slightly. Clearly no one thought You XiaoMo\u2019s luck was that good.</p><br/><p>On the side, An Qiao spat on the floor. What a lucky bastard he was! Less than one out of ten chance of getting his name drawn and yet he got it! How infuriating!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d Zhu Hong, who had spent a lot of time and effort to prevent this, could hardly accept this fact. The shock on his face couldn\u2019t be wiped off his face easily. He still hadn\u2019t come around to the fact. He specially found ten people and even paid a small price for them and the outcome was this!? Didn\u2019t it just mean that whatever he did was for nothing?!</p><br/><p>Faced with Zhu Hong\u2019s anger, the referee calmly handed him the paper slip in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe it, you can take a look at the result you personally picked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong didn\u2019t receive the slip of paper but he saw the name on the end of the slip. It was indeed You XiaoHa\u2019s name. Blood started to rush to his eyes.</p><br/><p>Everyone thought that he was doing this for the Clean sweep victory but he wasn\u2019t. The real reason behind it all was that he had an agreement with Ran Yu from the forty-third floor. If he won all six challenges, Ran Yu promised to do Dual Cultivation with him. In order to have Ran Yu, he was willing to go to any lengths to win. However, he never expected You XiaoMo to suddenly pop up. Furthermore, he was also one of the strongest students that XiaoYao Academy admitted this year.</p><br/><p>Before You XiaoMo even challenged him, he already did his research on them. What he concluded was that there were three high level mages who had multi-coloured souls among the new students. If he had to compete with them, they didn\u2019t stand a chance winning. As for the few strong ones, the odds of winning were slim. So to prevent that irreversible situation from happening, he thought of a plan.</p><br/><p>His actions did seem to violate the rules of the Academy but even if someone were to investigate it, they wouldn\u2019t find anything.</p><br/><p>The nine out of ten chance of not selecting You XiaoMo actually lost to that one-tenth.</p><br/><p>Any normal person would find this hard to accept.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo happily walked up the ring and stood in front of Zhu Hong. Zhu Hong knew he shouldn\u2019t take his anger out on his opponent but he couldn\u2019t help it. The way he looked at him was as if he was facing his mortal enemy. He glared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m You XiaoHa, please take care of me and do give me advice.\u201d You XiaoMo said lightheartedly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong was on the verge of vomiting blood. Give him advice! What did he have to teach? It was clear he was bound to lose this match, he might as well concede defeat now. Then again, that would be too shameful. If Ran Yu knew about that\u2026</p><br/><p>The referee standing at the side of the ring raised his hand an announced, \u201cBegin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong opened his mouth to speak but an overwhelming surge of soul force swept towards him. Directly in the path of the soul power, he bore the brunt of the attack. He felt as if his body was crushed by unmovable mountains and it was in that moment Zhu Hong truly felt the gap between You XiaoMo and himself. It was a gap that could not be compensated by any means.</p><br/><p>The laughter lines on the youth\u2019s slightly childlike face faded, replaced with a stern look. His standing posture slowly went into an attacking stance.</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong subconsciously stepped back.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he suddenly heard a mocking laughter.</p><br/><p>The familiar voice slightly surprised Zhu Hong. He looked towards the direction of the sound and saw a familiar face. He opened his mouth but he couldn\u2019t say Ran Yu\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>Standing among the spectator lots, Ran Yu looked down at him. The slightly downcast eyes nicely hid the disdain and contempt in them. The people beside him might not have noticed but Zhu Hong clearly saw it.</p><br/><p>Why?</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong only had this question in mind.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his brows in astonishment. Following his line of sight, he saw a splendid scene. It was a man who could be found with one look despite standing in a crowd. He clearly was a man but he had features that were more bewitching than MaoQiu\u2019s flirtatious countenance. If he had to use one word to describe him, that would be a vixen.</p><br/><p>At the moment, that vixen was looking at Zhu Hong condescendingly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo reined in his aura and looked at Zhu Hong who seemed to have come undone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDage, do you still want to fight?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him and it was obvious he wanted to give up already.</p><br/><p>Remaining silent for three seconds, Zhu Hong suddenly raised his head and stared at him with bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just after he finished saying that, his aura had an outburst and he shot towards You XiaoMo like an arrow that just left the bow. His aura did indeed gave people a scare.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought he was prepared to give up. Never did he expect him to attack so suddenly. While he might have been caught off guard, he easily grasped Zhu Hong\u2019s attack pattern. Zhu Hong was only charging towards him with brute force. You XiaoMo immediately erected a soul barrier. Want to knock into something? Fine, he\u2019d let him knock into something.</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong immediately shifted his body. He went around the soul barrier and tried to attack You XiaoMo but he just casually flicked his Resonance Finger. His soul power cut through the air and flew towards Zhu Hong like glowing silver needles. Zhu Hong didn\u2019t dodge it in time and got hit on the shoulder. Dull pain punishingly assaulted his heart.</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong kneeled down with one knee on the ground and cradled his injured shoulder. He then stood up immediately and the soul power within him exploded once again. He then continued to charge at You XiaoMo like a man on a suicide mission.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his eyebrows in surprise. This guy couldn\u2019t be\u2026</p><br/><p>Viewing the competition from the spectator seats was a whole other show altogether. Zhu Hong\u2019s perseverance could be seen. Time and time again, he tried to move the mountain that was You XiaoMo but each time his efforts were in vain. The one who ended up all battered and bloody was still himself.</p><br/><p>The spectators near the ring watched the scene play out silently.</p><br/><p>Many originally wanted to see Zhu Hong\u2019s pathetic state after he got defeated but now, they didn\u2019t know how to react. Both him and the spectators knew full well that he couldn\u2019t win, but he still continued. Either he\u2019s foolish or too persistent!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong\u2019s body was flung into the air and he landed heavily on the ground. A few seconds later, he seemed like he still wanted to get up and fight, just like a cockroach that could never be killed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked forward and shouted at him with furrowed brows, \u201cHey, there\u2019s tons of guys in the world. You don\u2019t have to be so hung up on one. It may not necessarily be your loss if he doesn\u2019t like you back. You don\u2019t have to do this yourself and make yourself feel unworthy. You may not feel bothered but I\u2019m getting annoyed right now with this shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kneeling with one knee on the ground, Zhu Hong spat out a mouthful of blood and turned his head back in Ran Yu\u2019s direction to take a look. That someone wasn\u2019t there anymore and he didn\u2019t even know when he had left.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look anymore. He left much earlier on when you charged towards me. How about this, you admit defeat now. Then I wouldn\u2019t have to kick you off the ring.\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong was stunned for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cReferee, he admitted defeat.\u201d You XiaoMo immediately told the referee.</p><br/><p>The referee was like, Do you think I\u2019m dead?</p><br/><p>Zhu Hong wiped the blood off the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand and agreed, \u201cYes, you\u2019re right, I concede defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The referee had no words for them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the referee with all smiles on his face.</p><br/><p>The referee then took a deep breath and declared You XiaoHa the winner.</p><br/><p>And that, was how all the drama came to an end.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, his biggest secret is already laid out in front of Ling Xiao. It doesn\u2019t matter whether he tells him or not so he might as well tell him everything from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>Actually, the process is not at all complicated since he himself doesn\u2019t know how the blue teardrop appeared on his chest. He\u2019s even more clueless on the magical nature of the lake water. So he finishes the explanation in just a few words. After speaking, You XiaoMo secretly observes Ling Xiao\u2019s face. <i>Wuh</i>, no change at all \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean that blue teardrop appeared when you were taking a bath? Then it didn\u2019t appear when you were taking a bath before?\u201d</p><br/><p>The great Ling Xiao is not so easily fooled. Right away he zeroes in on You XiaoMo\u2019s weak point. This question, even he himself doesn\u2019t know the answer. Actually, You XiaoMo himself is not sure if the blue teardrop on his chest appeared when he was taking a bath, because at that time, he had just come to this world, so everything is in a blur. After all, it\u2019s not as if he would have immediately taken off his clothes for no particular reason to see if had any birthmarks or such things on his chest. So there are two possibilities. The first is that the blue teardrop already existed on the original You XiaoMo before he died. The second is that it only appeared after he transported over.</p><br/><p>But, the transportation of his soul is You XiaoMo\u2019s biggest secret. He can let Ling Xiao know about the blue teardrop but this he can\u2019t tell. The reason why is because he and Ling Xiao have not reached the level of closeness for him to share such an important secret with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also don\u2019t know what the deal is. I just know that it suddenly appeared that day. It may not have anything to do with taking a bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo has a certain characteristic. If he doesn\u2019t want to say something, even if you beat him to death, he still wouldn\u2019t say it. He also won\u2019t say it clearly to avoid selling himself out, so he would frequently give ambiguous alternatives. Once you get to know him more, you would discover this habit.</p><br/><p>But Ling Xiao has not known him for long. He also believes that You XiaoMo wouldn\u2019t dare to lie to him so he believes his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrows his eyes and beckons him with his finger.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitates for a moment before walking apprehensively over to him. Because he feels guilty, he doesn\u2019t dare to look directly at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao simply orders him when he comes up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Ah</i>? Take off my clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo reflexively grips the front of his collar, looking at Ling Xiao in terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, do you not understand what I\u2019m saying or do you want me to help you take it off <i>ng</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao thinks that he is playing dumb, his tone a little displeased. It doesn\u2019t cross his mind that there would a problem between males.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shivers and considers between he himself taking it off or letting Ling Xiao help him take it off. He finally chooses the former. The clothes on his body is still one of the sets he had before. Very simple and of ordinary material. Because the weather is not cold, he doesn\u2019t have much on. No matter how much he dawdles, it still doesn\u2019t take much time before he takes off his shirt. The small and thin body is clear and fair. Washed by the magic water, it becomes even more sparkling and translucent. His flesh is smooth and glistening. Even more smooth and tender than a newborn baby. Maybe because he feels a little embarrassed, a pink flush starts to spread across You XiaoMo\u2019s upper body. Everything above his neck had turned bright red a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t notice his awkwardness. He is completely absorbed by the blue teardrop on his chest. The radiance of the blue teardrop is even more brilliant than what You XiaoMo observed before, extremely fascinating. If you stare directly at it, it would seem as if you have entered a dreamlike fantasy world. But this does not apply to Ling Xiao. After staring at it for quite a while, there is still no change in his expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, is there anything wrong with this teardrop?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks with a red face.</p><br/><p>Letting a man stare at one\u2019s chest, even though both sides don\u2019t have any particular intentions, it would still make one feel uncomfortable, especially for the thin-skinned You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raises his head and glances at him. His ambiguous gaze roams over his fair and clear body. He then says lightly: \u201cIt\u2019s a very peculiar dimension. Someone must have left it intentionally on your body, only to be opened when the proper time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho can it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo exclaims in astonishment.</p><br/><p>If the person had evil intentions, wouldn\u2019t this teardrop be a pre-determined time-bomb?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter who it is, for that person to put such a valuable thing inside your body, it wouldn\u2019t make sense if it\u2019s not someone close to you. There are benefits but there are also corresponding dangers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao seems to know immediately what he is thinking of.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the dangers?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frowns with a sad face. He knows that there is no such thing as a free lunch in this world.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao leans over to him, smiling slightly: \u201cThink about it yourself. If people find out that you have such an unfair advantage, not only can it be used to grow magic herbs, it can also expedite their growth, when that happens, how many of them will go crazy over it? Even for the number one large sect TianXin sect, they would probably take it away forcibly for themselves and kill you off to silence you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The last part was said extremely sweetly. You XiaoMo can actually feel an invisible hand squeezing his neck.</p><br/><p>He cries out in dismay: \u201cThen what should I do <i>ah</i>? Elder brother Ling, <b>*wu wu*</b>, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao snorts <b>*pu chi*</b>, and roars in laughter while looking up to the sky.</p><br/><p><b>Notes:</b>count by fives and tens \u2013 systematically and in full detail</p><br/>\n</div>"}

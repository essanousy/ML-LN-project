Although the mountain peak was low, it allowed one to have a clear view of all the tall and steep peaks of the surrounding mountains. As long as you weren\u2019t a naturally gloomy guy, staying on the Amaranthine mountain would basically keep you in a good mood every day.</p><br/><p>After the banquet event ended, Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo had chosen to stay whereas Yin Ge and Zhan YuXuan left the Amaranthine mountains on the second day. As they had Yin Ge\u2019s father\u2019s title, the Nine Headed Serpent King, as a cover, almost no one suspected them.</p><br/><p>After ending the conversation with Wei Bai on that day, Wei Bai felt ill the next day so they didn\u2019t get to see him at all.</p><br/><p>In his boredom, You XiaoMo finally remembered the person in white that Ling Xiao had kept in his dimension. Just as he was about to enter the dimension, XiongXiao came over to look for him.</p><br/><p>XiongXiao was the only person who knew that they had commissioned him to check up on the Vermillion Blood Clan before. Even though he didn\u2019t know who the missing disciple of the Vermillion Blood Clan was, it wasn\u2019t difficult to guess with his intellect, but he might not have completely and thoroughly understood the situation that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was anxious at his arrival.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao held his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? If he dares to threaten us, then we\u2019ll kill him. At most we\u2019ll just flee.\u201d Ling Xiao said casually in a way that seemed to play down the situation at hand.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had a face full of black lines. He thought he was going to say something comforting but his words ended up freaking him out even more.</p><br/><p>XiongXiao walked in from outside. When he saw them, he gave them a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Ling, fellow XiaoHa. Please forgive me, I wasn\u2019t able to talk to you during the banquet as I was busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly became depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you just call me Fellow You, don\u2019t call me XiaoHa.\u201d He said unhappily.</p><br/><p>XiongXiao was taken aback for a moment before he guffawed, \u201cI think your name sounds nice. The Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s main family\u2019s surname is also You. If I call you like that it will sound too general.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t find the words to rebut him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201d Ling Xiao walked to the side of the table and poured himself a cup of tea. The tea leaves belonged to the Cang Alliance whereas the water was the spiritual water from You XiaoMo\u2019s dimension. Speaking of which, he quite liked drinking tea.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frequently found this preference of his abnormal. This was because for someone who had lived abnormally and treated that as the normal way of living, suddenly doing something that a normal person would do one day was really abnormal. Oh alright, he\u2019d admit that it was because Ling Xiao was using his spiritual water to brew his tea that made him really resentful.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster told me to bring you guys out if you want to explore Amaranthine mountain.\u201d XiongXiao immediately replied after he heard Ling Xiao\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201dLing Xiao gave him a look.</p><br/><p>XiongXiao suddenly lowered his voice and spoke with a serious expression, \u201cAbout the thing you guys told me to investigate on regarding the Vermillion Blood Clan, although I don\u2019t know the reason, you can be rest assured that the investigation was done by me. No one else but me knows about it. I, XiongXiao, can swear that I will definitely not reveal a single thing about the both of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked towards Ling Xiao. He didn\u2019t expect XiongXiao to make it clear.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised the corners of his lips and said, \u201cXiong-xiong you do not have to swear, I believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>t/n:Xiong in XiongXiao mean Bear, and -xiong means fellow. Both Xiong if pronounce fast sounds like a cutesy way of calling a person. Boss is taking revenge for momo lolol.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but let out a sound just as Ling Xiao finished speaking.</p><br/><p>XiongXiao seemed to know what he was laughing about as he had an awkward look on his face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo held back his laughter and waved his hand, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, just call me XiongXiao from now on. As for Xiong-xiong, let\u2019s just not use it.\u201d XiongXiao coughed once before saying.</p><br/><p>After XiongXiao left, Ling Xiao knocked You XiaoMo on the head and clucked his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly realise you\u2019re an expert at ruining the mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201d You XiaoMo immediately replied smugly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is in a derogatory sense.\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll take it as it was said in a commendatory sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the peaceful and remote dimension, a person dressed in white sat quietly beside a lake. It was an ordinary lake. The water was so clear one could see the bottom of the lake and count how many pebbles were in there.</p><br/><p>The person in white had his dark eyelashes lowered, the expression on his face was calm like the surface of the lake. Even if he knew that he was taken away by a stranger, his composure was still as calm as ever. There wasn\u2019t a hint of change. It was like if the sky were to fall, it would crush the tall ones first and not him.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo saw the back of the person in white, his expression faltered for a moment.</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have seen this man before, but why did he have the impression that he might have seen him somewhere before?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao came over. Speaking of how he managed to guess that You ZhenTian would bring Feng ChiYun along, things wouldn\u2019t have proceeded so smoothly if not for this person in white.</p><br/><p>The person in white didn\u2019t seem to have noticed their arrival as his head continued to stay lowered, as if he was staring at the surface of the lake with full concentration.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked behind him. As he didn\u2019t know how powerful he was, after all he was a special person locked on the tenth floor, he didn\u2019t dare to go too close to him. He thought for a while before he said, \u201cSenior, are you also from the Vermillion Blood Clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>One second, two seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>One minute, two minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waited patiently for three minutes and in the end, the person in white didn\u2019t give him any response at all. Out of curiosity, You XiaoMo walked to his side and squatted down. He lowered his head to take a look and his jaw almost shattered as it fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ran back to Ling Xiao\u2019s side and said in amazement, \u201cH-h-he\u2019s actually sleeping. He\u2019s already in the hands of a stranger, isn\u2019t he worried about his personal safety? He can actually sleep through this and do it so seriously, I even thought he was meditating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Ling Xiao spared him a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He forgot that before him was also a person who equally self-centred. If the two of them swapped positions, he reckoned that Ling Xiao would be even worse.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a yawn alarmed them. The person in white was finally awake. Seeming to have noticed their presence, he turned his head around.</p><br/><p>For an instant, You XiaoMo thought he saw himself.</p><br/><p>The person in white looked too much alike, it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say they were made from the same mould except for their presence. You XiaoMo had a likable face and was full of youthful energy, whereas the man in white was more steady and reserved.</p><br/><p>No one would believe that the person in white and him weren\u2019t related by blood.</p><br/><p>Seeing as he was staring at him blankly, the person in white couldn\u2019t help but touch his face and laugh softly, \u201cHey kiddo, even if I\u2019m handsome you can\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo seemed to have been frightened as he took a huge step back. He turned around and looked at Ling Xiao in shock and pointed at the person in white with trembling fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-h-he\u2026\u201d He stuttered with an expression that begged for comforting.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust resign to fate.\u201d Ling Xiao grabbed his finger.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head vigorously, \u201cNo, no, I already have you. I can\u2019t handle one more person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao squeezed his cheeks and narrowed his eyes dangerously, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hissed in pain.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the person in white who had been neglected by them spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fella, two-timing isn\u2019t right. Furthermore, I don\u2019t like men, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business whether you like men or not!\u201d You XiaoMo slapped Ling Xiao\u2019s hand away. He was fuming from embarrassment. They made him sound like like he wanted to have 3P.</p><br/><p>t/n: 3P = threesome.</p><br/><p>The person in white choked. What a bad temper this little fella had.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s your name?\u201d This was the first time You XiaoMo urgently wanted to know the relationship between himself and the person in white. They better not be father and son, or else he would have the urge to kill and destroy the evidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fella, I\u2019m not called Hey.\u201d The person in white muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I asked what your name is.\u201d You XiaoMo replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m You Xu.\u201d The person in white answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you locked in the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s forbidden area?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I did something wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat wrong did you do?\u201d You XiaoMo decided to get to the bottom of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh, can I not say it?\u201d The look in his eyes started to become evasive, a clear indicator that he was trying to hide something he was guilty of.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up. He knew something was up so he said, \u201cNo\u201d.</p><br/><p>The person in white started to hem and haw, \u201cBecause\u2026because I flirted with elder brother\u2019s wife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Five seconds later, You XiaoMo ran back to Ling Xiao\u2019s side with a smug look on his face and he laughed loudly, \u201cYou see, I told you this guy definitely wasn\u2019t my father. The truth is out now.\u201d How could his dad possibly do something as boorish as flirting with his sister-in-law.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao waited till he was done laughing before continuing the conversation they were having previously, \u201cWhat is your relationship with You ZhenTian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my big brother.\u201d The person in white said somewhat guiltily.</p><br/><p>That old face of You ZhenTian instantly flashed across You XiaoMo\u2019s mind. He was already so old, so his wife should probably be very old too. He sucked in a sharp breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to have this sort of preference.\u201d You XiaoMo looked at him incredulously.</p><br/><p>The person in white\u2019s face flushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anymore, I understand. Actually with your looks, you can easily find a much younger one. There\u2019s no need to give up a whole forest of lush greenery for the sake of an old tree. I\u2019m sure they will be more than happy to\u2026uh, share the pleasures of the flesh.\u201d You XiaoMo patted his shoulder sympathetically.</p><br/><p>The person in white wanted to just die already. He might look young but he was actually very, very old.</p><br/><p>And that was how the man in white got his death sentence from You XiaoMo due to his incompetence in explaining himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

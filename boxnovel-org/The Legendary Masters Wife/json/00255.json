Why did you take so long to come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The harmonious atmosphere between You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao was broken by Xu Yun. He could not stand the sight of them talking and laughing together and found the sight aggravating.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked back and saw Xu Yun\u2019s expectant expression. He smiled and replied, \u201cWhy are you guys still here? Never mind, I have some things to do later, you can all leave now. The points will be divided after everything is sold. Since that\u2019s covered, we\u2019re leaving first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for a reply from Xu Yun and the others, Ling Xiao left with his arm around You XiaoMo\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>After they walked out of sight, Xu Yun became positively apoplectic. Worried that he would do silly things, the people beside him stopped trying to coax him away.</p><br/><p>When they could not see the onlookers, You XiaoMo brought up his burning question, \u201cHow do you know that Xu Yun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Ling Xiao chuckled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is jealous, I\u2019m just\u2026 \u2026\u201d You XiaoMo quickly refuted, \u201cYou attract too many people. It\u2019ll make things very troublesome for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This statement is clearly saying that he was jealous!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao straightened and lazily said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother about him. Xu Yun only approached me because he wanted a supporter. Although the Xu Family is a little famous in Yan City, their strength is not even half of one of the four great clans. This generation of disciples are nothing great too, so they need to urgently win over the promising young students in the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suspiciously looked at him and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really just like that?\u201d It didn\u2019t seem like the matter was as simple as what Ling Xiao said, that Xu Yun was only sticking close just to win him over. He could tell that Xu Yun obviously liked Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao embraced and ravaged him a few times, \u201cOf course it\u2019s true. Many things are not as simple as their appearances imply. What you see may not necessarily be the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately slapped his hand away and nearly knocked Ling Xiao\u2019s mask off. Fortunately he still had his rationality. But, no matter whether things were really just as Ling Xiao said, You XiaoMo still felt that he had to get him a new mask. Reminded of this matter, he immediately grabbed Ling Xiao and started running.</p><br/><p>However, he was soon restrained by Ling Xiao who asked, \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied without turning back: \u201cThe sales area for the daily necessities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stroked his chin, \u201cWhat are you going there to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo buy a new mask for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the one now pretty nice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s too nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m going to buy the ugliest one for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This really was too adorable!</p><br/><p>Looking at the youngster dragging him along, Ling Xiao nearly broke out into laughter a few times. Sure enough, jealousy was a good look on him. A certain person cannot help but think about this issue, should he make him jealous a few more times?</p><br/><p>They reached the sales area after half an hour.</p><br/><p>Since most students brought the things they needed, and there were few who would deliberately spend points to buy these, there were not many stalls selling daily necessities. But with perseverance, You XiaoMo finally found a mask that was stuck at the bottom of the pile.</p><br/><p>The mask was brown in color and its biggest feature was that it was as ugly as an ogre. So it was called the \u2018Ogre Mask\u2019.</p><br/><p>Without raising any objections, You XiaoMo bought the mask. He searched for an empty corner and took off Ling Xiao\u2019s silver mask, replacing it with the Ogre Mask.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ginned while patting Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder, \u201cNot bad, not bad, you\u2019re much more handsome like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao helplessly waved his hands, \u201cAre you sure it doesn\u2019t look ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was in a very good mood, \u201cWhat does it matter? Don\u2019t tell me that you still need to depend on your beauty to survive in this academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Ling Xiao blinked at him, \u201cYou know that I always depend on force, but I don\u2019t exclude others being attracted to me by their own choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately kicked him, \u201cYou narcissist!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao dodged his kick, and lifted You XiaoMo\u2019s chin with his index finger. While beaming, he said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not narcissistic, how could I hook you, en?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly blushed, and felt his heartbeat increasing.</p><br/><p>My God! He was still able to feel something while seeing the Orge Mask. He was truly hopeless now.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough chatting, I need to buy magic herbs.\u201d You XiaoMo did not want to argue with him further. Ling Xiao was obviously the type of person to take a mile when you give them an inch. If he continued talking back, he was sure that Ling Xiao would get more and more shameless as he talked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you go there recently?\u201d Ling Xiao quickly caught up with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to buy level five magic herbs.\u201d Since he wanted to earn points, the TianLing pill and the Mental Purification pill were both absolutely necessary. If not for the fact that he could not bring out top grade magic pills in bulk, he would not have to waste his points to buy the herbs every day.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly stopped, and gave him a look-over. You XiaoMo had indeed advanced to a level five mage.</p><br/><p>Not hearing Ling Xiao\u2019s footsteps, You XiaoMo turned back, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took out a magic bag and carelessly threw it at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo caught it with a flabbergasted expression, and cautiously opened it. Seeing the things inside, he could not help but stare. \u201cWhy do you have so many low grade magic herbs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cBecause I dug them up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao knew that he could not take out his high grade magic herbs, and he had to buy magic herbs every time he refined pills. Thus when Ling Xiao was in the mountains, he plundered all the magic herbs that he saw while on his way. Even he himself did not know what types of magic herbs were in the bag.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave the bag a little glance. There were a lot of low and middle grade magic herbs, and it happened that these were all the herbs he needed at his current level.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m still missing some others.\u201d After finishing looking over it, You XiaoMo kept the magic bag. Although Ling Xiao dug up a lot of herbs, they were all unevenly matched, and there were only a few complete sets of herbs which can be used to refine pills.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao did not recognise magic herbs. But he was able to classify them based on the energy the magic herb contains. Thus You XiaoMo did not need to organise the herbs again. But the bag did not contain all the herbs needed to refine the two pills he wanted. So they still needed to go to the magic herbs sales area.</p><br/><p>When they reached their destination, You XiaoMo saw the young man who sold magic herbs to him.</p><br/><p>The last time they met, his stall was quite deserted. But this time, there was a crowd surrounding it, and it was very lively.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s impression of the young man was not bad, so he dragged Ling Xiao over.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang YuLin, you had better not refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit. If I see you selling the magic herbs to him again, you won\u2019t be able to survive in the academy.\u201d The man with his back facing You XiaoMo kicked over Tang YuLin\u2019s stall and venomously spitted out a warning.(Refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit i.e to hesitate to do something until you\u2019re being forced to do it)</p><br/><p>Tang YuLin\u2019s expression was very calm, as if the man standing in front was not trying to pick a quarrel with him, but was just here to buy magic herbs. Seeing his overturned stall, he also did not immediately bend down to pick them up, but expressionlessly said, \u201cI do not like to drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPu\u2026 \u2026\u201d Someone could not help but laugh.</p><br/><p>The man fiercely glared in the direction of the person who let out a laugh. He then turned back to Tang YuLin, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you understand or not. This is my last warning. If you let me see selling magic herbs to him\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, what is going on? Don\u2019t you know that you know that fighting is prohibited in the sales area?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man did not get to finish before a teasing voice interrupted him. Everyone looked towards the speaker, and found that it was a black robed young man standing at the periphery of the crowd. The young man\u2019s traits were outstanding and his features were also quite handsome. Of particular note were his two sharp eyebrows that inclined towards his sideburn were unforgettable.</p><br/><p>When the man saw the black robed young man, his legs turned into jelly, and he stuttered out the young man\u2019s name, \u201cBai-BaiLi TianYi\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, so you recognise me ah, then it\u2019s easier to handle.\u201d BaiLi TianYi walked over, and wherever he passed, the crowd parted before him. This name was known to everyone in Ward B.</p><br/><p>While the group of men were trembling, BaiLi TianYi had already walked over to Tang YuLin\u2019s side. He reached out and held Tang YuLin\u2019s shoulder, and with a raised eyebrow, he said, \u201cWhat do you want to do to my people?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man immediately bowed, \u201cYoung master BaiLi, I didn\u2019t know that Tang YuLin was under your protection. If I knew, I would not dare to touch him even if I had ten lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi scoffed, \u201cI do not care if you bully others, but since you\u2019re bullying my people, you can\u2019t blame me for interfering. Go back and tell Chai Zheng, if you have any grudges, find the main culprit and settle it with them. If I see this sort of thing again, be careful that his head doesn\u2019t fall from his shoulders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes, this small one will bear it in mind.\u201d The man nodded again and again.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram.\u201d BaiLi TianYi flicked his sleeve magnanimously.</p><br/><p>As if having gained amnesty, the men immediately scrambled away.</p><br/><p>On the outskirts of the crowds, You XiaoMo looked at the young man with surprise, and found that he recognized him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao saw him staring blankly at BaiLi TianYi and narrowed his eyes, \u201cYou XiaoMo are you being unfaithful?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouted, \u201cStop talking nonsense. I recognize this person. Remember when you were duelling with Sun Zhe in the arena? He was standing beside me. I even heard news of you from him. Who would have thought that he was XiaoYu\u2019s older brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao still couldn\u2019t accept this explanation but said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a student from Ward B.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was astonished and replied, \u201cDo you mean that he\u2019s a student from Ward A?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded and smiled, \u201cI heard that he will occasionally come to Ward B. It could be that this Tang YuLin is the reason he keeps coming over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he stepped in to defend Tang YuLin, You XiaoMo felt that this is very possible. But the probability cannot be that big, ba. With a look, one would know that BaiLi TianYi was a very outstanding man. How can he keep running over here from time to time for another man? In addition, he heard that Ward A and B are quite far apart. Could it be that there is some sort of deal between them?</p><br/><p>Seeing his face full of doubts, Ling Xiao smirked, \u201cContinue watching and you will know.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded, and looked up again, only to find that BaiLi TianYi was walking towards them. He let out a smile, and opened his mouth to say two words.</p><br/><p>-XiaoHei!</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026 \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

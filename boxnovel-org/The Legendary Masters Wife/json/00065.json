But that is when no outsiders are around. Because in front of others, he is Lin Xiao, and not Ling Xiao. But when he sees You XiaoMo using the tea table as a stone platform to refine magic pills, his lips twitch. He raises his hand and simply spreads a barrier that cuts off smells.</p><br/><p>Although he is not a mage, he still knows that when mages refine magic pills, the magic herbs will give off a medicinal fragrance. Especially when it comes to higher level magic herbs, when the magic pill is formed successfully, that medicinal fragrance will be even stronger. Furthermore, this is the Central lineage where high level masters are as many as there are clouds. Any slight movement will be discovered immediately. If he didn\u2019t wake up in time from his meditation, he would have been in trouble.</p><br/><p>Seeing that You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t realize his presence, Ling Xiao walks over to the tea table and glances at the magic herbs. They are all high grade magic herbs, about thirty stalks. He soon thinks about the magic herb garden in the dimension. It looks like magic herbs watered with magic water is not quite the same.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pulls a chair and sits opposite You XiaoMo. Thinking about it, this is the first time he sees You XiaoMo refining magic pills. Seeing that fair and clear face flushed red, Ling Xiao thinks about the time they first met.</p><br/><p>At that time, You XiaoMo was far from how he is now, able to calmly face him. It\u2019s as if from the first look, he wanted to avoid him. That\u2019s right, avoid him but not terrified of him. This made him feel very intrigued, not only because he and Lin Xiao were from different divisions.</p><br/><p>He is someone that is used to being above everyone. A \u2026\u2026. person that is used to everyone fearing him. So, towards the person who is hell-bent on avoiding him, You XiaoMo, Ling Xiao was very intrigued. That\u2019s why he threatened him to give up half his soul.</p><br/><p>Of course that was just to scare him. The soul is an intact entity. If one were to give up half, that would mean death.</p><br/><p>After that, the more time he spent with him, the more he wanted to make fun of him. Looking at his furious but not daring to say a word expression delights him to no end. Just like that, it became only natural with time \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>If You XiaoMo knows what Ling Xiao is thinking in his heart, he might take the cauldron in his hands and throw it at him.</p><br/><p>But he is already entering the last stage so his mind is even more concentrated. So he basically doesn\u2019t know that Ling Xiao has been staring at him for quite a while.</p><br/><p>A quarter of an hour later and You XiaoMo finally succeeds in refining a Spiritual energy magic pill. The whole room is flooded with medicinal fragrance and spiritual energy. The time he used this time is one third of what he used last time. The speed has increased significantly. He only needs to practice a little more and he should be able to catch up to the speed he uses for low grade magic pills.</p><br/><p>Wiping off the sweat on his forehead, You XiaoMo raises his head and jumps in fright from the enlarged face before him, \u201cYou you you, how come you\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glances at the magic pill in his hand.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo notices his glance and thinks that since this magic pill was for him anyway, he is just about to hand it over when he sees Ling Xiao frown and look out the window. Following his gaze, he looks over \u2026\u2026. and sees absolutely nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder brother Ling, is there anything outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asks curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao answers indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201c<i>Ah</i>?\u201d</p><br/><p>The magic pill in You XiaoMo\u2019s hand almost slips out. Terrified, he quickly uses his other hand to hold it firmly and says anxiously, \u201cThere there there \u2026\u2026. there\u2019s someone? How can there be someone, can that person find out that I\u2019m refining magic pills? If I get found out, should I run away? But I don\u2019t know the way. And I don\u2019t know where to go <i>ei</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo gets anxious, the words would unconsciously come out non-stop.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s serious expression changes into amusement when he sees his over the top nervous behavior. How can this person be so interesting <i>ne</i>!</p><br/><p>\u201cWith me here, what are you afraid of? I had already put down a barrier a long time ago. Even if it was the Grand Master of TianXin sect himself that comes over, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see through it. What more that mouse outside whose power is only so so. Even if he were to plaster himself to the wall and try to listen, he would only think that we have already gone to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBarrier? When, how come I didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo calms down but is still very curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you were refining magic pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glares at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lets out an \u2018<i>oh</i>\u2018, no wonder he didn\u2019t know. At that time, he was fully concentrating on the insides of the cauldron so it\u2019s only natural that he didn\u2019t realize, \u201cWho is that person outside? Why is he spying on us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is the one who presided over the arena today, Elder Jiang. He also presided over last year\u2019s competition. But nothing in particular happened. Elder Jiang is a very low profile person but his relationship with the other elders is not bad. But before today, he didn\u2019t do anything strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, what now?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallows repeatedly. It\u2019s actually Elder Jiang. Thank goodness he wasn\u2019t discovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can we do? Of course just wait and see. Or, would you prefer that I kill him right now to avoid any future trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looks at him and somewhat playfully licks the corners of his lips. It almost seems that if You XiaoMo is to nod his head, he would immediately go and do it.</p><br/><p>A drop of sweat rolls off You XiaoMo\u2019s forehead, \u201cHow can I like killing people? You don\u2019t misunderstand. Elder Jiang is after all TianXin sect\u2019s senior. It maybe that, that\u2019s right, it maybe that he was just passing by and accidentally bumped into your barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be so nervous. I wasn\u2019t serious about killing him. This is after all TianXin sect. Killing him would only bring trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his nervous behavior, Ling Xiao can\u2019t help but laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ignores his jab and lets out a sigh of relief. He had thought it would be like that. After calming himself, he realizes that he is still holding the Spiritual energy magic pill in his hand. He immediately hands it over looking for praise, \u201cElder brother Ling, look at this magic pill. It\u2019s a high grade magic pill refined by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had long ago noticed it. Seeing him handing it over, he immediately reaches out and takes it. He looks and looks, sniffs and sniffs. This is really excellent, much more fragrant than the flawed low grade magic pills. Thus he impatiently throws it into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Every time You XiaoMo sees this action, he can\u2019t help feeling his heart ache. It\u2019s just too wasteful!</p><br/><p>He has never seen such a person. Eating magic pills like eating jellybeans. Furthermore, it doesn\u2019t matter what grade of magic pills. It can\u2019t be that he isn\u2019t afraid that eating too many magic pills will cause the spiritual energy in his body to wreak havoc, causing his meridians to go in reverse? Even as he is, he knows that eating too many magic pills is not a good thing.</p><br/><p>After finishing the magic pill, Ling Xiao appears unsatisfied as he looks at You XiaoMo. Such a tasty magic pill, he really wants to have his fill.</p><br/><p>In one glance, You XiaoMo knows that he still wants more. Thinking of the magic pills that he refined yesterday in his magic bag, he simply takes them out saying, \u201cThis is a bottle of Fasting magic pills. There are ten inside. I refined them last night. Make do with these first <i>ba</i>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Ling Xiao only looks at the bottle in his hand, \u201cWhy did you refine Fasting magic pills for no reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubs his head while speaking, \u201cThe cauldron I\u2019m currently using has a small crack on the bottom. I\u2019m afraid that it may split open at any time so I\u2019m planning on buying a slightly better cauldron. But I don\u2019t have enough money, so I\u2019m planning to refine Fasting magic pills to sell. I\u2019ve already asked around. High grade Fasting magic pills are in relative short supply. Fifty or more pills can be sold by auction. At that time, the price should be high. These ten pills are my practice pills. If you want, you can just take them. I will just refine some more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stares at him with an expressionless face. His mouth suddenly twitches and says as if slighted: \u201cNo need. It\u2019s the same if you give them to me tomorrow. Don\u2019t think of sending me away with your practice pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts. He actually thinks I\u2019m trying to pawn them off. Even though they are practice pills, they are still top grade magic pills okay. Furthermore, he had never heard him belittle his magic pills before. And those were low grade magic pills. Furthermore, at that time he was still a novice. Don\u2019t talk about quality, his skills were also nothing to shout about. Really can\u2019t understand what he is actually thinking!</p><br/><p>But since he already said he doesn\u2019t want it, he won\u2019t insist and ask to be snubbed. His refusal also suits him just fine <i>ba</i>!</p><br/><p>Thinking like that, You XiaoMo simply puts the magic pills back into his magic bag and starts on the second magic pill.</p><br/><p>Because of the presence of Ling Xiao\u2019s barrier, You XiaoMo is more at ease this time. He once again neglects Ling Xiao\u2019s existence and starts refining magic pills as if there is no one beside him.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he is ignoring him, Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t feel the least bit angry. He sits back on the chair and looks at him with an even more complicated expression than before. Just before, when he heard You XiaoMo saying those words, he felt irritated and displeased. Soon after an inexplicable feeling arose in his heart.</p><br/><p>It must be known that he is someone that can be said to be even more heartless than demons!</p><br/><p>Even so, Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t feel disgust. This \u2018inexplicable feeling\u2019 for the first time is not something he especially detests. It looks like from the time he started to get together with You XiaoMo, he has become more and more \u2018kind hearted\u2019!</p><br/><p>If You XiaoMo knows what he is thinking in his heart, he would definitely ridicule him silently in his heart. Really embarrassing!</p><br/><p>Even though they have not known each other for long, but from the time Ling Xiao conveniently wiped out the original Lin Xiao, You XiaoMo had known that he can\u2019t be a good person.</p><br/><p>This point, You XiaoMo really takes as the truth!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

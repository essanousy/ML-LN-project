Are you for real?\u201d Ling Xiao spoke mildly, yet there was clear contempt in his tone. No matter him or You XiaoMo, any normal demon beast that followed them would only become a burden.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast might be a high level demon beast, and even a mutated variant, but his combative ability was relatively low amongst high level demon beasts. He wouldn\u2019t be much of an asset in a battle to them. The only reason he could rule this island was because he was lucky enough that there were no powerful high level demon beasts.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast clearly felt that the other was insulting him, his eyes red with anger. So what if he was a Ground Squirrel Beast? He was proud of being one!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, am I for real? You should be honored to have the chance of becoming this king\u2019s comrade. If it wasn\u2019t for Master, then this king would never lower himself to sharing a Master with someone like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your attitude when wanting to become someone\u2019s contracted demon beast?\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s lips curled, seemingly in a good mood. He was actually willing to sit here arguing with the Weasel Beast, but the Weasel Beast wasn\u2019t so happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like this king wants to form a contract with you, so what does this king\u2019s attitude have to do with you?\u201d The Weasel Beast replied arrogantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it has to do with me.\u201d Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast\u2019s expression remained unchanged, clearly disbelieving, and asked, \u201cThen go on, what does it have to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao responded in an amused tone, \u201cAny demon beast that wants to form a contract with him has to get my approval. As for why, that\u2019s simple: because he\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMine?\u201d The Weasel Beast was stunned. Was it what he thought it meant? \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao crossed his arms. \u201cIf you want to become his demon beast, sure, but first, tell me what use value you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast didn\u2019t know how to react at all. The other had said the words \u201cuse value\u201d so straightforwardly that it had stunned him. He was speechless for a good while.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy patience is limited,\u201d Ling Xiao added lightly.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast finally snapped out of his stupor. For some things, it was better to believe they were true no matter if they were or were not. He personally thought it was rather absurd because the island was rather isolated, so he had interacted with very limited numbers of people and demon beasts. He hadn\u2019t ever heard of the idea of a man with another man.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t not believe it, otherwise, if it was true, then wouldn\u2019t he had offended his future master\u2019s other half?</p><br/><p>As a clever and amazing Weasel beast, he had to show his courage and gain his master\u2019s other half\u2019s acknowledgement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI naturally have great use value, and, and not just one\u2026\u201d The Weasel Beast stuttered, \u201cMy greatest value is my intelligence network.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? And how does that work?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Beast saw his neutral expression, and, unable to figure out what he was thinking, could only continue, \u201cI have a talent that normal Weasel Demons don\u2019t have. Only an aberrant like me has this talent, that is, to be able to control all rodent demon beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat? You?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Demon once again felt like he was being looked down on, but this time he didn\u2019t get angry. He puffed out his chest, saying confidently, \u201cOf course, let me tell you, this talent of mine is really powerful. I can produce a special kind of sound wave that only rodent demon beasts can hear. It can control all rodent demon beasts, and as my cultivation base grows, this talent will get stronger, too. Right now I\u2019m not all that strong, but after I become even higher leveled, then I\u2019ll be able to control all rodent demon beasts with a weaker cultivation base, or even those on par with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, he had wanted to say level eleven or even twelve, but this goal was a bit of a stretch. To prevent being taken as a joke again, he didn\u2019t say it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s interest was finally roused. At first he hadn\u2019t held much hope at all.</p><br/><p>There were very few records of aberrant Weasel Demons, because Weasel Demons were on the lower end of high level demon beasts, and aberrant Weasel Demons hadn\u2019t appeared in tens of thousands of years. The other reason was that Weasel Demons had this brutish look about them. Female cultivators didn\u2019t like them and male cultivators found them too weak, so very few practitioners would form contracts with Weasel Demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s try it,\u201d Ling Xiao said. After all, he hadn\u2019t been shown any evidence yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The Weasel Demon, too lost in his own pride, didn\u2019t manage to react immediately.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued, \u201cSummon all the rodent demon beasts on this island,\u201d he suddenly realized, though this sound waves trick was pretty useful, this demon beast\u2019s IQ was too low.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Demon hesitated for a moment before obeying.</p><br/><p>It was then that Ling Xiao realized why the other had hesitated. Rodent demon beasts generally reproduced very rapidly, and with the Weasel Demon there to back them, they lived better lives than any other kind of demon beast on the island. Thus, their population was ten, twenty times the size of the other demon beasts on the island.</p><br/><p>All these rodent demon beasts, of different shapes and sizes, like swarming ants, darted out of the forest group by group. Around five to six meters of ground around the hut was filled with rodents.</p><br/><p>What was the funniest was that these rodents had brought their entire families with them. For example, newborn rodent demon beasts, lying there limply, were being carried on their parents\u2019 backs. It was probably because Ling Xiao had asked for all rodents, so the Weasel Demon had complied, even gathering the newborns.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, IQ wasn\u2019t just an incurable injury in humans, but demon beasts, too.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, who was refining pills, suddenly shuddered. Any normal person, seeing so many rodents, would be shocked, especially someone like You XiaoMo who had transmigrated over: so many rats!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, send them all off.\u201d Ling Xiao waved a hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d The Weasel Demon was rather nervous, and immediately had the rodents leave upon hearing this order. Thus, the swarm of rodents retreated back into the forest like the tide. Some were slower, some accidentally tripped over, and some walked for quite a ways away before realizing their children were missing then ran back to get them\u2026</p><br/><p>What a bunch of dumb rodents.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao then asked, \u201cApart from this talent, do you have anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the Weasel Demon was conflicted. In order to change Ling Xiao\u2019s impression of him, he had showed off his signature talent. It wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t do anything else, but none of those were as good as this one. If he really did show them, then they\u2019d just get worse and worse, and wouldn\u2019t have just make the other\u2019s impression of him worse and worse?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are other\u2026 er, minor talents. Do you want to see them?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, he wasn\u2019t arrogant.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao chuckled. \u201cNever mind then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Demon carefully asked, \u201cThen, did I pass the test?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cSeeing as you still have some use value, I\u2019ll give you a chance, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weasel Demon almost cheered in excitement, but then, hearing the but, tensed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, I\u2019m merely giving you a chance to meet him. In the end, it\u2019s up to him if he wants to form a contract with you or not,\u201d Ling Xiao then said, his gaze moving to You XiaoMo, who was still refining pills. Today had gone smoothly, too. It shouldn\u2019t be long until another Lightning Retribution came.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Demon\u2019s face fell, but he was still in high spirits. He just had to work harder and get his master to form a contract with him, then he\u2019d be able to eat delicious turkeys in the future. Let\u2019s go!</p><br/><p>Go go go!</p><br/><p>If You XiaoMo knew that he had his mind set on the turkeys, then he definitely wouldn\u2019t form a contract with the other.</p><br/><p>His Qiu team already had enough gluttons. If another joined, then he really wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with it. Plus, he wasn\u2019t aiming to make a team of gluttons.</p><br/><p>When the Lightning Retribution came, it was still You XiaoMo who acted.</p><br/><p>It seemed easy, but only those who had personal experience would know that it wasn\u2019t. Otherwise, if it was so easy to deal with, there wouldn\u2019t be so many rainbow grade mages troubled over Lightning Retribution, or struck down by it, resulting in their efforts all gone to waste.</p><br/><p>After an hour, the thunderclouds dispersed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took the newly refined pill from the cauldron and placed it with the one from before. Two was enough for them to use. If they ran out, then he\u2019d make some more in the future. By then, the magic herbs in his fields would have matured.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d You XiaoMo came over to Ling Xiao and suddenly noticed the Weasel Demon. Last time, he hadn\u2019t seen the demon beast, so he didn\u2019t know of what the master of the island looked like.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Demon immediately revealed a bootlicking smile, though it wasn\u2019t very successful. Since he wasn\u2019t all that good looking in the first place, it even seemed a little terrifying.</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled and explained, \u201cHe\u2019s the Weasel Demon, the master of this island. He wants to form a contract with you. You decide if you want him or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitated. This was the first time a demon beast came over to try and get him to form a contract.</p><br/><p>Generally, the more scarce they were, the more valuable demon beasts became. Those that came running over for a contract were different from those who were sought out by practitioners. The latter was considered much more valuable.</p><br/><p>The Weasel Demon could tell that he was hesitant and hurriedly said, \u201cMaster, I might seem like any normal Weasel Demon, but I\u2019m actually very strong. I can control many rodent demon beasts and make them obey and gather information for you. I promise, I won\u2019t disappoint you if you form a contract with me. I have other talents, too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was also the first time he had ever seen a demon beast sell their talents like this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

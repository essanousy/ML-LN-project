Who said that Mo Jing must leave for the Living Waters River Boundary, he could leave from the South and not go to the Boundary.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Xing Qi and Gao Yin decided to split up.</p><br/><p>Xing Qi was going to guard the South, whereas Gao Yin and Hei Xiong were going to guard the North.</p><br/><p>The plan seemed good in their heads, but as Xing Qi was on his way, the West side exploded into chaos. Someone had bombed the gates open, creating a riot. Xing Qi\u2019s intuition said that this must have something to do with Mo Jing.</p><br/><p>Xing Qi landed on the city wall and stared piercingly at the crowd who was running out of the city gates. One by one, like a radar, he attempted to find Mo Jing who had blended in amongst them.</p><br/><p>He wanted to stop everyone, but not only would that anger the masses, he couldn\u2019t clone himself to do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, Xing Qi, I really can\u2019t shake you off.\u201d It was at this moment that a slightly deep voice rose behind him without warning.</p><br/><p>In surprise, Xing Qi slapped his palm backwards without thinking. His expression was venomous but this attack was simply to sound him out.</p><br/><p>Mo Jing blocked with ease.</p><br/><p>The two quickly separated.</p><br/><p>Mo Jing didn\u2019t actually want to fight Xing Qi, since his internal wounds were not yet healed. Although, Xing Qi had lost his arm, if Gao Yin and Hei Xiong caught up, he would be a rat in a hole.</p><br/><p>Without stopping, Mo Jing\u2019s silhouette swifty flew towards the gate.</p><br/><p>Before, he hadn\u2019t thought that Xing Qi would\u2019ve caught up so quickly, because just as he was about to follow the crowd out, he heard Xing Qi\u2019s roar. With just a slight delay in movement, he had caught up.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was making a break for it, Xing Qi was about to follow when suddenly he caught a glimpse of a familiar white silhouette going through the gate.</p><br/><p>The white silhouette belonged to a young man around eighteen or so. Like a fox, the young man was looking left and right like a thief. Once he determined a direction, he made a dash towards it.</p><br/><p>Xing Qi squinted his eyes. He realized that the direction the young man ran towards was the same as Mo Jing.</p><br/><p>Something flashed across his mind and the blurry figure became clearer, but Xing Qi didn\u2019t have time to organize his thoughts as he followed the man subconsciously.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long before Hei Xiong and Gao Yin arrived hurriedly as they heard the news.</p><br/><p>Hei Xiong quickly got hold of the situation, only to find out that the one behind it all was a young man, who looked plain but was at the Divine Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cXing Qi went that way, we should hurry.\u201d Seeing that Xing Qi had already left the city, Gao Yin said in haste. Due to his anxiousness, he didn\u2019t see the odd expression on Hei Xiong\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Hei Xiong said, \u201cYou go first, with you and Xing Qi\u2019s strength, Mo Jing shouldn\u2019t pose a threat. I\u2019ll deal with the stuff here first and then catch up with you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Yin didn\u2019t think too much about it, he was more worried that Xing Qi would take a beating against Mo Jing. With Xing Qi\u2019s lost arm, if he used his original form, his power level would drop by a grade.</p><br/><p>Not only that, what Hei Xiong said wasn\u2019t unreasonable either. Mo Jing\u2019s wounds hadn\u2019t completely healed yet and they had two people on their side, so they needn\u2019t fear just Mo Jing.</p><br/><p>Once he thought it through, Gao Yin chased after Xing Qi in haste.</p><br/><p>Looking at his disappearing figure, Hei Xiong sneered, \u201cI\u2019m not going to die with you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young man and flames.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t much to go by, it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><br/><p>It was because of this cautious attitude that Hei Xiong could rule ZiRan City for thousands of years.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the young man who was being tailed, had ran a few thousand meters in the blink of an eye. His route was almost the same as Mo Jing, making his suspicion grow deeper and deeper. Judging by the figure, he was sure he had seen him before.</p><br/><p>Fifteen minutes later, the young man suddenly slowed down until he reached a full stop at a gigantic tree.</p><br/><p>Just as he was confused, the young man turned around with his big black eyes staring straight towards him, meeting his eyes.</p><br/><p>The young man gave him a sweet smile.</p><br/><p>As if a light bulb was suddenly lit, a similar smiling face appeared in Xing Qi\u2019s mind. Although there were differences, the feeling of familiarity was unshakable.</p><br/><p>His expression changed drastically, if it was as he thought, then that man, the man who broke his arm was definitely around, he had been tricked!</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, you fell into our trap!\u201d The voice that was ingrained into his body appeared behind him with a delighted laugh and heaviness. As if he had been waiting forever, like a blood-thirsty and yet clever hunter, waiting for his prey.</p><br/><p>As the man was talking, his hand was already on Xing Qi\u2019s head, in delight he said, \u201cThus, I\u2019ll be taking your Life Crystal. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last thing Xing Qi saw was blood.</p><br/><p>He had never thought that he would have died so easily and cleanly, but it was too late. With his Life Crystal being stolen, there was no way he could survive.</p><br/><p>When Gao Yin arrived, he happened to see the exact moment Xing Qi\u2019s Life Crystal fell into the man\u2019s hands. It was a dark red and within it held all of Xing Qi\u2019s power, it was almost equivalent to a second grade rainbow pill. Many from the TongTian Continent would\u2019ve stared at it with blood-shot eyes.</p><br/><p>Gao Yin\u2019s eyes were red, but not from greed, rather, anger.</p><br/><p>He had been partners with Xing Qi for twenty thousand years, they had always been together, doing evil deeds. He had never once thought that Xing Qi would die before him.</p><br/><p>His anger revealed his killing intent.</p><br/><p>With one kick, the man kicked away Xing Qi\u2019s body and looked towards his direction. That dark-as-abyss eyes contained a sliver of interest as the unreserved killing intent sent a shiver down Gao Yin\u2019s spine, instantly cold sweat drenched his shirt.</p><br/><p>How could he have forgotten, his strength was below Xing Qi, Gao Yin thought with a deathly pale face.</p><br/><p>Even Xing Qi died. How could he stand up against the man and he even dared to think about revenge, he really overestimated himself!</p><br/><p>That man was probably thinking of the same thing.</p><br/><p>As Gao Yin stared at Xing Qi\u2019s corpse, his body backed away and in the next second, he ran.</p><br/><p>In the end, twenty thousand years of brotherhood was not enough, he didn\u2019t want to face the same end as Xing Qi.</p><br/><p>The man stared at his figure and sneered, but didn\u2019t give chase.</p><br/><p>Mo Jing jumped down from the tree, confidently he landed beside You XiaoMo. He saw with his own two eyes, how Ling Xiao killed Xing Qi and took out his Life Crystal. His heart was in turmoil, maybe he should be happy that he wasn\u2019t Xing Qi and had a relation with the Black Turtle Clan, otherwise, the one who got their Life Crystal stolened would likely have been him.</p><br/><p>At first, they hadn\u2019t planned on killing Xing Qi, but with the man\u2019s \u2018his Life Crystal should be pretty good\u2019, Xing Qi\u2019s life was determined. Thus, the scene occured from before.</p><br/><p>But, Xing Qi was also unlucky to have actually came by himself to guard the South gate. It gave Mo Jing a feeling of inevitability, regarding his death at least.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind his contact information, Mo Jing parted with them at the outskirts.</p><br/><p>Since the little master was already sent back to the Black Turtle Clan, he didn\u2019t need to go to the Living Waters River Boundary anymore.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared with puppy-dog eyes at the Life Crystal in Ling Xiao\u2019s hands. Although it was a bit disgusting, coming directly from someone\u2019s brain, the immense power that it emitted was way too tempting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want it?\u201d Ling Xiao held out the Life Crystal in front of You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo reached out to steal it, \u201cOf course I want it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, Ling Xiao pulled his hand away, causing You XiaoMo to slip. \u201cYou just leveled up recently, so you can\u2019t even use this Life Crystal right now. There is no point in giving it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stood where he was and scrunched up his nose, as if he was giving up, but then suddenly, without a warning, he pounced onto Ling Xiao, aiming for the Life Crystal.</p><br/><p>With nine out of ten people, he would have been successful, but Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t a normal person.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao retracted his hand and took two steps back. Not only did You XiaoMo not get the Life Crystal, he fell onto Ling Xiao\u2019s lap.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face became distorted, his knees hurt.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at his enduring expression and couldn\u2019t help himself from laughing out loud. He once again put the Life Crystal in front of him, \u201cSince you even kneeled to beg me, then I\u2019ll very reluctantly give you this Life Crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man should have his dignity and not kneel!</p><br/><p>In his heart, You XiaoMo screamed out, he didn\u2019t kneel to beg him, but right after that, he aggressively took the Life Crystal.</p><br/><p>To be honest, there was a good reason as to why he so badly wanted this Life Crystal.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was advancing even faster than him. Others were jealous of him, but he was even more jealous of Ling Xiao, who didn\u2019t have to cultivate to advance.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t completely sure why he had to refine Xuan Ze\u2019s corpse, he felt he caught onto something though.</p><br/><p>So as to not be thrown too far behind, he must grab onto the Life Crystal and if need be, use them to advance.</p><br/><p>As for the three level ten Life Crystals he bought earlier, he had given them to PiQiu, XiaoHei and MaoQiu, all three of which were level ten practitioners. They were in need of it and as for MaoQiu, she would compensate him later.</p><br/><p>Once he thought of that, You XiaoMo quickly got Ling Xiao to pull PiQiu and the others out of his dimension. At first he was going to let them have their free time, but suddenly some unforeseeable events happened and they wouldn\u2019t be able to take them to Zhong Tian. With more people, the target was bigger too.</p><br/><p>Other than LanQiu and Xiao Ji, everyone was present.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glanced over only to see that a person had sneaked his way into his contracted demon beast group. Staring at him wide eyed, You XiaoMo pointed to him as he said, \u201cYou, you, you, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>With an expression of being wronged, You JunQi walked out with his hands covering his chest, heart-broken, \u201cSonny, you forgot about me? I\u2019m your\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom!\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>You JunQi felt the blood swell up in his throat.</p><br/><p>Those with less composure, like the new member, the Giant Roc, he also felt it in his throat.</p><br/><p>As for the others, they were used to it. Often their master would do something crazy, one would get used to it.</p><br/><p>The reason why You XiaoMo told Ling Xiao to have the contracted demon beasts in his dimension was actually because of You JunQi. Even though he was in the wrong, leaving him alone there just seemed too pitiful. So, he thought of having his demon beasts there to accompany him to see how nice he was.</p><br/><p>The result was that when Ling Xiao pulled all the demon beasts out, CatQiu and PiQiu were talking to him, thus he was brought along too.</p><br/><p>You JunQi placed both of his hands onto You XiaoMo\u2019s shoulders and said solemnly, \u201cSon, you have to remember, I\u2019m your father, not your mother. What you have, I have, what you don\u2019t have, I also have\u2026cough, I said it wrong, what you don\u2019t have, I also don\u2019t have.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched violently.</p><br/><p>Even his contracted demon beasts were looking at him unbearably, like father like son.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was laughing so much that his shoulders wouldn\u2019t stop shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, you have to believe me, I\u2019m really your father.\u201d You JunQi said with a serious face.</p><br/><p>How are you going to make me believe that I have such a stupid father. If Ling Xiao knew math, he would definitely say that two times negative two makes a negative. My positive energy would be stupefied by you.</p><br/><p>t/n: ( two) is a modern slang for stupid. Remember how Ling Xiao said Momo only have IQ of two? His positive IQ of two multiply with his dad\u2019s stupidity(negative two) equals negative XD</p><br/><p>On the outside, You XiaoMo was expressionless, as if he wasn\u2019t moved at all, but on the inside, he called bullshit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSonny~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, let us talk business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned to Ling Xiao with anticipation, and blinked his eyes.</p><br/><p>Taking the baton, Ling Xiao gave a summary of the situation at Zhong Tian and the Southern Continent. As for the final conclusion, they would still have to stay at Xi Jing, but this time, they were given a mission. That mission was to find LanQiu and also to get some info on the little chick.</p><br/><p>As for You XiaoMo, he promised that by the time they met again, he would give them each a rainbow pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d Just as the demon beasts were bustling with excitement, the cool-beauty XiaoHei raised an eyebrow and casually asked.</p><br/><p>Instantly, everyone fell silent.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt the corner of his eyes twitch, \u201cToo little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone stayed silent, silently approving.</p><br/><p>Then with full seriousness, You XiaoMo said, \u201cOkay then, once you get back, I\u2019ll give everyone three level ten pills. Now then, that settled nicely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

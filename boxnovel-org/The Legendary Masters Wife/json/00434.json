This was the fighting ring number of his match. Then he searched for the venue and the approximate time of his match on the screen. The venue was at the second challenge arena and it was to be held in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had seen Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye\u2019s match time, but other that Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye whose matches were held at the same time, the matches of the others, including An Qiao\u2019s match, were all staggered.</p><br/><p>An Qiao\u2019s opponent was also a person on the twentieth floor. Probably for the sake of his reputation, the opponent he challenged was a person who was a little famous. However, his current strength was more than enough to deal with someone on the twentieth floor.</p><br/><p>The match had yet to begin as they sat on the spectator seats.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the jade slab inlayed into the wall in front of the stage. It was dozens of times bigger than the one he had seen when he was registering, \u201cOh yes, what\u2019s the penalty they\u2019ll receive if someone loses their match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing who had been talking to Tian Xin heard his question and explained, \u201cThe penalty is to be demoted. If someone on the twentieth floor loses, they would fall to the nineteenth floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the penalty is not very severe.\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin continued, \u201cThe XiaoYao Institution does take things into consideration. After all, your strength would also be at that level even if you lost. The rule is that you will only drop by one floor so as not to create chaos in the strength of every floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the spectator seats fully packed, the starting time for the Challenge Match was finally at hand.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the audience were hundreds of empty fighting rings. Standing separately on the edge of the fighting ring was a referee with a solemn expression. At this moment, everyone restlessly looked at the jade plate on the wall. The names people participating in the first round would appear there.</p><br/><p>There was no host for the Challenge Matches. The jade plate began to emit bursts of rays once the starting time arrived and after a moment, the names of all the contestants began to roll. The list of names of the contestants would be announced as though one did know the approximate time for their match, but the spectators did not know this.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly found two familiar names. It was Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye. The two were both participating in the first round.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing stood up and nodded in their direction while smiling before going down. Jiu Ye\u2019s seat was behind him, so their actions were almost simultaneous.</p><br/><p>There were a hundred matches in the first round. It was not possible for everyone to have a hundred eyes, so most would choose to watch the match that they were more interested in. Most were looking forward to the strength of the new students so the match that the majority wanted to see was Qiao WuXing\u2019s and Jiu Ye\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother WuXing will definitely win.\u201d Tian Xin clenched her first.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, with Wu-dage\u2019s ability, others will laugh at him till their teeth could be seen if he doesn\u2019t win. Though there are many within the twentieth floor who are quite strong, it\u2019s still not impressive enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who said this was Yan Hui and he did not lower his voice. Thus the gazes of the people seating around them were immediately filled with a little ill will as he finished speaking. Even if the strength of the people on the twentieth floor was inferior to them, there was a big difference between saying it out loud and not saying it.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether Yan Hui\u2019s words were unintentional or not, the hostility point had already gone up.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head. Speaking without thinking, you should still lower your voice even if you want to say it.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui seemed to become aware of the peculiarities of their surroundings as his laughter gradually trailed off. He shrunk down and did not dare to glance around. He could feel the gazes of many people falling onto him, making him feel uncomfortable from head to toe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe matches are about to begin.\u201d Tian Xin\u2019s excited voice disrupted the tense atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The attention was everyone was immediately pulled down on the stages.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing and Jiu Ye were standing on Ring Ten and Ring Eighty Two respectively. Qiao WuXing\u2019s opponent was a man who looked a little gentle, but one could tell that he was a ruthless and devious person from the faint shadow on his glabella.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing politely nodded in his direction, but his opponent did not give the slightest reaction and only narrowed his eyes, as if he was thinking over a problem. With regards to an opponent who was stronger than oneself, one could only outwit the enemy instead of using force.</p><br/><p>The man was obviously a type of person who was like a military adviser and his half-lidded eyes seemed to contain a gleam of light.</p><br/><p>Just as the referee yelled \u2018start\u2019, the man swiftly disappeared from his current place. His speed was so fast that only afterimages could be seen. Qiao WuXing would never underestimate his opponent no matter if he was strong or weak. He immediately put up his guard. However, just as the man was about to reach him, the man\u2019s shadow seemed to have split and instantly separately left and right to surround Qiao WuXing.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing was momentarily startled.</p><br/><p>The man took advantage of this opening and immediately launched an attack. A strong and solid soul force instantly rushed forth to his palm, and ferociously shot out in Qiao WuXing\u2019s direction. The latter seemed to have been baffled by his methods and the man instantly let out a trace of happiness.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing\u2019s figure lightly flashed then disappeared in the nick of time. The man\u2019s expression changed and before he could react, a soul force that was even stronger and denser than his instantly struck his abdomen. The huge momentum from the strike caused his face to distort and he could not control his body as he flew backwards, directly falling off the stage.</p><br/><p>He actually tasted defeat in such a clear-cut manner! And this was only the first round!</p><br/><p>Everyone who saw this scene could not help but swallow, he\u2019s really powerful!</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing dusted off his clothes. Actually, he had never even left his original place by a single step from start to finish. The man\u2019s method of using afterimages to confuse his opponent was pretty good. If he wavered in the slightest, the flow would have been in his opponent\u2019s favor. But no matter how realistic afterimages were, it did not contain any soul force. Furthermore, he had immediately noticed as his strength was much higher than the man\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Just as the match on this side ended, the match on Stage Eighty Two had also ended.</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye\u2019s speed was not any slower than Qiao WuXing\u2019s and he did not even use a trace of soul force. When his opponent had made a move, he had swept the man who was brawnier than him off the stage with a cool and awesome kick.</p><br/><p>Jiu Ye was slowly withdrawing the leg he had raised without a single expression on his face when Qiao WuXing looked over.</p><br/><p>After the performance of the two, those who originally were scornful of them all started paying attention. This was especially so for those people from the twentieth floor who had some fame. One must be aware that several of them had been incited by You XiaoMo and the rest. If You XiaoMo and the rest were as powerful as these two people, they had to consider how to face them later.</p><br/><p>As the time it took for everyone to finish their match was different, the names on the jade plate began to roll again after Jiu Ye and Qiao WuXing\u2019s match ended. After seeing their own name, a bunch of people walked out one after another from the spectator seats.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoHa, it\u2019s your turn. Do your best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin who was sitting behind him strongly clapped his shoulder suddenly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolled his eyes in his heart. Tian Xin looked weak and delicate, who would have thought that her hand strength was so strong. Each and everyone\u2019s strength were all so great.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your best!\u201d Cheng XiangRong shyly said to him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled and nodded. He had always felt that it was inconceivable that this uncle\u2019s personality was actually so bashful. However, this also proved that he was a relatively simple person. Then he looked at Ling Xiao, \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes at him, \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo harrumphed, \u201cSome encouraging words, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him in despise and said, \u201cYour opponent is just a level five mage. Are you certain that you need my encouragement?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave a hollow laugh as he touched his nose. He only said this on a whim just because he was carried away in this moment, did you need to look at him like this? You also won\u2019t die by occasionally cooperating.</p><br/><p>After silently cursing, he walked down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at his opponent without blinking. The person\u2019s clothes were relatively unusual but the places that should be covered were covered. To others, it was very revealing, however it was quite normal to him with his past memory.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the two were already standing at the ready, the referee loudly yelled, \u201cBegin!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was the same as Qiao WuXing and did not become careless just because his opponent was a level five mage. His skin immediately became taut as he stared at her without wavering, waiting for her to attack. Look how considerate he is.</p><br/><p>The woman calmly looked at him for a moment before she suddenly smiled. She was quite pretty to his surprise.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his eyebrows in astoundment. What did this mean? Was she preparing to honey trap him? Don\u2019t be like this, beauty. I\u2019m already not heterosexual. I won\u2019t be tempted no matter how you smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I won\u2019t be able to win this match no matter how hard I try. The disparity in strength is too large.\u201d The woman opened her mouth and said. Not only did her tone have no nervousness, it was also a little blithe.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo continued to raise his eyebrows. This sort of preparing to admit defeat pacing, what kind of ruckus was she trying to start?</p><br/><p>The woman sighed in relief and stared at him with a smile that was yet not a smile, \u201cI believe that Sire is also not a person who would have tender and protective feelings for the fairer sex. It\u2019s not necessary to compete since I know that I will lose.\u201d Then she turned back to the referee, \u201cI admit defeat for this match.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nature of proactively admitting defeat and rejecting a match were different so there was no need to deduct points.</p><br/><p>Once this sentence was said, a burst of sighs rang from the spectator seats.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

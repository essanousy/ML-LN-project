The amount generated in the spiritual water lake had already decreased by a third.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hadn\u2019t expected the dimension to change so much after not going in for just such a short time. At first he had believed that the crack wouldn\u2019t really be a problem, but reality proved that he was too optimistic. Based on the spiritual water lake\u2019s output, no matter how much he tried to save the spiritual water, one day it would run out.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo got several white hairs just from worrying about the situation. The dimension was his lifeline, and if it was destroyed, it was very hard for him to imagine what life would be like after. Without a large supply of magic herbs, how would he survive?</p><br/><p>He was already used to the existence of the dimension.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked out of the dimension dejectedly. The palace was basically empty; Ling Xiao had gone over to the Weeping Ghost Shore, while Lin ShaoYi and the TongTian Emperor were both over here, so they still had to make some preparations.</p><br/><p>As for PiQiu and the rest, ever since he opened up the Five Blessing Spirit Eye for them to cultivate with, those fellows all ran behind the palace, obsessed with cultivating.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought a little before detouring over to take a look.</p><br/><p>The Five Blessing Spirit Eye was set up in a hidden chamber that was very expansive. The outside was covered by many layers of barriers that Ling Xiao had arranged. Unless someone got his and Ling Xiao\u2019s permission, it was impossible to enter.</p><br/><p>The door to the hidden chamber was half-open. You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t suspicious, and he pushed open the door before entering. After passing through a hallway, he saw someone inside with their back to him standing next to the Five Blessing Spirit Eye, staring expressionlessly at the brilliant, revolving Spirit Eye. Their gaze was serene and deep, and he didn\u2019t know what they were thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoc?\u201d You XiaoMo called out to him and walked over.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the person was given a fright, and he suddenly turned towards You XiaoMo, a strange panicked look flashing through his eyes quickly. It disappeared very rapidly, and he looked about the same as the usual Giant Roc.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing standing here and not cultivating?\u201d You XiaoMo stopped in front of him and asked curiously. But he wasn\u2019t suspicious about why the Giant Roc was here.</p><br/><p>Even though the Five Blessing Spirit Eye was a rare, fortuitous treasure, and the less people that knew about it meant the safer it was, he was fairly close to his contracted demon beasts, so he basically didn\u2019t need to worry about them betraying him. So during that time when he and Ling Xiao left Xi Jing to go to Zhong Tian, he gave them the privilege to go in to the secret chamber whenever they wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much, I just came to take a look,\u201d the Giant Roc explained with an odd tone to his voice. His eyebrows also imperceptibly twitched once.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo watched him and blinked. \u201cRoc, why do you seem a little strange today? Do you feel unwell somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant Roc shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not unwell.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, smiling, \u201cThat\u2019s good. If something\u2019s wrong, you have to tell me. Oh right, have you seen HunQiu? I was just looking for him, but I couldn\u2019t find him. Do you know where he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was a moment when the Giant Roc couldn\u2019t react in time. When his gaze finally met You XiaoMo\u2019s, he said, flustered, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about HunQiu ah, I haven\u2019t seen him either, he probably went out.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded and said with concern, \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. Then I\u2019ll go find him myself. If you don\u2019t have anything to do, then you should come out as well. Tian Dao is probably looking for you, there\u2019s no need to hurry with cultivating.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant Roc\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them walked out of the hidden chamber together, and You XiaoMo closed the door after them. Behind him, the Giant Roc\u2019s eyes landed on the Five Blessing Spirit Eye with a veiled, unreadable expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa\u2026 Master, if you don\u2019t need me, then I\u2019m going first\u2026\u201d the Giant Roc withdrew his gaze as he immediately told You XiaoMo that.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to rush.\u201d You XiaoMo cut him off and chuckled as he said, \u201cI just happened to be on my way to Weeping Ghost Shore to find Ling Xiao as well. You might as well come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how You XiaoMo immediately turned and left, the Giant Roc frowned very slightly. He wanted to find an excuse to evade him, but he couldn\u2019t come with anything good. If he was too rash, then he would be suspected, so he had no choice but to go with him to the transport circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoc, speaking of which, ever since you became contracted to me, it seems like I haven\u2019t had a good conversation with you before. Where is your home?\u201d You XiaoMo glanced back at him and asked casually.</p><br/><p>The Giant Roc suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo discovered that the footsteps behind him had halted, and when he looked back, he saw that the Giant Roc\u2019s expression was indecipherable. His dark eyes stared straight at You XiaoMo, and it seemed as if there was a tiny trace of devouring chilliness filtering through his gaze. The aura around him changed at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>With a frozen face, the Giant Roc said coldly, \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed. \u201cI found out from the beginning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d \u2018The Giant Roc\u2019 seemed unhappy with this response. His face was filled with another layer of darkness as he watched him frigidly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smirked. \u201cThe Giant Roc is my contracted demon beast. I already said so just now, I\u2019ve basically never had a conversation with him before, so he\u2019s the contracted demon beast that I\u2019m the least close with. As a result, he usually looks at me with respect and deference, do you think you have that? Also, I asked you about HunQiu just then. That was also testing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes someone named HunQiu not exist?\u201d \u2018The Giant Roc\u2019 snorted coldly. He should\u2019ve long since guessed that; how in the world could there be someone with this name? Sure enough, it was a test.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled and waved his finger. \u201cOf course HunQiu exists. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s never been with us. If you were the Giant Roc, you shouldn\u2019t have followed along with what I was saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018The Giant Roc\u2019 lifted his head and laughed loudly. \u201cIt seems like you aren\u2019t stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked steadily at him as his smile faded quite a bit, and a faint pressure exuded from his body, closing straight in on the impersonated Giant Roc. He lowered his voice. \u201cWhere did you put the real Giant Roc?\u201d</p><br/><p>The impersonated Giant Roc retreated many steps back before saying expressionlessly, \u201cI can let him go. Just hand over the Five Blessing Spirit Eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked him up and down. \u201cYour cultivation base isn\u2019t as high as mine. It would be easy to take you down. If you think you can use the Giant Roc to threaten me, you can try it and see what happens. Ling Xiao can absorb someone\u2019s memories; once he returns, even if you don\u2019t tell me, we\u2019ll still know. Do you want to try it and see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like your contracted demon beasts aren\u2019t worth as much as the Five Blessing Spirit Eye in your heart. You\u2019re not treating that Giant Roc sincerely at all, are you?\u201d The fake Giant Roc sneered at him, as if he didn\u2019t care very much about his situation.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted a brow. \u201cAre you preparing to drive a wedge between us? Is the Giant Roc somewhere nearby?\u201d</p><br/><p>The impersonated Giant Roc didn\u2019t expect him to be so sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly are you?\u201d You XiaoMo look at him, eyes burning.</p><br/><p>The impersonated Giant Roc\u2019s gaze darkened, and with a flash of his body, he fled outside extremely rapidly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo only saw a black shadow flash by, and he almost didn\u2019t react in time. The other\u2019s speed was much faster than what he had expected; he had thought that his own speed was fast enough at first, but he hadn\u2019t expected someone to be even faster than him, and he hastily chased after.</p><br/><p>However, though he was fast, You XiaoMo was definitely much more familiar with the palace. Moreover, this palace wasn\u2019t just a palace; there were also a few traps in places. After discovering his path of escape, You XiaoMo immediately triggered the traps in that path.</p><br/><p>That person could still be considered very capable. Before he infiltrated, he had probably already discovered the majority of the palace\u2019s terrain. In addition, he also seemed fairly familiar with the traps, and he ran back and forth like a slippery fish. Every time, You XiaoMo could only glimpse the back of him, as if he was a professional thief.</p><br/><p>Something sparked in You XiaoMo\u2019s mind, but it disappeared before he could catch it.</p><br/><p>They passed through much of the palace like that, one in front, one in back, playing hide and seek.</p><br/><p>Finally, the impersonated Giant Roc was still cut off by You XiaoMo, right when he was fairly close to the main gates of the palace. You XiaoMo didn\u2019t want to fight with him in the palace, so he forced him step by step out of it, and the two of them rushed to the gates after a short while.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf something happened to the Giant Roc, I\u2019ll bury you alive!\u201d You XiaoMo stared at him with a serious expression. As soon as he said that, the person attacked him without responding.</p><br/><p>He was a one star Sacred Realm expert, far from You XiaoMo\u2019s opponent. They had just exchanged a few blows before he started to be at a disadvantage, and a bit of anxiety immediately showed on his face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blocked the gates, and the aura around his body erupted in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo!\u201d At that moment, a slightly familiar voice suddenly came from outside. However, most likely because it had been too long, he couldn\u2019t tell who it was at first listen. You XiaoMo didn\u2019t look back, both of his eyes still glued on the impersonated Giant Roc.</p><br/><p>The voice behind him grew even louder. \u201cYou XiaoMo, I\u2019m Dao Yun. Do you still recognize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Dao Yun?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately remembered. However, during this brief daze, the impersonated Giant Roc immediately ran. Without saying a single word, You XiaoMo rushed over, smashing a fist towards his face. Behind him was Dao Yun\u2019s worried and nervous voice.</p><br/><p>The person swiftly dodged, but You XiaoMo\u2019s fist still brushed his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, stop. You XiaoMo, he\u2019s my shifu, I beg you to let him go!\u201d Dao Yun couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. His worry was indeed not unfounded; his shifu wasn\u2019t You XiaoMo\u2019s opponent at all. The moment he was discovered, it definitely wouldn\u2019t end well, so Dao Yun had hurriedly rushed over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Dao Yun\u2019s shifu the Thief God from the Ten Gods?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

A little further was the grand plaza, but that was when Ling Xiao slowed down his flying speed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo realized this abnormality and surprised, looked up and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao slightly squinted his eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t you see that the atmosphere around the TianXin Sect changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, You XiaoMo took a deep breath and just as he was about to speak, \u2018bam\u2019 a hand gently hit his head\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat hurts\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo said as tears flowed down his face like noodles and covered his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid, you think you can smell atmosphere?\u201d Ling Xiao laughingly yelled.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him piteously, he was being creative okay!</p><br/><p>Just in the two days they had left, someone had come to make trouble for the TianXin Sect and the place of the incident was that grand plaza. Even from far away they could tell there were two sides facing off and one, obviously, was Zhou Peng and the others.</p><br/><p>Once You XiaoMo could see clearly who those picking a fight was, his jaw nearly dropped to the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, why would those people be here?\u201d You XiaoMo exclaimed as he realized that those who should have been at Yan City were, in fact, here at TianXin Sect. He couldn\u2019t have been seeing ghosts in the middle of the day, right?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao quirked his eyebrows and said, \u201cLook like they followed us here.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied in disbelief, \u201cIf they were following us, how could you not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this Ling Xiao explained, \u201cTransport circles have different timings, no matter how far-reaching I am, I wouldn\u2019t be able to find out that they were on a different transport circle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once they had arrived at the South they didn\u2019t find anyone stalking them so that was the only explanation.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was about as strong as Dong Shen, there was no way he would miss them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo reluctantly accepted this explanation, but if that was the case then they could be fairly certain the one who came to pick on the TianXin Sect last time was them too.</p><br/><p>They arrived not too early and not too late. The fight at the plaza was reaching its climax. Even though the TianXin Sect had the help of the Bird of Pride, they were still at a disadvantage. This was only because the young man had a life-bound contract level nine demon beast and there was an Imperial level practitioner too. The set-up was very strong.</p><br/><p>Although LanQiu was level ten, he was still lower than the middle-aged man. It was only because he was a demon beast that he could even compete with the man, however as time went on, the difference was becoming more apparent.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, the young man smiled triumphantly, \u201cBy opposing this young master, your fate has already been decided. Even if you get on your knees and beg now, it would be of no use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Suddenly, a light laugh could be heard beside his ear.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s face changed. As he was about to dodge, a sharp blade pressed against the skin on his slender neck. The cold yet sharp reflection felt as if it would slice through his flesh.</p><br/><p>That laughter sounded again, \u201cEh? Young Master, why aren\u2019t you running?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s face turned livid.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo walked over to the young man and showed a brilliant smile, \u201cBy opposing this young master, your fate has already been decided. Even if you get on your knees and beg now, I wouldn\u2019t let you go easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>In return the young man stared at him ruthlessly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo smiled. He loved using their words against them, you can\u2019t not be pissed.</p><br/><p>As he finished, he shouted towards the others who were still fighting ferociously, \u201cThat uncle over there, stop fighting or else I\u2019ll make a mistake and leave a wound on your young master\u2019s neck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the young master in the enemy\u2019s hand, the middle-aged man showed a slight mishap and LanQiu took the opportunity to attack, making him throw up blood. When LanQiu wanted to continue, the middle-aged man did not want to fight anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave young master alone!\u201d a teenager shouted towards You XiaoMo who was holding the young man hostage.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him with contempt, only an idiot would let go.</p><br/><p>Suddenly Ling Xiao spoke, \u201cAh, sorry, my hand shook a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the teen saw the young master\u2019s neck being slashed by the blade and hot red blood dripping, he immediately stopped talking. He didn\u2019t dare make anymore rash movements.</p><br/><p>Laughingly You XiaoMo said, \u201cThat\u2019s how it should be, if we must talk, it should be done seated. Why all the yelling, don\u2019t you know we are easily afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teen felt blood in his mouth. You are easily scared but kept the young master hostage?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys want?\u201d The middle-aged man had an ugly expression. Of course, anyone who had the absolute advantage before suddenly losing it to the enemy probably wouldn\u2019t have a good expression.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied, \u201cSimple, just surrender.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the middle-aged man could speak, the young man angrily replied, \u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao moved the blade threatening the young man away, and his surprised expression showed as one of his hands was cut off. Fresh, red blood shot out, a little chilling.</p><br/><p>The young man let out a sound of horror.</p><br/><p>Even You XiaoMo trembled a little, he just wanted Ling Xiao to show the young man a little something, but he didn\u2019t think Ling Xiao would shred off his right hand.</p><br/><p>A shrilling and cruel voice sounded out by the young man, \u201cUncle Cheng, kill them for me, I want them dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he finished, his other hand was also cut of by Ling Xiao. This time slower as he first cut off each finger one by one before slicing off the whole hand. That way, the pain was intensified a hundred fold.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was assigned to protect the young man, so he couldn\u2019t watch him get hurt. In the end, he still surrendered, not before LanQiu gave him a slap.</p><br/><p>The young man was still screaming, so You XiaoMo raised his hand to give him a knock on the head. All was silent again.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sealed the spiritual power of the middle-aged man and two other Imperial practitioners then threw them into an underground cell.</p><br/><p>So, like this, the grand battle seceded.</p><br/><p>Originally Zhou Peng thought that it was going to be a tough fight, not expecting Da ShiXiong to arrive on time. If it wasn\u2019t for them, the TianXin Sect could have suffered severely. And those who threatened the TianXin Sect were finally eradicated, so the tension from over the past few days was removed. Zhou Peng and Ye Han\u2019s hearts could finally be at peace again.</p><br/><p>After You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao consolidated with each other, they decided to take the young man\u2019s group with them. They didn\u2019t plan on staying for long anyways. They had only a month of break.</p><br/><p>The next day, before You XiaoMo left, he shoved a bottle of magic pills to Zhao DaZhou. Those pills could help him train, to level up, as well as the cute little tiger.</p><br/><p>So, after bidding farewell, they left the TianXin Sect, but they weren\u2019t in a hurry to return.</p><br/><p>On the road to Nan Ye City, Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo went into the dimension together. In there were the four prisoners who had their spiritual power sealed.</p><br/><p>They still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock yet.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man looked at Ling Xiao with fear. He actually misjudged, this masked man was actually a practitioner above him. He could tell from the dimension.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day on Lei Tian Platform, the one who ruined our plans was you?\u201d as he remembered their relationship with Zhao DaZhou, the middle-aged man finally remembered this incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re correct, it was me.\u201d Ling Xiao generously admitted.</p><br/><p>The young man regretted his decision. If he had known the TianXin Sect had someone this strong, he wouldn\u2019t have followed so ruthlessly. He had always thought that Uncle Chen\u2019s strength was the pinnacle at this realm.</p><br/><p>Knowing that they had no advantage, the middle-aged man asked, \u201cWhat do you guys really want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao let out a laugh.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said with a little smile, \u201cI almost forgot, my name is You XiaoMo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of four, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he had saw nothing, You XiaoMo went on, \u201cI heard you guys were looking for me, what is it that you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man\u2019s expression shifted a little, as if he remembered something.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew they weren\u2019t going to talk so easily but, he was in no hurry, they had plenty of time.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao went straight to the point, \u201cI\u2019ll ask, and you answer. If you don\u2019t or you lie, one question is one hand. If we run out, it\u2019ll be your feet next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Remembering how this man, with an unchanging expression cut off his hand, the young man shivered and bought himself closer to himself. Although he could grow it back with Bone Growth Pill, it would still extremely painful. Growing up without a worry, he wouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate that kind of pain.</p><br/><p>Before Ling Xiao spoke again, You XiaoMo had a lightbulb moment and stopped him, \u201cI have a good idea that can prevent them from lying!\u201d</p><br/><p>In return, Ling Xiao rose an eyebrow, \u201cWhat idea?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo answered, \u201cWe each interrogate one, if their answers are different then they\u2019re lying.\u201d Only the young man and the middle-aged man seemed to know something, so they just had to focus on them.</p><br/><p>With a little laugh and a smirk Ling Xiao said, \u201cNot a bad idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Ling Xiao took the middle-aged man to another room for interrogation.</p><br/><p>With this, You XiaoMo walked over to the young man who was pale from blood loss and said, \u201cWhere did you guys come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man closed his eyes, he thought You XiaoMo was going to ask why they captured him and answered, \u201cA higher realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The answer might as well be blank, both useless.</p><br/><p>So, You XiaoMo asked again, \u201cWhy do you want to capture me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not knowing what the young man was thinking, You XiaoMo assumed that he didn\u2019t want to answer and continued, \u201cI have never cut of someone\u2019s toes before, I might be a little clumsy, so bear with me okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately the young man replied, \u201cBecause you have a treasure on you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

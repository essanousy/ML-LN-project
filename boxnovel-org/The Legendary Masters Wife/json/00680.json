Did he have to watch him himself so that he wouldn\u2019t run off somewhere?</p><br/><p>At the same time, faraway from the plaza, above the steep and rocky mountain stood two figures. One was Ling Xiao, who You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t find and the other wasn\u2019t a stranger to him either. He was Fang Yang, the one who threw the black needles was him.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ling Xiao was tight on his heels, Fang Yang didn\u2019t show any sort of fear, rather he looked at him with glee. Laughing out loud he shouted, \u201cYou were fooled!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao calmly looked back. He wasn\u2019t sure when, but there stood a figure with his hands behind his back as he stood against the wind. He had a handsome face that couldn\u2019t be more familiar and stood there proudly. His dominating presence was even stronger than before, when they saw the blood shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe meet again.\u201d Lin ShaoYi said with a carefree expression. His lips curled into a unscrupulous smile, his eyes spoke of ease, but with one look, the aggressive arrogance of his could not be ignored.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao slightly raised an eyebrow, \u201cYou lured me here on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d Lin ShaoYi said with his lips curled up, \u201cMy intention was you all along, those black needles were made by Fang Yang on my orders too. It was all to lure you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him calmly, \u201cOh, you want to kill me before the competition ends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi knew what he meant and wasn\u2019t agitated at all, instead he smiled with arrogance, \u201cI never cared about that pact we made. If it wasn\u2019t for those two old farts pressuring me, you think I would have followed some \u2018rules\u2019? I know you\u2019re thinking of the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou came to say you aren\u2019t afraid of them anymore so you want to break the contract?\u201d Ling Xiao said as his eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi looked at him as if he was naive, \u201cWhat, you think I would have kept to the rules? Maybe I thought too highly of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Ling Xiao replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be thinking, why I\u2019m here even though I\u2019ve been grounded by the Qilin Lord?\u201d Lin ShaoYi was in no hurry to take care of Ling Xiao, as he said before, he never considered him an equal. Even if he did defeat the TongTian Emperor, that didn\u2019t mean he acknowledged him.</p><br/><p>If You XiaoMo heard this, he would\u2019ve have snorted in contempt.</p><br/><p>Although he and Ling Xiao were both of the Qilin Clan, with a bit of a blood connection, but who was he? Why would Ling Xiao need his acknowledgment?</p><br/><p>Who did he think he was!?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to fight then fight.\u201d Ling Xiao said as he looked up at the clear sky. His wife was about to finish, if he didn\u2019t hurry back on time this time, his wife would definitely get angry at him.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi gaze chilled, Ling Xiao always had the ability to piss him off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you can escape this time? This was a trap especially made for you. If it doesn\u2019t keep you here than I\u2019m not Lin ShaoYi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen prepare to get your name changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are confident, lets see how long that confidence lasts.\u201d The one who followed up Ling Xiao\u2019s words wasn\u2019t Lin ShaoYi but rather a dark shadow that appeared behind a mountain top, behind Lin ShaoYi. The shadow firmly landed beside Lin ShaoYi.</p><br/><p>Beneath the black cloak appeared the sickly expression of TongTian Emperor\u2019s handsome face. Ever since he was hurt by Ling Xiao\u2019s attack, his wounds hadn\u2019t been able to completely heal. Not only that, the destruction of his domain was a heavy blow to him as well. At that point, he hadn\u2019t known Ling Xiao had used the same move against You AnTai, thus he wasn\u2019t prepared and got hit directly.</p><br/><p>It was only after that he remembered Ling Xiao was half Demon Phoenix Clan, and they had the ability of rebirth, self-destructing their domain wasn\u2019t as harmful for them.</p><br/><p>After that, his underlings decreased a lot because of him too, he always kept that in mind, waiting for the day to get his revenge. When Lin ShaoYi found him, he had actually expected it. He had long heard of what happened in Dong Zhou and Xi Jing, and since they had the same aim, without clashing interests, then working together was for the best.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s expression darkened as he stared at Lin ShaoYi and the TongTian Emperor.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Xiao like this, both of them felt a feeling of joy from the bottom of their hearts. Especially Lin ShaoYi, he had been attacked by Ling Xiao\u2019s nonchalant expression for so long, that even in his dreams he dreamed of a day where his expression would change. Now, he finally got his wish.</p><br/><p>Immediately, Lin ShaoYi\u2019s feeling went through the roof.</p><br/><p>A moment later, three incredibly strong forces rose to the sky. An almost heart crushing pressure quickly spread out.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang quickly got away from them, it wasn\u2019t till he was really far away did he stop. He looked at the scene with lingering fear. It was the first time he had witnessed three powerhouses explode in pressure at the same time, it was a shocking scene. If he didn\u2019t react quickly, he probably would have been bleeding all over by now.</p><br/><p>Once he was safe, Fang Yang looked at the three\u2019s tangled shadows with fervor. As if the sky shook and the earth shattered, with a drastic change, the mountain ranges nearby exploded into pieces. That was the power of an expert at the pinnacle. Some day, he would also reach that realm.</p><br/><p>Two seven stars against a six star, if he told it to anyone else, they probably wouldn\u2019t believe him, but it actually happened. Every hit shook the sky and earth. If they weren\u2019t deep into the mountains, away from the plaza, by now, the two major Associations would\u2019ve definitely appeared.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s expression became more and more serious. If it was only Lin ShaoYi, he could definitely escape intact. Before this, he didn\u2019t think someone as egotistical as him would join forces with the TongTian Emperor. One mistake led him into this dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>A massive fire QiLin roared as it charged towards Lin ShaoYi. The purple and red fire QiLin rushed against each other, the flame\u2019s heat could even be felt from afar. Anyone closer probably would\u2019ve felt their body burning.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Lin ShaoYi simply let out a cold chuckle. Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t the only one with a mutated flame on this continent. With a roar, two flames rose to the sky above his head, it turned into an identical fire QiLin as Ling Xiao\u2019s. It\u2019s pressure even felt slightly above Ling Xiao\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Ling Xiao furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>As a purebred Qilin Clan member, Lin ShaoYi actually had the Demon Phoenix Godfire!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Ling Xiao thought of the disappearing Four Ancient Beast Clan member, his brow tightened even further. Looks like he underestimated Lin ShaoYi, to reach his aim, he would actually do something like that and he had planned it for a long time. From the look of things, he had succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurprised? Today is your last day!\u201d Seeing his slightly shocked expression, Lin ShaoYi smiled insolently. His hair and cloak had caught the wind, as if demons were dancing.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long before the two fire QiLin tangled together, roaring, devouring and tearing each other apart. Probably because there was a slight difference in strength, Ling Xiao\u2019s fire QiLin looked to be on the verge of disappearing.</p><br/><p>Just as Ling Xiao was about to increase his strength, a black light bypassed his ear. Behind him, TongTian Emperor came attacking him, so he could only turn around to deal with him.</p><br/><p>Even though the TongTian Emperor was hurt, his strength was still there. Not only that, his main objective was to stall Ling Xiao, to mess with him so that he couldn\u2019t fully concentrate, that was enough.</p><br/><p>On the other side, without his master\u2019s attention, Ling Xiao\u2019s fire QiLin finally disappeared, devoured by Lin ShaoYi\u2019s Qilin. Only a flicker of a flame was left.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s body shook for a moment. The fire Qilin was made from his true fire, once it was devoured, it more or less effected him as well. Other than the last time against You ZhenTian, he rarely had this kind of feeling. His gaze became even colder.</p><br/><p>His figure instantly backed hundreds of meters away from the other two.</p><br/><p>Neither Lin ShaoYi nor the TongTian Emperor chased immediately. In their eyes, Ling Xiao was a sitting duck.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run.\u201d Lin ShaoYi declared calmly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes narrowed, but he didn\u2019t become frightened or scared just because he was at a disadvantage. If two flames didn\u2019t work, then three. The flames within in his body came bursting out once again, its loud entrance was earth shaking.</p><br/><p>Lin ShaoYi didn\u2019t think he would try again, and by the looks of things, with another fire Qilin. With a cold laugh he said, \u201cNo matter how many times you try, the answer\u2019s still the same. If you want to die so fast then I\u2019ll grant you your wish!\u201d After that, another impressive power came from within his body, almost the same as Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>He was at seven stars, of course his fire Qilin was stronger than a six star. However, just as his fire Qilin was about to take form, a vast, endless force erupted in a gold light with Ling Xiao as the center. It quickly hit his fire Qilin and after a bit of turmoil, they merged as one.</p><br/><p>Instantly, both Lin ShaoYi and the TongTian Emperor\u2019s expressions changed.</p><br/><p>Now the gold embedded fire Qilin was more than double the strength of the previous fire Qilin and that was only with the addition of another power.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Breath of the True Dragon?\u201d Lin ShaoYi cried out involuntarily.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had the True Dragon Clan\u2019s blood? How could that be!?</p><br/><p>Could it be that like him, Ling Xiao took the blood of the Four Ancient Beast Clan\u2019s infants and exchanged a blood transfusion with himself?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

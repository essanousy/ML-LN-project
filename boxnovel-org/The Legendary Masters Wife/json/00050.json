But unexpectedly not only does he not detest You XiaoMo, he actually finds the him that is this way very lovable, so much so that he sometimes can\u2019t stop himself from teasing him, deriving great pleasure from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, if you don\u2019t want to die, you have to listen to me obediently, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raises the corners of his mouth and says in delight.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately nods his head as if he\u2019s pounding garlic. Now, his life is already in his hands. Even if he doesn\u2019t understand _______ he still has to pretend to understand!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stands up and walks a few steps. He turns back towards You XiaoMo that is following his every move: \u201cFrom now on, don\u2019t let anyone besides me see the blue water drop on your chest. This is very important. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstand!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nods his head vigorously. Although he very much wants to tell him that it\u2019s not a blue water drop but a blue teardrop, after thinking it over for a bit, he decides to let that rot in his stomach. After all the shape of a water drop and teardrop are pretty much the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the magic herbs planted in this dimension. When the time comes, you can take out a few but not too much to avoid attracting the attention of observant people. Furthermore, the reason why you can refine over a hundred magic pills in a day is due to the effect of the lake water. If an observant person wants to investigate you, sooner or later they will find out that something is not right. So from today onwards you must not overdo it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao instructs him word by word with a serious tone that he has never used before.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo also knows how important it is so he agrees to all of them. After committing all these to memory, You XiaoMo suddenly thinks of another issue and asks hastily: \u201cElder brother Ling, can I still drink that magic water?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao thinks it over briefly, \u201cYes, but you must not hand over the magic pills too early. You should at least wait one or two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>There\u2019s no need for a detailed explanation, You XiaoMo knows what he means. The last time, he took one thousand and two hundred magic herbs and finished them off in four days. This speed is really too fast. For a disciple with his innate talent, it is quite abnormal.</p><br/><p>After going through all the details, Ling Xiao casts his gaze on the large field of magic herbs in front. The colorful magic herbs are growing quite well, quite unlike those the original Lin Xiao had seen before. The ones that Lin Xiao had seen were the magic herbs of Heaven peak. Because he is the elder disciple of the Grand Master and because Tang YunQi is the daughter of the Grand Master, so based on this relationship, Lin Xiao is rather close to Heaven peak. Before, when he visits Heaven peak, the disciples and seniors did not treat him cautiously just because he is from the warrior division. But this may no longer be the case now.</p><br/><p>Recently, the rumors that he is very close to You XiaoMo is very rampant. On top of that, You XiaoMo is now a direct disciple to Kong Wen. It\u2019s hard to say if there will be those that read more into it. But Ling Xiao has not gone over to Heaven peak for some time so he doesn\u2019t know if those people have changed they attitude towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe area of this land in this dimension is quite large. Are you planning on using that piece of land to grow magic herbs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao surveys the dimension. The area of this dimension is actually not considered small. Just that small lake is as big as Heaven peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I actually plan to use the whole area to plant magic herbs. But, <i>uh</i>, there\u2019s too many weeds, I still haven\u2019t finished clearing them.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lowers his head, his cheeks blushing shamefully. It has already been ten days but he only has one pair of hands. His time is usually spent refining magic pills, basically leaving him with no spare time to weed. On top of that, he was in seclusion for four days before this, not even having the time to harvest the mature magic herbs, let alone weeding.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiven your efficiency, you may not even finish it in a year\u2019s time.\u201d Ling Xiao says indifferently, glancing at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo can\u2019t refute it. This dimension is so big. It is true that he may not be able to clear all the weeds in a year\u2019s time. Thinking it over, he then asks cautiously: \u201cThen do you have any ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>A gentle smile like the spring breeze suddenly blooms on Ling Xiao\u2019s face, \u201cNot just anyone can get the great me to lend a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts, \u201cHow many magic pills do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty. And the best kind.\u201d Ling Xiao says without the slightest bit of shame.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grimaces. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be a small demand. Twenty magic pills, of the best quality at that. With his current ability, it would probably take a day. Luckily the magic herbs in his dimension is already mature. This way, he wouldn\u2019t have to continuously go to the Hall of Enchanted Herbs to get magic herbs. He also doesn\u2019t have to hand over half so it will save him quite a bit of time.</p><br/><p>In the end, You XiaoMo exchanges twenty top quality level one magic pills for Ling Xiao\u2019s effort.</p><br/><p>Then a shocking scene unfolds. From where did he conjure up tornadoes? Several small tornadoes appear out of thin air, and purposefully wreaks havoc in the dimension. Everywhere they go, all the weeds are uprooted. You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t even need to further prepare the land. In under an hour, other than where they are standing, and that field of magic herbs, every other inch appears to have met with some disaster, in a complete mess \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>________________________________________<wbr>__________I don\u2019t speak Chinese.

Although I don\u2019t want to give out spoilers but this seems to be important to readers so \u2026. This story is really just an adventure story. The bl stuff is just a side note. The steamy stuff is really next to zero in this story. Maybe once or twice in over seven hundred chapters. So please don\u2019t expect it! It\u2019s very light reading, the complete opposite of .</p><br/>\n</div>"}

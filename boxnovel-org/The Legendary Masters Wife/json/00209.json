He then suddenly gave an ambiguous smile. He moved next to You XiaoMo, making the distance between them closer, so close that their eyelashes met each other.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could feel Ling Xiao\u2019s breath on his face. He began to blush, fortunately it was nighttime, even if his face was red no one would see. Seeing Ling Xiao looking at him without saying anything, You XiaoMo placed his hand on Ling Xiao\u2019s chest and pushed, \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao placed his hair over his ear, *haha* he laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t show you my true face, but\u2026.what will you do in exchange?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing those words, You XiaoMo had an urge to swear, why did he have to pay just to see his face? Like he would believe Ling Xiao would use Lin Xiao\u2019s face everyday after, but\u2026he was super curious <i>ah</i>, he really wanted to know what his original look was like.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitated for a long time, then cautiously asked, \u201cThat\u2026.what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his reluctant words, Ling Xiao withheld his laughter, as he pointed to his lips and said, \u201cIf you take the initiative to kiss me, I will let you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo bit his lower lip, his eyes flashed as he seemed to think about the pros and cons.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t urge him, he lay on the grass waiting for his decision.</p><br/><p>Seeing his \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what your answer is\u201d attitude, You XiaoMo clenched his teeth, he checked around first, and then when he sure no one was looking, he sat up, crawled toward Ling Xiao and gave his lips a peck. This was the first time he took the initiative in kissing.</p><br/><p>When he thought the kiss was long enough, he didn\u2019t think that by the time he wanted to move away, Ling Xiao\u2019s hand was already on the back of his head and suddenly those lips that had just left were now touching again.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao directly pried open his teeth, as his tongue flexibly occupied inside, turning that peck into a deep kiss, his tongue licked every corner inside You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth, only when his face started going red did Ling Xiao let him go.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Momo, this is what you call kissing!\u201d Ling Xiao licked his lips and laughed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo heavily breathed in and out while wiping the saliva at the corner of his mouth. This kiss nearly made his heart beat out of his chest, \u201cCan you now let me see your real face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lowered his voice as he laughed, \u201cOh, you really want to see it that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I \u2026\u201d Xiao Mo raised his head, and when he saw Ling Xiao\u2019s face, he became speechless. His eyes went blank as if his soul had left his body, and it took awhile before that glazed look left.</p><br/><p>This man, no wonder even when his identity was revealed, he still didn\u2019t bring his true face to light. Turned out it was too bewitching. His appearance was exceedingly outstanding and handsome, so enchanting and sexy but it didn\u2019t lose the masculinity. Like a god descending to the mundane world. His gentle smile was dazzling and warm like the sun, even those sparkling stars could not compete with him, of course, this was before he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>If he had this look, he would need a mask everyday.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have one to show off.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao saw his foolish expression, he couldn\u2019t help but give an elegant smile. His slender finger lifted up You XiaoMo\u2019s head, his lazy eyes filled with passion as they stared at You XiaoMo. \u201cXiao Momo, are you being enchanted by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally got back his soul. He covered his mouth with a guilty conscience as he turned away, \u201cI am not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Ling Xiao moved closer as he smiled, \u201cBut I see your face is red like a ripe apple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour eyes must be wrong then.\u201d You XiaoMo cast aside his hand, he turned his back around to stop looking at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Of course how could Ling Xiao let You XiaoMo escape, the more he resisted the more he couldn\u2019t hide. Ling Xiao simply embraced his whole body under his arms, they both rolled over as Ling Xiao put him under his body. He rubbed his face on You XiaoMo\u2019s hot cheek, very maliciously saying, \u201cStill saying no? Your cheek is so hot, obviously someone was enchanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolled his eyes as he stared at that handsome face, he couldn\u2019t control his heart from rampaging. It went <i>thump thump thump</i> violently. He was so done now, he really had feelings for him.</p><br/><p>In his past life, he had never gone through anything called love, but it was not like he couldn\u2019t understand the feeling. He knew what this unnatural heartbeat meant, but because he knew what it was, he felt that he might get sick. Ling Xiao is a man <i>ah</i>.</p><br/><p>To make matters worse, not only had he kissed this man everyday, but also not long ago, he had sex with him. Wouldn\u2019t that make him homosexual?</p><br/><p>This conclusion made You XiaoMo stop thinking. He had lived for nearly 20 years but he never thought he would like a man. Of course, it was not that he looked down on homosexuals, but he still felt a little strange.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at twisted face and he could roughly guess at what was running inside You XiaoMo\u2019s head. He tightly hugged You XiaoMo\u2019s waist, \u201cXiao Momo, how do you feel about how I usually treat you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted up his head, thought a little, then seriously said, \u201cBad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao (-_-\u201c), he chopped You XiaoMo\u2019s head, \u201cI\u2019m not playing around, answer seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt aggrieved, that was his sincere answer after some serious thought. In his opinion, Ling Xiao was indeed a very bad character, not to mention he spun him around every single time. Teasing him was his pastime, obviously his happiness was built on his suffering. Well, those words absolutely were something that he must never tell Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>He thought a little, and he unwillingly forced out a fake answer, \u201cYou are very nice to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the answer, Ling Xiao gave a satisfactory smile, then he asked, \u201cDid you like what I did to you last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo burst into shame, he was not sure if his face was still red from before, or if those words made him red again. He frowned and didn\u2019t answer his question.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pinched his ass, \u201cTalk, or else we are doing it here tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at him, could he treat this as a threat?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled as he winked at him, the hand placed on his butt didn\u2019t move an inch. He was even daring enough to shift down to You XiaoMo\u2019s thigh. You XiaoMo was so scared, he quickly clenched his butt cheeks together and surrendered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will talk okay? Take your hand off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao showed a regretful look, actually he had hoped that You XiaoMo would persist a little longer.</p><br/><p>How could You XiaoMo not see the \u201cambition of a wild wolf\u201d (t/n: ill intention, vicious thought), he flew into a rage out of humiliation as he glared at Ling Xiao. But then shamefully lowered down his head and whispered, \u201cL\u2026.Like\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo dragged out the sentence, how could Ling Xiao not see through his motive, he pinched and then rubbed You XiaoMo\u2019s sensitive spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI liked it!\u201d You XiaoMo was stimulated and immediately yelled.</p><br/><p>And then everyone all turned around to see them, although they couldn\u2019t see their faces, but people noticed it was two men, then the whispering started. If anyone came here then it must be to view the stars. If you came as a pair then you must be lovers. Even if it wasn\u2019t, it was unlikely to see two men who came here together, some couldn\u2019t help but doubt their relationship.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face turned red, he admitted that he liked to play around and kiss Ling Xiao. He certainly liked to be together with him and he had almost accepted the fact that he was in love with Ling Xiao, but to publicly confess it, he was not that brave.</p><br/><p>Even though Ling Xiao said that two men can be together, he is not dumb. In this world, straight couples were the thing, not gay couples.</p><br/><p>After he pushed Ling Xiao away, You XiaoMo crawled up and ran away.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stood up, dusted away all the grass blades off his clothes, and immediately pursued the lost lamb.</p><br/><p>He was caught right away, and Ling Xiao\u2019s strong arms surrounded his constantly struggling body. \u201cOkay okay, not playing with you anymore, the sky is already seen, let\u2019s go back to the tavern.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his head, when he was about to speak, a line of gasping continuously broke out. Only now did You XiaoMo realize Ling Xiao didn\u2019t change back to Lin Xiao\u2019s face, no wonder he attracted so much attention. Seeing more and more onlookers stare with lusty eyes toward Ling Xiao, he immediately grabbed Ling Xiao\u2019s hand and pulled him back to the tavern.</p><br/><p>When they got back to their room, after closing the door You XiaoMo straightforwardly pointed at the lack of interest Ling Xiao had and criticized, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you change back your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took a sip of tea, he leaned his head to the side, indifferently saying, \u201cWhy should I change back?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo came over, stole away his cup and drank it empty without hesitation. He went quiet for a few minutes, then pushed back the cup into Ling Xiao\u2019s hand, unwillingly saying, \u201d A man\u2019s beauty is a sin.\u201d</p><br/><p><b>T/n: the original idiom is </b><b></b><b>, means a woman beauty is the root of all trouble, with the char </b><b></b><b> ( pink), a metaphor for woman, but in here, You XiaoMo change to </b><b></b><b> ( blue), indicated male\u2019s role. XD clever You XiaoMo.</b></p><br/><p>Ling Xiao found it so funny, he then picked up the teapot again and poured another cup, then he drank right at the spot You XiaoMo just put his lip, and then ambiguously looked at him. He said, \u201cRest assured, I only love to sin with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blushed again, he made a *tsk* sound to cover the thump thump of his heartbeat. He would never admit that hearing that sentence made him super happy.</p><br/><p>From next door came the sound of a heavy object landing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Did Ling Xiao really think that he was a three-year-old child? No matter how lousy he was, he knew that it was impossible for the Bird of Pride to have said this. He could not refrain from suspiciously squinting at Ling Xiao, \u201cWhat in the world was he saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the Bird of Pride furiously roared, \u201cYou are definitely not the Emperor Beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After quite a while, Ling Xiao helplessly admitted, \u201cActually he\u2019s crazy in the head.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was at a loss for words, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to cure him if he\u2019s crazy ah, if not how will he be my contracted beast? No, wait, I don\u2019t want to contract with a demon beast that\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao cajoled, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go into your dimension first and come out two minutes later?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at him, \u201cWhy do I have to go into my dimension? Just put me down, I\u2019ll wait there for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hesitated for a moment, \u201cAll right, but call SheQiu out.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo would have discovered the problem if he was too insistent.</p><br/><p>After safely putting You XiaoMo down onto a grassy patch, Ling Xiao immediately rolled up his sleeves for battle as he prepared to get rid of the Bird of Pride. Who permitted you to shoot your mouth?</p><br/><p>After the Bird of Pride had discovered Ling Xiao\u2019s identity, he took advantage of the time when the two descended to make a hasty escape. He was not even able to defeat the Emperor Beast, don\u2019t even mention one that was above the Emperor Beast. Though the Bird of Pride was prideful, he knew when to cut his losses. If one couldn\u2019t beat them then one should run \u2013 this was a characteristic of the Seven Sins Beasts.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Xiao would never easily let off someone who had nearly exposed his identity.</p><br/><p>With one figure in front and one behind, the two quickly vanished into the horizon.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hid in the underbrush while occasionally sticking his head out and looking around. He had not planned on calling SheQiu out. Still, the Uneven Slope was very dangerous and he did not want Ling Xiao to worry, so he took SheQiu out of the dimension.</p><br/><p>SheQiu\u2019s level was ever more sophisticated. He immediately noticed when You XiaoMo\u2019s intent arose.</p><br/><p>After coming out, he looked at the surrounding situation with no surprise at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Boss?\u201d SheQiu asked.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo dully supported his chin, \u201cHe went to chase the Bird of Pride. He should be back very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu was astonished, \u201cThe Bird of Pride, one of the Seven Sins Beasts? Who would have thought that a Seven Sins Beasts would exist on the Long Xiang Continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly became very energetic after hearing him say as such, \u201cWhat does that mean? Are you saying that the Seven Sins Beasts are not a local specialty of the Long Xiang Continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>A local specialty? The corner of SheQiu\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><br/><p>All right, this term was not entirely inaccurate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Long Xiang Continent is only a Middle Level Realm. The Seven Sins Beasts which are only second to the Emperor Beasts were originally living in a Higher Level Realm, but everything is not absolute.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew of the Emperor Beasts. To speak frankly, it was just about the same as the pinnacle of the aristocracy in the human race. It was only that the Emperor Beasts had a pressure emitting from its blood and the aristocrats did not have that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Higher Level Realm that awesome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, there are two differences in the Higher Level Realm and Middle Level Realm. The first is in the spiritual energy. For realms on a higher plane of existence, their spiritual energy would be denser, leading to a faster speed of cultivation. The second is related to strength. The Middle Level Realm receives a restriction due to its location, so the people here will never be able to breakthrough to a higher realm. You will know this after you go to a Higher Level Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so certain that I would go to a Higher Level Realm?\u201d You XiaoMo saw that SheQiu seemed to be seriously convinced that he would definitely go there in the future, thus he could not help but be curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you not know that the Boss is from a Higher Level Realm?\u201d SheQiu asked in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo I didn\u2019t\u2026 \u2026\u201d You XiaoMo replied. But he always had a faint inkling in the back of his mind so he did not feel too surprised when he heard SheQiu say as such. You XiaoMo had never believed that the Long Xiang Continent would be able to produce such a person like Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>SheQiu did not feel that he had said anything extraordinary and indifferently stated, \u201cNow you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo mused over it before he asked again, \u201cJust now, that Bird of Pride said this as he looked at Ling Xiao, \u2018You are definitely not the Emperor Beast\u2019. Do you know what these words mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu was taken aback but he pretended to be indifferent so as not to let You XiaoMo discover any lapses, \u201cIt was probably that he didn\u2019t believe that a human practitioner would actually be stronger than him. He had thought that only the Emperor Beasts would be able to suppress him, so he felt that this was impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d You XiaoMo accepted this explanation when it was combined with the fact that the Seven Sins Beasts were only second to the Emperor Beasts.</p><br/><p>SheQiu inwardly wiped away his cold sweat, what a fortunate escape!</p><br/><p>The two\u2019s conversations had lasted for two minutes. Just as they had finished talking, the sound of the wind whistling was suddenly heard approaching from far and the mass appeared to be reaching the airspace above the Uneven Slope soon.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought that Ling Xiao was back and became delighted. He stood up and was about to walk out when SheQiu abruptly grabbed his shoulder as his expression slightly changed, \u201cNo, wait a moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 \u2026Hmmph\u2026 \u2026\u201d You XiaoMo was just about to ask when SheQiu covered his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one approaching is not Boss.\u201d SheQiu whispered to him while looking extremely imposing. It appeared that the one approaching had ill intent. SheQiu was strong. But with how fearful SheQiu was of the other party, it was evident that that person\u2019s strength was above SheQiu.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately quieted down.</p><br/><p>As the master, he knew SheQiu\u2019s strength best. SheQiu was already a peak seven star level nine demon beast, who would be able to have a breakthrough with just a little more time. Although he couldn\u2019t compare with the Bird of Pride, he had no problem traversing the Long Xiang Continent with his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me into\u2026 \u2026\u201d You XiaoMo was worried about leaving SheQiu alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose two hiding there! When do you want to hide until?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had not finished speaking before a sinister voice abruptly interrupted him. The two raised their heads seeing three figures in the air that had already discovered them. The black robed man was looking at them with a hint of amusement in his eyes, giving off an exceedingly disgusting feeling.</p><br/><p>There was no other choice since they had been discovered.</p><br/><p>SheQiu did not dare to let You XiaoMo enter his dimension at this moment, as the dimension was his master\u2019s secret. If it was known by this three people, he couldn\u2019t guarantee that they would not think of killing them and stealing the treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? A mage and a demon beast? Then it shouldn\u2019t be these two.\u201d The black robed man began to mutter to himself without waiting for them to speak. Lifting his head, the man saw SheQiu\u2019s guarded expression, and the corner of his mouth lifted \u201cThe little mage at the back, you are a student from DaoXin Academy right? Answer a question of mine and I will consider leaving both your corpses intact.\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu\u2019s expression became taciturn.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo also did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>This man was really arrogant. For such a deal whereby he asked for answers and a satisfactory reply from the addressee would lead to him leaving an intact corpse, did he would assume that people would accept these terms? Could the wires in his head be crossed?</p><br/><p>However, the weak are prey to the strong. It was a fact that this man was very strong, even stronger than SheQiu. He could only be so arrogant be because of the basis of his strength. However, You XiaoMo felt that he would not hate it at all if the person who said this was Ling Xiao instead, at the most he would look down on Ling Xiao a little. When it was said by this person, he didn\u2019t know why but he felt really disgusted.</p><br/><p>The man seemed as if he did not need them to agree to this \u2018deal\u2019 as he went ahead and asked, \u201cDo you know these two called Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo? Where are they now?\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu and You XiaoMo were simultaneously stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys looking for them for?\u201d The man\u2019s words were beyond SheQiu\u2019s expectations. It just made him even more alarmed, as one of the two main characters was just behind him.</p><br/><p>The man looked at him sinisterly, \u201cTell me, where are they? You know it right?\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I know where they are. But I\u2019m afraid that if I tell you, you will immediately kill us right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man darkly looked at him and broke into chuckles as he malevolently said, \u201cIt seems that you\u2019re very chatty. Are you trying to buy time to try to escape? Or are you waiting for some person? Ha, sure enough you\u2019re an inferior demon beast. I\u2019ll be sure to cut you up into pieces since you\u2019ve already lost your last chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he then shifted his gaze to You XiaoMo behind, \u201cLittle mage, I\u2019ll give you a chance. Where are they? Don\u2019t attempt to answer me half-heartedly. I have many ways to make you beg for death.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gave a grieved sigh, \u201cI can tell you, but I have a small request. You don\u2019t even need to lift a finger to fulfill it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This answer was beyond the man\u2019s expectations, \u201cOh? Tell me about your small request.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo gnashed his teeth as said with profound hatred, \u201cActually, I have a little personal grudge with You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao. When we were in the academy, they had once embarrassed me in front of everyone. I hate them so much that I cannot wait for them to die, so I hope that you could kill us later. I want to personally watch them die before me; otherwise I won\u2019t be reconciled.\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu, \u201c\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the man took some interest in him instead, \u201cYou look so fair and clear, yet who would have thought that you are such a black-hearted person. Not bad, you\u2019re really to my liking.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo continued with his con, \u201cThis is the Uneven Slope, which is where the objective of their task is at. They should be reaching soon with their travelling speed. You only need to wait for about half an hour before they will deliver themselves to your doorstep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I will let you guys live for half an hour more.\u201d The man mercifully stated.</p><br/><p>SheQiu suddenly felt like kneeling.</p><br/><p>This was the first time he found that his master was such an awesome person.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

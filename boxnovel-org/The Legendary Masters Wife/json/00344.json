It was something they had done just a moment ago, although they seemed to be much more intense, he could hear the bed creaking.</p><br/><p>With a face of surprise, You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao and said, \u201cCould it be\u2026You have a peeping fetish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without changing his expression Ling Xiao replied, \u201cPeeping from a wall away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut then what are you doing?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201cEavesdroping.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched and he threw a piece of his clothing at Ling Xiao while saying, \u201cThen what did you hear?\u201d He couldn\u2019t be wanting to learn from them, could he? What a scary thought!</p><br/><p>The next day, to avoid being recognized, the two put on a disguise before leaving the room. At the same time, the neighboring door opened. Out came a neat and tidy man with a hint of grace around him. Following him closely was a glamorous woman with a peach red blush and eyes that seemed to hold spring water.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo froze instantly, now he understood why you couldn\u2019t judge a book based on its cover.</p><br/><p>The two, especially the man, definitely did not seem like the type who would be intense in bed.</p><br/><p>Noticing his gaze, the man turned around and gave him a light smile and a nod before walking away escorting the women downstairs.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people eating breakfast so as You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao came down, they were coincidently seated next to the two. The two seemed like a happy couple. During the meal they were laughing and chatting, the women often broke out into a charming laugh.</p><br/><p>Looking at this couple You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but contemplate on his own. This was his image of an ideal \u2018dating\u2019 experience before Ling Xiao came along. He looked at Ling Xiao who was pouring tea for him, a blockhead that liked to tease him, so annoying!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d taking a sip of the tea Ling Xiao asked monotonously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d You XiaoMo replied avoiding his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re relationship isn\u2019t what you think it is.\u201d Suddenly Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked You XiaoMo blankly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see soon enough.\u201d Ling Xiao leaving him hanging.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo showed a face of suspicion as he remembered last night. Although Ling Xiao eavesdropped for a bit, the other two didn\u2019t speak a word. All there was, was moaning and the bed creaking. At that condition he couldn\u2019t have possibility heard some secret code could he?</p><br/><p>About fifteen minutes later You XiaoMo realized the wonders of Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere suddenly changed. Just a moment ago the two seemed so lovey-dovey and inseparable wer now distant and polite. They stopped smiling too, with one graceful while the other cold.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly tugged at Ling Xiao\u2019s shirt, \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shrugging his shoulders Ling Xiao just told him to keep watching.</p><br/><p>About five minutes later, at the inn\u2019s door arrived a group of men carrying weapons. These men all had one similarity and that was the handle of their weapons had a yellow tassel.</p><br/><p>A young girl that was charming but pampered looking, after seeing the two had her face immediately lit up and ran over to them. \u201cHai-gege, Lan-jiejie.\u201dt/n: gege: brother, jiejie: sister. These can either use for sibling or close relationship.</p><br/><p>The girl, without reserve, sat next to the man and intimately hugged his arm.</p><br/><p>Hai Le didn\u2019t struggle and Lan YiLan, who sat across from him, didn\u2019t react either, as if it was a normal thing.</p><br/><p>Hai Le looked at the young girl dotingly, \u201cLittle Yu, why did you come, didn\u2019t shifu tell you to stay in the sect? If he realized, you\u2019ll get a scolding again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl stuck her tongue out cutely while looking at Hai Le admirably, \u201cI don\u2019t care, shifu loves me most. He wouldn\u2019t scold me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at the scene dumbfoundedly. This scenario looked like a love triangle but was also not really a love triangle. He seemed to understand a little of what Ling Xiao meant. The two were probably sharing an hidden love affair and didn\u2019t dare let the young girl know.</p><br/><p>During this moment, the girl called \u2018Little Yu\u2019 saw You XiaoMo, who was staring and gave a smile, \u201cWhat are you looking at, ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl, when saying this line, had a voice that was soft and sweet. If one ignored its contents, You XiaoMo would have found this girl to be cute and even pitied her.</p><br/><p>However, when he heard that word \u2018ugly\u2019, he couldn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>Looking at himself, he knew he wasn\u2019t handsome but at least he was okay. Most definitely not ugly. However, the girl just straight up called him ugly, did she think her looks could cause the downfall of a kingdom? Even though she wasn\u2019t even as pretty as her \u2018Lan-jiejie\u2019 she dared to call him ugly! That meddling woman!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked over at Ling Xiao, \u201cAm I ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cVery handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blushed a little before giving a sigh of relief, \u201cThat\u2019s good, looks like it isn\u2019t my problem then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao added viciously, \u201cLooking normal doesn\u2019t mean the brain or eyes are normal too.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but let out a \u2018pfft\u201d before saying, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young girl stood up with a bang, her delicate features slightly twisting, but before she could rage, Hai Le, who was beside her, grabbed her arm and said, \u201cLittle Yu, don\u2019t make trouble, later we still have to meet up with shifu. If we are late, he wouldn\u2019t be happy with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, how dare he yell at me.\u201d The young girl continued on relentlessly. Although she did not pounce over, she stared at You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao with a fiery glaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t insult them first, why would he retaliate. Little Yu, you should really control your temper.\u201d Hai Le spoke in a resigning manner. Little Yu, due to her shifu \u2018s doting, never controlled her temper and insulted people left and right. If it wasn\u2019t for this, he and YiLan wouldn\u2019t have to resort to being underground lovers.</p><br/><p>The young girl looked at him in disbelief, \u201cHai-gege, how could you help an outsider? I\u2019m your shimei, you should know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Le was speechless, shifu pampered her too much.</p><br/><p>Lan YiLan put down her teacup and spoke with her brows slightly furrowed, \u201cLittle Yu, stop with this tantrum.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being scold at consecutively by two of her closest people, she gave You XiaoMo a look before walking away angrily.</p><br/><p>Weary of what she might do, Lan Le and Lan YiLan had to bring the rest of the disciples to follow her. Looking at them, one could tell they were used to the young girl\u2019s troubling personality.</p><br/><p>Only once they left did the people in the inn talk freely again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like that evil-girl is out again scourging others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why Elder Hei Yun loves her so much. Isn\u2019t her talent just slightly better than others? Her personality is really awful. I\u2019d say Lan Le and Lan YiLan are much better. If it wasn\u2019t for the evil-girl, they would already be together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows what Elder Hei Yun is thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop ruining the mood, I heard that from Yan City came a lot of strong practitioners. There is the Four Great Clans and Dao Xin Academy. Looks like this fight for the leyline is going be a tough one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the Great Four Clans were very strong, the people of Boundless Town were nothing to fret about either.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the one who found the leyline was the sect leader of the Flying Fish Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Flying Fish Sect is just a second rated force, their sect leader has already been controlled by the Boundless Town\u2019s top three strongest practitioners.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The contents of the chatter and whispers did give some hints to You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>They were originally troubled by how to approach this, now they had a direction. Although it would be difficult take an advantage with so many strong people around.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask a question, \u201cHow did you know their relationship was troubled?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him, \u201cYou weren\u2019t watching? Their relationship seems good but between the eyes there was a hint of distress and strain. The two also looked towards the door multiple times, clearly waiting for someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose embarrassingly, he really wasn\u2019t paying attention to their expressions.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Xiao abruptly got up and grabbed You XiaoMo\u2019s arm before walking quickly to the second floor. Before he could ask why, a familiar voice could be heard and just as he turned to look, Ling Xiao grabbed his head and turned it back.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pushed him inside the room before walking in himself and closing the door.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t see clearly, You XiaoMo knew that voice. It was BaiLi TianYi and he didn\u2019t seem like he was alone either.</p><br/><p>Just as You XiaoMo was about to ask, Ling Xiao took off his mask. That\u2019s when he realized their getup had some problems.</p><br/><p>Before, when they didn\u2019t want to be recognized, Ling Xiao\u2019s ugly mask got changed back to the silver one and their clothes changed too. He himself had a change of clothes, his hair was also down, their style was very different compared to before. It really wasn\u2019t suited to greet them.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took the ugly mask and wore it, \u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll find a moment to meet them \u2018coincidently\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised an eyebrow at that, \u201cIf we go with Dao Xin Academy, wouldn\u2019t that restrict our actions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we are going to muddy the waters and take the prize.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

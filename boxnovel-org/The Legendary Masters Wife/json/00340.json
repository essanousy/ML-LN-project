His attitude was as if it was an annual report, by You XiaoMo standards that was highly suspicious.</p><br/><p>What was there to conclude? So, You XiaoMo asked in confusion, \u201cDo I really need to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded seriously, \u201cYes, let me hear your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhhhh\u2026.\u201d You XiaoMo scratched his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m happy to see my relatives, knowing the whereabouts of my father makes me happy, and\u2026and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>And what?</p><br/><p>Sneakily, You XiaoMo peeked at Ling Xiao, \u201cDo you want to add anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao became angry to the point of laughing. He knew he couldn\u2019t count on You XiaoMo\u2019s brain and instead went straight to the point, \u201cAbout the TianXin Sect, what are your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked a little, \u201cThe TianXin Sect huh\u2026My thought is, it\u2019s too bad we didn\u2019t get to see Da ShiXiong and Second ShiXiong. I wonder where they went for training, I want to meet them again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Squinting his eyes Ling Xiao asked, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the dangerous expression, he was making, You XiaoMo knew he didn\u2019t get to the point but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t think of anything else. Out of ideas, he carefully asked, \u201cMaybe, you can give me a hint?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rubbed his hair and answered, \u201cIs your way of treating people to treat them back double if they\u2019re nice to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo replied obviously, \u201cOf course, it isn\u2019t this normal?\u201d</p><br/><p>In his previous life, he didn\u2019t have many friends, you could count them with one hand. It wasn\u2019t because he was a loner but because his family was strict. They kept a tab of who he became friends with so when he just start a friendship with a classmate, his family would scare them away.</p><br/><p>Especially his devil like brothers, for some reason they had to test all of his friends, too see if they were worthy. Of course, that just scared them away.</p><br/><p>Whenever he remembered this he became super frustrated, those two were such a pain!</p><br/><p>But it was because of that he treasured his friends very much.</p><br/><p>So, Ling Xiao continued asking, \u201cYour lingering feelings towards the TianXin Sect, is it because of your three ShiXiong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without thinking You XiaoMo said, \u201cOf course. If Zhao ShiXiong left as well, then I wouldn\u2019t have a reason to go to the TianXin Sect.\u201d After he said this, he looked over at Ling Xiao suspiciously, \u201cYou\u2019re really weird today, why did you bring this up all of a sudden? Is there something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly Ling Xiao laughed and raised his finger to hook You XiaoMo\u2019s nose, \u201cSeeing that you\u2019ve suddenly became smarter, I\u2019ll let you in on a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes went wide. There really was something?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao whispered to You XiaoMo\u2019s ears, \u201cAbout two years ago, when we left the TianXin Sect, I told a secret to your Da ShiXiong and Second ShiXiong.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo froze. It took a second before he found his voice again, \u201cWha-What secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Ling Xiao asked in return.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stayed silent for a while before asking, \u201cYou actually told them? It\u2019s not a prank, right?\u201d There was too much precedence for You XiaoMo to not be vary.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I lie, it\u2019s not like I get to eat your saliva.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t blush, instead he rubbed his hand together nervously, \u201cUmm\u2026What were they\u2019re reactions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him expressionlessly and suddenly smiled.</p><br/><p>As if a bucket of cold water was dumped on him, You XiaoMo felt cold inside out, was he tricked again?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cActually I didn\u2019t say everything, I just told him that Kong Wen had died. He set his eyes on someone else\u2019s treasure and wanted to kill for it, but instead he died. Although\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as You XiaoMo let out a breath of air, the \u2018although\u2019 made him panic again. Stuttering he asked, \u201cAlthough what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued, \u201cAlthough it would seem as if they guessed it already. Want to know their reactions?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo kicked him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grinned, \u201cFang ChenYue blanked for a second, Fu ZiLin just let out a \u2018oh\u2019 sound and they both left after acknowledging they knew. Looking at them, it seems like they were unsurprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Blinking You XiaoMo asked, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s it, but I think they were playing dumb.\u201d</p><br/><p>Playing dumb seemed like a good option, if You XiaoMo was in that situation, he would probably do the same. As long as everyone had a mutual understanding, it seemed like he didn\u2019t need to worry anymore.</p><br/><p>Looking up, You XiaoMo stared at Ling Xiao with sparkling eyes. Ling Xiao rubbed his head in return, \u201cYes, you don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo responded by putting his hands around his waist and laughing. It was so great to let go of a burden.</p><br/><p>After he finished, Ling Xiao chilled his excitement, \u201cAfter this, if there is no need to, don\u2019t get into contact with Ye Han.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sudden stop came to the laughing, You XiaoMo threw over a question, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao continued matter of factly, \u201cIf he can sell us out once, he can do it again. Ye Han\u2019s roots are at the TianXin Sect so regardless of me being there, strong or not, his only has one option and that\u2019s to protect the TianXin Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused for a moment, he had never thought about this before. When he met Zhao ShiXiong, he told him the reason Ye ShiShu revealed their location was because he knew Ling Xiao was strong enough to deal with them. Everything was built on that notion that Ling Xiao was stronger.</p><br/><p>This was what Ye-shishu told Zhao ShiXiong to relay. After Ling Xiao gave the hint, he realized he was tricked.</p><br/><p>Since it was told by Zhao ShiXiong, who he hadn\u2019t seen for two years, when they met, his attention wouldn\u2019t be on the conversation and so he would have no suspicions. But if it was someone else, like those other fellow disciples who he was not close with, the situation would be very different.</p><br/><p>The most important thing though, he realized, by Zhao DaZhou\u2019s strength, this task of going to DaoXin academy was too much for him to handle..</p><br/><p>He was just a level five mage with no fighting power. Enough with the cute little tiger, humans were deceptive, and Zhao DaZhou was not very clever. If he got tricked by someone with ulterior motives, he\u2019d be dead. For the TianXin Sect, Ye Han-shishu would cudgel his brain out.</p><br/><p>Seeing his troubled face, Ling Xiao knew he understood, \u201cI won\u2019t object to you meeting with your seniors but only as pure friends. Anything related to the TianXin Sect you shouldn\u2019t be involved with.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at him listlessly, \u201cOkay, but didn\u2019t you help Zhou Peng-shixiong get to where he is now? He seems like your little brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that, Ling Xiao raised his eyebrow, \u201cThat\u2019s his path to take, I just gave him an opportunity. Even if he destroys it, it has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo bared his teeth, he thought that Ling Xiao wanted to make the TianXin Sect be his first place of power in this middle level realm since he wasn\u2019t one to help without a reason. But it seemed like he was wrong, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t plan on having any influences on Long Xiang Continent.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Nan Ye City was up ahead, You XiaoMo remembered a question. Ling Xiao had said before that he came to a middle-levelled realm for to find someone, and that someone was him.</p><br/><p>To be honest, he was certain they had no interactions before this and as for the original You XiaoMo, if Ling Xiao knew him, he would know his identity. Clearly, he didn\u2019t, so it was most likely Ling Xiao found him by his soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, what you said in the trials, about my past, its it true?\u201d After the atmosphere was silent, for a while, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask. Ling Xiao didn\u2019t seem like one of those evil-doers with a terrible past. Also, if he really were to fight with the QiLin Clan and the Demon Phoenix Clan, shouldn\u2019t he develop his influence or recruit some underlings? The more he thought, the more things didn\u2019t add up, the chance of this being a lie was very high.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao let out a sign, \u201cWhat is there to lie about? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to give me your heart. Seriously, I tell you the truth and you don\u2019t believe me. Do I have to lie for you to trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt a little guilty, \u201cThat\u2019s because you had such a bad record previously. But what does your past have to do with you finding me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cWhen did I say these two things were related?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now You XiaoMo was confused, \u201cThen why did you come find me?\u201d</p><br/><p>From the corner of Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes, he could see You XiaoMo\u2019s face shine in expectation and said, \u201cThe reason\u2026I can\u2019t tell you right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>This got You XiaoMo\u2019s interested and he said impatiently, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied warmly and caringly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll feel pressured. The reason I found you is not simple, if I tell you now, it might be a hindrance to your training so it\u2019s best if you stay oblivious to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt his mouth twitching, he really didn\u2019t like this conclusion one bit, \u201cFine, let\u2019s not think about these questions anymore. See, we are at Nan Ye City already.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

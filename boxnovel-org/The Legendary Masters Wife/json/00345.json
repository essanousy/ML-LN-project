They intentionally left the restaurant earlier than BaiLi TianYi to loiter around the prearranged meeting point, preparing to stage a coincidental meeting later on. It was as if they were serial stalkers. You XiaoMo felt especially guilty.</p><br/><p>However, after walking around, You XiaoMo started to shop around instead of stalk. The Boundless Town had developed differently from Yan City. They started off developing their economy from seafood and it hadn\u2019t changed till now. As a result, most of the goods sold in the town were related to the aquatic creatures that dwelled in the depths of the Boundless Ocean. In all their sales, seafood took up as much as seventy percent, whereas the rest were hunted from the mountains.</p><br/><p>An hour later, the both of them walked towards a large harbor where they guessed BaiLi TianYi and his group would be heading to. The fisherfolk of Boundless Town were already there early in the morning, setting up their stalls and laying out their catch to sell. Those that were selling the seafood were mostly ordinary people, while those setting sail out to sea to catch demon beasts were clearly practitioners with the exception of a few mages. Due to the recent incident regarding the Leyline, there was an increasing number of people heading out to sea. Those dependent on catching demon beasts from the sea for a living were more or less affected.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo half demon beasts like the water demons live in the Boundless Sea?\u201d Along the way, You XiaoMo discovered that there were a lot of aquatic demon beasts, most of them he hadn\u2019t seen in his scroll.He couldn\u2019t help but thinking about the water demon live in the Shallow Shore, they also seemed like the type of demon beast spending their life away under water.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, water demons can only survive in ten thousand year old frozen lakes with ice poison in them.\u201d Ling Xiao explained. \u201cWater demons are a highly contagious species, even if they existed in the Boundless Sea, it would soon be obliterated by the strong fighters of this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a look around. Not even a single thing sold at the harbor caught his interest. High and middle level demon beasts generally could not be found at the stalls.You XiaoMo suddenly tugged at Ling Xiao\u2019s sleeve. \u201cDo you think I can contract an aquatic demon beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave him a side glance. \u201cThe demon beasts that you have contracts with, which one of them doesn\u2019t know how to swim?\u201d Especially PiQiu and MaoQiu, they had fun daily in the lake. He reckoned it wouldn\u2019t even be a problem to get them to dance on water.</p><br/><p>T/n: It\u2019s a wordplay. (shuixing) can mean aquatic or (know how to swim). In this case, LX thought he meant the latter meaning.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo ignored his teasing and immediately started correcting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the demon beasts that live in the water. It would be easier to go to places with oceans in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll do something about it when the time comes.\u201d Ling Xiao replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo, fellow Ling?\u201d A voice behind them called out in surprise.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo jolted to his senses. He unknowingly forgot his objective of coming here in the first place. He was so engrossed in shopping that it became BaiLi TianYi finding them first instead.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo turned around and smiled brightly at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence! What are you guys\u2026 ah?\u201d He greeted them, only to be stopped halfway through his speech when Ling Xiao gently pinched his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d BaiLi TianYi raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly slapped Ling Xiao\u2019s hand away and replied, \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just being weird. Why are you guys here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Yang\u2019s loud laughter could be heard from the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we didn\u2019t come, how would we know you two came here on your break. But I didn\u2019t expect you two to return so early. In fact, you guy came back right on time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dao Xin Academy didn\u2019t really restrict its students\u2019 movements. Those who wanted to take the opportunity to train and level up could sign themselves up. Tempted by this rare opportunity, Gao Yang and his group came over. Yin Ge and the rest also walked towards them. He slightly nodded his head in acknowledgment of You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>An XinRui had her eyes trained on Yin Ge whereas Chen Zhao, the top on the list of the hundred strongest Mages, had his eyes on her. Both of them did not speak.</p><br/><p>Realising that a few people were missing from the group, You XiaoMo was surprised. He asked, \u201cThe academy only sent you guys here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not getting the message, Gao Yang replied, \u201cNot only us. Shifu and a few elders will be bringing the others over to meet us. There\u2019s other fellow schoolmates, but they have places to be at.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded in understanding. He knew the Academy\u2019s underground Leyline was already reaching it limit, so obtaining the Elemental Essence was absolutely necessary. To ensure that the Academy could secure the Elemental Essence, Yan Fa was personally attending to the situation. As for the schoolmates, most likely Teng ZiXin and the rest, they were probably heading back to their clans. Which was a good thing as they wouldn\u2019t have to face them later on.</p><br/><p>After the \u201ccoincidental meeting\u201d, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao started tagging along with the rest of the group. Gao Yang and the rest had their minds set on training themselves as those who were vying for the Elemental Essence were at least Imperial level or above. If they were to compete with those superpowers with their current level of cultivation, there was no doubt they would be crushed in an instant. In order to prevent unnecessary casualties, Yan Fa had already warned them long before they set off.</p><br/><p>When they were returning to the inn, You XiaoMo purposely walked beside BaiLi TianYi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Tang YuLin? He didn\u2019t come this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi couldn\u2019t help but sigh when he was reminded of Tang YuLin. \u201cI did drag him here, but he\u2019s cultivating in the inn now.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t hold back his snort. From a money addict to a cultivation obsessed fellow, You XiaoMo could already predict this outcome when he persuaded Tang YuLin. Tang YuLin\u2019s personality was honestly easy to understand. He was both devoted to and perseverant in achieving his goals. Once he had his mind set, unless there were better reasons to convince him otherwise, he would not budge despite reaching dead ends.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop laughing already. Do you have any ideas on how to make him not so obsessed with cultivation?\u201d BaiLi TianYi responded.</p><br/><p>In truth, BaiLi TianYi was quite grateful to You XiaoMo. Compared to being a money addict, he\u2019d much rather Tang YuLin become a cultivation fanatic. But that didn\u2019t mean he should cultivate till no end. If this continued, BaiLi TianYi couldn\u2019t hold it in much longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo smiled knowingly. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very simple.You just have to tell him the flaws of cultivating in isolation for a long period of time and lie a bit. If not you can always think of another way to raise his level without cultivating in isolation.\u201d</p><br/><p>For example, Dual Cultivation.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo was not so kind as to reveal this to him.</p><br/><p>BaiLi TianYi looked at him skeptically. Levelling up without cultivating in isolation, he must be joking right?</p><br/><p>He probed, \u201cWhat methods do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat methods can I have? I\u2019m just giving you suggestions, you think for yourself.\u201d He answered straightforwardly. You XiaoMo could tell BaiLi TianYi about Dual Cultivation, but being a bottom himself, he didn\u2019t want BaiLi TianYi to take advantage of a fellow bottom so easily. What he didn\u2019t think off was that the more a man was pent up, the one who gets hurt was most definitely the one at the bottom. But now, You XiaoMo didn\u2019t think that far ahead. He had unwittingly made the situation worse for Tang YuLin.</p><br/><p>When they finally reached the inn, the sun had almost set. You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao pretended that it was their first time in the inn. Having checked out of their rooms when they left in the morning, they had to check in to a new room again. Luckily, the innkeeper did not recognise them. Most probably it was because many people were entering and leaving the inn in a day and they even made the effort to disguise themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only getting one room?\u201d Gao Yang looked at them in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao turned back and replied, \u201cYes, we can save on Crystal coins like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing his sentence, Ling Xiao walked into his room and shut the door in Gao Yang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang was still in shock. He originally wanted to say \u201cI can help you pay for it\u201d but didn\u2019t have the chance to get the words out of his mouth. Thinking about it, those words felt inappropriate and he eventually gave up on saying them.</p><br/><p>Zhan YuXuan had observed everything at the back. He chuckled and spoke to Yin Ge who was beside him. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Gao Yang to be such a naive person. They were already being painfully obvious and he still didn\u2019t get the message.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Ge just glanced at You XiaoMo\u2019s and Ling Xiao\u2019s room before returning to his own without a word.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the first day Zhan YuXuan knew him, he understood his personality and stopped speaking. Zhan YuXuan couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of Feng ChiYun. Whenever Feng ChiYun was around, Yin Ge seemed to talk more?</p><br/><p>By nightfall, everyone stayed in their own rooms.</p><br/><p>The next day, everyone gathered punctually in the lobby. As there were many people in the group, they were split up into three tables. An XinRui hadn\u2019t given up at this point, she followed Yin Ge and shared the same table with him. Yet, the latter showed no change in his expression. Clearly, he couldn\u2019t be bothered. Chen Zhao chased after An XinRui and went over to that table.</p><br/><p>At that table sat four people, the fourth being Zhan YuXuan. You XiaoMo found the relationship between them very intriguing indeed. An XinRui liked Yin Ge and Chen Zhao liked An XinRui, but Yin Ge didn\u2019t reciprocate An XinRui\u2019s feelings. Their relationship felt like a marathon. It was a simple concept, but the people involved never seemed to notice or understand.</p><br/><p>When breakfast was served, You XiaoMo ate and watched Ling Xiao enquire about information of the Elemental Essence from GaoYang and his group discreetly. However, it was a pity that even the insider information that Gao Yang and his group had was not very clear. Nevertheless, Gao Yang was the only disciple of Yan Fa, he would still know about things that others didn\u2019t. For example, the Flying Fish Sect Leader who discovered the underground leyline. Despite him being hidden by the superpowers in the Boundless town, their actions were still found out by Dao Xin Academy and the Academy was able to track down the whereabouts of the leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cShifu only told me to not go near the Mirage Sand Sea. I believe the the Elemental Essence should be there.\u201d Gao Yang recalled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

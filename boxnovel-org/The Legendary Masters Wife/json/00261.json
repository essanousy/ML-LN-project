The pleasure that kept surging in wave after wave and leaving behind a feeling of wanting to cry when he couldn\u2019t almost pushed him to the edge.</p><br/><p>The man from behind gasped while his hand still firmly imprisoned his thin waist, thrusting in and out with no sign of slowing down. The tide of pleasure coming from the friction made both of them throb continuously and forced out the man\u2019s deepest desire as he plunged deeper and stronger one after another. Each of those times would hit You XiaoMo\u2019s most sensitive spot.</p><br/><p>The pleasure coming from every limb of his and then ultimately gathering at his lower part stimulated him unendingly, such arousing pain as if someone was drilling into his heart almost killed him. And eventually, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a scream while he came for the second time on the quilt.</p><br/><p>After he came, his whole body couldn\u2019t hold up anymore and turned into jelly. He then lay on the bed, panting and thanks to the man\u2019s strong arm holding his waist he didn\u2019t completely sink down to the bed. His behind also began twitching, thus bringing in the satisfactory pleasure to the part where they were connected. Making Ling Xiao, who hadn\u2019t come for a long period, finally hum a sound and release all of his essence.</p><br/><p>The quilt under them had long been soaked in sweat and cum.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t remember how many rounds it had been, he only knew that right now he was extremely tired and exhausted, so it didn\u2019t take him long to utterly fall deep into sleep.</p><br/><p>After that, Ling Xiao got out of bed and carried the unconscious You XiaoMo to the bathtub that had been prepared behind the screen. Disregarding the fact that the water had turned cold, Ling Xiao helped wash You XiaoMo\u2019s body clean from inside out, and then carried him back to bed. However, he didn\u2019t even bother changing to a new quilt and just casually tossed the dirty quilt to the ground, and just like that he held You XiaoMo until he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>The next day, You XiaoMo woke up only to find out that his whole body was mushy and sore all over and the only thing he could do was to lay on the bed. Remembering what happened yesterday, he couldn\u2019t help but become furious. That bastard really did him more than a few times. If he had known it would come to this earlier, no way he would have given that pill to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was nothing to do for today, so You XiaoMo simply decided not to get out of bed. After spending a whole morning resting, when most of his energy had finally recovered, he then got out of bed on his still-a-bit-soft legs.</p><br/><p>Even after warming up, You XiaoMo still couldn\u2019t find Ling Xiao anywhere inside the pavilion. However, he didn\u2019t care. When he had fully recovered his energy, he then went upstairs to refine magic pills.</p><br/><p>Two days ago, he made a deal with Tang YuLin, besides sending him level four herbs every two days, he also asked Tang YuLin to find some herbs for Tianling pills and Mental Purification pills, and then deliver them over with the rest of the herbs. In addition to the herb cost, You XiaoMo also included in extra points as labor costs, and Tang YuLin didn\u2019t reject it, since he also needed points. Of course, this was the result after some careful discussion.</p><br/><p>But today You XiaoMo had no intention to refine those magic pills.</p><br/><p>He remembered he once saw in the auction the two Moon Breaker pills and Purple cloud pills. The first one was to help break out of Moon level, while the other was to increase the cultivation of the practitioner. These two types of pills were one of the items students of Block Two had been fighting over.</p><br/><p>(Ra: Moon breaker and purple cloud pill was mentioned in chap 112.)</p><br/><p>Disregarding that, the sales of those two pills had never really been sought after, and this was not because of those stalls that occupied all the standout spots, but because of the fact that those pills on the market did not have a high enough quality.</p><br/><p>For that whole reason, if one day a Moon Breaker pill and Purple Cloud pill that guaranteed the quality appeared on the market, certainly, hell would break loose, as it would surpass the hotness of the Yuan Yang pill. Their market value was definitely immeasurable.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t buy the herbs for those two, his intention was to use the high grade herbs inside his space, and for each recipe he would refine five pills. This way, even if others were suspicious of him, they definitely wouldn\u2019t think he could plant magic herbs inside his space.</p><br/><p>The Moon Breaker pill and Purple Cloud pill were more difficult to refine than Tianling pills, especially the Purple Cloud pill.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo carefully looked over the Purple Cloud recipe. To refine this pill, there were more than thirty six steps needed to be completed. Not to mention, some of the steps needed to be done at the same time, if the soul force was wielded unskillfully, it would be impossible to refine it.</p><br/><p>That was why Purple Cloud pill was one of the most difficult pills to refine among level five pills.</p><br/><p>Probably because of this reason, some of the mages decided to skimp on the job and stint on materials, resulting in a terrible quality. Since practitioners didn\u2019t want to take too much risk, the Purple Cloud pill and Moon Breaker pill were not very hot items.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took out five batches of materials from his space, and started refining at the moment his energy was at its peak. In order to familiarize himself with the complicated steps, he chose the Moon Breaker pill to practice first since it only took twenty-nine steps to complete. Although, the complexity of Moon Breaker pills was not that different compared to the Purple Cloud pill.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had not yet entered the pavilion and he already noticed You XiaoMo was refining pills. He could tell since the smell of the herb fragrance coming out of the cauldron was much stronger than any other time before, probably due to the difficulty level this time was higher, making it harder to control the soul force, thus the smell leaking from the caudron.</p><br/><p>Taken by surprise, Ling Xiao raised his eyebrows and straightforwardly jumped through the second floor window and landed on the floor without making any sound. Then he saw You XiaoMo was sitting with his leg crossed in the middle of the room. You XiaoMo\u2019s complexion was rather pale, as his forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat, yet his gaze was still stubbornly fixed on the pill that had began to take shape inside the caudron.</p><br/><p>Looking at You XiaoMo\u2019s current appearance, Ling Xiao instantly remembered he had once saw this soul drained appearance of his when they were in Tian Xin Sect. He couldn\u2019t help but frown.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked in front of him, but he didn\u2019t interrupt You XiaoMo. Instead, Ling Xiao took the magic bag beside You XiaoMo\u2019s waist and then searched for the half a bottle of spiritual water. Fortunately, You XiaoMo had formed a habit of storing half a bottle of spiritual water inside his magic bag, or else Ling Xiao would have no choice but to abruptly interrupt his refining process.</p><br/><p>Taking out the cork, Ling Xiao swept out a drop of spiritual water and then shot that drop onto You XiaoMo pursed up lip, that drop of spiritual water helped relax and moisten his lips.</p><br/><p>Feeling the spiritual water on his lips, You XiaoMo opened his mouth and sucked in that drop, and not long after, the soul power that was drained finally starting to come back by a little.</p><br/><p>Even though the amount of power regained was not much, it was enough for him to finish this batch.</p><br/><p>Seven minutes later, a fragrant smell of medicine overflowed from the cauldron and assailed the nostrils, followed by a crimson colored pill that flew out of the cauldron.</p><br/><p>At first, You XiaoMo intended to reach his hand out to catch it, but his reach was cut off halfway by someone else. Caught by surprise, You XiaoMo raised his head and saw Ling Xiao looking him with a smile yet not a smile. Inside his hand was the Purple Cloud pill. You XiaoMo then withdrew his hand, his face was full of guilt while he touched his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou XiaoMo, remember what I told you before?\u201d Ling Xiao casually said.</p><br/><p>That guy even called him by his full name, how could he not remember? Even though Ling XIao\u2019s words had no head nor tail, his guilty conscience had answered for him what event Ling Xiao was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis, that\u2026\u201d You XiaoMo scratched his head as he beat around the bush.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao first bluntly knocked his melon-seed-brain head, then stroked his head twice, as if he was giving a carrot and stick. That handsome face exposed an extremely gentle smile along with a tender voice, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hugged his head, sobbed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lifted up You XiaoMo\u2019s chin, blew hot air toward his face and replied, \u201cIf I ever find this situation happening again, let\u2019s see if I can do you ten times a night.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo without a blink, remembered about Ling Xiao\u2019s one hell of an endurance that could go on from one to two hours. If he really could go for ten times a night, then wouldn\u2019t that make it a full day? That would definitely kill him!</p><br/><p>Thinking to this point, You XiaoMo immediately shook his head like the rattle-drum.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stroked his cheek and sighed. \u201cPersonally, I am actually really looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d You beast in human clothing!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo who was originally filled with guilt, after his head was struck by lightning by those words, he then slapped Ling Xiao\u2019s hand away and glanced back at him while taking back the magic pills. Afterward, he picked up the jade jar on the ground. Inside the jar were other four pills, and including this one was the fifth. There was also another jade jar containing the Moon Breaker pill. For these ten magic pills, he had poured in a lot of effort and time, but at least everything had finally been managed.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked, \u201cYou want to sell those high quality pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tidied up his stuff while he answered, \u201cYeah, since those magic pills can earn quite a sum of points, moreover, they don\u2019t need production cost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201cDo you want to go now?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked outside to the sky, the sun had soon settle down, so he shook his head, \u201cLet\u2019s leave it to tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day morning, they left early to the bazaar.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

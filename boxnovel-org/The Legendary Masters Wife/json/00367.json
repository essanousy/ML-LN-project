They had to defend DaoXin Academy and prevent the Demon Beast Tide from the deep mountains from invading. This was also the true reason behind why the Academy only had Duan QiTian and Hei Tian to oversee the Boundless Sea event.</p><br/><p>So, considering the current situation, DaoXin Academy probably couldn\u2019t take back those spirit gems.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow what? Are we just going to \u2018gift\u2019 the spirit gems to Qiu Ran?\u201d You XiaoMo hurriedly ran in front of Ling Xiao. It felt terrible to have to \u2018gift\u2019 their spirit gems to someone they hated, and thirty percent was way too much. One piece was more like it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you want to do?\u201d Ling Xiao asked lazily.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused before remembering the family meeting he really loved recently and his excitement calmed a little. \u201cWhy do you think Qiu Ran\u2019s first move would be to steal those spirit gems?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ling Xiao\u2019s devil-may-care attitude immediately changed, asking in amusement, \u201cWhat you actually wanted to ask was how can we get those spirit gems back, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo retorted seriously. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I can think, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him in doubt. \u201cIs that so? But doesn\u2019t thinking require a brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo: \u201cAre you implying I don\u2019t have a brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao unexpectedly shook his head, saying with a smile, \u201cNo. The fact that you can think of implications means that you have something in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fuck, that double meaning!</p><br/><p>No matter how you interpreted it, it was still saying he didn\u2019t have any brains.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo once again was given a demonstration of Ling Xiao\u2019s IQ and mean personality.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo selectively ignored his words. If Ling Xiao refused to answer, then he\u2019d think for himself. He didn\u2019t believe he wouldn\u2019t be able to figure it out. When there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, do you think Qiu Ran stole those spirit gems because of the two powerhouses he had brought with him? His appearance couldn\u2019t have been a coincidence and Qiu Ran had taken so much damage. The grand elder said he\u2019d need several years to recover, yet his status is already much improved. Is there any connection between that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao poured a cup of water, handing it to him. \u201cDrink some first, take it slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, thanks!\u201d You XiaoMo drank the cup of water in one go and returned the cup to Ling Xiao, continuing to speak. \u201cAnd last time, at the Boundless Sea, Netherworld Siren said that they had told their higher-ups about us. It\u2019s already been almost four months, so how come the Vermillion Blood Family still hasn\u2019t sent anyone? Or have the people they sent already arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were too many questions, You XiaoMo felt\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your brain in knots yet?\u201d Ling Xiao asked, smiling.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026 It is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao supported his chin in one palm. \u201cI only just realized that being simple-minded isn\u2019t always a god thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could feel black lines on his face. It was clear that Ling Xiao was talking about him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao then continued. \u201cActually, you don\u2019t need to think in such circles, just assume that the two powerhouses Qiu Ran called over are the people Netherworld Siren was talking about, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. Their presence was too strange and I hear no one\u2019s seen their true face. If they were powerhouses from the LongXiang continent, then someone must know something about them, but there\u2019s been no word whatsoever.\u201d The more You XiaoMo thought, the more possible it seemed.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cSo, it\u2019s very likely that Qiu Ran provided them with intel and they helped Qiu Ran face DaoXin Academy, taking the chance to try and force us out, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s good chance that they aren\u2019t the people Netherworld Siren was talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave him a meaningful look, as if he was getting anxious about You XiaoMo\u2019s intelligence.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten, Netherworld Siren knows our names. If they had told their higher-ups about us, then those people must know what sort of role we have in the DaoXin Academy. If that\u2019s true, then they wouldn\u2019t need Qiu Ran to give them intel, so they might have something to do with the people who were chased off at the TianXin sect. However, this is all a guess; I can\u2019t be certain yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was enlightened. Ok, he got it now.</p><br/><p>The reason why Qiu Ran stole thirty percent of the spirit gems was to try and see if he could force them out of hiding, because those people didn\u2019t really understand their situation, so this was their only choice.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t we only have two choices here? One is to expose ourselves and steal the spirit gems, the second is to just \u2018gift\u2019 them the spirit gems.\u201d You XiaoMo looked at him plaintively.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sighed lightly. \u201cWho told you that we only had two choices? Isn\u2019t there a third?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, of course, temporarily storing those spirit gems there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t just sit here and wait, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, true\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, another five days passed. Hei Tian had gone to test out the powerhouses Qiu Ran had brought with him and found that their strength was on par with his. One of them was at the same level, and other was only weaker by a star. Under this situation, the only way to proceed was if Duan QiTian helped out.</p><br/><p>Then, Hei Tian returned to DaoXin Academy and never left again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could guess the Grand Elder\u2019s intentions and actually wanted to tell Ling Xiao that while they couldn\u2019t get the spirit gems back now, the grand elder probably wouldn\u2019t just leave it at that.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Not long later, the situation changed in a way even Ling Xiao hadn\u2019t expected.</p><br/><p>They heard that one of the powerhouses Qiu Ran had brought left and that person was the one who had gone to Boundless Sea for the spirit gems.</p><br/><p>After You XiaoMo heard this, he immediately jumped to his feet. \u201cThey actually went there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pressed his hand against his forehead. \u201cYeah, seems like their IQ is even higher than yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo glared at him. You just can\u2019t go a day without insulting my intelligence, can you? \u201cYou said we were going to store the spirit gems there temporarily, but what do we do now that one of them is leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I know, then let\u2019s go and take it back,\u201d Ling Xiao said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when do we strike?\u201d You XiaoMo asked him in excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen? Wait a day or two first.\u201d Ling Xiao hid his face behind his hand, his eyes seeming to hint at some deeper thought behind the gaps between his fingers.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t understand. If they waited a day or two, that guy might\u2019ve gone back already. However, he restrained himself, because he knew that Ling Xiao had to have some sort of plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp~chirp~\u201d The little chick, seeing that the two had finished talking, suddenly flew up, letting out two excited cries and spitting out two embers as if burping.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took this chance immediately, wanted to take him down from atop his head, but\u2026 \u201cOw~\u201d The little chick didn\u2019t forget to keep a grip on his hair. He had really made his head into a nest. Why?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed aloud at this.</p><br/><p>Two days passed by quietly\u2026</p><br/><p>On that day, CatQiu slowly walked in from outside on his short legs.</p><br/><p>There was a whirl of wind and CatQiu disappeared\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d You XiaoMo asked impatiently, holding up CatQiu\u2019s fluffy body.</p><br/><p>\u201cChirp?\u201d The little chick looked at CatQiu in curiosity.</p><br/><p>CatQiu blinked his big, round eyes. He had been sent to do reconnaissance because he could transform into anyone and imitate their presence. This was his strength. After You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao\u2019s discussion the other day, Ling Xiao had sent him into the Teng Family, where Qiu Ran and the other two were.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all there,\u201d CatQiu replied.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, who had just sat up on the bed, lay down again. \u201cSee, it was a trick, as expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo put CatQiu down. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cIt\u2019s simple. During this special period of time, they wouldn\u2019t dare to operate alone. If one left, they\u2019ll only have four people left if you count the Teng family head. If DaoXin Academy, the BaiLi family and the Tong family teamed up, do you think Qiu Ran and the others would have a chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you mean that this was a trap to lure us out.\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s spirits fell immediately. \u201cBut even if they all worked together, they still wouldn\u2019t have a chance against you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Ling Xiao crossed his legs. \u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about isn\u2019t them, but those who are hiding in the shadows. Their target is you and they know that we\u2019re in DaoXin Academy. What\u2019s worse, they even know our names.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d You XiaoMo felt that the situation was becoming more and more complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry to stay close to me and, in the near future, reduce the amount of times you go into your dimension. They probably can\u2019t confirm that it\u2019s on you and are probably keeping watch on you even now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, my shoulders ache a little, come and give me a massage.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He stood in place, his mouth curling into a strange smile.</p><br/><p>In reality, he had never been 100 percent sure if You XiaoMo had successfully activated the pocket dimension or not, because before those old farts passed the dimension down to his younger brother You JunQi, no one had managed to activate the dimension since their ancestors in ancient times.</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s family heads had tried many different methods. He had also tried once when he was younger, before he became family head, but he didn\u2019t try in secret, but those old farts had taken his blood in an attempt to activate the dimension. That was also when he knew that the Vermillion Blood Clan had such a treasure. Unfortunately, it did not activate.</p><br/><p>Back then, the young You ZhenTian didn\u2019t care much about the Inheritance Jewel, because he believed that things that couldn\u2019t be used had no value.</p><br/><p>It was only after You ZhenTian became the family head and was told the core secrets of the You Family that he realized what sort of existence the Inheritance Jewel was.</p><br/><p>It could facilitate the growth of magic herbs, rapidly replenish spiritual energy, mass refine magic pills. It was a priceless treasure, for sure; how could You ZhenTian not be moved. It was unfortunate that he hadn\u2019t ever had the chance to see this Inheritance Jewel again after finding out its secrets because his younger brother had disappeared with the Inheritance Jewel.</p><br/><p>After that, You ZhenTian didn\u2019t see You JunQi again until tens of thousands of years later.</p><br/><p>However, You JunQi was unable to activate the Inheritance Jewel either, so he was relieved, even as he worried. At the very least, You JunQi wasn\u2019t able to use the Inheritance Jewel, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about the other suddenly coming back to steal the position of family head.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian strongly believed that there was none that could activate the Inheritance Jewel. However, his belief had begun to waver since You XiaoMo\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>Who knows, perhaps he really did manage to activate it. No matter how low the chances were, You ZhenTian was determined to capture You XiaoMo, knowing of the benefits the Inheritance Jewel could bring the Vermillion Blood Clan.</p><br/><p>As for why he waited until You XiaoMo entered the dimension.</p><br/><p>It was because, if the other didn\u2019t enter the dimension, then You ZhenTian would have to try and force him to reveal the dimension. If he accidentally damaged the dimension, then it\u2019d be all for naught. So, if there was a better way, he\u2019d rather stick to it.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, You ZhenTian swiftly released his domain \u2013 the Void Domain. Nothing would escape his eyes in his domain.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside the dimension, You XiaoMo appeared in front of Fu ZiLin, blood pouring from his mouth, giving the other quite the scare. However, his surprise didn\u2019t last long.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle-shidi, are you alright?\u201d Fu ZiLin hurriedly ran over to support him and realized that the other had some internal injuries, though luckily they weren\u2019t too serious.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved a hand at him, taking out a magic pill and ingesting it. It melted nigh instantly in his mouth and it didn\u2019t take a moment before his injuries were mostly healed. Expected, considering that he had ingested a level 11 magic pill. It was rather wasteful to use this sort of magic pill to heal some minor internal injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, but our current situation definitely isn\u2019t!\u201d The moment he entered his dimension, You XiaoMo knew that there was no way he\u2019d be able to hide. However, You ZhenTian was a Sacred level practitioner. He couldn\u2019t be certain if the other had methods to deal with his dimension. He had to be prepared.</p><br/><p>Fu ZiLin\u2019s expression turned solemn. \u201cLittle-shidi, it\u2019s my fault we\u2019re in such danger this time. If you find a chance, escape first. There\u2019s no need to mind me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way! Second shixiong, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll find a way.\u201d You XiaoMo shook his head. This wasn\u2019t the other\u2019s fault at all. You ZhenTian had been after them for a long time already. Even if it wasn\u2019t for today, he\u2019d probably come after them in the future.</p><br/><p>Plus, he had done everything he could to save the other. There was no way he was sending the other out to die after that.</p><br/><p>Fu ZiLin couldn\u2019t help but think of Ling Xiao. He had heard that the two rarely ever separated. Yet this time there was only his little-shidi, which was rather puzzling. \u201cLittle-shidi, that person\u2026 how come he isn\u2019t by your side?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was in secluded cultivation when I came over, but he should be done around now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Awkwardness flashed across You XiaoMo\u2019s face, but then he recalled that he could contact Ling Xiao through the transmitter stone and hurriedly took it out. Yet, no matter what he tried, there was no response. Rationally speaking, Spirit Mountain wasn\u2019t large enough that Ling Xiao would be out of range.</p><br/><p>Fu ZiLin knew the result with a single glance.</p><br/><p>That was when the dimension abruptly began to quake. You XiaoMo\u2019s grasp on the transmitter stone slipped and it dropped onto the ground. The tremors were so bad that they would barely stand straight. The only one that could stabilize themselves was XiaoPing.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo raised his head, panicked, and saw a crack appear in the sky of the dimension. The crack was slowly widening, and tendrils of darkness were slipping inside. If this continued, the dimension would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked over at his second shixiong and contract demon beasts, then gritted his teeth and left the dimension in front of the the three. Fu ZiLin, having realized what he was planning, didn\u2019t manage to stop him before he disappeared right before his eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo appeared in place of the dimension after leaving. Since the dimension existed within him, if he entered, then the dimension would become a speck of dust on the wind. If he wasn\u2019t inside, then the dimension would be wherever he was.</p><br/><p>Before You XiaoMo could calm himself, a terrifying black light shot straight towards him. In order to force him to come out and not destroy the dimension at the same time, You ZhenTian didn\u2019t strike a killing blow at him. Thus, it only took him a bit of strength to block the attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou finally came out.\u201d You ZhenTian\u2019s low voice sounded beside You XiaoMo\u2019s ear with a hint of barely repressed joy. The dimension was going to be his, finally.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly yelled, looked rather defeated.</p><br/><p>Originally, You ZhenTian could ignore him and deal with him directly, but since he was so confident in himself, or perhaps he wanted to hear what You XiaoMo had to say before he died, he stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing as you are my nephew, I\u2019ll listen to what you have to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. So sorry, but he really didn\u2019t want to be that guy\u2019s nephew. First, the man stole his cheap dad\u2019s position as family head, then he went after his nephew\u2019s possessions. He even acted so damn righteous about it. It was a misfortune to have such a disgusting uncle.</p><br/><p>Calming his expression, You XiaoMo slowly said, \u201cI believe you really want to know how I managed to activate the You Family\u2019s Inheritance Jewel, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian\u2019s eyes flashed and he intoned coldly, \u201cIf you tell me everything you know, I can let you live.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grinned. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t say anything, you can\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat makes you so confident?\u201d You ZhenTian\u2019s sharp gaze bore into him, his impressive aura filling the domain as he spoke. Any normal person would have probably already collapsed from terror.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo seemed completely unaffected and said with triumph, \u201cBecause, if I\u2019m dead, then you\u2019ll never be able to activate the dimension.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian gave a cold chuckle. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t pry the method to activate it from your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo shook his head. \u201cWhat I mean is that even if I tell you the secret to activating it, you still wouldn\u2019t be able to because I\u2019m the only one in the Vermillion Blood Clan that can activate it. I\u2019m not lying to you. Otherwise the Vermillion Blood Clan wouldn\u2019t have spent all these years with no progress on that front.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t at all worried that You ZhenTian would go and find the You family after knowing the secret. After all, there were hundreds of thousands of lower level planes in existence. It was practically impossible to find their precise location. Plus, he didn\u2019t plan on actually saying the real secret. He knew how to lie. All he had to do was to trick You ZhenTian.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian suddenly barked in laughter.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was confused. Was what he said that funny?</p><br/><p>A hint of mockery appeared in You ZhenTian\u2019s expression, though his tone remained as confident as ever. \u201cYou think I won\u2019t dare touch you if you tell me that? You\u2019re as naive as your father. Even if what you said was true, believe it or not, but I have thousands of methods to keep you under my control, to keep you from death, but completely immobile, hm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fear crept across You XiaoMo\u2019s face. Of course he believed it. Could he hope for someone who could strike their own brother down to show mercy to their nephew?</p><br/><p>The answer was of course not.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian had no mood in continuing this useless talk. A hint of danger appeared in his eyes and the energy around him grew violent. The space around You XiaoMo began to distort.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cursed in his heart and rapidly retreated. However, he was currently inside You ZhenTian\u2019s domain. No matter how far he ran, he\u2019d still be in the other\u2019s attack range.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian was confident that he could keep the other alive even if he beat him half to death, so there was no need to control his power. Right now, he just wanted to capture You XiaoMo, so he wouldn\u2019t show mercy.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, black spheres of dark energy appeared around You XiaoMo. Though he didn\u2019t know what this was, he could tell that this strike would be overwhelming in power. If he was hit, he\u2019d be half a step to his grave.</p><br/><p>Just as You XiaoMo began to despair, the domain suddenly began to shake violently.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

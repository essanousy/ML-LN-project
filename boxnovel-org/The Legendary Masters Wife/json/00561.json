It would definitely cause a stir if they were seen by others, since these were all influencers who could make TongTian Continent shake with one stomp of their foot.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo also hadn\u2019t imagined that so many influencers would be dragged out because of their business. If things truly did come to blows, they would definitely get out of hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tugged on Ling Xiao\u2019s clothes and whispered quietly to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cA fight is unavoidable.\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s voice slipped into his mind.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had Fu CangQiong and the Black Turtle Clan on their side, as well as his clingy dad. Although he wasn\u2019t as strong as before, for better or worse he was still a Sacred Realm expert. Altogether, they had four Sacred Realm experts; meanwhile, You ZhenTian\u2019s side only had the Demon Phoenix Clan, since the Qilin Clan still hadn\u2019t made their position clear yet. Even if they did, it would be about even.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cEven though Ebony Plum Town is on the edge of Zhong Tian, it is still considered part of the Mage Guild and the Beast Transfiguration Guild\u2019s territory. Moreover, there\u2019s still the TongTian Palace above them, so the two large associations won\u2019t let them start fighting. The amount of damage that many Sacred Realm experts can create is something that you absolutely can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say a fight is unavoidable?\u201d You XiaoMo was confused by what he said. It sounded like they wouldn\u2019t need to fight, but what he said before didn\u2019t match what he said after.</p><br/><p>\u201cI meant that we\u2019ll be the ones fighting, not Fu CangQiong and the rest.\u201d Ling Xiao said patiently. He had never had too high expectations for You XiaoMo\u2019s IQ.</p><br/><p>While they were talking, the Qilin Clan had also picked a side.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s grandfather Lin Tian announced that the Black Turtle Clan and Fu CangQiong shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved in someone else\u2019s personal grievances, or else they wouldn\u2019t have the demeanor of an expert.</p><br/><p>But the Mage Guild and the Beast Transfiguration Guild also announced that they wouldn\u2019t let them make a move in this place.</p><br/><p>It was exactly like how Ling Xiao had said. They were worried that if the others acted out, they would create enormous and unfixable damages to Zhong Tian. Plus, there were still a lot of people in Ebony Plum Town.</p><br/><p>You JunQi quietly whispered to You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao, \u201cIn a bit I\u2019ll stall You ZhenTian first, you two can seize the chance to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbfounded. \u201cThen what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSonny, daddy knows you care a lot about me. Daddy is truly very happy, but for now, you two don\u2019t need to be concerned about daddy. You ZhenTian won\u2019t kill me.\u201d You JunQi winked at him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t go along with him this time, and he revealed a displeased expression. \u201cNo! I can\u2019t leave you here by yourself. Even if he won\u2019t kill you, it\u2019s hard to ensure that he won\u2019t do something else to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi stared blankly at him before a somewhat bashful expression suddenly appeared on his face. \u201cSonny, how could you be so, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched fiercely, and goosebumps appeared all over him in an instant. He said, exasperated, \u201cWhat are you thinking? I meant that he would probably cripple your cultivation base or something like that, what did you think I said?\u201d</p><br/><p>(Ra: daddy must have taken a liking on inc-*cough*-est)</p><br/><p>You JunQi instantly withdrew the expression on his face and said seriously, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, nothing. That\u2019s actually what I meant too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liar!</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t even want to expose him anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you guys chatted enough yet?\u201d Ling Xiao probably couldn\u2019t bear listening any longer, and so he finally spoke up in order to break off their dialogue. There was a hint of helplessness in his voice.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said, \u201cDad said that he\u2019ll shield us so we can escape first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be that complicated.\u201d Ling Xiao quickly said, \u201cEven if your dad shields us, he can\u2019t fend them off for very long. He\u2019ll only land himself in danger. If you\u2019re worried about him, then you should tell him to follow Fu CangQiong, since You ZhenTian won\u2019t make a move against Fu CangQiong. Even if he wants to, the associations won\u2019t permit him to.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded and suddenly reacted. \u201cThen what about us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t answer him. His lips moved very slightly, as if he had sent a message to someone. In the next second, You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes blurred, and the scenery seemed to be rapidly falling backwards, but all he saw was shining white, followed by a furious roar that sounded like thunder in his ears.</p><br/><p>What he heard was You ZhenTian\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was too fast, and You XiaoMo finally managed to see clearly. Ebony Plum Town was already no longer visible, replaced by a wrathful figure. At first it was just a small black dot, but then it started getting closer and closer; even though he still couldn\u2019t tell who it was, he was certain that that person was You ZhenTian. He could confirm for sure now that his clingy dad was safe.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo finally understood why Ling Xiao was so positive that nothing would happen to his dad. The weight of his clingy dad compared to them was clearly not enough in You ZhenTian\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you warn me beforehand next time?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was thrown over Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder, and he asked him pleadingly as he watched You ZhenTian get closer and closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Ling Xiao replied extremely simply.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at You ZhenTian, and the distance between them was only a couple thousand meters now. No matter what he did, he couldn\u2019t feel happy in his mind. This was just a desperate race, he didn\u2019t like it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s about to catch up to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, do you want to go in my dimension?\u201d Ling Xiao didn\u2019t even turn his head as he spoke.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitated for a beat. \u201cCan I not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was immediately unable to say what he was about to say next. He discovered that Ling Xiao always treated words like gold during key moments, and he wasn\u2019t even willing to give him an explanation. \u201cThen I won\u2019t bother you as you run for your life anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy that you understand this point. However, I have to correct you on something. The people running for their lives right now are you and me, and finally, we don\u2019t need to run anymore.\u201d After finishing the last sentence, Ling Xiao stopped.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted his head, and he couldn\u2019t see You ZhenTian anymore. Could Ling Xiao have thrown You ZhenTian off while they were chatting?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao set him down and turned his head so he looked to the front. \u201cBecause he already caught up to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth, which had fallen open, closed again.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian clasped his hands behind his back, expression extremely dark, but several flickers of flame seemed to be leaping in his eyes. His gaze shined as he stared at You XiaoMo, and Ling Xiao was directly ignored by him. To You ZhenTian, the two of them were already essentially trapped. All he wanted to know now was whether or not You XiaoMo had opened that item.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you leave him here, I\u2019ll spare your life!\u201d You ZhenTian\u2019s gaze only moved to Ling Xiao when he saw You XiaoMo hide behind him. His confidence from being a Sacred high-star expert made him completely underestimate Ling Xiao\u2019s combat strength.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao ignored him. This was his first time challenging a Sacred Realm expert. Although the pressure was indeed present, there was more of an eager happiness than anything else. He was prepared to use this chance to test the power of four different bloodlines. The reason he had run to this place was just because he didn\u2019t want too many people to witness it.</p><br/><p>\u201cStep back. No matter what happens, don\u2019t come closer!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was pushed several steps back by him. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian saw through his intentions and sneered coldly. \u201cOver-confident! Since you want to die, this old man will help you out.\u201d After that, he struck out right away. He didn\u2019t want to give Ling Xiao any time to react, and his impatient moves made it seem as if he wanted to fight the battle to end it quickly.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian didn\u2019t have any famous weapons, but his fists and feet were even more powerful than a weapon. One of his fists alone contained the ability to shake the heavens and the earth, and wherever his fist went, the space around it became distorted.</p><br/><p>This fist was just a test, but it also equaled seventy percent of You ZhenTian\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t defend. Instead, two different-colored flames burst from his fist, and when their fists collided together, a huge wall of flame surged up immediately. The wall of flame swept up before slicing downwards towards You ZhenTian\u2019s fist like a scythe.</p><br/><p>This time, it didn\u2019t break through or push aside the opponent\u2019s attack like it had before. The two attacks came to an endless deadlock, and the energy also continuously depleted. They managed to maintain it for about two minutes before the energy finally dispersed and a deep crater appeared in the ground.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian raised his thick eyebrows. \u201cIndeed, you have a few tricks up your sleeve.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he believed that in order for Ling Xiao to receive this fist of his, he must have used up at least ninety to one hundred percent of his strength. He wouldn\u2019t be so fortunate after this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I only had a few tricks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat you.\u201d Ling Xiao answered.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian took it as him stubbornly refusing to admit defeat, and he said with a dark and ruthless expression, \u201cSince you have both the Demon Phoenix Clan\u2019s and Qilin Clan\u2019s bloodlines, I\u2019ll show mercy and leave you as an intact corpse. I\u2019ll let you experience my true strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian also wanted to take You XiaoMo away before Fu CangQiong and the rest caught up to avoid raising unexpected difficulties. If the news about the Inheritance Jewel was leaked out, he wouldn\u2019t just have to face Fu CangQiong and Xuan Zheng, but also the Demon Phoenix Clan\u2019s, Qilin Clan\u2019s, and the rest of the major power\u2019s experts.</p><br/><p>He had just finished speaking when a shocking amount of spiritual energy suddenly exploded from You ZhenTian\u2019s body, causing everything to shake as if a volcano had just erupted. This was the strength of a Sacred high-star expert. His spiritual energy was red, and it seemed as if there was a ferocious tiger roaring behind him in an extremely imposing and domineering manner.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s expression became focused. He had heard of You ZhenTian ten thousand years ago, and he had a famous unique skill which just happened to be related to the ferocious tiger. Rumor had it that it had the ability to swallow the heavens and destroy the earth, and many experts had fallen before it.</p><br/><p>He used this famous unique skill as soon as they started, and Ling Xiao had also guessed that he wanted to quickly end the battle. Since it was like this, he could only use that attack.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

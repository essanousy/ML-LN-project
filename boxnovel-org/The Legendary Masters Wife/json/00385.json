Most people were heading in the same direction, and that was towards where the Cang Alliance had organised their auction\u2014the Goshawk Auction Hall.</p><br/><p>Duan MuQing had already prepared a horse carriage just when the sky started to turn light. He then hurriedly brought his men along to fetch You XiaoMo and the rest from the inn. Not long after, a luxurious carriage pulled up near the main gate of the Goshawk Auction Hall. It was the exact same auction hall that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had passed by the day before.</p><br/><p>The once empty area outside the gates of the auction hall was now packed like sardines. Carriages of all sizes were parked along the wide street, making it hard for a person to even move an inch. While Bei Dong\u2019s population wasn\u2019t much compared to other places, they could still tell the area for the auction was huge.</p><br/><p>After getting out of the carriage, You XiaoMo and the rest walked for some distance before finally reaching the smaller gate beside the main gate. The smaller gate was for VIP access only, only those who were powerful in Bei Dong had the exclusive right to walk through it.</p><br/><p>Compared to the enormous and boisterous crowd outside the main gate, the area outside the smaller gate was no doubt quieter and relatively more spacious. It was only every once in a while when a group of seemingly prominent and powerful people walked through the smaller gate. The middle aged man who was guarding the gate was neither obsequious or haughty, showing no sign of sucking up to them.</p><br/><p>Just when they were about to pass through the gate, a few people suddenly popped up and intercepted them. In fact, there were two groups of people who were heading towards the small gate at the same time.</p><br/><p>The small gate could only allow up to two people to pass through at any one time. Yet, both groups of people all seemed to want to pass through first. As a result, both groups ended up stuck outside the gate. The air crackled with tension. A hint of gunfire seemed to drift through the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Hao, it\u2019s you after all!\u201d The person who spoke was a young man who was walking on the right and he looked around the age of twenty-five. However, it was impossible to judge a person\u2019s age based on appearance in the Tong Tian Continent. Many who looked young were already more than a thousand years old!</p><br/><p>Behind the young man, two men of powerful presence flanked him. Judging from their appearance, one of them must be at least an Emperor level and the other, an Imperial Level. Seemed like those two were the bodyguards of the young man. To have the protection of two powerhouses, the young man definitely wasn\u2019t an ordinary fellow.</p><br/><p>The person addressed as Tang Hao looked similar in age as the young man, his handsome features tinged with a sense of self-importance. Similarly, he had two bodyguards at his side.</p><br/><p>After hearing the young man speak, Tang Hao shot him a cold look and gritted out, \u201cHu Feng, you again. Looks like you want to vie with me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should say, you want to vie with me instead.\u201d Hu Feng reciprocated with a smirk.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao scoffed. \u201cSince you\u2019re also here for that thing, then may the most capable win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I hope you prepared enough spirit gems. Don\u2019t want you chickening out when you see my bid.\u201d Hu Feng\u2019s eyes turned stone cold for an instant before returning to normal.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a voice rang out from the side. \u201cExcuse me, could you please let us pass?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden interruption caused the two people to turn towards the source simultaneously, only to find an eighteen or nineteen year old teenager standing not far away. From his aura, they could tell he was a mage. But as for the people beside him, one of them made the two do a double take.</p><br/><p>Standing beside the teenager was a man with looks that could rival the gods. He was elegantly dressed in white and even with his lazy posture, they could feel power rolling off this man. He seemed as powerful as the men they brought along.</p><br/><p>Despite knowing that, the two still frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Hu Feng shot back impatiently.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo obviously wouldn\u2019t scram. They all arrived at the same time and those two just had to block the entrance by squabbling there. They didn\u2019t want to enter, fine, but others did. Since they didn\u2019t receive his polite way of asking well, he had no choice but to use another method.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but if I remember correctly, the Goshawk Auction Hall isn\u2019t owned by you guys.\u201d You XiaoMo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI dare you to say that again, brat.\u201d Hu Feng\u2019s expressions turned sour. Without bothering to listen till the end, Tang Hao\u2019s face hardened. Both his expression and his voice turned dark and when he looked at You XiaoMo, it was as if he was shooting cold lightning bolts with his gaze. It had been a long time since someone dared to speak to them like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how many times I say it, it\u2019ll still be the same. You guys are blocking the entrance and not letting anyone enter. Is there anything wrong in asking you to move aside and let us pass? If you tell me this stretch of road was opened for you by the Cang Alliance, then I have nothing to say.\u201d As if he had not noticed the foul look on their faces, You XiaoMo rambled on with his hate-inducing words. The other two couldn\u2019t even rebut him.</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing, who was at the back of the group, had no time to stop him. After hearing what You XiaoMo said and seeing how Tang Hao\u2019s and Hu Feng\u2019s expressions darkened, he could tell the situation was going awry. He knew who those two were and knew very well not to offend them.</p><br/><p>The Cang Alliance definitely wouldn\u2019t open up this stretch of road specifically for the two of them. The Alliance wouldn\u2019t do it even for people of a higher status than them, let alone Hu Feng and Tang Hao.</p><br/><p>Hu Feng\u2019s and Tang Hao\u2019s faces flushed as they glared at him.</p><br/><p>Just when they were getting ready to yell at You XiaoMo, the middle aged guard at the gate spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Hu, Young Master Tang, this sir is right. If you\u2019re not planning on entering, then please give way. It would be unsightly to have a huge group of people stuck outside because they are blocked by you. If the auction is delayed, I take it that you two are taking responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Feng and Tang Hao\u2019s faces went pale and green simultaneously upon hearing his words.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t speak to him with the same attitude they used with You XiaoMo. After all, the middle aged man represented the Cang Alliance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever are you talking about, good sir? We\u2019ll be going in now.\u201d Tang Hao expressed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>He then looked at You XiaoMo and snorted coldly. Clearly, he had put the blame of getting reprimanded by the middle aged man on You XiaoMo. Tang Hao proceeded to the auction hall with his men trailing behind him. Hu Feng glared hard at You XiaoMo and soon followed after with his two bodyguards.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was not the least bit stressed, not even after offending two highly prominent people in the short period of time. They were the ones being petty and despising others.</p><br/><p>Instead, it was DuanMu Qing who broke out in a cold sweat. When they entered the auction hall, he quickly grabbed You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy benefactor, this is bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s bad?\u201d You XiaoMo had no choice but to stop when he was pulled by DuanMu Qing.</p><br/><p>DuanMu Qing explained anxiously, \u201cThe two that just went in, I told you about them yesterday. They\u2019re the forces from the Southern Continent. They definitely won\u2019t let you off after you offended them today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Southern Continent? What a coincidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re leaving Bei Dong in the next few days. Even if we are heading to their territory, we might not even see them since the Southern Continent is so huge.\u201d You XiaoMo said. If all else failed, they could just change their appearances. He and Ling Xiao had originally planned to do that when they reached the Southern Continent, lest people of the Vermillion Blood Clan recognised them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what if\u2026\u201d DuanMu Qing still had something to say, but You XiaoM and Ling Xiao had already entered the small gate. He could only catch up to them.</p><br/><p>The Goshawk Auction Hall was very large, it was like half a gigantic bird\u2019s nest. The auction hall was deep underground and the seats were organised into rows on elevated levels. At the top, different rooms were prepared for each of the forces. The rooms were allocated based on the black invitation letters given.</p><br/><p>The black invitation letter the DuanMu family gave them was for a single room. As everyone needed their own privacy, they specially gave him a room of his own. After leading You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao to the room, DuanMu Qing went to the room next door.</p><br/><p>The room was transparent from all angles so they could clearly see the people from the DuanMu family next door. After he went over, they saw DuanMu Qing speaking into the ear of a middle aged man who looked similar to him. They were unsure of what the middle-aged man said, but DuanMu Qing\u2019s brows furrowed at his words.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo might have limited IQ but he could guess what they were talking about, most likely what just happened outside. Dao Yun also noted what he saw before walking towards You Xiao to take a seat beside him. Suddenly, he realized someone was staring at him. He turned his head only to see Ling Xiao watching him expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Dao Yun felt a shiver run down his spine. He straightened his body which was already halfway in the sitting position and forced a laugh before moving to the next seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow You, you\u2019re really not worried they\u2019ll take revenge on you? Those two don\u2019t look ordinary to me.\u201d Seeing You XiaoMo\u2019s excited expression, he couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>Hearing his question, You XiaoMo nonchalantly replied as he laid against Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019ve already offended them.\u201d</p><br/><p>To say such a thing so lightly, You XiaoMo had DaoYun\u2019s admiration.</p><br/><p>From his observations, the two of them were most likely from the top force in the Southern Continent. The bodyguards they brought along was one factor, another being their clothing. It wasn\u2019t just the usual expensive stuff. The accessories they adorned looked very valuable and definitely not what a person from an average force can afford.</p><br/><p>Without a doubt, those two must be rich and powerful people.</p><br/><p>As they were talking, You XiaoMo saw the room opposite from them. It was Hu Feng and Tang Hao\u2019s room. Despite being separated by two layers of glass-like walls, You XiaoMo could see the flames of fury in their eyes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s heart thumped a beat as he shot them a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>As expected, those two were pissed off.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

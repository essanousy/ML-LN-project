Since You XiaoMo was close to him, he could hear him fairly clearly. The man\u2019s voice was full of hatred and fury, as well as a bit of powerlessness.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s gaze moved to the three white-robed people. Even though he couldn\u2019t see their faces clearly, they were all extremely strong. Moreover, ever since they had come in, the prisoners\u2019 mood had started to fluctuate excitedly.</p><br/><p>Even though it was faint, several strong, negative emotions were mixed in, which were all targeted at those three white-robed people, but there was more fear than anything else.</p><br/><p>The three white-robed people walked past the cell You XiaoMo was imprisoned in. One of their gazes seemed to sweep carelessly across him, and he could vaguely hear other people releasing a breath of relief when the white-robed people moved past their cells. The tense atmosphere also started to relax.</p><br/><p>After a while, the sound of iron chains clanking came from inside, followed closely by the sound of someone howling in fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go, I don\u2019t want to die, let me go, let me go! You\u2019re all devils, devils who don\u2019t deserve to die properly. I curse you all to have an unpleasant death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person was being dragged along by two white-robed people, and his expression looked as if he were deranged. But even though he was struggling endlessly, he didn\u2019t move them in the slightest. He was still dragged out, black shackles around his hands and feet. They created clanking sounds as he struggled, large echoes rippled through the expansive prison.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo saw some people shake their heads helplessly, and the suspicion and unease in his heart grew stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person won\u2019t be able to come back.\u201d At that moment, the man who had just talked to You XiaoMo gave a helpless sigh. His voice seemed a little lonely, as well as a trace of hard to detect despair, as if he would also walk that path one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You XiaoMo continued the conversation.</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t answer for a long time, and just when You XiaoMo thought he wasn\u2019t going to reply at all, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the specifics of the situation, but I know that it seems like TongTian Palace is currently carrying out some kind of shocking experiment. They need many experts, and everyone who \u2018walks\u2019 out of this place never returns. So they always need more people to make up for it after a short amount of time, and it seems that TongTian Palace is using some sort of honest and open way to catch people. How did you get in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo told him briefly about how he was locked inside here.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it was. To be the only one chosen out of a hundred people, you\u2019re also pretty unlucky. This is one of TongTian Palace\u2019s tricks: by using the competition, they can secretly kidnap a few of you from the hundred or so others. They probably announced to the outside world that you all already died. It\u2019s really a good excuse. If you don\u2019t have any strong experts supporting you, you probably won\u2019t be able to get out of here for the rest of your life. But even if you do, there\u2019s hardly anybody who is stronger than TongTian Palace. You should just prepare yourself in your mind.\u201d The man sometimes laughed and sometimes sighed helplessly, his expressions abundant. It seemed like he had also experienced this before.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lifted an eyebrow. \u201cWere you also once a student from XiaoYao Institution?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man hadn\u2019t expected him to be so sharp. There was nothing worth hiding about this either, and so he said, \u201cI could be considered so. Speaking of which, I would be your senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he thought of what happened before, the man\u2019s expression fell quite a bit instantly. He remembered how high-spirited he used to be, but in the end, he had still fallen to this point. If he couldn\u2019t get out, then he shouldn\u2019t have any more hopes for this lifetime.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had just entered, so he wasn\u2019t as emotionally stirred up. He also firmly believed that Ling Xiao would definitely rescue him. Moreover, Fu CangQiong also needed his help. Even though his cultivation base still wasn\u2019t high enough to refine the Samsara Pill yet, but the Cang Alliance better not forget that they still owed him a big favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried?\u201d The man was paying attention to his expression, and when he saw that You XiaoMo had no change in expression after listening to him speak, he couldn\u2019t help but ask that.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grinned. \u201cWhat is there worth worrying about? Someone will definitely come to rescue me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re this confident?\u201d The man still didn\u2019t believe him. Ever since he was locked inside this prison, he had never seen a single person who had successfully escaped, nor had anyone ever come to rescue them. When the typical person heard of TongTian Palace, they would have long since run far, far away. Who would dare to challenge TongTian Palace?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, my man is very powerful. Also, I have a lot of friends, and my clin\u2026 uh, my dad is also very strong. Just then, I heard that TongTian Emperor say that my man and my dad have been thinking of ways to rescue me during this past year.\u201d You XiaoMo said honestly. He said the words \u2018my man\u2019 even more smoothly.</p><br/><p>The man looked at him with surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the TongTian\u2019s Emperor?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded. \u201cOf course, is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes flashed. He only knew that the TongTian\u2019s Emperor was an extremely mysterious person, and back then when he had been caught, he hadn\u2019t seen the TongTian\u2019s Emperor at all. When he connected it with You XiaoMo\u2019s confident expression and words, he knew that maybe this person really did have the ability to get out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be trying to trick me, right? If your supporters are really that formidable, why would you be dragged in here? The TongTian Palace usually only kidnaps those who don\u2019t have powerful backers or supporters.\u201d The man said, testing him out.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head. \u201cI also can\u2019t answer your question. If I knew why I was kidnapped, then I wouldn\u2019t need to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, the man also felt that what he said was logical. \u201cThen tell me, who will come to save you? If there\u2019s only the two people you told me about, they probably won\u2019t be able to deal with TongTian Palace relying on their ability alone. TongTian Palace has a strong and solid inside information network, and there are also quite a few generals underneath the TongTian\u2019s Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. But I can say with certainty that I know a lot of Sacred Realm experts, probably seven or eight if I estimate conservatively.\u201d You XiaoMo said whatever came into his mind first, but he actually did know quite a few. He just wasn\u2019t that close with some of them, that\u2019s all.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes lit up, but he didn\u2019t directly trust his words. He thought a bit before asking again, \u201cGive me an example. Such as, your man and your dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy man is from the Qilin Clan, and he has a level twelve five star cultivation base. My dad is from the Vermillion Blood Clan. He\u2019s a pretty low-profile person, but he\u2019s also a Sacred Realm expert, with a three or four star cultivation base.\u201d You XiaoMo looked proud.</p><br/><p>The man sucked in a breath of air. The Qilin Clan and Vermillion Blood Clan were two large powerhouses. Even though TongTian Palace was powerful, it wouldn\u2019t be advantageous at all for them to provoke those two powerhouses at the same time, especially when they were doing something secretive. If they didn\u2019t handle it appropriately, it would very likely be exposed because of this.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t imagined that TongTian Palace would have kidnapped a big problem this time. If they could take advantage of this wisely, they could probably escape from Sheng Tian. A thread of hope appeared in that man\u2019s dead heart for the first time. After so many years, if he was going to die with or without fighting, then it would still be better to choose fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung fellow, if what you\u2019re saying is true, there still might be a chance to escape from here. But if what you\u2019re saying is a lie, then the only result will be that you\u2019ll die even faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Radiance shone through the man\u2019s eyes, and he looked at You XiaoMo intently and sharply. Even though he had been locked in here all along, so his cultivation base hadn\u2019t improved, he wasn\u2019t weaker than You XiaoMo. Moreover, his willpower was very resolute, or else his realm would have long since dropped.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded solemnly. \u201cI promise that I\u2019m not tricking you. Everything I said was true.\u201d Indeed, between Ling Xiao and his clingy dad, one was from the Qilin Clan, and one was from the Vermillion Blood Clan. The only thing was that both of them had drawn a clear line between them and the two major powers, but he wasn\u2019t lying.</p><br/><p>The man saw that it didn\u2019t seem like he was lying, and he finally believed him. \u201cFor now, don\u2019t make any movements, so you don\u2019t attract TongTian Palace\u2019s attention. If things are really as the TongTian\u2019s Emperor has said, then TongTian Palace should be a little chaotic right now inside. When the opportunity strikes, I will tell you how to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded, nothing changing about his expression.</p><br/><p>Inwardly, he was actually already extremely overjoyed. Before, he had mentioned TongTian\u2019s Emperor on purpose just so he could attract this man\u2019s attention, so he could trust that You XiaoMo was valuable.</p><br/><p>This prison had probably existed for at least over a hundred million years. The people imprisoned here were all Divine Realm and up experts. When he was locked in here earlier, he had also seen quite a few Sacred Realm experts.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe that they had all really resigned themselves to being locked in here for the rest of their lives until death. During that time, they had definitely looked for many different ways to escape, and their experience absolutely had to be more plentiful than his, since he just entered. Naturally, he had to utilize such a good resource well.</p><br/><p>Even though the man said there was no way out, You XiaoMo trusted that he definitely could think of a way. It was just because the chance of success was low, so he chose to bear it silently. That\u2019s what his intuition told him, and in reality, he hadn\u2019t gambled incorrectly. The man did indeed have a method.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, the person who was brought out indeed didn\u2019t return. Another person entered his cell. You XiaoMo had seen his face before, and even though he didn\u2019t have a deep impression of him, he was sure that the person was a rainbow level mage who had participated in the competition at the same time as him.</p><br/><p>The person looked like he was in despair, as if he had received some blow.</p><br/><p>After a while, You XiaoMo heard him howling and shouting loudly in his cell, as he only cursed out TongTian Palace\u2019s people in rage. Perhaps he was someone who had once believed in TongTian Palace, but now, this belief was completely shattered. That blow had to be significant.</p><br/><p>He had an abundant amount of energy, and nobody nearby warned him either. The second day, You XiaoMo saw him be taken away, and he never came back again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With such a natural and favorable geographical position, a person may not be able to discover them immediately even if they passed by. You XiaoMo was lucky enough to find a man-made cave in the area.</p><br/><p>The cave had existed for many years and it seemed to be the dwelling of some predecessors from the ancient times based on the traces left behind. Unfortunately, the entire cave had been emptied, with only some old stone chairs and beds left behind.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo did a quick and simple clean and wiped the dust off the stone chairs. Then he took the quilt out from his dimension and laid it on the stone bed. A good and soft bed was a must-have though he was not sure how long they would stay here.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao leaned against the entrance of the cave and watched his wife virtuously doing \u2018housework\u2019. He would occasionally point out areas where the dust had not been cleaned up and so on in an annoying tone.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo restrained himself with much hardship. He would not argue with Ling Xiao about this small matter seeing that he had just recovered.</p><br/><p>The sun had already set by the time he was finished with everything.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wiped the sweat from his forehead and took out the illuminating Night Pearl from his dimension. As it was nighttime, the entire cave was so dark that one could not even see their fingers right in front of their face.</p><br/><p>But once the Night Pearl was taken out, the cave was lit up so brightly as if it was daytime.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had always felt that this world\u2019s Night Pearl was really marvelous. It was not that he had never seen a Night Pearl in his past life, but that the Night Pearl there could not be used as lighting. It could only emit a dim but beautiful halo even in the darkest place.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that this feels like our home?\u201d You XiaoMo looked at the cave which had become a little cozier after he had cleaned it. He suddenly felt that the close to an hour of hard work was worth it. He eagerly ran to Ling Xiao and asked, like he was trying to take credit for someone\u2019s achievements.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have such a measly aspirations!\u201d Ling Xiao shot him a glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with this.\u201d You XiaoMo pouted. It was easy to realize low aspirations. Grand dreams were easy to speak of and nice to hear about, but few could realize such tall aspirations.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked to the stone bed where You XiaoMo had laid the quilt on and touched the soft and silky-smooth quilt. His lips suddenly lifted in a faint smile, \u201cBut you\u2019ve done a pretty good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was immediately healed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo went out hunting for a rabbit beast and bought it back as dinner because Ling Xiao wanted to experience his culinary skills. He had never cooked again since they came back from the Living Waters River Boundary.</p><br/><p>The rabbit beast looked just like a rabbit, but its size was different from normal rabbits. The rabbit beast here was more than one meter tall and was a type of low-level demon beast without intelligence. However, many practitioners liked to hunt rabbit beasts for their meat when camping rough as its meat was very delicious.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took out various condiments from his dimension.</p><br/><p>He bought these condiments a long time ago in order to cook the Thousand Spirit Earth Sheep meat. But his idea ground to a halt before it could take root as the meat of the Thousand Spirit Earth Sheep required a special type of fire to cook. Now, he was finally able to put it to good use.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had also gathered some firewood in passing while he was hunting for the rabbit beast. He piled up the firewood he had gathered and arranged the stand. His actions were quite practiced. This was also a skill he was forced to train in by You Bo. When he finished, he immediately dashed to Ling Xiao who was in the cave and shouted, \u201cI\u2019m ready, come out and help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao leisurely walked out, \u201cHelp you to do what?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pointed to the firewood pile, \u201cHelp me light it on fire.\u201d This was the method to make the best use of everything.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fire was soon ready. You XiaoMo cut the entire rabbit into four pieces, skewered them and placed them all around the fire. The remaining rabbit meat could be stored in his dimension even if they couldn\u2019t finish the more than one meter tall rabbit beast. His dimension had the function to retain freshness and the meat was also delicious when turned into jerky.</p><br/><p>In order to roast the meat properly, You XiaoMo was so busy he was running around in circles. One moment he needed to run to this side, another moment he needed to run to the other side, for fear of burning the meat.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stood at the entrance of the cave and watched this scene. Finally, he could not bear to watch it anymore and took the initiative to walk over to say that he wanted to help, but he was pushed away by You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ling Xiao raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pushed him away from the fire, \u201cYou had better just stand here and watch. I\u2019ll do it by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at his face which had been roasted red by the heat of the flames and sternly demanded, \u201cSpeak the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitated for a moment, \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019ll burn it and waste my meat.\u201d He personally felt that some truths were better left unsaid.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao gave him a profound stare before he turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xiao breathed a sigh of relief before went back to his struggle. Fortunately, Ling Xiao\u2019s fire was very strong and the rabbit beast meat was not as particular as the meat of the Thousand Spirit Earth Sheep. In less than fifteen minutes, the strong smell of roast meat was drifting out. The scent was definitely able to make people salivate from gluttony.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo surveyed the situation. Then he poured the condiments out of the bottle and began to season the rabbit beast meat. The technique for seasoning and roasting were equally important. The deliciousness of the meat would be greatly reduced if the flavor was amiss. After he finished seasoning, he then roasted it over a small fire once more for a while to finish it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took off a section of the rabbit meat and cut it into bite-sized pieces. He plated it onto a small pot and eagerly delivered it to Ling Xiao as he excitedly bubbled, \u201cTry my meat roasting skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao thought his family\u2019s wife would often surprise him. As a carnivore, he thought that the freshly cooked roast meat smelled more appetizing than food he had eaten on the ship at that time. His saliva was already flowing. No matter how voracious he was, his expression was as calm as if there were only a few steamed white buns in front of him.</p><br/><p>The Metal Swallowing Beast and the two Golden Winged Insect had long been tempted by the fragrance until they could not bear it any longer. They emerged from You XiaoMo\u2019s clothes and were about to throw themselves at the roast meat in the pot after eyeing it, but a hand quickly and nimbly moved the roasted meat away.</p><br/><p>They had thought that it was their Master who was playing dirty tricks and not letting them eat. However, they soon discovered that the roast meat was in the hands of Boss Ling Xiao after looking up. The three could only silently turn their heads and look at their Master while selling meng (cuteness) as they begged for a bite.</p><h5>t/n: Meng = Moe ( same kanji)</h5><br/><p>Naturally, You XiaoMo did not forget about them. He had already prepared two plates, cut off two pieces of meat that were larger than them and put the meat in front of them.</p><br/><p>See how competent their Master was. He totally waited upon them like they were children whose hands needed to be held while shitting and peeing. Where could one find such a good Master as him? The only one was in this family and there was no other !</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was not in a hurry to eat. He cut the other rabbit meat into pieces and put it into his dimension while it was hot. When he returned to the cave intending to share the large pot of meat with Ling Xiao, the meat had been completely eaten him until there were only scarce crumbs remaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ate all of it?\u201d You XiaoMo was astonished.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao cast a sidelong glance at him, \u201cDon\u2019t you still have more?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rebutted, \u201cYou don\u2019t normally eat so much ah!\u201d That was why he was shocked. A quarter of the rabbit was quite a large portion. Although the rabbit over a meter tall was not very big, it was really fat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d Ling Xiao kept a straight face.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s expression was a little complicated. It was only now that he realized that Ling Xiao was actually a glutton. This was really a big discovery. In the end, he could only take out the meat that he had just stored away. It turned out that Ling Xiao still had not had his fill and he had even snatched half of his food.</p><br/><p>The moonlight spilled into the entrance of the cave as the Night Pearl illuminated the two people lying on the stone bed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pillowed his head on Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder. He had eaten until his stomach was rounder than Ling Xiao\u2019s and was so full that he found it a little uncomfortable to sleep. He could hear the sound akin to the beating of a drum when he lightly bumped his stomach.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stroked his bared stomach as he softly laughed, \u201cWife, how many months are you pregnant?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo slapped his hand off with a face full of black lines. \u201cYou are the one that\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao jokingly laughed, \u201cIf the wife says so, then your husband can only comply. But as the party who is on the receiving end, don\u2019t you think that you are more likely to be pregnant, my dear wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cursed a word of \u2018scram\u2019 in rage. The day he believed that men could have children was the day when there would be snow in June.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your husband scrams, who will help you sow seeds?\u201d Ling Xiao buried his head in You XiaoMo\u2019s neck and took a deep whiff of the smell on his body. The smell of roast meat filled his nose.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation upon hearing him sprout off outrageous things the more he talked. He turned over then threw himself onto Ling Xiao, \u201cLaoZi will sow it himself. What of it? Bah! That\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m a man, no matter how much you try to sow, it\u2019s impossible to take root.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed till his shoulders were shaking.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grabbed Ling Xiao by the neck in humiliation and anger.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly grabbed hold of his waist as he ordered, \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared blankly for a moment. Just as he wanted to ask what happened, he found that the thing his butt was sitting on was getting harder and harder, and hotter and hotter. It pressed straight into the crack between his buns.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao flashed a grin at him, \u201cWife, let\u2019s satiate our minds and lust.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo restrained himself till his entire face was red.</p><br/><p>At this time, the two did not expect that Su Lang had bribed the shop assistant in the Magic Herb Hall and easily fished the incident where Manager Li had actually sold the Heart Flower Herb to them out of the assistant\u2019s mouth. He also had got a hold of the fact that they asked Manager Li to look for the Black Lotus Herb. Finally, the assistant had also told him of their greatest distinguishing characteristics \u2013 one ugly and one beautiful mask. Now, Su Lang\u2019s subordinates were already lying in wait for them at WuShan Town.</p><br/><p>Su Lang, who firmly believed that You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao would reappear, blindly waited there for nearly a month. Yet, there was not a single shadow of either target. Su Lang then realized that they might have left WuShan Town.</p><br/><p>Su Lang smashed more than a dozen tea sets in his residence and finally decided to pull a snake from its hole, that is, to help them find the Black Lotus Herb and then ask Steward Lee to inform them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

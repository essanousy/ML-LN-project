These people would just surrender, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason.</p><br/><p>The real reason was because most people had more than one match to fight. If they were stubborn just to not lose face, then it would probably affect the battles later on. If they were injured, it wouldn\u2019t be good for them later on. Thus, most people were very understanding when it came to girls surrendering the match.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao had only watched the matches in the morning before leaving the arena.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t a match between powerhouses, then it would be too boring to watch. They quickly got tired of watching and could only manage a morning of matches. Though, apart from Yan Hui and An Qiao, the others all had their matches in the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t expect that the usually gentle and soft uncle would be so fierce when fighting. It\u2019s like he became a completely different person.\u201d You XiaoMo walked in front of Ling Xiao, unable to stop a smile when thinking back to Cheng XiangRong\u2019s match.</p><br/><p>The hint of a smile appeared on Ling Xiao\u2019s face. \u201cThat area truly is a weak spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly turned and said mischievously, \u201cSo you had better be careful. If you make me angry then\u2026 heheh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ling Xiao said confidently.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao shook his head, looking at the other in seriousness. \u201cNo one would go against their own bliss. They will only work hard to gain it.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo paused for a moment before he figured out what Ling Xiao was referring to when he said \u201cbliss\u201d. He flushed, glaring at the other. Bliss my ass, work hard my ass. Not bothering to continue arguing, he quickened his steps to leave the twentieth floor.</p><br/><p>TN: Happiness( -xingfu) and Sexual happiness( -xingfu) have the same pronunciation. LX was \u201creferring\u201d to the latter. Word play at finest.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao followed with a wicked smile.</p><br/><p>By four PM, most of the matches had ended.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and company headed towards the thirty-fifth floor. That was the registration area for Arena Four. Since the matches were over, the name list for the second registration had been compiled.</p><br/><p>The thirty-fifth floor wasn\u2019t as crowded as the fifteenth floor. The number of people on each floor was structured like a pyramid. Thus, here, there were less than half the number of people than on the fifteenth floor. The presence of the people here was also much more intense.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo accepted the name list given to him by the male manager. They had come rather late. It was Qiao WuXing\u2019s suggestion. If they came later, they could get a better grasp of the situation. Otherwise, it would be easier for others to plot against them and they wouldn\u2019t be able to gain a good grasp of the situation either. Most of the names on the list had several challengers behind them, and very few were blank.</p><br/><p>Though they didn\u2019t know if the people who came after them would choose the same people to challenge or not, logically speaking, the powerhouses at the top of floor forty wouldn\u2019t have many challengers. It wasn\u2019t just him with this idea. Jiu Ye and the others had the same thought and all cast their gazes to the front.</p><br/><p>The name list on the jade board was organized by strength in descending order.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took a look. The five strongest didn\u2019t have any challengers yet. Just as he was hesitating on which one to choose, a name suddenly appeared behind the person ranked first. It was Jiu Ye. You XiaoMo thought for a moment before settling on the third ranked person.</p><br/><p>The reason for deciding on a different person was because if there were two people challenging the same person, then the times for the match would be set apart. For example, one match would be in the morning, the other in the afternoon. No one was willing to spend time on this.</p><br/><p>The matches would be held the day after tomorrow. There was still plenty of time, so no one was in a rush to return. After they registered, they each went their own way.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t have anywhere he particularly wanted to go, so he returned to his room with Ling Xiao. He still had much to do.</p><br/><p>After he let out SheQiu and the others, he hadn\u2019t seen even a shadow of them. Even the Metal Swallowing Beast had been lured away, off to play who knows where. Thus, the task of tidying his dimension was left to him.</p><br/><p>However, it had been a while since he had went back to his pocket dimension, so there were huge patches of matured magic herbs. It was a good thing that it was taking longer and longer for the magic herbs to mature, so he only had to plant new ones every few months. It gave him plenty of time.</p><br/><p>However, just thinking of how much he had to do had his back aching.</p><br/><p>SheQiu, hurry and come back, you guys. I miss you.</p><br/><p>At the same time, PiQiu suddenly sneezed and then wondered, \u201cThat was weird, is someone thinking of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu was lazily draped over the railing, his snake eyes watching the people walk about below in boredom. Hearing the other\u2019s words, he smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s probably that master misses us.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu was moved to tears.</p><br/><p>XiaoHei\u2019s haughty voice immediately gave him a heavy blow. \u201cProbably wondering when we\u2019ll be back to do work for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu swayed precariously.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu said, \u201cXiaoHei, there was no need to voice that. It\u2019s blissful to live in a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>PiQiu instantly received several more arrows. This was exhausting; he felt that he would never love again.</p><br/><p>On the other side, You XiaoMo immediately dragged Ling Xiao into the dimension upon getting back to their room. The only helper he had remaining was Ling Xiao, so he couldn\u2019t let the other escape as well.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had wanted to refuse, but seeing the \u2018if you dare run, then you can spend the rest of your life in the dog house\u2019 that was implied in You XiaoMo\u2019s expression, he reconsidered and accepted his fate.</p><br/><p>Magic Herbs were primarily green in color with some that varied more. It was an amazing sight in bloom.</p><br/><p>Before, he had only opened up ten field for magic herbs, but after he had gotten help from SheQiu and the others, there were now two hundred and sixty six fields, primarily geared towards growing high level magic herbs.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo decided to start from the level nine magic herbs since he was currently a level nine mage.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo first brought over a large bucket and filled it with spiritual water. Then, he brought out several griddles from the wooden hut, preparing to start work.</p><br/><p>With his control over his soul force, it wouldn\u2019t take him long to dig up a level nine magic herb. In addition, he could dig up several at a time with his multitasking ability, which increased his speed greatly.</p><br/><p>After fifteen minutes, he had filled two griddles and brought them over to Ling Xiao, saying, \u201cOk, now you have to use the bucket of spiritual water over there to wash away the mud on their roots. Remember to be careful, otherwise, if their roots are damaged, their effect will be reduced.\u201d</p><br/><p>This method was the best for the inexperienced Ling Xiao. Otherwise, if he had to clean them by hand, he might damage everyone he cleaned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I got it.\u201d Ling Xiao wore an uninterested expression.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was exasperated at Ling Xiao\u2019s response. To make sure the other wouldn\u2019t slack off, he increased his speed, dividing his attention into ten. When he was refining pills, he only dared split his attention into three, but digging up magic herbs wasn\u2019t as complicated as refining magic pills.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao picked up the thirty-first magic herb and was about to put it into the bucket to be washed, when he suddenly noticed in his peripheral that there were already two full griddles next to You XiaoMo. He couldn\u2019t help but narrow his eyes. Was he trying to compete in speed?</p><br/><p>After confirming that the other did have such intentions, the corner of Ling Xiao\u2019s lips curled down. In the next moment, he had poured a griddle full of magic herbs into the bucket. When he next took them out, most of the mud had already sunk to the bottom. The entire process only took four to five minutes.</p><br/><p>When Ling Xiao placed the two empty griddles in front of You XiaoMo, the latter stared dumbly.</p><br/><p>Five seconds later, You XiaoMo pulled himself back to the present and stared at Ling Xiao suspiciously. \u201cHow are you so fast?\u201d Ling Xiao had been wearing an expression like he would rather be anywhere but here. How come he had gotten so into it so fast? You XiaoMo could barely keep up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to be slow?\u201d Ling Xiao retorted.</p><br/><p>No, You XiaoMo really wanted to say \u2018it\u2019s exactly what I wanted\u2019, but he quickly formulated a different response. \u201cNo, I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To keep up with Ling Xiao, You XiaoMo sped up again. Splitting his attention into ten wasn\u2019t his limit. Before, when he was purifying magic herbs, he could purify more than ten at once, after all.</p><br/><p>This chore, through their constant competing in speed, was quickly finished. They had gotten through the entire area for level nine magic herbs and were currently working on the level ten herbs. However, there were few level ten herbs and after they had finished, they returned to the section for level eight magic herbs to continue.</p><br/><p>They only stopped when You XiaoMo had exhausted his energy.</p><br/><p>He decided that he wouldn\u2019t randomly plant magic herbs anymore. If they matured, he\u2019d keep them in the field and dig them up when he needed space to plant new ones.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t done this in a while. He was completely burned out.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao threw the last griddle to one side and scooped a cup of spiritual water from the lake for You XiaoMo. After You XiaoMo drank it, he was battle ready once more.</p><br/><p>Before leaving the dimension, You XiaoMo picked out some magic herbs from the ones he had dug up to put into his storage and bring with him.</p><br/><p>Ever since they had managed to successfully bid for the Heavenly Cauldron, he hadn\u2019t had a chance to try it out because the first floor really wasn\u2019t secure enough. Their neighbors would hear everything they did. The commotion from refining pills was too much to keep unnoticed, so he had decided to test it out after the challenges.</p><br/><p>Early next morning, everyone got ready for the day and headed confidently to arena four.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

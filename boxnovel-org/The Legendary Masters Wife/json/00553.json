It had nothing to do with their cultivation bases, but rather their bloodlines; one was a pureblood, while the other was a hybrid. Who was stronger and who was weaker should be clear at first glance.</p><br/><p>But when she saw her own Godfire being engulfed by Ling Xiao\u2019s Godfire, she was completely stunned. Her Godfire wasn\u2019t scattered, but rather it was actually swallowed?</p><br/><p>Only truly powerful Godfires that had the ability to engulf could swallow other Godfires. However, this kind of thing had never occurred before in the Demon Phoenix Clan. Their Godfire didn\u2019t have the ability to engulf, they were only separated into \u2018stronger\u2019 and \u2018weaker\u2019 categories.</p><br/><p>A mouthful of blood suddenly welled up from Ji Rui\u2019s throat, and the coppery taste spread all throughout her mouth.</p><br/><p>Having her Godfire engulfed hurt her vitality more than merely having it be defeated. Although the internal injuries weren\u2019t that great, she didn\u2019t dare to keep facing Ling Xiao after knowing that the opposing side had Godfire with the ability to engulf others.</p><br/><p>She had to deliver this piece of information to the elders of the Demon Phoenix Clan.</p><br/><p>Clan members that had the engulfing Godfire were a treasure for the Demon Phoenix Clan, but if this treasure bore a grudge towards them, that was absolutely a huge catastrophe.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving!\u201d Ji Rui swallowed the blood in her mouth.</p><br/><p>Just when Ji YunLang thought that Ji Rui was about to continue fighting, she gave the command to retreat instead. Her voice was also extremely panicked, and Ji YunLang froze for a moment. What situation was this?</p><br/><p>Ji Wen and Ji Wu weren\u2019t stupid. They could see that Elder Rui had received an internal injury.</p><br/><p>There was no advantage for them to continue fighting in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>Ji Wu didn\u2019t need to be told twice before grabbing Ji YunLang and running after Ji Rui, Ji Wen following close behind. The only one who didn\u2019t move was Ji Feng, his gaze following after them as if he had nothing to do with them.</p><br/><p>A cold smile appeared on Ling Xiao\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>He had no intentions whatsoever of just let them go like that. What was the point of letting go of cannon fodder that had sent themselves straight to his door? Moreover, since they were the opponents of that chicken, he would just have to take on the difficult task of helping him wipe out a few of them.</p><br/><p>Clear killing intent locked onto them in an instant, and with a slight flick of his fingers, flames seemed to shoot out.</p><br/><p>The four people\u2019s expressions froze before Ji Rui quickly reacted. A Dimensional talisman appeared instantly in her right hand. This was a medium grade Dimensional talisman, and not only was the distance longer than a low grade Dimensional talisman, it could also transport more people. The most important part was that it was fairly safe and stable.</p><br/><p>The force of the teleportation immediately spread outwards from the Dimensional talisman that she shattered into pieces, and it seemed that the force was about to surround them, excluding Ji Feng, who Ji Rui had forgotten completely.</p><br/><p>But in the next second, a few flickers of flame suddenly burst upwards from their feet, and in a split second, the flames were tangled around their legs. It was followed by the smell of burning flesh and Ji YunLang\u2019s screaming.</p><br/><p>Among the four of them, there was only Ji YunLang who had no ability to resist at all and was wrapped unwaveringly by the flame. Actually, it wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t react in time. It was that nobody had noticed You XiaoMo, who was behind them sniping them. He and Ling Xiao had the same line of thought.</p><br/><p>None of Little Chicken\u2019s enemies could just easily go like that.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Ji YunLang was about to resist Ling Xiao\u2019s fire, You XiaoMo had quietly attacked him. Ji YunLang\u2019s movements had only paused for a second before he was caught by the flames.</p><br/><p>It was as if the fire had its own consciousness. Just like the burned arm of XingQi, Ji YunLang\u2019s legs were melted right away, and they could foresee that he would turn into a legless cripple.</p><br/><p>But that didn\u2019t mean that the others weren\u2019t having trouble.</p><br/><p>Ji Wen and Ji Wu had seen how Ji Rui\u2019s Godfire was engulfed by Ling Xiao\u2019s Godfire. Although they were afraid, they could only use their own Godfire to ward his off in order to save their lives. But in the end they were engulfed as well, and both of them received internal injuries too.</p><br/><p>This scene only persisted for a few seconds before the force of teleportation warped them away.</p><br/><p>Silence reigned in the inn from both the people inside the inn and outside watching.</p><br/><p>The men looked at Ling Xiao with wonder, while the women looked at him with adoration. In this world, who didn\u2019t like experts? Powerful people would always be greatly welcomed.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t look at Ji Feng. He looked towards the doorway instead and said calmly, \u201cYou still haven\u2019t come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people watching from the door couldn\u2019t help but look at each other helplessly.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be calling for them, right? Absolute nonsense!</p><br/><p>At that moment, a person suddenly slipped out from the corner at the right of the door, telling them the answer. It was a youth wearing all white, pale and clean. After he ran into the inn, he threw himself at Ling Xiao, hugging his waist, revealing a dumb smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it, aren\u2019t I smart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao flicked his forehead once. \u201cYou took advantage of the opportunity very well, but you still can\u2019t quite be called \u2018smart\u2019 yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t approve of this. Nevertheless, he already believed that he was smart enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cSonny~\u201d When You JunQi, who had excitedly watched the entire thing unfold from the second floor, saw his son come over, he instantly ran down. He threw himself at You XiaoMo with a naive expression on his face just like how he\u2019d seen You XiaoMo throw himself at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>The instant You XiaoMo heard that familiar word, which were familiar to the point that his ears were almost bleeding, his first response was to hide unhesitatingly behind Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>You JunQi had already almost thrown himself at Ling Xiao\u2019s feet before he hastily backpedaled.</p><br/><p>There was no way that kind of \u2018father kowtows to the son-in-law\u2019 thing could happen to him, not even by accident.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked disappointed.</p><br/><p>You JunQi pretended that he couldn\u2019t see the disappointment on his son\u2019s face, and he didn\u2019t try to understand why his son was disappointed either. In order to change the subject, he pointed directly at Ji Feng, who was still standing by the door, completely unworried about how he would escape. \u201cSonny, this person is also from the Demon Phoenix Clan, how do you want to deal with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s impression of Ji Feng was still pretty good, and furthermore, he hadn\u2019t participated at all just then. In the end he had even been thrown aside by Ji Rui, this was too pitiful!</p><br/><p>Ji Feng knew that it was his turn to come on stage now, and when he saw them all look over, he smiled leisurely. \u201cBrother Ling, Fellow You, could I borrow you two and have a chat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>He directly told You XiaoMo that what he wanted to discuss wasn\u2019t simple, but the one to answer him was Ling Xiao. They should at least consider it for a moment, yet Ling Xiao just answered before he could.</p><br/><p>However, why was he only Fellow You, but Ling Xiao was Brother Ling?</p><br/><p>The most unlucky one of them all was the innkeeper. Ninety percent of the chairs and tables in the lobby had been destroyed, and even the counter hadn\u2019t escaped misfortune. But seeing their expressions, he decided that it was better not to bring up his hidden bitterness.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought a bit before still giving him a few spirit gems. It could be considered Ling Xiao\u2019s portion for destroying the inn, as well as their other expenses, before leaving to find the Demon Phoenix Clan.</p><br/><p>Two minutes later, the four of them gathered in Ling Xiao\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Three pairs of eyes locked onto Ji Feng.</p><br/><p>Ji Feng unhurriedly took out a flaming red feather. \u201cThis is a token of trust!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was the first to recover. He raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cThat chicken?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ji Feng coughed. When that rascal Ji NingYu told him that Ling Xiao liked to call him \u2018that chicken,\u2019 he hadn\u2019t believed him. Now that he personally heard it with his own ears, he finally believed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know that Little Chicken is connected to us?\u201d When You XiaoMo heard Ling Xiao acknowledge it, he didn\u2019t bother denying it anymore. He believed that Ji Feng had come prepared.</p><br/><p>Ji Feng said, \u201cI once saw that he wanted to send you guys some information. He only told me afterwards that you guys rescued him, and without you, he wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last phrase was a little strange when he heard it, as if they were Ji NingYu\u2019s second parents. But after Ji Feng knew about Ji NingYu\u2019s experience, he couldn\u2019t help but be grateful towards them as well. With his circumstances, if the two of them hadn\u2019t come to save him, Ji NingYu would have died sooner or later.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore?\u201d You XiaoMo hadn\u2019t thought that the chicken would actually be so careless. Not only was his secret discovered, he had also told the secret to Ji Feng voluntarily. Eh, should he kill him to silence him?</p><br/><p>Ji Feng was completely unaware, and he shot a deep look at You XiaoMo before saying hesitantly, \u201cHe wanted me to tell you guys a few things. What he wanted to say is \u2014 I\u2019m currently doing very well at the Demon Phoenix Clan. Even though some careless fellow will come over every day to provoke me, he\u2019s very stupid, even more stupid than so-and-so. As long as I go and complain tearfully to the elders, he\u2019s ruined, so you don\u2019t have to worry about me. Wait until I grow up and I\u2019ll go find you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flew into a rage after hearing this. \u201cWhat does he mean, \u2018even more stupid than so-and-so\u2019? Who is this \u2018so-and-so\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did he feel like it was alluding to him?</p><br/><p>Ji Feng shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know who it is either. When I asked, he wouldn\u2019t tell me who it was, he only said that you would know after you heard.\u201d</p><br/><p>You\u2019re still a bastard! Since you purposefully went out of your way to call me stupid, just wait till you\u2019re back. You\u2019re dead for sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides that, did he said anything else?\u201d You XiaoMo asked viciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing else.\u201d Why did Ji Feng feel like his current mood was very bad? It couldn\u2019t be that\u2026 for the sake of his life, it would be rude to keep thinking about it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo seemed to be thinking, and he said, not admitting defeat, \u201cThen you can go back and tell him to wash his butt clean and wait for me to smack him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Feng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know whether or not Ji NingYu delivered this message to Ji Feng, but it didn\u2019t change his desire to smack Ji NingYu.</p><br/><p>After that brat left them, he actually changed to become like this. He was truly lacking in discipline, so no wonder Ling Xiao gave him the name \u2018Douche Ball\u2019, he was indeed a bastard!</p><br/><p>As for Ji Feng\u2019s bearing, Ji Feng\u2019s status in the Demon Phoenix Clan wasn\u2019t actually all that low, but he had no right of succession, since he was of the fourth elder\u2019s bloodline.</p><br/><p>Generations of the fourth elder\u2019s bloodline were all people who supported the Demon Phoenix Clan\u2019s clan head. If they earned the clan head\u2019s trust, it was the same as earning an uncommon position in the Demon Phoenix Clan. But by the time it was Ji Feng\u2019s generation, the fourth elder\u2019s bloodline had continuously been repressed, so they needed an opportunity. Ji NingYu\u2019s appearance just happened to be their opportunity.</p><br/><p>Ji NingYu was actually someone who could become an heir for the Demon Phoenix Clan\u2019s clan head, and this was exactly the opportunity Ji Feng needed to earn the future clan head\u2019s trust. That was why he voluntarily chose to help Ji NingYu deliver information.</p><br/><p>The events at the inn happened before a big crowd, and news of it basically swept threw half of TongTian Continent in an instant. Ling Xiao was the current hero of the day. The Demon Phoenix Clan was one of the Four Ancient Beast Clans, and sparks would definitely fly when two great powers collided.</p><br/><p>Who would\u2019ve thought that although sparks did indeed fly, the entire course of events took place during a short five minutes. The Level Twelve expert of the Demon Phoenix Clan, Ji Rui, fled in defeat extremely straightforwardly, just like a heavyweight bomb in still water.</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s scouts had originally thought that Ling Xiao and the Demon Phoenix Clan would fight until death, before they would swoop in afterwards. But even the Demon Phoenix Clan\u2019s Ji Rui was defeated. This was something that had to be relayed back to the head of the family.</p><br/><p>The news spread very quickly back to You ZhenTian.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian was experienced and knowledgeable, and when he heard what happened, he instantly connected it to the engulfing Godfire. This was the only reason that could explain why Ji Rui would be defeated.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wife, there\u2019s been a turn of events.\u201d You ZhenTian paced back and forth.</p><br/><p>Lady Yin said calmly, \u201cMy husband, do not fret. Even if that person has the engulfing Godfire, the Demon Phoenix Godfire will not let him go either. As long as we fan the flames a little higher, there is no need to worry that nobody can face him.\u201d</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian knew that what she was saying was reasonable. \u201cThen based on your judgment, how should we proceed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will personally take care of this myself.\u201d Lady Yin\u2019s eyes were no longer indifferent. Instead it seemed as if they were deliberating over a storm of conspiracies.</p><br/><p>But her plans hadn\u2019t even begun to be implemented yet when a sudden piece of news mercilessly smashed her plotting apart.</p><br/><p>Two days after Ling Xiao and the Demon Phoenix Clan collided, the Cang Alliance released a statement directed largely at the Vermillion Blood Clan. The statement said that Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo were the Cang Alliance\u2019s friends, and anyone who was their enemy was also the Cang Alliance\u2019s enemy.</p><br/><p>The Cang Alliance had always been a neutral party.</p><br/><p>Before, even if two large powers started fighting, the Cang Alliance had never declared that it was supporting one side, and it had seemed as if they would always keep their \u2018keep out of other people\u2019s business\u2019 attitude.</p><br/><p>This time, their magnificent feat truly gave everyone a scare.</p><br/><p>There was nobody who believed that the Cang Alliance made this decision for no reason whatsoever. There was definitely some kind of trade that had occured between the two parties that outsiders didn\u2019t know about, this was the only explanation. Some people even suspected that it most likely had something to do with Fu CangQiong\u2019s little disciple. Back then, on his birthday banquet, didn\u2019t the two of them stay behind on their own?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

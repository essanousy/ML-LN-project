He wanted to get off from Ling Xiao, but Ling Xiao\u2019s arm was like a steel band around his waist, trapping him there. The other hand danced across his body, igniting his nerves. He realized, distressed, that his desire down there was already starting to rise.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had no idea his body was so sensitive. He had only been teased a little by Ling Xiao and he was already responding.</p><br/><p>He shifted in discomfort, but noticed that the hard object pressed against his backside seemed to be completely up. The heat seeped through the fabric, making him shudder at the burn.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flushed, \u201cWh-what promise are-are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh? You don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swore that if he dared say he didn\u2019t, Ling Xiao would do \u2018it\u2019 until he remembered. So, he said, \u201cI remember, but you agreed to let me, let me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His words ended in a stutter, refusing to come out.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao patted his backside, asking cheerfully, \u201cLet you what?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flushed further.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cIf you keep hesitating, you\u2019ll miss your chance.\u201d And then made to flip them over and pin him down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hurriedly pressed him back down. \u201cWait, I, I can do it, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Though he didn\u2019t know if he could do it, he wanted to try. If he really couldn\u2019t, then he wouldn\u2019t have any regrets.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pressed him, \u201cThen hurry up.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s hands reached for his collar, trembling. Usually, he could easily strip Ling Xiao of his clothes, but now he was quivering, unable to even take off a piece of clothing.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grabbed his hands. \u201cIf you keep shaking like that, the sun\u2019s going to come up soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo mournfully replied, \u201cI-I\u2019m just a bit nervous, let me take a moment to get used to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a very, very ordinary person in his past life. Suddenly becoming gay and getting him to top the very male Ling Xiao, he didn\u2019t have any confidence to do it. Reality was very different from your imagination after all.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiled, saying, \u201cIt seems like even when giving you the chance, you can\u2019t stand up down there.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that just a little too insulting?</p><br/><p>What did he mean, couldn\u2019t stand up down there? As a man, being suspected of that was very hurtful. Though he always lay submissively under Ling Xiao, that didn\u2019t mean he was like a woman. He had something down there.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo grew angry, and instantly wasn\u2019t nervous anymore. He directly tore Ling Xiao\u2019s clothes off, revealing the other\u2019s firm, sexy chest. His skin wasn\u2019t white and silky like water, but more honey colored, or a little lighter, very alluring.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo swallowed thickly.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t good. Every time he saw Ling Xiao\u2019s body, he would be defenseless against his desire for such beauty.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo deeply felt that he had been turned completely utterly gay. Women could no longer hold his attention. Instead, he always felt like drooling upon seeing Ling Xiao\u2019s physique.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao bent a leg, nudging the thing between his legs with a knee.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo startled, hastily getting up, but was pushed back down by Ling Xiao, that hard rod poking his\u2026 It almost made him jump into the air.</p><br/><p>He knew Ling Xiao was rushing him, but he couldn\u2019t help but shake. It was his first time doing something like this after all.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lowered his head, red-faced, and poked out his tongue after a moment of hesitation, lapping at Ling Xiao\u2019s lips. Forgive him for being thin-skinned, but initiating a kiss was too embarrassing!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao only found it funny, pressing his head down for a heavy kiss. His tongue easily slipped past You XiaoMo\u2019s teeth, catching You XiaoMo\u2019s retreating tongue. It was as if Ling Xiao wanted to devour him, kissing him until he was limp and breathless and then licking the saliva at corner of his lips. He smiled darkly, charmingly, and said, \u201cYou should be a human, not a dog, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo flushed again, defiantly glaring back at him and stuttering, \u201cWh-what are you saying? Of course I\u2019m human. I-I\u2019m just trying to get the feeling for it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes suddenly narrowed. \u201cYou mean to say you still don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said so, Ling Xiao evilly nudged You XiaoMo. It was intentional this time, that the swollen rod slipped directly between his cheeks. You XiaoMo froze in place; that feeling was hard to use words to describe.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was inwardly sweating. After preparing himself mentally, he forced himself to lower his head and copied the way Ling Xiao kissed him to kiss Ling Xiao. He wanted to roughly force Ling Xiao\u2019s mouth open, but\u2026 He didn\u2019t have the courage to do so and instead flicked his tongue out tentatively\u2026</p><br/><p>This move almost made Ling Xiao laugh. He caught the prodding tongue in his own mouth. You XiaoMo gave a sound of surprise, but wasn\u2019t able to say anything before his sounds were stifled.</p><br/><p>He was so weak!</p><br/><p>After that kiss, You XiaoMo lay on Ling Xiao\u2019s chest, panting.</p><br/><p>It was no use; he was too weak. Ling Xiao was going to devour him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stripped him from his clothing, revealing You XiaoMo\u2019s slight figure. His skin and figure hadn\u2019t changed; he was slim and small, his skin tender and white, seeming particularly soft and smooth. When he was aroused, it would gain a pink tint, like a ripe peach.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was losing all sense of reason, his expression alluring and his eyes clouding over with the haze of desire. In the end, it was Ling Xiao who had to act, throwing the rest of their clothing onto the ground and letting their bodies come into direct contact.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo realized, red faced, that he was sitting astride Ling Xiao\u2019s crotch.</p><br/><p>Without the cover of clothing, that streak of burning heat seemed to turn his skin even redder.</p><br/><p>Just as he was starting to panic, Ling Xiao suddenly grabbed the thing between his legs. That place was already perked up in excitement, becoming even harder with just a few light strokes.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but inhale sharply. This feeling was too much, he couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao mocked him, \u201cLook at you, and to think you wanted to top me.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo tensed, his awareness coming back to him, but it wasn\u2019t long before it slipped from him again. His entire body was limp against Ling Xiao\u2019s because that accursed hand holding him down there had rubbed the top a little. That was where he was most sensitive.</p><br/><p>Feeling that soft place tightly clinging to the symbol of his desire, Ling Xiao let out a slow breath. Then he let go of his control, starting to thrust without changing his position.</p><br/><p>Tormented by the intense pleasure coursing through his veins, You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t stifle the sounds that fell from his lips.</p><br/><p>This position made their intimate connection even deeper than before. The sensitive place inside him was battered and pleasure rose like a flood, making his toes curl.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t deal with the ferocious desire. If it wasn\u2019t for Ling Xiao\u2019s hands holding his waist, he would\u2019ve been unable to keep straight long ago.</p><br/><p>It was really too much, You XiaoMo thought hazily.</p><br/><p>Though he had long since anticipated it would end in such a way, this experience had made it clear to him that he would never get the chance to top.</p><br/><p>He had no way to overcome his original outlook on this issue.</p><br/><p>Before he succumbed to sleep, he suddenly realized that he seemed to have forgotten something.</p><br/><p>The next morning, You XiaoMo struggled to get up, his whole body aching. Remembering what had occurred last night, his face went red again. In the end he had been done silly, somehow letting Ling Xiao go for several different positions. He buried his head in his hands, returning to the bed; how did it escalate to that?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought of this absentmindedly and then his brain suddenly stopped for a moment. His head snapped up and he gave a shrill scream, \u201cMy half a lake of spiritual water, no, where\u2019s that beast egg?\u201d</p><br/><p>He searched around, but didn\u2019t see a hint of the egg.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao walked in, hearing his scream.</p><br/><p>Seeing him, You XiaoMo questioned him anxiously, \u201cWhere\u2019s my egg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s lips curled up \u201cYou laid an egg last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cWhere\u2019s the demon beast egg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao turned his head to look behind the screen, calmly saying, \u201cCome out, your owner is looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked over curiously.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the round demon beast egg jumped out with a thud. It\u2019s movements were slow, as if it was highly reluctant.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo opened his mouth a little. Even this unhatched demon beast egg was afraid of Ling Xiao. It seemed like strength really was the law here, but when he thought of what the egg had done in his personal dimension, his teeth ached with rage.</p><br/><p>Thinking of that, he gritted his teeth and said to Ling Xiao, \u201cThrow him into your dimension.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though his dimension was large, there was nothing in it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolled his eyes, saying, \u201cI\u2019m very sure. If I put him into my dimension, he might absorb the rest of the spiritual water in the lake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had no objections, but the egg seemed to. However, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t give it the chance, pulling it into his dimension when it jumped up. There was no spiritual water there, but he had plenty of Demon Beasts from the Paradise Realm, so letting it run around there was probably for the best.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo released the rest of his displeasure in a sigh. Out of sight, out of mind; his mood finally brightened.</p><br/><p>After resting for an hour or so, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao went out together.</p><br/><p>Ward A encouraged independent studies, so there would be no mentors to give them hints; everything they wanted to know had to be gained through their own means.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

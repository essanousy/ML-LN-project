It was hard to imagine that Old Eagle\u2019s ultimate move that made him famous, the Corrosive Yin Claw, was so easily countered. He was one of the ten gods after all.</p><br/><p>Everyone originally thought that the youth and his companion were doomed. After all, they had never heard of anyone escaping from Old Eagle\u2019s claws. Even if those two had some connections with Shuang Yu Hotel and young master Wu, it was impossible for Old Eagle to fear them. No one had expected a person to show up halfway. Not only did he save two people, he seemed to be very powerful.</p><br/><p>There were only a few powerhouses on par with Old Eagle,</p><br/><p>Subconsciously, everyone began to search their memories for this man who suddenly showed up. However, they found no one in their minds that matched this man\u2019s appearance. It was as if this man was a powerhouse that emerged out of thin air.</p><br/><p>Old Eagle\u2019s thoughts were obviously the same as everybody else. From the looks of it, he didn\u2019t look like a reclusive Master. Instead he looked more like a powerhouse from a family that had hidden from the world. No matter which one he was, Old Eagle didn\u2019t dare to let down his guard again.</p><br/><p>Liao Ya and the rest were already so frightened, they hid behind him.</p><br/><p>After confirming the target, Ling Xiao carried You XiaoMo and placed him beside SheQiu, \u201cLook after him.\u201d</p><br/><p>SheQiu gave his answer through his actions. He spat out a mouthful of blood. The collar of his shirt was mottled with blood and it was ghastly sight. With one look, it was obvious that he had suffered very serious internal injuries.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took out a magic pill once again for him to use. Although it couldn\u2019t heal him completely in a short time, the magic pill could prolong his life and not let his injuries worsen. Seeing that his complexion had gotten slightly better, You XiaoMo heaved a sigh of relief and looked at Ling Xiao smugly at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should reverse the way you say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s thumb and index finger were tightly pressed together before giving one hard flick to You XiaoMo\u2019s forehead. \u201cAre you trying to make things even more complicated?\u201d Ling Xiao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me, okay? I may be a mage but my fighting power is much more powerful than that One-eyed Scarface in reality.\u201d You XiaoMo huffed angrily.</p><br/><p>Said One-eyed Scarface was already knocked out and it was almost impossible for him to do anything within a short period of time. This was actually a mage\u2019s strong point. They were good at soul attacks and those who lost to mages tended to have their souls wounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Ling Xiao motioned him to look at Old Eagle.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s straightened back silently curled in and he gave a forced laugh, \u201cIsn\u2019t the disparity in power too great? When I reach his level I can also crush him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao spared him a glance and sneered, \u201cOh yes, if I didn\u2019t show up, you wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to grow and reach his level. He can crush you with a finger.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew he was in the wrong and he decided to just shut up.</p><br/><p>After he was done lecturing You XiaoMo, the troublemaker, Ling Xiao finally turned his gaze on Old Eagle. The latter hadn\u2019t dared to move. Before he could determine Ling Xiao\u2019s strength, he had to be careful.</p><br/><p>But after all, Old Eagle was like an eagle\u2014a king of the skies. He had his way in Central City for a long time. Even if he knew that Ling Xiao and him were evenly matched, his presence wasn\u2019t any less intimidating than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you, sir? This is the Eagle Guild\u2019s business. Please do not interfere with our matters.\u201d Old Eagle said in a low voice with a hint of politeness in his tone.</p><br/><p>No one had ever seen Old Eagle playing nice or giving in to anyone. Even if he was faced with the divine level powerhouse from Shuang Yu Hotel, he still had a high and mighty attitude. The crowd couldn\u2019t help but develop the thought that everything that happened today was an illusion.</p><br/><p>As if he just heard a very funny joke, Ling Xiao laughed out loud. His smile was not without mockery and he only stopped laughing when Old Eagle\u2019s expression darkened more and more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou attacked my partner and even asked me not to interfere. Is the head on your neck for decoration?\u201d Ling Xiao said expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere became silent for a few seconds before someone couldn\u2019t hold in their laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft.\u201d</p><br/><p>One after another, people\u2019s muffled laughter could be heard.</p><br/><p>Leaving aside the fact Old Eagle abused his strength to bully the youngster, even if they weren\u2019t a couple, what make he think he can go violent, but other can\u2019t?</p><br/><p>Old Eagle\u2019s face immediately turned red. He knew that today\u2019s matter wasn\u2019t going to be go down well. Since that was the case, he didn\u2019t have to be polite anymore. While his Corrosive Yin Claw was countered, that didn\u2019t mean anything because he didn\u2019t use his full strength.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao noticed his murderous intent but he wasn\u2019t surprised. Instead he was worried that Old Eagle would escape. If he didn\u2019t beat that eagle into a little chick then he wouldn\u2019t be true to his word.</p><br/><p>With the tense atmosphere, it seemed like anything could happen any moment now.</p><br/><p>The people who were watching gulped and their throats bobbed. They all stared wide-eyed at the scene, most likely thinking that Ling Xiao was also at the peak of divine level seven stars. Two powerhouses at their peak fighting it out was something they had never seen before. This was because whenever powerhouses fought, it was usually earth-shattering and the damage was catastrophic. If they weren\u2019t careful they could be affected\u2026</p><br/><p>The crowd slowly started to realise something. The space seemed a bit too small?</p><br/><p>This thought spread quickly and the crowd seemed to have froze on the spot. The next moment, everyone scrambled out as in someone lit a fire to their tails, leaving behind gusts of cold air\u2026</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was just about to comment about it when Old Eagle suddenly attacked.</p><br/><p>A black shadow flashed in front of Ling Xiao, the distance between them pulled closer from a few dozen feet to a few dozen meters in a split second. All they could see was that he had a burst of spiritual power that shot towards the sky as if it had been pulled from the ground. As he had cultivated the dark arts, the appearance of his spiritual power was greyish black. His spiritual power was extremely concentrated and if not for most of the people running out, his spiritual power would have stabbed their eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao pushed off the ground using his legs and his body immediately charged forward. The white figure flashed across the air a few times before directly charging towards Old Eagle. Within a few seconds they exchanged no fewer than a hundred moves before quickly separating again. It looked like they really were equally matched.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s eyes were in a blur. His eyes completely couldn\u2019t keep up with their speed and he couldn\u2019t resist rubbing his eyes. In the end, they fought again and judging from their moves it seemed like no one got the upper hand.</p><br/><p>Old Eagle had also discovered this point. He had already ascertained that his opponent\u2019s strength was on par with his. With the way things were at the moment, the only way he could win was to rely on his ultimate move. He still had a lot of confidence in his ultimate move, the Corrosive Yin Claw, that made a name for itself.</p><br/><p>Old Eagle landed steadily more than ten feet away and his outstretched right hand quickly turned black. The surrounding spiritual energy from heaven and earth started to roll around vigorously, a prelude to his Corrosive Yin Claw. From the looks of it this move was more than a few times stronger than the previous one.</p><br/><p>Dark energy was surging from his palm like a raging ocean. Like numerous streams and rivers, it roared as it gathered at the center, slowly forming an enormous black claw. This, was the real Corrosive Yin Claw.</p><br/><p>Even for a powerhouse who was as strong as him, they also had to avoid and retreat when they were met with his Corrosive Yin Claw.</p><br/><p>However, Old Eagle made a fatal mistake. The Corrosive Yin Claw was a dark art and while it might be extremely unusual, it wasn\u2019t without weaknesses. Its greatest nemesis was the Yang Fire, also known as the Qilin\u2019s Sacred Fire that could burn through anything.</p><br/><p>Previously, the flame arrow might have destroyed the Corrosive Yin Claw but due to its arrow form, it disappeared after it had done its job. As a result, Old Eagle never thought that it could be caused by the flames. He also wouldn\u2019t have guessed that Ling Xiao had the Qilin\u2019s Sacred Fire on him that could restrain him.</p><br/><p>It was a moment\u2019s miscalculation, but it was fatal.</p><br/><p>The Qilin\u2019s Sacred Fire was Ling Xiao\u2019s life-bound flame so it didn\u2019t take long for him to summon it.</p><br/><p>When Old Eagle\u2019s black claw had locked onto him, a wisp of purple flame shot from beneath his feet and morphed into a magnificent purple QiLin in an instant. It pounced on the black claw that was advancing towards them at a mad pace and roared, revealing its sharp teeth.</p><br/><p>The wild and sinister smile on Old Eagle\u2019s face instantly froze when he saw the purple QiLin tearing his black claw to shreds and swallowing it. The next second his expression became one of fright and terror, his throat bobbed as if he couldn\u2019t say a thing.</p><br/><p>A while later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple flames? QiLin\u2019s shape? Is this person the man who defeated You AnTai in the June Mountains on the Southern Continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The news from the June Mountain range might not have reached Central City but the Tong Tian Ranking had long been updated.</p><br/><p>After You AnTai was defeated, the Cang Alliance had striked out his name from the Ten Gods. Replacing him was a man called Ling Mo, and rumor had it that he was a member of the QiLin clan.</p><br/><p>Many people paid close attention to the Tong Tian Ten Gods Ranking and when it was updated, even remote areas like DongZhou knew about it as soon as it was out.</p><br/><p>However, this person didn\u2019t appear anymore after that incident. As a result, no one knew where he was. Furthermore, he only started to rise to fame so not many people had information on him.</p><br/><p>You AnTai was his equal in terms of power. He knew this because they had exchanged moves before and none of them got the upper hand. That was why when he found out that he was Ling Mo, one could imagine the shock Old Eagle felt.</p><br/><p>The Fire QiLin quickly devoured the black claw completely but Ling Xiao didn\u2019t take it back immediately. It had its aim on Old Eagle who wasn\u2019t far away, itching to make a move.</p><br/><p>With his cultivation subdued, no matter how he looked at it he had no chance of winning.</p><br/><p>Old Eagle wasn\u2019t stupid. If he didn\u2019t escape now he wouldn\u2019t have another chance. He quickly grabbed One Eye from the ground and tried to flee.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hadn\u2019t turned him into a little chick so naturally he wouldn\u2019t let him escape. The Fire QiLin chased after Old Eagle\u2019s steps, not the least bit slower than him.</p><br/><p>Feeling the fluctuations from behind his back, a ruthless look flashed across his eyes. He grabbed Liao Ya and the other two henchmen and threw them towards the Fire QiLin. As expected, he succeeded in blocking the Fire QiLin and although it was only for a few seconds, it was enough.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

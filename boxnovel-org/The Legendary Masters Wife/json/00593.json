If it was just one on one, it was very easy for a Sacred Realm expert to escape.</p><br/><p>For the typical Sacred Realm expert, their control over the dimension was three or four times that of a Divine Realm expert. Although they could be obstructed, it was impossible to block them completely, so it was necessary for the rest of them to collaborate.</p><br/><p>The three of them belonged to different major powers.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Xia Yin could trust Moqi XiYuan. After all, they had come in contact numerous times before and understood each other quite well. Xia Yin was keenly aware that Moqi XiYuan was someone whose trust was borne of trust, and likewise, Moqi XiYuan knew that Xia Yin always stood by her word. But the Black Spider was a different matter.</p><br/><p>Many people knew about the Black Spider. They were even more bandit-like than bandits, and they were a group of evil people who did whatever they pleased. One basically couldn\u2019t trust anything they said, since who knew if they would just casually go back on their word. They were people that couldn\u2019t be trusted, unless the sun rose from the west.</p><br/><p>The only reason why Xia Yin and Moqi XiYuan weren\u2019t completely committed was because of this. Although they didn\u2019t know the Black Spider\u2019s goal, when they saw how on edge the cloaked person looked concerning the solitary dimension and the treasure inside, they knew that they had already grasped the cloaked person\u2019s weak point.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin and Moqi XiYuan quickly shared a look before they finally stopped dragging things along.</p><br/><p>The cloaked person didn\u2019t reveal a happy expression. Instead, his expression became even more complicated. He wasn\u2019t an idiot; he could tell that the two of them had most likely come to an agreement.</p><br/><p>If they wanted to kick him out after finishing things up, they would still have to see whether his fists agreed or not. The people from the Black Spider weren\u2019t easily bullied. Moreover, it had only ever been the Black Spider bullying other people.</p><br/><p>The three of them each harbored their own sinister intentions, but although their calculations were created very meticulously, Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t someone who would allow them to walk over him. His wounds still hadn\u2019t healed yet, not to mention that he had used quite a lot of spiritual energy in the palace in order to refine the White Tiger\u2019s corpse. Fortunately, he still had several bottles of spiritual water which allowed him to recover spiritual energy. He drank several bottles in a row, and his spiritual energy had already recovered by half.</p><br/><p>As for You XiaoMo, he seemed to have disappeared.</p><br/><p>By the time Ling Xiao reached a safe spot, he wanted to give You XiaoMo a round beating.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was very bitter, he was extremely bitter. Originally, everything was fine. Nobody knew that he was in the underground labyrinth, and he just needed a tiny bit of time so he could escape from the palace and meet with Ling Xiao, but he hadn\u2019t expected that such an accident would occur.</p><br/><p>He was in the underground labyrinth, and the passageways had no sea water, so his circumstances were different from the cloaked person\u2019s. He could only depend on his own two legs to run out of the labyrinth. Even though he had a map, his speed still wasn\u2019t that much faster. As a result, by the time all the sea water drained out of the palace, he ended up being trapped inside it.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo resentfully slapped the membrane trapping him. He didn\u2019t even know what it was; clearly there had been nothing there in the gateway, yet he couldn\u2019t leave, as if he was trapped inside by a clear membrane.</p><br/><p>He wanted to attack the clear membrane, but he couldn\u2019t gather the energy. No matter how he called, the soul force in the sea of consciousness had no response. When he received the same response after trying multiple times, You XiaoMo basically had guessed what had happened. It turned out that after changing, the palace had the ability to suppress people\u2019s strengths.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was locked in the palace. Even though he was powerless, he could still clearly see what was happening outside. Everyone, including Ling Xiao, looked like giants to him, and their rapid movements also slowed down. Now, the only thing he could do was pray for Ling Xiao\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>After confirming that for now, there was no way out, You XiaoMo decided he might as well enter his dimension.</p><br/><p>The Metal Swallowing Beast and Ping Pong were currently guarding over the spiritual water lake with 120% devotion, since You XiaoMo had threatened to reduce their food expenses. Three pairs of eyes rolled towards him when he entered.</p><br/><p>The spiritual water lake was the same as ever. The surface was extremely calm without even a ripple. You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t in a hurry to find the Water Elemental Essence. He walked over and tested the height of the water. Thankfully he had foresight, so the spiritual water hadn\u2019t declined by much.</p><br/><p>If the Water Elemental Essence was hidden in Ling Xiao\u2019s dimension, it might be a little more troublesome. But You XiaoMo\u2019s dimension was essentially a part of his body, and he only needed to do a quick check to know what there was in his dimension.</p><br/><p>Only a short amount of time had passed before You XiaoMo found the Water Elemental Essence underneath the spiritual water lake.</p><br/><p>This fellow was indeed very inclined towards the spiritual water lake. At that moment, it was hidden under the surface of the spiritual water lake, moving slowly. Since the Metal Swallowing Beast and Golden Winged Insects were guarding from above, it didn\u2019t dare to move too much. It only sucked in a tiny bit of the spiritual water in the lake each time, and its IQ could even be compared to a cunning human.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for You XiaoMo being trapped in the palace, the next time he would have entered his dimension might have been a few days later or an entire month later. Just thinking about it gave him a sense of lingering fear.</p><br/><p>This fellow didn\u2019t want to hide anywhere else except below the spring. It wasn\u2019t hard to believe that his target was the spring.</p><br/><p>The high-IQ Water Elemental Essence was currently happily absorbing the spiritual water in the lake. When it finished absorbing all the spiritual water and swallowed the source of the spring, it could transform and become the first ever transforming Elemental Essence in the whole world. Then, it could go settle the score with the White Tiger and get revenge for being imprisoned for countless years.</p><br/><p>The Elemental Essence was blessed by the heavens, but it wasn\u2019t easy at all to nurture Intelligence. Its Intelligence had already taken shape since the ancient times, and after countless years of experience, its Intelligence had long since reached the IQ of a human\u2019s. It learned how to wait patiently like a human, and it learned how to calculate like a human.</p><br/><p>It originally thought that it was dead for sure when it fell into humans\u2019 hands this time, but it hadn\u2019t expected to find a spiritual spring here. With a human-level IQ, it knew very clearly the worth of the spiritual spring.</p><br/><p>The extremely excited Water Elemental Essence instantly calmed back down. For many years, it had been unable to transform because it didn\u2019t have enough energy, so it had never been able to break through that layer of restriction. Now the Heavens gave him this opportunity, and he definitely would have to grasp it well.</p><br/><p>Only a few minutes had passed before the human who had captured him put three demon beasts inside.</p><br/><p>The Water Elemental Essence was quite disdainful towards them. Before, it was only because it was careless that it had caught the attention of the glittering demon beast. In its heart, they had the IQ of small children, and it would be very easy to deal with them.</p><br/><p>So the Water Elemental Essence quietly slunk to the bottom of the spring and started to implement its plan.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s appearance told it that although its plan was perfect, reality was brutal.</p><br/><p>An invisible force pulled it out from the depths of the spring, and the Water Elemental Essence fearfully began to struggle, but its resistance was like that of a three-year-old toddler. It didn\u2019t have the capability to resist at all.</p><br/><p>Several seconds later, it was delivered to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you very surprised?\u201d You XiaoMo laughed gloatingly. If it weren\u2019t for this fellow being so sly back then, he wouldn\u2019t have wasted so much time in the labyrinth, causing him to be unable to meet up with Ling Xiao. Even though he sounded a little angry, right now, what he needed was a way to vent the worry in his heart.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo had clearly underestimated Ling Xiao\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>After the three reached an agreement, they caught up to Ling Xiao, who was still injured. The moment they entered the sea territory, the three of them quickly surrounded Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh heh, Master always says that I should not underestimate you too much, but in my opinion, you\u2019re just so-so.\u201d The cloaked person looked at Ling Xiao with a dark smile. Right now, he was just like a turtle in a jar, caught by their scheming. How could this kind of person be an opponent for Master? The cloaked person felt that Master looked too highly upon him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao narrowed his eyes indifferently. The \u2018Master\u2019 he was talking about was most likely that person. Since the beginning, he had suspected that the Black Spider had something to do with that person, since the Black Spider\u2019s underhanded tricks and way of doing things were way too similar to that person\u2019s. Now, when he heard this person speak, he was extremely certain.</p><br/><p>Xia Yin\u2019s eyes flashed. Judging from his tone, they were acquaintances?</p><br/><p>But Ling Xiao didn\u2019t bother with the cloaked person. Instead, his gaze moved to Xia Yin, and his mouth unexpectedly revealed a faint smile. \u201cAfter parting paths at the small town, I never would have thought that I would meet the Holy Maiden here. I wonder if Chief Mo Ma\u2019s two twin daughters are doing well right now? This humble subordinate dearly misses them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yin\u2019s pupils shrunk, and her hands curled into fists inside her sleeves. For him to suddenly mention Mo Xue and Mo Fei, it couldn\u2019t be that he knew something. It most likely wasn\u2019t very likely, after all, her plans were only made at the last minute, so it was impossible for them to be leaked out. But as the saying went, it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><br/><p>Although a war was going on in Xia Yin\u2019s heart, her face remained expressionless. \u201cIf Your Excellency wishes to see them, you can go to the Guma Tribe and visit them if you have a chance in the days to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao chuckled. \u201cIn the days to come? I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xia Yin\u2019s heart jumped. She suddenly was very certain that this man knew that she had killed Mo Xue and Mo Fei. Was this a suggestion or was it a threat?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have quite a bit of self-knowledge. If you want to live, then hand over the solitary dimension, and I can consider letting you walk away alive.\u201d The cloaked person started to laugh loudly. He hadn\u2019t heard the suggestion in Ling Xiao\u2019s words; instead, he thought that Ling Xiao knew that he would be unable to escape. The cloaked person felt extremely pleased in his heart and looked down on him even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so loud!\u201d Ling Xiao looked at him, annoyed.</p><br/><p>The cloaked person\u2019s laughter came to a halt suddenly. He was about to counterattack when his heart suddenly throbbed with terror, and he quickly retreated backwards. In the next second, a fire snake abruptly shot up in the spot where he had just been standing. If his reaction was one beat slower, he would\u2019ve been done for.</p><br/><p>But the main reason why he could dodge it was because they were in the ocean. Although the ocean couldn\u2019t extinguish Godfire, it could obstruct the Godfire a little bit. It was this tiny difference that allowed him to avoid disaster.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He stamps his foot on his chest and jumps off the bed, his whole face completely furious, \u201cWhy do have so many requests? I don\u2019t want to do it any more!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he tries to put on the boots he took off not too long ago.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao grasps his hand and pulls him onto his body with one tug. He says indifferently, \u201cLittle brother. You can choose not to do it, but then, we\u2019ll have to go back to the original agreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is pulled and tugged by him, causing him to sprawl on top of his body, his face directly facing the rather noticeable gigantic thing bulging under his hip. If it wasn\u2019t because Ling Xiao was holding down his back, he would have jumped up a long time ago. Hearing those words from him, his bright red face immediately turns black.</p><br/><p>How did it come to this? Actually it\u2019s very simple.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had originally wanted him to use both his hands to help him release the swelling under his hip but You XiaoMo firmly refused. That\u2019s because the last time he helped him, his endurance was too outrageous almost causing both his hands to be disabled. The other reason is because at that time, he spurted thick white liquid all over his body. That type of feeling is something he just can\u2019t forget even now.</p><br/><p>With You XiaoMo refusing to do it to the point of death, Ling Xiao changed the conditions to a whole body massage.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had given his parents massages before so he agrees thinking that this is more acceptable. At first, he used his two hands but Ling Xiao complained that he is too weak so he asked him to use his feet to step on his body to massage him. You XiaoMo agreed.</p><br/><p>As a result, from the start until now, it has not even been fifteen minutes and he had already heard non-stop complaints. A little harder, then a little lower, then a little higher. He has never met someone with so many requests. After 15 minutes, You XiaoMo refuses to continue.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t get angry. If that\u2019s what you want, then we\u2019ll go back to the original agreement.</p><br/><p>Although this kind of massage is very comfortable, especially when You XiaoMo uses both his feet to step here and there, it\u2019s really very nice. But he still prefers the feeling when You XiaoMo uses both his hands to hold his stick. That feeling is much better than a massage!</p><br/><p>He\u2019s the type of person that does it as soon as he thinks it. So not waiting for You XiaoMo to answer, he takes advantage of his unpreparedness to grab a hold of his little brother.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was just about to stand up when his body collapses again. Red-faced, he glares at Ling Xiao and stammers, \u201cYou, you are so depraved and shameless, again with this move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you call this depraved and shameless <i>ne</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughs out loud *ha ha*. His big hand scoops him up in one swoop while the other hand completely has no intention of relaxing its grip. The hot breath sprays on the his nape making the person in his arms tremble endlessly, his neck to his ears turning completely red.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t dare to struggle because his manhood is still in the hand of the other <i>ne</i>. But hearing these words, his heart becomes even more displeased, \u201cYou\u2019re forcing me and yet you don\u2019t think it\u2019s depraved and shameless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, I\u2019m just helping you to indulge in pleasure in a timely manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao says mischievously while putting one of his hands inside his clothes. He had wanted to do this for a long time, ever since yesterday. You XiaoMo\u2019s face is so soft so he was wondering how his body would feel like.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes seem to light up.</p><br/><p>From the outside, You XiaoMo doesn\u2019t seem as tangible as he is under his clothes. The flesh his hand comes in contact with is so unimaginably soft. The soft and smooth body is even softer than the best silk he has ever worn. Even more tender and lovely than the petals of the most exquisite rose he has ever seen. He hears a moan escape from the person in his arms next to his hear, making his heart start to tremble uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>This person seems to have been created just for him. Just one patch of skin, one moan, and it arouses the lust deeply buried inside his heart.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo is not any better, he feels as if his body is no longer his own.</p><br/><p>He never knew that his whole body would melt just from being touched by Ling Xiao. The friction between his hand and his skin actually gives rise to an uncontrollable pleasurable sensation. Such a sensitive reaction is really too unscientific!</p><br/><p>But in a daze, You XiaoMo thinks that this feeling is a little irrational. Since when did his body get so sensitive that such a familiar and yet unfamiliar pleasure would arise from just one touch? This is so unscientific <i>ba</i>, because before when he was bumped and jostled by others, he never felt this way.</p><br/><p>Thinking that his body could have become abnormal, You XiaoMo can\u2019t stop his eyes from getting red. He doesn\u2019t want to turn into such a strange person!</p><br/><p>In the midst of drunkenness, Ling Xiao suddenly hears a muffled sob. Weak and faltering. Looking down, he sees that the person in his arms is actually crying, making him jump in shock. Before, he never cried when bullied so why is he crying now?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao hastily turns his body around to face him. He holds up his face with both of his hands and unconsciously softens his voice, \u201cLittle brother, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019s ok, it\u2019s ok. If necessary elder brother won\u2019t bully you anymore. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this words, You XiaoMo lifts up his small fist and not knowing whether to laugh or cry, starts to pound on his chest, \u201cSo you know you are bullying me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lets him continue pounding. After all, that amount of strength doesn\u2019t hurt nor tickle. Later, when his tears start to give way to smiles, he asks, \u201cAlright, can you tell me now why you were crying? Do you really not like that kind of feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, he raises his brows. For \u2026\u2026. let\u2019s just say people for now, from that time are all faithful to their desires. They do what they want, and do what comes to mind. Why would they think so much? So he doesn\u2019t quite understand You XiaoMo\u2019s reactions. It\u2019s obviously something that feels good so why did he cry?</p><br/><p>Hearing his frank and bold question, You XiaoMo blushes almost turning into the glow of sunset.</p><br/><p>How is he going to answer this question? Actually, speaking honestly, oh, it really felt good. He has never experienced such a strong feeling so because it is so unfamiliar, he became very confused. He always felt that quivering just from the touch of another man is something not quite right. So for You XiaoMo who never considered that this kind of thing can be normal, he feels that there is a possibility that he has become abnormal.</p><br/><p>But for him to say this frankly to Ling Xiao, it\u2019s difficult for him to open his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t have the patience to wait one of two hours. Seeing that he doesn\u2019t answer, he simply urges him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo squirms for a bit but thinking of how much Ling Xiao likes to touch him all over, he feels that he has to say it sooner or later. So he simply drums up his courage and says jerkily, \u201cI I I I think I\u2019m a little abnormal \u2026\u2026. \u201d</p><br/><p>Although the last part is said as softly as a mosquito, Ling Xiao still manages to hear the word \u2018abnormal\u2019. Surprised, he looks him up and down saying, \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re abnormal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, just that \u2026\u2026. you just now \u2026\u2026. just touched me a little and I felt strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo buries his head into his chest. This type of thing should be a very intimate matter <i>ba</i>?</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, Ling Xiao can\u2019t help but burst out laughing. He had thought it was a serious matter and it turns out that it is this little thing. This is really something very normal. If he didn\u2019t feel anything wouldn\u2019t that mean his technique is too bad? Ling Xiao feels that he is making a big deal over a small matter. He simply lifts him out from his arms and says while looking into his bright red face, \u201cLittle brother, love between men is in line with the principles of heaven and earth. You don\u2019t have to feel that you are abnormal.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pouts, \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be man and woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao rubs his head gently, smiling lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s all the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at him doubtfully, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>He still feels that it\u2019s not quite right.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. This type of thing, it\u2019s only important that the feeling is there. No one will care if it is between a man and a woman or a man and a man. Just like you have feelings for me and I have feelings for you. Doesn\u2019t this prove that we are right for each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao caresses his cheeks.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looks at him while saying, \u201cI still feel that your smile is somewhat evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao smiles as he says, \u201cBe good. This is my very honest smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thinks it over and says, \u201cBut I still think that I\u2019m a little abnormal. The last time you touched me, I didn\u2019t feel such a strong reaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing him speak this way, Ling Xiao finally thinks that his sensitivity is actually a little abnormal. Normal people will have their sensitive spots but they wouldn\u2019t get so sensitive from just one touch. He still remembers clearly, You XiaoMo lying in his arms with a bright red face while his whole body seemed to have lost all its strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao says suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly grips his clothes tightly. This person, weren\u2019t they just talking nicely? The next second he is asking him to take off his clothes? Such an animal.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao raises the corners of his lips revealing an evil smile, mocking lightly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that your body is abnormal? I\u2019ll help you look at it now. See if there\u2019s something wrong <i>ah</i>!\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hesitates \u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Why does he feel that Elder brother Ling\u2019s smile is a little strange? Just like the children\u2019s tale between the big bad wolf and little red riding hood?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

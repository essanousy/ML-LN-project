The dark energy was dense and thick, and they could hear ghosts crying and howling.</p><br/><p>Originally You XiaoMo wanted to just fly across like how they did before, but just when he got close, a strange feeling suddenly rose in his heart, as if something in the Demon Beast Graveyard was luring him in. Last time there clearly hadn\u2019t been this kind of feeling.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo told Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was also slightly surprised.</p><br/><p>The Demon Beast Graveyard was an Ancient Battlefield. Even if there was actually something inside, there was no way it could have anything to do with You XiaoMo, since he had switched to this life halfway through.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we go in and take a look?\u201d Ling Xiao suggested. Although there was no lack of powerhouses in the Demon Beast Graveyard, including those who had been even stronger than him before their deaths, in the end they had still been dead for many years now. No matter how powerful they were in life, there was no way they could regain their peak condition in death. Moreover, his Sacredfire was their natural enemy.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rubbed his nose. The closer he got, the stronger the lure felt, and although it wasn\u2019t like he had taken drugs and couldn\u2019t control himself, it felt as if something was continuously hurrying him along. He had a kind of panicked feeling, so after hearing Ling Xiao\u2019s suggestion, he only hesitated for two seconds before agreeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go in and take a look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demon Beast Graveyard was just like a black purgatory. Deteriorating graves were everywhere, and even the mud was black without a single trace of weeds. Some graves were already split open or only half of it was left, and every two steps they could see a ghastly white skeleton.</p><br/><p>All they could hear was the sound of ghosts wailing and howling, and You XiaoMo\u2019s legs started to tremble.</p><br/><p>The first time he had flown across, he had felt that it was very scary, but still not scary enough to make his knees weak. However, it seemed that one could only know the true terror of the Demon Beast Graveyard by experiencing it firsthand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat direction is the lure coming from?\u201d Ling Xiao stopped walking.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo pointed in his upper-left direction. It was in the northwest.</p><br/><p>Someone who didn\u2019t understand the Demon Beast Graveyard didn\u2019t know that the true powerhouses were buried in the Demon Beast Graveyard\u2019s northwest sector. They slaughtered everything during the ancient battle and were extremely famous, so the only place that experts who came to explore the Ghost Tomb Mountain Range avoided and feared was the area in the northwest.</p><br/><p>Both of them were unaware of this, but Ling Xiao could sense that many big demon beasts were buried in the northwest. There was no way he could mistake that faint scent of danger that seemed to brush past him.</p><br/><p>For insurance, Ling Xiao planted a fire seed inside of You XiaoMo. The fire seed was part of the Qilin Sacredfire, and it could save someone\u2019s life in a critical moment.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly stopped and looked a little hesitant at the area in front of them, which was covered with black fog. The wind was like the sound of ghosts screaming, and it seemed as if countless tentacles would reach out from the black fog at any moment.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lowered his head and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, are we almost there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be right in front of us. It doesn\u2019t seem to have any malice, as if it\u2019s only simply calling me.\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t place what exactly was calling him, and he was a little unsure.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to go in, then let\u2019s leave right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of You XiaoMo\u2019s lips twitched slightly. Did he want him to go in or not? Ling Xiao actually used such a scornful tone of voice. You XiaoMo was also brave, alright?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go in!\u201d</p><br/><p>When they went through the layer of black fog that was clearly darker than the rest of the mist, a gust of dark wind suddenly scraped past their cheeks. You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but shiver.</p><br/><p>The graves here were distinctly different from the ones outside. The biggest difference was that they were clean. Not only were there no scattered bones, the graves were also arranged neatly into four rows. Moreover, compared to the place that they had just walked through, this place was indeed much quieter and didn\u2019t have any noises like ghosts crying and howling. There was only a deathly silence.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at the graves in front of him. There couldn\u2019t have been more than a hundred of them, and he tilted his head to the side and asked, \u201cWhich one is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the white-colored one.\u201d You XiaoMo\u2019s gaze landed on the fifth grave in the third row. This was a white-colored grave \u2013 not only the gravestone was white, but so was the burial mound behind it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao dragged his wife over, and he looked at the name carved on the gravestone. It only had the date that the owner of the grave died on, no surname or given name, and it seemed to be a nameless grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look yourself, what about it is calling you?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frowned. \u201cIt seems to be whatever is inside the grave that\u2019s calling me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to dig out the grave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 isn\u2019t that a little too disrespectful? After all, they\u2019ve been asleep for so long now, and they\u2019ll probably be really unhappy to be suddenly disturbed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said indifferently, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to dig it out, then let\u2019s just go.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stared at the white gravestone, and in the end he still looked away. He really did want to know what was calling him, but\u2026 there were many more of the dead, and digging up someone\u2019s grave wasn\u2019t polite. \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had just finished speaking when the white gravestone suddenly lit up. The outside seemed to be enveloped in a kind of holy, white light, followed by a blurry white figure that floated up from the gravestone.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao instantly retreated backwards quickly with You XiaoMo. You XiaoMo grabbed Ling Xiao\u2019s arm, and the entire weight of his body rested on Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>At first glance, it seemed like a ghost, but in reality it was a handsome guy.</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy was completely see-through and didn\u2019t move after coming out of the gravestone. Instead, he stood quietly in front of the gravestone, looking calmly at You XiaoMo. If one looked closely, they could even see that there was actually a trace of tenderness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d The handsome white-robed guy looked at You XiaoMo\u2019s scared expression and smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instinctively responded, \u201cYou XiaoMo.\u201d Only after speaking did he react, and he hurriedly covered his own mouth.</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy laughed lightly. \u201cYou are indeed a member of the You Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>This You Family should be referring to the Vermillion Blood Clan. However, You XiaoMo was a little unconvinced. Could he really confirm that You XiaoMo was a member of You Family just based on his last name?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who called me over was you?\u201d He asked probingly.</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy nodded. \u201cOnly members of the You Family can sense my call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then why did you call me over?\u201d You XiaoMo saw the handsome white-robed guy\u2019s cool appearance, and he suddenly felt as if he wasn\u2019t all that scary at all. At the very least, he had never seen a ghost who looked so pleasing to the eye and had even attracted him so strongly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am very grateful.\u201d The handsome white-robed guy suddenly said something completely different.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You XiaoMo was confused.</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy smiled but didn\u2019t speak. His gaze soon fell on Ling Xiao, who was standing next to You XiaoMo, and there was a bit of scrutiny and disbelief in his eyes. After a long pause, he lost his smile and said, \u201cI never would\u2019ve thought that after so many years, I would still be able to see that ancient legend.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing this sentence, which seemed as if it was spoken out loud to himself, the handsome white-robed guy said straightforwardly to Ling Xiao, \u201cYoung one, use your advantage well. It will allow you to stand out in TongTian Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The inexplicable statement made them feel as if the handsome white-robed guy knew their secret.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s eyebrows raised, but the guarded look in his eyes didn\u2019t disappear in the slightest. He trusted that if this man spoke this way, that meant he definitely knew something. This was the so-called \u2018hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy laughed lowly. \u201cIt seems that you still do not know the secret in you, even though I know very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twisted.</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy continued, \u201cI can tell you what I know, but you have to agree to my requirement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat requirement?\u201d Ling Xiao asked simply.</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy glanced at him admiringly. It was truly easier talking with an intelligent person.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt as if he was in a completely different world from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe requirement is that I want you to take care of him well. You must swear on your life that you will never abandon him.\u201d The handsome white-robed guy looked at You XiaoMo. Clearly, he was referring to him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly felt as if the handsome white-robed guy was marrying off his son. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had already found his father, he probably would\u2019ve thought that the handsome white-robed guy was his real father.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s answer was to pull him into his embrace. He said intimidatingly, \u201cHe is my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bit of astonishment flashed through the handsome white-robed guy\u2019s eyes. It seemed that he had anticipated that their relationship was unusual, but he hadn\u2019t anticipated that they would have this kind of relationship. However, it was also understandable. Many ancient experts would stubbornly use this method to raise their strength. Very few used the method of getting a wife and having kids. The two men had a very close relationship, and others would only believe that they were deeply devoted friends.</p><br/><p>Instead, You XiaoMo was a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Although Ling Xiao hadn\u2019t sworn, the handsome white-robed guy had already believed that he would protect You XiaoMo well.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, he didn\u2019t know what secret the two of them talked about. Since there were still other \u2018people\u2019 around, the handsome white-robed guy only told it to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Before they left, You XiaoMo asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know of a transcendent level mage called Dan Qing?\u201d Dan Qing was an ancient mage. It seemed that he was very famous, so perhaps the handsome guy knew of him.</p><br/><p>The handsome white-robed guy looked surprised. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t tell him about the red jade drive. He only said that he had received something that Dan Qing had left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was the most powerful mage back then, with the surname You.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was all the handsome white-robed guy said.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the last two words, You XiaoMo found that he now understood everything. When they left, he saw that the handsome white-robed guy was still standing in front of his grave, watching their backs as they left, a single shadow. He looked extremely lonely.</p><br/><p>Although the handsome white-robed guy hadn\u2019t told them his identity, You XiaoMo had more or less already guessed it. The handsome white-robed guy should be the forefather of the You Family and one of the experts that had fallen during the ancient battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Xiao, do you think that after they died, they\u2019ve been trapped in the Demon Beast Graveyard this entire time, unable to leave?\u201d You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but ask. He sympathized quite a bit with that forefather. He was so handsome, yet he could only live with those ugly beasts for the rest of eternity.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly reacted when he discovered that what Ling Xiao had said was \u2018nope,\u2019 not \u2018yes.\u2019 Was he imagining things?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao didn\u2019t need to read his mind to know what he was thinking. \u201cThe Demon Beast Graveyard is only a graveyard. It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t leave, it\u2019s only that they don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d You XiaoMo was puzzled. From what he could see, the Demon Beast Graveyard certainly didn\u2019t lack any extremely evil fellows. If there was really nothing keeping them in the Demon Beast Graveyard, then they would\u2019ve definitely long since run out. Why would they continue to stay in here, and moreover, stay for a trillion years?</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cThe leaving I was talking about was referring to reincarnation. The souls that are still lingering in the Demon Beast Graveyard are merely the ones who refused to enter the reincarnation cycle. Some have not resigned themselves to their deaths, while others still have unfulfilled wishes from their lives. For example, that You Family forefather has an unfulfilled wish, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s stayed in the Demon Beast Graveyard.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked. \u201cWhat unfulfilled wish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao looked at him deeply for a moment and said, \u201cHis wish has already been completed. In a little bit, the obsession keeping him in the Demon Beast Graveyard should disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis wish couldn\u2019t have anything to do with me, right?\u201d You XiaoMo suddenly had a spark of inspiration as he opened his eyes wide and pointed at himself.</p><br/><p>At last he couldn\u2019t be considered hopeless!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao nodded gratefully. \u201cI believe I know the real reason why you can inherit the Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s Inheritance Jewel and why people like You ZhenTian cannot.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo urged, \u201cThen hurry and say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, there were already traces of this that could be seen. The direct descendants of the You Family died and were injured left and right during the ancient battle until only the side branches were left. But only direct descendants of the You Family could inherit the Inheritance Jewel. This was the real reason why Vermillion Blood Clan\u2019s past clan heads couldn\u2019t inherit it.</p><br/><p>You ZhenTian didn\u2019t know of this. In the end, too much time had passed, so even if he captured You XiaoMo, he would be unable to get the Inheritance Jewel.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo still felt that something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cYou said that only direct descendants of the You Family could inherit the Inheritance Jewel, but I\u2019m also not a direct descendant of the You Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, the You XiaoMo from before was not.\u201d Ling Xiao looked at him meaningfully.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cWhether a member of the You Family is a direct descendant is not told by looking at bloodline, but rather by looking at the soul. As that elder said, as long as they are the direct descendant of the You Family, the clan mark will appear on their forehead.\u201d</p><br/><p>In short, he was confused.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

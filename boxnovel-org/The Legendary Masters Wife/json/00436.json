So, the moment they arrived, the attention was focused on them, especially those from the fifty to seventieth row from the left. That section was so excited that their eyes felt like they were spitting fire.</p><br/><p>Yan Hui and Cheng XiangRong came early and saved seats for them so that even though they came late, they didn\u2019t have to stand like everyone else.</p><br/><p>Once You XiaoMo was seated, he realized that those people were still staring at him and couldn\u2019t help but question, \u201cAre those people there our opponents? Why are they still looking at us?\u201d He was in his room the day before, so he didn\u2019t know what his opponent looked like.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin, who was sitting in front, turned to say, \u201cThat\u2019s them, although they\u2019re all from the fortieth floor, every one of them is sinister and crafty. When we went to register, they had already heard about us, but that cannot be helped since every year there are new students who are tough. Therefore, they pay close attention to those particularly tough as to prevent themselves from getting chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo scratched his head, \u201cHow do you prevent something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin snickered, \u201cOf course you can, if you weren\u2019t locked up in your room yesterday, this kind of information was easy to obtain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen hurry up and tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin lifted her delicate and petite chin to say, \u201cIf you call me big sis then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know what to say, he knew that Tian Xin was only nineteen, so to get him, a twenty-two-year-old to call her sis\u2026he felt his goosebumps rising.</p><br/><p>But right at this moment, his savior appeared, Ling Xiao, who sat beside him, slightly opened his eyes and gave a unclear glance at Tian Xin while saying, \u201cIt probably has to do with the lottery system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s why!\u201d</p><br/><p>With just one sentence You XiaoMo figured it out, it was in the rules that if more than three people challenge the same person then there would be a random draw at the stage. Only the one who was drawn could have that chance to fight.</p><br/><p>If these people knew who would be challenging them, then they could get people to pretend to challenge them. The more people, the less likely they were to be picked.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin pouted at little and looked towards Ling Xiao with blame, \u201cHowever, that is undesirable since its disrupting the rules and if the Xiao Yao Institution finds out, there would be severe punishments. Because it was so harsh, no one would break it unless they were sure they wouldn\u2019t leave a trace.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought to himself, he couldn\u2019t be that unlucky right? Since he did want to use these three attempts to get to the sixtieth floor.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the challenges began.</p><br/><p>On the jade plate appeared the two hundred contestants for the first round, since the number of participants was less than the lower floors, the names of Yan Hui, Tian Xin, and Zhang LanYu were all on the list.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin was already bustling with excitement so the moment she saw her name, she jumped straight up.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing said to her, \u201cTian Xin, once the match starts, you can\u2019t be careless, even if the opponents are weaker than you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin spitted out her tongue in response, \u201cI know, WuXing-gege.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had one hand supporting his chin while he thought. The three were middle tier in their group, however, for someone from the fortieth floor, they would completely overwhelm them. Take Tian Xin for example, her strength was that of a high rank level seven mage, to fight against a level six mage, there would be no reason for her to lose.</p><br/><p>Zhang LanYu\u2019s strength was unexpectedly high, he was a low rank level nine mage.</p><br/><p>As for Yan Hui, he could never see through him, this person seemed to be careless and straightforward but You XiaoMo always thought that he was a bit weird. However, he was definitely a high rank level eight mage, certainly strong and would have no problem getting to the seventieth floor.</p><br/><p>The three opponents were not the strongest bunch of the floor, so their results were similar to that of You XiaoMo, both of Yan Hui and Zhang LanYu\u2019s opponents forfeited. That was because they all had matches later on, except for Tian Xin\u2019s opponent.</p><br/><p>Her opponent had probably thought that since she was a girl and there was only a one level difference that he still had a chance. However, he didn\u2019t realize that under that delicate appearance was a manly heart. With pure force she sent her opponent flying.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had already knew that the girl was strong, but he didn\u2019t think it was this ridiculous. The man who she sent flying was at least one hundred kg and yet she did it effortlessly. It looked like that day when she patted him on the shoulder, she went easy on him.</p><br/><p>The girl who won the fight came running back jubilantly and blinked towards Qiao WuXing.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing couldn\u2019t help but laugh while shaking his head. Him telling her to be wary wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t trust her, but he was simply worried that the opponent might pull something dirty.</p><br/><p>\u201cEasy peasy lemon squeezy. It was so easy!\u201d When Tian Xin got back to her seat, her pretty face looked like a flower with how much she was smiling.</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing didn\u2019t know whether he should laugh or cry and said, \u201cTian Xin, you are a girl, beware of your image.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Xin paid no attention, \u201cWuXing-gege, look at the tournament, the jade plate\u2019s moving again. It\u2019s possible that you\u2019re up next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao WuXing shook his head.</p><br/><p>Like she said, there was new names appearing on the jade plate. You XiaoMo was paying close attention so he wouldn\u2019t miss his name, since there were less matches than for the twentieth floor, he had a pretty good chance of appearing. However, when all the names were shown, his was still not there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird, You XiaoHa your opponents name is up there though.\u201d Tian Xin, who had a sharp eye, spotted the name Zhu Hong, who was You XiaoMo\u2019s opponent.</p><br/><p>Hearing her words, the group looked closer and as she said, on the thirty-third spot, which was the arena number of You XiaoMo, had Zhu Hong\u2019s name. However, beside it, there was no name for a challenger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lottery, there is more than three people challenging Zhu Hong.\u201d Jiu Ye spoke up in his nonchalant tone.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was dumbfounded, wasn\u2019t Zhu Hong a powerhouse of the fortieth floor, then why was there so many challenging him? Also, he arrived relatively late and at that point he was the only challenger, logically speaking, this shouldn\u2019t be the case.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin had a muffled laugh as she covered her mouth, \u201cYou XiaoHa, it looks like this Zhu Hong person doesn\u2019t want to fight you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo rolled his eyes towards her and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say most people were too afraid to break the rules?\u201d This was annoying, how unlucky was he to come across something like this.</p><br/><p>Tian Xin objected, \u201cHowever, this Zhu Hong is not typical, do you know of a Clean Sweep Victory?Well, you probably don\u2019t. In the Giganticus, there is a special rule that says if you can win six matches in a row, with having opponents at a higher level, then you can go straight up twenty floors. I heard that Zhu Hong was preparing to challenge this rule and yesterday he already won against someone stronger, if he lost to you here, then his record from before would be useless. The next time he could challenge again would be in three months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Hui continued while grinning, \u201cThe great disparity between you two is so large that even if he won yesterday, there was no way he could win against you currently.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wanted to die, if he had known earlier he wouldn\u2019t have picked him. Even if it meant challenging the same person as Qiao WuXing that would\u2019ve been fine, but now it was all up to luck. His was going crazy just picturing being stuck at the fortieth floor while everyone else went up to the sixtieth.</p><br/><p>\u201cServes you right!\u201d Qiao An\u2019s gloating voice appeared expectedly.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had expected that he would add insult to injury, so he just rolled his eyes and pretended not to have heard anything. Then he leaned on Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder and made a forty-five degrees sadness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing\u2026Eh, do you think I will be picked?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said, \u201cYou just have to believe that you have a halo above you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d What, the main character halo?</p><br/><p>The lottery was done in front of everyone, however, it wasn\u2019t just Zhu Hong with multiple challengers, so it took a while to get to him. Once it was Zhu Hong\u2019s turn, the audience suddenly became a lot quieter. The people here knew the context better than Tian Xin did and also knew that to not fight You XiaoMo, he cheated.</p><br/><p>Once Zhu Hong stood on top of the thirty-third arena, even though it was hard to tell his expression due to the distance, You XiaoMo felt that this person here was in a composed complacency.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo thought to himself, \u201cDage, you can\u2019t just sacrifice me because you want the Clean Sweep Victory, that\u2019s unethical. If I\u2019m not chosen, I\u2019m fighting you for my third chance, you got me? So if you got me then just be a good boy and pick me, I won\u2019t embarrass you, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>A little while later, the referee of the thirty-third arrived with a stack of paper.</p><br/><p>In the referee\u2019s hands were names of Zhu Hong\u2019s challengers and all he had to do was to choose one of the paper slips.</p><br/><p>There were a total of elven paper slips, if You XiaoMo \u2018stand out amongst the crowd\u2019, he had less than one tenth of a chance to do so. It was so low that most people thought it was impossible, however that didn\u2019t deny the fact that it was a tense situation.</p><br/><p>Most of the audience was focused on Zhu Hong.</p><br/><p>The best part was, on a nearby stage, a pair also had a burning gossip spirit and actually both called for a pause, so they could fight later. The referee was angered to the point of laughing.</p><br/><p>So, the referee walked over with the slips to Zhu Zhong, with the latter very casually pulling one out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Some were so startled they fell off their chairs and landed with their bottoms on the floor, each wearing stunned expressions on their faces. Hu KangNing, who was in the path of the two pressures, was the first to be hit.</p><br/><p>When faced with such an aura, the Imperial level powerhouse was like a dinghy weathering out the storms and winds on the ocean. Without the chance to retaliate, he was thrown out of the inn by the immense force of the aura. His battered body hit the opposite stone wall like a rag and then crashed, rolling a few rounds on the ground before coming to a stop. By then, the guy was already breathing feebly.</p><br/><p>Deathly silence swept across the inn. A few seconds later, a sharp intake of breath could be heard throughout the inn, followed by many more to come. The looks that everyone gave to the handsome man and the youth immediately had more fear and respect in them. While they didn\u2019t know who attacked, it was definitely one of the two and many were leaning towards the handsome man had committed it.</p><br/><p>Just when everyone else was still caught in a state of shock and confusion, a loud sound suddenly caught their attention. The source of the sound had originated from the side and everyone turned to face it. Unsurprisingly, they saw Hu Yin, who wore an expression as dark as soot. His right hand was clenched tightly into a fist as he slammed it on the table. Clearly, he was the one who made the sound. He glared coldly at the handsome man and the youth, just like a venomous snake would with its prey. It was as if any second now, he would crush their bones and swallow them whole.</p><br/><p>The people from Yu Xian City standing behind him were also shooting them icy stares as if they were watching corpses. They were ready to stir up trouble from the looks of it and it seemed like they might attack anytime.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you belittle my Yu Xian City too much. You dared to hit my people in front of me. If I don\u2019t get an explanation today, then I\u2019ll take it as the two of you want to challenge Yu Xian City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Yin stood up and the aura of a powerhouse immediately burst forth from within him, followed by frenzied Pressure that swept towards them like a storm. The handsome man lifted his eyes and lazily glanced at him. Hu Yin\u2019s aura was timely blocked by an invisible wall and could not get any closer.</p><br/><p>After a while, the aura that Hu Yin had intentionally let burst out from himself had bounced back at him. Not only did he not gain the upper hand, his face paled instead. The him right now no longer had the smugness and arrogance he had previously as he stared at the handsome man in aghast.</p><br/><p>By solely comparing auras alone, he was completely floored. One could also say he was utterly defeated by the handsome man. Hu Yin was an Emperor level Three Star powerhouse and for someone to defeat him using aura alone, the person must either be an Emperor level Seven Star or Divine level powerhouse. No matter which one he was, the handsome man was far superior than him in terms of power.</p><br/><p>On the sidelines, the plastered smile on Cheng DongQing\u2019s face disappeared and was replaced with a grim look on his face. He gave the handsome man a complicated and fearful look as he stared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like this sir really wants to become enemies with Yu Xian City. Since it\u2019s already like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Hu Yin had Yu Xian City backing him up, he didn\u2019t dare to act recklessly before the others from Yu Xian City arrived. Should the other party intend to kill him because of that, then it would do him more harm than good. But still, he was unwilling to lose the war of words.</p><br/><p>The handsome man smirked and finally spoke his first sentence. \u201cYou\u2019ve been yapping non-stop about Yu Xian City. Do you know how to say something else? If you feel that I\u2019ve slighted or challenged Yu Xian City, then why not take action against me now? Or am I right to say that you\u2019re afraid of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what he said, Hu Yin\u2019s face turned green.</p><br/><p>What he said was the truth. Indeed, Hu Yin couldn\u2019t defeat him and feared his power. But to lay it bare in front of everyone else at the inn, how could he not be embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Hu Yin clenched his fist. With eyes were aflame and with a twisted look on his face, he screamed at the handsome man.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you have the balls you stay here and don\u2019t leave! Wait till Yu Xian City\u2019s elders come and teach you a lesson! I\u2019ll see if you\u2019re still so arrogant then!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad!\u201d The youth beside the handsome man quipped. The look he gave Hu Yin was one full of frustration. His head hurt. This guy never stopped talking. After he was done talking, the youth no longer paid any attention to Hu Yin. He buried his face in the arms of the handsome man and mumbled something, making others wonder what he was complaining about.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?! If you have the guts I dare you to say it again!\u201d Hu Yin\u2019s sharp and piercing voice could be heard once again. It already pissed him off enough to have one person insulting him and now this seemingly weak youth had the gall to reprimand him! How dare he despise him just because he had a powerful companion with him!</p><br/><p>Being repeatedly slighted by the other party set all of Hu Yin\u2019s rational thoughts on fire. He was almost at the end of his fuse and he really wanted to slaughter them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain, calm down. You are not his match as of now. It\u2019s never too late to take revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Imperial level powerhouses who sat at the next table were also Hu Yin\u2019s men. Seeing as he almost lost all rationality to his anger, they quickly came up to hold him back for fear that he might just charge ahead.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Cheng DongQing suddenly cut in, \u201cBrother Hu Yin, what they said is reasonable. Please don\u2019t act recklessly, that man might really kill you. There\u2019s no need to risk your life over a fit of anger. You have a bright future ahead and if you die here, it really won\u2019t be worth it. Let\u2019s just leave him to the elders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng DongQing\u2019s words were like a pail of water that doused the fire in Hu Yin\u2019s heart. The flames of fury had mostly been put out. He might not have listened to his two underlings, but Cheng DongQing was different. He was the disciple of Master XiLe, who was one of the board members of the Southern Continent Mage Guild. As the saying went, \u201cNot for the sake of the monk, but for that of the Buddha.\u201d Even if he didn\u2019t want to listen to Cheng DongQing he had to, in order to give face to his Master. Furthermore, what was most important was that he had a way out without embarrassing himself too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cHng! Since Brother DongQing has already said so, I\u2019ll do it for Brother DongQing.\u201d Hu Yin acted all high and mighty as he said, then grunted coldly when he looked at the two of them. What a prideful guy. Despite clearly being on the losing end, he still had to find words to salvage his hurt pride. Didn\u2019t he realise he was making himself more of a joke to others? What a classic \u2018turn tail and run\u2019 situation.</p><br/><p>After he delivered what he had to say, Hu Yin got his men to carry Hu KangNing who was outside and left.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stay in that inn any longer. Even if he wasn\u2019t pissed to death, he had lost all face there. He had lost all face to remain there anymore. Neither did Cheng DongQing stay behind.</p><br/><p>The inn once again resumed its peace. After a while, people started to whisper and discuss. The Yu Xian City which had had their way on the Southern Continent for many years had finally met its match in this inn. Not only were they unable to fight back, they even had to flee from the inn in defeat. This was the first time in history that such a thing happened.</p><br/><p>After the initial stages of shock\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBack to the topic, why would people from Yu Xian City and the Mage Guild be in June City at the same time? Judging from Hu Yin\u2019s tone, it seems like some elders will be coming over. Don\u2019t tell me something big happened? But why haven\u2019t we heard anything about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after, the crowd\u2019s attention was redirected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the Yu Xian City and the Mage Guild are here to train. Something must have happened and the news was contained. That\u2019s why we know nothing about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Yu Xian City and the Mage Guild are here, then the other forces are sure to follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sure gets people pumped! I wonder what will happen this time.\u201d\u2026\u2026Just when everyone was busy buzzing around, the handsome man and the youth stood up. Their every move was scrutinised by the people there and when they stood, the noise died down a bit.</p><br/><p>The handsome man helped the slightly tipsy youth up the stairs and they were instantly hidden away from the inquiring looks others gave them. Yet, the crowd still refused to give up as they stared in the direction they left.</p><br/><p>When they returned to their room, the youth suddenly lifted his slightly flushed face and wrapped his arms around the man\u2019s neck. Then, he kissed him.</p><br/><p>The youth nipped at his lips clumsily as they shared a drunken kiss that tasted of wine. While it was sloppy and slightly painful, it had undoubtedly fanned the man\u2019s desire. He quickly bent down to gather the youth in his arms and carried him to bed.</p><br/><p>As the man laid on top, he suddenly reached out to grab a ball of white stuff before conveniently throwing it out. Following this series of actions, the youth\u2019s appearance underwent a drastic change.</p><br/><p>The ordinary face transformed into one with fine and delicate features as the youth turned into a teenager. And that teenager, was no other than You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Said white ball of stuff that was tossed away by the man landed on the ground lightly. It meowed resentfully at the two on the bed before hopping its way out of the room.</p><br/><p>Seeing as the person under him was still dizzy, the man took advantage of it and leaned down to seal the teenager\u2019s lips with his. He easily pried open his clenched teeth and his tongue eagerly swept over every corner of his mouth. Teasing as he sucked on the teenager\u2019s tongue, the man kept his hands busy by sliding them under the teenager\u2019s shirt. And when he found that nub, he pinched it forcefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t suppress his moan when he felt the stimulation. In return, he wrapped his arms even tighter around the man.</p><br/><p>In the next second, his lips were captured once again by the man and his moans were swallowed in the kiss. You XiaoMo was already drunk since earlier on. His body had gone all soft and weak and ready for the man to have his way with it.</p><br/><p>The man released his lips and brushed his cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like you only behave slightly more passionately when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d The man gently smiled.</p><br/><p>At that moment, You XiaoMo suddenly lifted one leg. His knee just brushed against the bulge between the man\u2019s legs which sent a wave of heat coursing through his body. Meanwhile, the person who started it was laughing out loud inconsiderately.</p><br/><p>The man sucked in a breath before lowering his head to kiss him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little imp!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

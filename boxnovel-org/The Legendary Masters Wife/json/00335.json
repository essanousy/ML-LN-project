Be it in strength or in the psychological aspect, all aspects had increased. The transportation circle was no longer a hurdle for him.</p><br/><p>The mode of transport used by You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao the last time they came to Yan City was by riding the Gigantic Firebird. The location they disembarked from the Gigantic Firebird was at the outskirts of Yan City and the transportation circle they were going to be travelling by was nearby.</p><br/><p>The three immediately hurried out after exiting the city gates.</p><br/><p>It took them less than half an hour to reach the transfer point.</p><br/><p>The transfer point had many transport circles and the circles were organized up based on the transportation distance. They were going back to the South and would be covering a very long distance, thus they needed to use the largest transport circle.</p><br/><p>The price of using the transport circle was much more expensive than what You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao paid when they first came from NanYe City. They paid a hundred thousand gold coins at that time. Such a sum was already considered to be expensive. But now, the price had more than doubled and they were required to pay two hundred thousand gold coins per person.</p><br/><p>The upside was that Yan City\u2019s transport circle would bypass Hei Yin Village and they would be sent directly to the in-the-middle-of-nowhere Nan Ye City. Unfortunately, transport circles only ran one-way, thus people were unable to be sent directly from Nan Ye City to Yan City.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou was speechless when he heard this, \u201cAlthough the journey from the North to South is very far, but this price is too outrageous. All the gold coins that I am carrying have been already been spent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Han gave him a lot of gold coins before he sent Zhao DaZhou to look for You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>At that time, Zhao DaZhou was surprised at the large sum. He was only just going to find his little shidi. In his estimation, the journey there and back should not cost that much gold coin. Contrary to his expectations, all his gold coins had been nearly spent before even finding the person he was tasked to. Furthermore, the commodity prices in Yan City were too expensive.</p><br/><p>Only then did he realize why Yan-shishu had let him carry more gold coins.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo took out six hundred crystal coins and passed them to the person in charge of the transport circle. One crystal coin was equivalent to a thousand gold coins. Six hundred would naturally be six hundred thousand. As he never had a need to use these coins, he was still able to afford the measly sum of six hundred crystal coins.</p><br/><p>The present him did not even feel that distressed about spending this amount anymore, as he had never once used the crystal coins since he had entered DaoXin Academy.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou was nearly drooling upon witnessing this scene.</p><br/><p>He had heard of this stuff called crystal coins but had never seen them before.</p><br/><p>Seeing his little shidi take out six hundred coins in a blink of an eye, he was envious to the max.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou was tempted and after hesitating for a moment, he cajoled, \u201cXiao shidi, these crystal coins are very pretty. Can I have a few of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished speaking, the mini XiaoHu riding on his shoulder also cried out in echo of his request.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched and he threw five crystal coins to him in passing.</p><br/><p>Zhou DaZhou was so fond that he could not bear to let go of the coins and even threw one to XiaoHu to play with.</p><br/><p>With two claws holding a crystal coin that was almost the same size as him, the cute little tiger looked at it in a daze. He looked just like the first time they met him, when the tiger used two claws to hug his mother\u2019s life crystal. This gave one the impression that he did not progress much.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could not refrain from asking something he had always been curious about, \u201cFifth-shixiong, how did XiaoHu\u2019s cultivation base rise so high? Was there some stroke of luck?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou breathed out on the crystal coins and used his sleeve to polish them, looking just like a miser. You XiaoMo frowned as he saw this. Only when Zhou DaZhou caught sight of his expression did he say, \u201cIt\u2019s not a stroke of luck. However, the barrier to the Paradise Realm disappeared a year after you guys left the TianXin Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was astonished, \u201cWhat in the world happened?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou DaZhou explained, \u201cI\u2019m also not too sure about it. After the barrier disappeared, the entire Paradise Realm appeared in front of everyone and many people ran over to hunt for treasure. There were both humans and demon beasts going treasure hunting and it was extremely chaotic. XiaoHu acquired an inheritance in the Paradise Realm, that\u2019s why he has his current cultivation base.\u201d</p><br/><p>As for the method to conceal his cultivation base, it was also included in the cute little tiger\u2019s inheritance. Therefore, this was the reason that middle-aged man did not discover its true strength.</p><br/><p>However, the opening of the Paradise Realm meant that it was no longer a treasure that the TianXin Sect and the other great powers could monopolize. Many wandering practitioners were attracted to visit the famous location and came in droves. The TianXin Sect and the QingCheng Sect were afraid to arouse public indignation, so they did not limit those who could enter the Paradise Realm. This was also the reason why the Paradise Realm was currently the most dangerous place in the South.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly asked after a while, \u201cFifth-shixiong, did Da-shisxiong and Second-shixiong say anything before they left the TianXin Sect? Why did they suddenly decide to go on a journey?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou deliberated, \u201cI don\u2019t think they said anything. They had already left when I knew of this incident. But you don\u2019t need to worry, the one protecting Da-shixiong and Second-shixiong are strong demon beasts. Nothing will happen to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was actually worried that his Da-shixiong and Second-shixiong had left TianXin Sect because they knew about the news of the death of their teacher. However, that did not seem to be the case from Zhao DaZhou\u2019s tone.</p><br/><p>Just as he started musing over it, Ling Xiao abruptly grasped his shoulder, \u201cWe can go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and Zhao DaZhou then discovered that the people using the transport circle had gathered. Yan City and the type of city like Nan Ye City could not be compared with each other at all. There were many people travelling all around every day, thus it was not long before the number of people required to activate the transport circle was met.</p><br/><p>Just as they had left, the youngster and his entourage arrived.</p><br/><p>Knowing that they were travelling to the transport circle in the South, the youngster\u2019s group followed behind without further ado.</p><br/><p>At the Nan Ye City transfer point three days later,.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou\u2019s two legs were weak and You XiaoMo had to support him out of the transport circle. This was his first time travelling by a transport circle for such a long time. In addition, his own strength was not that high so he nearly vomited.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo could understand his feelings. That day, the three stayed at an inn in Nan Ye City until Zhao DaZhou had nearly recovered before they left.</p><br/><p>As for the group following them, they had lost sight of their targets when You XiaoMo and the other two left the transfer point.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and the other two finally returned to the TianXin Academy two days later. Their arrival did not incite any waves at the TianXin Sect as they had secretly returned.</p><br/><p>Zhao DaZhou went back to Capital Peak to report his well-being to his father, while You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao went to Yun Shui Peak to see Ye Han. Ye Han was much the same, other than enrichment in Ye Han\u2019s cultivation base, there was not a large difference. He was not surprised with their arrival.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys arrived faster than I thought,\u201d Ye Han laughed. Ye Han was after all an elder. You XiaoMo did not dare to be impudent in front of him, so he could only look at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was not so scrupulous and he got right to the point, \u201cLet\u2019s put aside the pleasantries. Do you know where those people came from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Han replied, \u201cLooks like you guys have crossed paths with them. I presume that Zhao-shizi had already told you guys of this matter. However, I suspect that the people looking for you are not just that group of people. There should also be another group. You have to be mentally prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo cursed after hearing that. To think that there were still some more! He felt that he had played his part of \u2018You XiaoMo\u2019 perfectly since he was transmigrated here. But he did not know if the past You XiaoMo was restless or not.</p><br/><p>After getting the answers they wanted, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao were not in a hurry to head to Peach Blossom Village. You XiaoMo wanted to have a little rest. According to his version of events, they had travelled non-stop for many days and he was tired.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao did not doubt him. In any case, he was also not in a hurry.</p><br/><p>The next day, You XiaoMo took the chance when Ling Xiao and Zhou Peng were reminiscing together to secretly sneak out to inquire for information. That\u2019s right, secretly, because he simply did not know where the Peach Blossom Village was. He had asked Jiang Liu about the location of the Peach Blossom Village before, but it was quite a long time ago. Under the assumption that there would not be any reason for him to return in this lifetime, he forgot about the information.</p><br/><p>Jiang Liu had already disappeared so it was not possible to ask him. Therefore, he could only look for those fellow villagers who had joined the TianXin Sect together with him.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo quickly found one with Zhao DaZhou\u2019s help. This person was the only one who had become an inner sect disciple besides him and Jiang Liu. The rest had either left the TianXin Sect, or had transferred to the Commerce Department.</p><br/><p>The name of the fellow villager was very ordinary \u2013 he was called Jiang Da.</p><br/><p>Everyone in Peach Blossom Village was surnamed Jiang. However, You XiaoMo was the exception as he took on his father\u2019s surname and his father was not from Peach Blossom Village.</p><br/><p>Jiang Da was panic-stricken upon knowing that You XiaoMo was looking for him.</p><br/><p>Two years had passed since that war was over, but You XiaoMo had long left a deep and indelible impression in the hearts of his fellow villagers. Jiang Liu had once bullied \u2018You XiaoMo\u2019 and was afraid that You XiaoMo was there to take revenge. In truth, he was overthinking it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, relax, I just want to ask you something.\u201d You XiaoMo immediately knew that he had frightened his fellow villager when he saw that Jiang Da was as mute as a fish.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-what thing?\u201d Jiang Liu stuttered out.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo lamented a little. It was always him who was stuttering at other people. Who would have thought that there would be a day where someone was stuttering at him, \u201cActually, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just that I had accidently knocked my head before and can\u2019t really recall the things in my past. Therefore, I wanted to ask you where our native place, Peach Blossom Village, is at.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Da sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>After getting the answers he wanted, You XiaoMo placidly went back. Ling Xiao was not back yet and You XiaoMo did not wish to wantonly publicize the news that they had returned. Currently, their enemies were hidden in the dark while they were in the light and acting too ostentatiously was detrimental to them. Ling Xiao returned in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo temporarily stationed the Bird of Pride at the TianXin Sect before they left.</p><br/><p>Although nothing seemed to be happening to the TianXin Sect now, it was difficult to guarantee that some groups of people would not come knocking. In addition, Ye-shishu had also said that there was not only a single group looking for them.</p><br/><p>It was only after ensuring the safety of the TianXin Sect that they left for Peach Blossom Village.</p><br/><p>Peach Blossom Village was not far from the TianXin Sect. They only needed half a day to reach it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

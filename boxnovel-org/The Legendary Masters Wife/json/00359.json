Thinking that it wanted to escape, several people quickly set off in pursuit of it. Some of them were a little slow and were immediately engaged by the experts that Azure Sea Dragon had invited.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the lure worked, Ling Xiao immediately returned with the Soul Crystal. The Elemental Essence followed him, not at all slow either, and they soon arrived at where Duan QiTian was and he immediately put the Soul Crystal away.</p><br/><p>Having lost the scent of the Soul Crystal, the Elemental Essence paused in confusion, unsure what to do.</p><br/><p>In that moment, Qiu Ran spotted the Elemental Essence, his expression immediately twisting in shock, and losing his composure and yelling, \u201cThe Elemental Essence?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian thought he was trying to divert his attention, immediately taking this opportunity to make a hand seal, attacking the other\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>An opening was created when Qiu Ran spotted the Elemental Essence that suddenly appeared. He might\u2019ve dodged most of it, but his soul was still hit, his face paling and body swaying.</p><br/><p>It was only then that Duan QiTian realized something was wrong and turned his head, eyes widening involuntarily.</p><br/><p>Hei Tian and Azure Sea Dragon had arrived by the time the two recovered from their shock.</p><br/><p>Seeing Duan QiTian and Qiu Ran, Hei Tian\u2019s sharp gaze swept over them and then fell onto Hong Yun, who was engaged in a fierce battle with the Aberrant Blood Vine, his low voice ringing out across the sky, \u201cOld Hei Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the others arrived and heard this, their complexions all paled minutely.</p><br/><p>Duan QiTian immediately recalled Aberrant Blood Vine. Though he didn\u2019t know why they were here, Hei Tian\u2019s arrival did take a lot of pressure off his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Seeing Hei Tian, Qiu Ran\u2019s complexion turned ugly and Hong Yun retreated to his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Hei Tian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as you see. Old Hei Yun is, in reality, Qiu Ran\u2019s Life bound contract demon beast, Hong Yun. What happened to XiaoBai is his doing,\u201d Duan QiTian said coldly.</p><br/><p>Hearing the what he referred to Qiu Ran as, Hei Tian knew that they were over and said coldly, \u201cThis is good, too. I\u2019ve thought that Qiu Ran wasn\u2019t anything good for a long time now. After this is over, I\u2019ll report back to Han Gong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Gong was the legendary principal of DaoXin Academy.</p><br/><p>Just as everyone was busy being shocked over Qiu Ran and Duan QiTian\u2019s drama, a person that had been hiding in a dark corner lunged at the Elemental Essence while everyone was distracted.</p><br/><p>He was swift and timed his lunge well. The Elemental Essence was caught before it could react. In the next moment, he turned to run.</p><br/><p>However, the others weren\u2019t weak. Fairy Fu Rong and Fei Xie almost instantaneously appeared in front of him to block his way.</p><br/><p>When they saw his face, confusion flashed through their eyes and they asked, near simultaneously, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Tian looked over. This person\u2019s presence felt familiar to him, but he couldn\u2019t remember where he had seen him before.</p><br/><p>Seeing the powerhouse that suddenly appeared, pretty much no one recognized him, but Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo who were hidden in a corner recognized him at once.</p><br/><p>It was none other than Dong Shen who had been following Fairy Fu Rong and company.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he had been foiled, Dong Shen gritted his teeth and threw the Elemental Essence out with all his might.</p><br/><p>Right now, whoever held the Elemental Essence would become a target. Out of those present, none had the power to fight everyone else all at once, not even Hei Tian, Azure Sea Dragon or Hong Yun dared to try. Plus, Hei Tian and Azure Sea Dragon were both injured.</p><br/><p>Staring at the Elemental Essence that arced through the sky, everyone was restless, but none dared to be the first to try and snatch it.</p><br/><p>The Elemental Essence, now free, didn\u2019t dare to hesitate any longer, swerving in the air and fleeing in a direction with no people.</p><br/><p>Fairy Fu Rong couldn\u2019t help but be the first to pursue it. Her delicate hand was about to touch the Elemental Essence when an axe suddenly came down at her from one side.</p><br/><p>To avoid it, Fairy Fu Rong could only give up.</p><br/><p>Turning around, she saw BaiLi family\u2019s gentle looking family head. The person blocking her way was BaiLi Yang. Seeing her look over, he smiled, \u201cFairy Fu Rong, I\u2019m very sorry, but I can\u2019t let you have the Elemental Essence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fairy Fu Rong was enraged, and said, \u201cBaiLi Yang, you might be able to stop me, but you won\u2019t be able to stop the others. You won\u2019t be able to get the Elemental Essence either.\u201d</p><br/><p>BaiLi Yang smiled, uncaring. \u201cI know, but I\u2019ll stop who I can.\u201d What he was implying was that he didn\u2019t care about getting the Elemental Essence anymore.</p><br/><p>Fairy Fu Rong immediately became anxiously angry.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t unreasonable. In the BaiLi Family, he was the only Emperor level practitioner, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the Elemental Essence on his own. He couldn\u2019t die either, otherwise the impact on the BaiLi Family would be apocalyptic. So, instead of trying the impossible, he decided to have DaoXin Academy owe him one by helping them out.</p><br/><p>Tong Family\u2019s head evidently had the same idea, blocking Fei Xie\u2019s path to the Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>It was the Chai and Teng family that hesitated.</p><br/><p>The Chai Family had a grudge against You XiaoMo and he was Duan QiTian\u2019s pupil. He couldn\u2019t accept siding with DaoXin Academy.</p><br/><p>Teng Family\u2019s head hesitated because of Qiu Ran. Qiu Ran was Teng ZiXin\u2019s mentor and he was personally close to the Teng Family. With Qiu Ran and Duan QiTian now enemies, the Teng Family had to decide soon.</p><br/><p>With that, it was DaoXin Academy that had the most people.</p><br/><p>Azure Sea Dragon might\u2019ve invited a lot of powerful helpers, but many were injured in the previous battles and some even gave up working with him. With this cooperation in shambles, he ended up on the side with less powerful people.</p><br/><p>However, DaoXin Academy\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t optimistic.</p><br/><p>The Azure Sea Dragon stood in Hei Tian\u2019s way. \u201cEven with the BaiLi and Tong Families\u2019 help, don\u2019t even dream of getting the Elemental Essence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Tian looked at him with a dark face. \u201cIf I can\u2019t have it, then neither can you.\u201d After saying that, he glanced towards the two demon beasts that were being stalled by the Chai and Teng families. Azure Sea Dragon had invited so many powerful beasts, yet only three were still able to fight now.</p><br/><p>Azure Sea Dragon harrumphed coldly. \u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though there were only three left on his side, that didn\u2019t mean he would lose for sure.</p><br/><p>Hei Tian knew what he was talking about, his cold gaze sweeping over Lightning Sable, who was standing not far off.</p><br/><p>Lightning Sable was the level ten demon beast that had successfully escaped out of Fairy Fu Rong and the others\u2019 hands. Seeing the others paired up and in intense battle, delight rose in his heart and he darted off towards the Elemental Essence without hesitation.</p><br/><p>However, he had forgotten someone everyone had ignored. That someone was Dong Shen, who struck when Lightning Sable was about to touch the Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!!\u201d Lightning Sable cried out in pain.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t noticed Dong Shen\u2019s movements because of his excitement and was hit by the sneak attack, a bloody wound appearing on his back.</p><br/><p>Lightning Sable glared at Dong Shen, furiously roaring, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Shen\u2019s lips curved up in a barely perceptible angle.</p><br/><p>No one noticed that something was quietly approaching the Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>Though the Elemental Essence had developed spiritual awareness, it had only evolved to around the level of a seven or eight year old kid, curious about everything around it. Seeing everyone fighting, it hadn\u2019t escaped, but was floating in midair, as if spectating. The green flash that occasionally surrounded it sped up.</p><br/><p>Hidden away, You XiaoMo gazed over the stable battle situation, feeling as if something was wrong.</p><br/><p>LanQiu suddenly said, \u201cThat Netherworld Siren hasn\u2019t appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately looked towards the Elemental Essence, a pulse of spiritual energy going to his eyes. Then, he saw an invisible hand stretching out to the Elemental Essence. The Elemental Essence hadn\u2019t noticed at all, and his heart leaped into his throat. Where did Ling Xiao go?</p><br/><p>Just as the thought passed through his head, the hand grasped the Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>After having it in his grasp, the first thing he did was flee. This was level ten Netherworld Siren, having been forgotten in his absence. If a level ten emperor beast wanted to hide, then it would be simple over the ocean. Plus, no one knew about his existence, so they didn\u2019t know what to look out for.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, the Elemental Essence is gone.\u201d Qiu Ran was the first person to notice. Hearing his shocked voice, some of the fighters quietly paused their battles and looked around. The Elemental Essence really was gone.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Dong Shen, who had been fighting with, and winning against Lightning Sable, quickly pulled away and darted in the direction Netherworld Siren had fled in with immense speed. To others, it seemed as if he was pursuing the Elemental Essence. Very few would\u2019ve thought he had something to do with the person that had taken the Elemental Essence.</p><br/><p>As You XiaoMo prayed, an overwhelming presence appeared from thin air, rolling in from the direction Netherworld Siren had fled in. Its pressure was immense, and the terrifying presence locked Netherworld Siren in place, forcing him into becoming visible once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cDi-divine level?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

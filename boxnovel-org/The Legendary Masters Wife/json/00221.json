He has a bright and cheerful face with a strongly defined facial contour, a very handsome man. He emitted a bright, elegant and unconventional aura, you can tell just from a glance that he is a firm and manly man.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, isn\u2019t that Gao Yang-gexia? Why does he come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool, why shouldn\u2019t Gao Yang-gexia comes here? Don\u2019t forget that he is the disciple of Dao Xin Academy\u2019s vice-chairman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Dao Xin Academy sent outstanding students to maintain the order and safety of this student enrollment. I never imagine they would send out Gao Yang-gexia. He really is very incredible, ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>When they saw him, the people were all pleasantly surprised. Not only surprised, they also couldn\u2019t help but make a gasping sound. All of them have heard about Gao Yang-gexia\u2019s popularity, but have not been able to see his graceful bearing. Many people found it rather regrettable because they never expected that they would be able to look at him this close so they missed him already, while some hardcore fans immediately began fawning over him in happiness.</p><br/><p>The youth who dared to mock You XiaoMo earlier face already turned pale.</p><br/><p>He never imagined that Gao Yang-gexia would unexpectedly hear their conversation, and help You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>If he were to be reported to the teachers at Dao Xin Academy, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to enter Dao Xin Academy for the rest of his life. He is now twenty five years old, three years later, his age would exceed the admission limit.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was looking at the man who spoke up for him with surprise, this person was called\u2026 lamb?</p><br/><p>Judging from his imposing manner, and how others treat him respectfully, this \u2018Lamb\u2019 must be not an ordinary person. The disciple of vice chairman, the rumored \u2018second generation\u2019 ah, this identity alone was imposing enough. (t/n: second generation in china means that you\u2019re a child from someone powerful, like official/tycoon, thus enables you to easily achieve any position without much effort)</p><br/><p>Just right when he was being entranced, suddenly a hand was waving in front of his face.</p><br/><p>Coming back to his senses, You XiaoMo saw Ling Xiao leering at him, and obviously, his expression was absolutely irritated. This time, he was too embarrassed to say anything because they were in public, so he had to pull back Ling Xiao\u2019s hand instead.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang actually didn\u2019t expect to see him making this kind of scene. At first, he just came to do a normal routine inspection, but then he overheard the teenager and youth\u2019s conversation. There\u2019s no denying that the teenager\u2019s words were really full of confidence, but being confident about one\u2019s self is a good thing, so he felt that the teenager was right.</p><br/><p>He thought the teenager was a very gentle person, Gao Yang felt poorly for him and wanted to speak up for him. But he didn\u2019t expect the teenager to be so quick-witted, and even refused the duel invitation like it was the most natural thing to do. He looked like he didn\u2019t really understand the significance of dueling at Lei Tian platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, you really are an eloquent speaker, I really admire you!\u201d Gao Yang was laughing while cupping both of his hand in front of his chest towards You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laughed awkwardly, this level of speech couldn\u2019t regard him as an \u2018eloquent speaker\u2019. He felt that it was just at a tolerable level, \u201cNot at all, you are too polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>But somehow he felt that this Gao Yang was kinda similar to Zhou Peng, at least, their characters seemed to be the same: a very generous person.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang said, \u201cMy name is Gao Yang, I wonder how should I call little brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo said: \u201cI\u2019m called You XiaoMo.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, he was going to introduce Ling Xiao, but then Ling Xiao would enter the school using a different face, so he dismissed the idea. Since Gao Yang was the vice chairman\u2019s disciple, they might meet again later.</p><br/><p>Gao Yang was interested in him, so he said: \u201cLittle brother You, I think your queue is still very long. I know a teacher, she currently doesn\u2019t have anything to do, if you don\u2019t mind, I can ask her to test you.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo became delighted, and nodded in an instant: \u201cI don\u2019t mind, I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll be troubling you to show me the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>This is the so-called getting in through the back door, ah, he unexpectedly had the fortune to do it in this lifetime.</p><br/><p>And then, the-not-so-polite You XiaoMo pulled Ling Xiao to follow Gao Yang and went through the back door.</p><br/><p>The onlookers were all shocked and gaping their mouths, Gao Yang-gexia would unexpectedly open a backdoor for a person that he just met less than half an hour ago, that was rather scary. When will they be able to walk through the back door ah, some people immediately got jealous at You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>As for the incident between You xiaomo and the youth, many people had already forgotten about that.</p><br/><p>Led by Gao Yang, they smoothly entered Dao Xin Academy\u2019s hall. The hall was a place for teachers to rest for a while, except for the ones who have special statuses, outsiders were not allowed to enter.</p><br/><p>The hall where the teachers could rest looked very simple from the outside, there was only a simple board on the door, but the inside didn\u2019t look simple at all. The decorations and furniture was all from the finest materials, they all looked so luxurious and valuable.</p><br/><p>Apart from the teachers, there was a group that looked like students in the hall, followed by some attendants or bodyguards behind them. To be followed by bodyguards, looked like they were someone from the influential families.</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered, the people looked at them, some people greeted Gao Yang naturally, but You XiaoMo could feel it, there were many pairs of eyes that were lurking on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Jing-daoshi, I brought you someone\u201d.</p><br/><p>After he greeted the others, Gao Yang brought them to a beautiful woman who looked to be in her thirties, but still maintained her graceful bearing. This woman was the one he called Ning Jing-daoshi, and just like her name, she made you feel comfortable and peaceful just by looking at her. (t/n: her name  means peaceful, tranquility)</p><br/><p>The woman wore aqua blue clothes, and pasted a gentle smile on her beautiful face. Her sparkling beautiful eyes were looking at them just like a quite, clear spring.</p><br/><p>When she heard Gao Yang\u2019s words, the woman\u2019s line of sight naturally fell onto You XiaoMo who was behind him, and warmly asked, \u201cAre you the one who brought this little friend? Gao Yang, since when did you start to help people go through the back door?\u201d</p><br/><p>This remark has a hint of teasing in it, but it wasn\u2019t meant to criticize him.</p><br/><p>Everytime Dao Xin Academy held a student enrollment, there were many people who got in through the back door. But what surprised Ning Jing the most was that Gao Yang would actually bring people to go through the back door. From her impression, Gao Yang would never do such thing, so she really got curious. What kind of person could make Gao Yang make an exception like this?</p><br/><p>Upon hearing it, Gao Yang called You XiaoMo to go to her: \u201cNing Jing-daoshi, this person is You XiaoMo,I feel like we\u2019ve been friends for a long time even though it was our first meeting. When I saw him sunbathing outside with the glaring sun, and knowing that you have nothing to do, I helped him to look for you\u201d.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo talked as formal as possible, \u201cNice to meet you, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Jing looked at him for a moment, then smiled and nodded: \u201cSince Gao Yang has brought you all the way here, then please come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when they\u2019re about to turned around, the students who also went through the back door suddenly shouted at them.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing\u2019s beautiful eyebrow made a little frown.</p><br/><p>The one who called out to them was a man in his twenties. When they looked at him, he was already walking towards them, and happily said: \u201cNing Jiang-daoshi, since you will help him to take the test, you shouldn\u2019t have any problems helping us take the test too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man stared at Ning Jing-daoshi with a hint of passion in his eyes, filled with obvious adoration towards her. You XiaoMo was surprised by this fact, so he glanced at Ning Jing secretly. This Ning Jing-daoshi should be over thirty years old, while the young man was only in his twenties. The age gap between them should at least around ten years old.</p><br/><p>But Ning Jing-daoshi was indeed a really beautiful woman. This kind of gentle and beautiful woman really fit his image of a \u201cgentle sister\u201d, only that she was a little bit older\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Jing actually didn\u2019t want to pay attention to them, but since he already said it, she couldn\u2019t refuse them. She lazily said, \u201cThen you all can come with me.\u201d And she turned around after she said that.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s smiling face turned cold all of sudden, his venomous, cold stare fell on You XiaoMo. Not only did Ning Jing-daoshi not smile at him, she didn\u2019t even bother to say more than one word to him; but towards this person, she was soft and gentle, just like dripping water.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo felt like he was being stared at by a venomous snake, he suddenly shuddered from head to toe.</p><br/><p>He noticed the man was looking at him, but he didn\u2019t understand, he didn\u2019t seem to have said anything or did something, why did it look like he had offended him?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t realize it, but for Ling Xiao who always took notice of his surroundings, it was crystal clear.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao slowly narrowed his deep eyes, his ordinary face suddenly became unfathomable. Compared to the man whose gaze was cold like a venomous snake, his was more like a sleeping lion.</p><br/><p>Although they could be tested personally by Ning Jing-daoshi, for people who had statuses like them, they actually had to rely on an unimportant person whose name they didn\u2019t even know to get this opportunity. The atmosphere suddenly became very delicate, apparently everyone already became a little hostile towards You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Ning Jing-daoshi walked toward the seat that was specially put on the hall and sat down. A male staff immediately brought a scroll and a brush, and put it in front of her.</p><br/><p>This Ning Jing\u2019s destructive power, indeed is really powerful! You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>After she paused a little, Ning Jing-daoshi talked to them with a warm voice: \u201cWell then, let\u2019s start the test. Come here one by one, don\u2019t cut in line. First tell me your name, age, and lastly, your rank. Who wants to go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man practically stood up immediately: \u201cI will go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>T/N:</p><br/><p>Gexia () = Your Excellency, The Honourable, Your Lordship. A honorable title, kinda similar to \u201c-sama\u201d in Japanese. It was commonly used during ancient times, on modern times, people use it for letters (esp. business-related letters) and during diplomatic occasions.</p><br/><p>Naming problem: Gao Yang is written with  (a common chara to write someone\u2019s name),but Momo, with his low IQ (as boss always said), mistook it for , which mean \u201clamb\u201d. Well, you can\u2019t really blame him since it\u2019s spelled the same, Gao Yang XDD</p><br/><p>Daoshi () = teacher/tutor/academic advisor. The \u201c\u201d means to lead, guide, conduct. While the \u201c\u201d is the normal character for a teacher/master.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why are you waiting for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Dao Yun saw them, he shrugged and said, \u201cIt seems like you guys are still unaware of what happened when you went backstage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something to do with that Tang Hao isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ling Xiao had a look of understanding as he stated plainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Dao Yun looked at Ling Xiao cheekily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened exactly?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that Tang Hao left the auction hall, he got people to spread the word that anybody who sided with us would be going against the Yin Yang Valley. The DuanMu family was afraid of bringing trouble to themselves so they cut all ties with us. I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t go back to the inn anymore.\u201d Dao Yun explained.</p><br/><p>While You XiaoMo understood that the DuanMu family had their own reasons, he was still slightly displeased at their actions. They didn\u2019t even let them stay at the inn anymore! At the very least, they saved DuanMu Qing\u2019s life. They deserved at least that much!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the Dimensional Teleportation portal? Won\u2019t that mean we can\u2019t use it anymore?\u201d You XiaoMo could understand why the DuanMu\u2019s did what they did, and honestly, he wasn\u2019t surprised. What he was really worried about was the XiaEr family refusing to let them use their Dimensional Teleportation portal because of this. That would be troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may not be the case. Actually, before the DuanMus left they passed me an invitation letter from the XiaEr family. They even told me that they have told the XiaEr\u2019s about the Dimensional Teleportation portal and they agreed. Even if that Tang Hao found out, I doubt he will stop us. In fact, he may even welcome it.\u201d Dao Yun walked in front of them and said.</p><br/><p>After You XiaoMo digested what he said, he instantly got what he meant.</p><br/><p>Tang Hao was from the Yin Yang Valley and the Yin Yang Valley was one of the strongest forces on the Southern Continent. Once they were in his territory, killing them would be much easier.</p><br/><p>Presumably, Tang Hao must hate them to the bone, so he wouldn\u2019t let them die so easily. Therefore, it was most likely that he would only attack when they reached the Southern Continent.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao scanned the surrounding. There were fewer and fewer people on the street but he could sense that some were watching them. \u201cSince they\u2019re so eager to see us go to the Southern Continent, then as they wish, we\u2019ll go to the XiaEr\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d Ling Xiao spoke as if it wasn\u2019t a matter of concern.</p><br/><p>Since You XiaoMo wanted to leave BeiDong as soon as possible, he agreed.</p><br/><p>Dao Yun had no objections.</p><br/><p>That night, they found another inn to settle down for the night. Not long after, they heard news of Tang Hao and Hu Feng leaving BeiDong, apparently quite hurriedly too. This utterly disappointed those who wanted to watch some drama unfold but there were also some that had the same speculations as Dao Yun.</p><br/><p>Just before he went to sleep, You XiaoMo picked up an almost inaudible sound from the next room, all thanks to his Soul Power. If not for his Soul Power getting more sensitive by the day, he might not even have noticed. That sound was coming from Dao Yun\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so late already, why is Dao Yun even going out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laid on the bed and replied lazily, \u201cDao Yun isn\u2019t as simple and harmless as he looks on the surface. Previously when you tried to probe him about some matters, he definitely didn\u2019t tell you the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo frowned. From an outsider\u2019s point of view, Dao Yun and them seemed really chummy but they had only known each other for a few days. Dao Yun definitely wasn\u2019t as simple as he appeared to be if he could be taken in as a disciple by the Thief God, one of the Ten Divine Gods of the Tong Tian Continent. He could even have been guarding against them from the very start.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t help but feel helpless. He still wasn\u2019t used to seeing others in a negative light.</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, he could already gotten some information about his master. Maybe he may even suggest splitting up with us tomorrow.\u201d Ling Xiao continued. While he wanted to obtain information from Dao Yun\u2019s master through Dao Yun, the Thief God route was not the only way for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he really said that, then there is nothing we can do about it.\u201d That was all that You XiaoMo could say. They couldn\u2019t possibly just tie Dao Yun up, it wasn\u2019t their way of doing things and unnecessary to say the least.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually that would be good too. Him following us around is somewhat unnecessary.\u201d Ling Xiao stated plainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by unnecessary?\u201d You XiaoMo didn\u2019t comprehend.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sat up and glanced at him, then he smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s unnecessary alright. Ever since he joined us, you never let me kiss you in public anymore. I\u2019ve long wanted him gone.\u201d YouXiao Mo should be glad he didn\u2019t say Dao Yun was an eyesore.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Boss, even if Dao Yun wasn\u2019t here, I\u2019ve never let you kiss me in public, okay?</p><br/><p>The second day, Ling Xiao\u2019s words held true.</p><br/><p>Dao Yun came to find them even before the two of them left their room. You XiaoMo remembered the conversation he had with Ling Xiao yesterday, but it didn\u2019t show on his face. Instead, he spoke to Dao Yun very naturally, \u201cDao Yun you\u2019re up early! We\u2019re not done yet though. Why not wait for us in the big hall downstairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I have something to tell you.\u201d Dao Yun was slightly uncomfortable as he spoke, his face apologetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Say it.\u201d You XiaoMo knew Ling Xiao hit the bull\u2019s eye when he saw Dao Yun\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this. I\u2019ve already obtained some information on my master, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be on the Southern Continent. I guess this is where we separate.\u201d Dao Yun had a face full of regret. Previously, it was him who decided to tag along and now he was going back on his words. He didn\u2019t know how to face them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was stunned for a moment before replying, \u201cOh. Since you\u2019ve gotten news of your master, then finding him is more important, of course. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I didn\u2019t expect things to turn out like this.\u201d While he was talking about leaving them, Dao Yun felt really sorry towards the two of them. Talking about leaving now was as if he was cutting all ties with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologise.\u201d Ling Xiao walked over with a cold demeanor. \u201cWe aren\u2019t that close. Wherever you go is none of our business, you don\u2019t have to tell us specially.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dao Yun\u2019s face tensed. \u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d He mumbled.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wanted to facepalm himself. Ling Xiao was too blunt. He immediately tried to salvage the situation by explaining, \u201cDao Yun, don\u2019t pay him any mind. He\u2019s just like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Then I\u2019m off now, you guys take care.\u201d Dao Yun nodded. He might not have spent a long time with those two but he more or less figured out Ling Xiao\u2019s character.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou take care too!\u201d You XiaoMo watched as Dao Yun left, only turning his attention back to Ling Xiao when Dao Yun finally disappeared at the end of the street.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you have to say that? Even though he didn\u2019t tell us the truth, he also didn\u2019t do anything to harm us. Maybe we could even be friends in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao glanced at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say I was this type of person?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo choked for a moment. He actually used my own words against me!</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me honestly, were you planning something?\u201d You XiaoMo definitely didn\u2019t believe Ling Xiao would say those words for no reason. He already guessed that Dao Yun would come to look for them the day before, so why would he spout such caustic words?</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk, Tsk. Since you\u2019ve already noticed, then it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d Surprisingly, Ling Xiao laughed with a rather annoying smile on his face. You XiaoMo felt that Ling Xiao had reverted back to his hateful ways.</p><br/><p>Then, he remembered. Ever since Dao Yun appeared, Ling Xiao had been hovering around him like a guardian spirit. He didn\u2019t talk much too but after Dao Yun left, he immediately showed his true colours.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen hurry up and say it.\u201d You XiaoMo definitely wouldn\u2019t admit it, but he missed it a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, even if Dao Yun didn\u2019t leave, I would still find an excuse to make him go. Don\u2019t forget, we have many secrets that others can\u2019t know. The Vermillion Blood Clan must be searching for us now, so if Dao Yun knows about that, even if he doesn\u2019t have his eyes on their clan treasure, the same can\u2019t be said for his master. Furthermore, once we reach the Southern Continent, we have to change into our disguises. It won\u2019t be suitable if he\u2019s here.\u201d Ling Xiao explained his plans when You XiaoMo was about to bristle.</p><br/><p>Luckily, Dao Yun left early. If he had stayed around longer, You XiaoMo reckoned things would get ugly if Ling Xiao had to chase him away. And not just that, while Ling Xiao previously said that they could obtain information about the Thief God through Dao Yun, Dao Yun was not a man that could be easily fooled. Ling Xiao and You XiaoMo could more or less tell that was the case as they had never heard him reveal anything related to his Shifu at all during the past few days they spent together.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m done talking. Let\u2019s go to the XiaEr family.\u201d Ling Xiao walked out of the room and You XiaoMo hurriedly caught up with him.</p><br/><p>The XiaEr family\u2019s forces weren\u2019t in Tian Xiang City but where the Dimensional Teleportation portal they controlled was. There were many powerhouses from the XiaEr family guarding the portal and many feared them. As long as someone heard of the XiaEr family, no one dared to forcefully go against them.</p><br/><p>After they left the inn, You XiaoMo hired a horse carriage nearby. The Dimensional Teleportation portal was too far away from the inn they were staying at. Not only that, Tian Xiang City didn\u2019t allow powerhouses to fly in the sky so the only way to get other places was by carriage.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

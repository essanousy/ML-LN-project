During that time, he only exchanged a few words with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>Once MoQi XiYuan heard of this and the clan member who guarded the second floor library also said there wasn\u2019t any strange activities, he was finally at ease.</p><br/><p>That night, You XiaoMo got a jade drive from Fang ChenLe.</p><br/><p>Unsurprisingly, the library on the second floor contained a lot of books, some were about the placement of Spirit Eyes. Fang ChenLe did a quick scan of the materials and copied them into the jade drive.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much he could copy in thirty-minutes but good thing the books were all sorted into categories, so most of what Ling Xiao needed was in the jade drive.</p><br/><p>The same night, Ling Xiao started to calculate it whereabouts.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the people of the Guma Tribe was also secretly plotting.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma didn\u2019t appear personally just to help the Guma Tribe fight against the other two tribes, it was mostly for the transcendent level Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>But, they were much faster than Ling Xiao. When they sent people over, they had already calculated the position of the transcendent level Spirit Eye. It was just that the Spirit Eye was underground in the ShuiXi Tribe, so they hesitated before making a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe prepared and give me a hundred percent of your attention, we\u2019re going to fight a tough battle from here on out.\u201d Zu Ma said to the three people she brought along as her delicate brows tightened.</p><br/><p>The man who sat closest to her, lifted his soft head, as if there wasn\u2019t a bone supporting it, and looked at the holy Zu Ma with eyes that spoke of an devious, yet flirtatious expression, and chuckled, \u201cMaster Zu Ma, the show hasn\u2019t even started yet, why so worried?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was a general under Lin ShaoYi. His cultivation base was unpredictably deep but was downright lazy. His original form was a snake, although not as noble as the Nine-Headed Serpent King, it was still an upper class bloodline in terms of serpents.</p><br/><p>His cultivation base was the strongest after Zu Ma, being a Level Twelve beast, the other two were of the Divine Realm and that was only because the fight in Xi Jing hasn\u2019t finished yet, so they couldn\u2019t lend more people. But, the formation was already really powerful, which was indication enough that Lin ShaoYi really thought highly of Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster attached great importance to this mission.\u201d Zu Ma said lightly.</p><br/><p>The man straightened his body, tilted his head and said with a smile-but-not-really-expression, \u201cOf course, it was a transcendent level Spirit Eye after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was called Fang Yang. Even though Zu Ma was held in high regards at the Black Spiders, he never really respected her. When the Master was there, he would sometimes make pleasant greetings, but otherwise, he always spoke with a dandiacal expression and sometimes not in good temper either.</p><br/><p>Zu Ma knew of this as well. As for those who didn\u2019t respect her, she didn\u2019t let them off easily either. Hearing his nonchalant tone, she immediately said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one side who knows of the transcendent level Spirit Eye, our opponent isn\u2019t just Ling Xiao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Yang expression changed and a devious smile appeared, \u201cJust some pests, as if they could achieve anything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down on pests, afterall they\u2019re well-known old foxes, it\u2019s better safe than sorry.\u201d Zu Ma furrowed her brows almost undetectably, not in agreement with what he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, enough, you said the same thing before, can\u2019t you think of something fresh?\u201d Fang Yang said and waved his hands in annoyance, \u201cWhere is the transcendent level Spirit Eye? I\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Surprisingly, Zu Ma rejected him.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang furrowed his brows and looked at her menacingly, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zu Ma explained, \u201cAlthough you\u2019re strong, your not Ling Xiao\u2019s opponent. If you go now, we can\u2019t be a hundred percent sure that he won\u2019t find out. Then it\u2019ll just alert them of the transcendent level Spirit Eye being in the ShuiXi Tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do this, can\u2019t do that, then what do you say we do?\u201d Being rejected multiple times made Fang Yang\u2019s expression turn dark.</p><br/><p>The corner of Zu Ma\u2019s mouth lifted as she said, \u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Yang stared at her.</p><br/><p>Just as she said this, the ShuiXi Tribe went into chaos. Under the dark curtain of the night, lamps lit up one after another. Soon, it was bright as day.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo came out from the room and asked, grabbing hold of a ShuiXi Tribe member, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The member recognized him as an important guest and replied, \u201cIt seems that someone barged into our tribe. Our team leader has gathered us over to catch them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be the Black Spiders?</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed. You XiaoMo turned around and ran back to his room, but saw that Ling Xiao was still calculating. Interrupting him right now seemed like a bad idea.</p><br/><p>Calculating was something extensive and profound. The closer one was to the Almighty Realm, the closer the calculation was to the truth. There was no need to study such a skill, it was a test to one\u2019s understanding of the world\u2019s order. Due to the complication of such calculations, it cannot be interrupted, otherwise one would have to start again.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo went out to find out more information as he waited.</p><br/><p>The thief still hadn\u2019t been found, it seemed that they were quite strong and familiar with the tribe. Even MoQi XiYuan was alerted.</p><br/><p>Once the morning arrived, the person disappeared. Having worked through midnight, the ShuiXi Tribe members only caught a glimpse of their figure, always having them escape without even a frontal image.</p><br/><p>It was then when Ling Xiao\u2019s calculations were completed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo laid in front of him and quickly told him the gossip. With a clear expression that said he was enjoying the show, he asked, \u201cDo you think the Black Spider was behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took a sip of tea and answered, \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom how others description of the ex-holy maiden, they should be a careful and scheming woman. Before she has confirmation that we know the whereabouts of the Spirit Eye, she wouldn\u2019t sent someone over wily nily, unless she wants me to suspect something. Thus, most likely this has nothing to do with the Black Spiders or the Guma Tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked, \u201cThen who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao made a thoughtful face and said as he slowly rubbed his chin, \u201cGood question\u2026but I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His just toying him on purpose right?!</p><br/><p>No matter who that person was, if they weren\u2019t part of the Black Spider or Guma Tribe, then they were probably not very threatening. Currently he was more curious as to the location of the transcendent level Spirit Eye. Where was it so that the Black Spider hadn\u2019t made a move yet and needed to partner up with the Guma Tribe?</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, tell me~\u201d You XiaoMo urged.</p><br/><p>But Ling Xiao started to slowly sip the tea. The tea was even one of the good ones given by MoQi XiYuan, which he had drunk quite a bit over the past few days.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo heart ached in curiosity, he needed to know now, but Ling Xiao just loved to keep him hanging. By the looks of things, he needed to be fierce. He went and locked the door, then ran back, crawling underneath Ling Xiao\u2019s armpits and sat butt first onto his thigh. With both hands hugging his neck, and two legs hooked onto his waist, he started to shake fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m not getting off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao held back his laughter and stood his ground, \u201cNot telling.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo showed his teeth, then don\u2019t blame him if he\u2019s \u2018heartless\u2019. Thus, he went and grabbed little-Ling Xiao, even squeezing it a little. The \u2018sleeping\u2019 little Ling Xiao was quickly \u2018awoken\u2019.</p><br/><p>Beside his ear, came a weak intake of breath from Ling Xiao. It didn\u2019t take long before it was completely up, like a skyscraper, making a hill between his legs. It was so fast that You XiaoMo was almost unsure of what to do next.</p><br/><p>In reality, he didn\u2019t react. Normally it was Ling Xiao who took the initiative, he usually just layed down and enjoyed, sometimes fighting back, but that was usually guided.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue!\u201d Ling Xiao said as his chin rested on You XiaoMo\u2019s shoulder, his eyes half-closed and his burning hot breath landing on the other\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s face went fully red. He had almost forgotten that this beast loved this and he was a meat-bun that gifted himself over. Thinking it this far, he started to bargain, \u201cIf you tell me, then I\u2019ll cont\u2026Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao suddenly took a bite of his ear, causing him to almost scream. When he wanted to escape, it was too late. His hand was forced into grabbing that hot-like-soldering-iron-massive-thing. You XiaoMo wanted to take his hand back but he wasn\u2019t strong enough.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long before You XiaoMo\u2019s clothing fell to the ground, with only a white shirt and nothing on the bottom. He held a massive and ferocious thing deep in his mouth, and swallowed it up and down at a quick pace. The slightly hidden yet racy scene caused one\u2019s heart to race even more.</p><br/><p>With a dazed expression, You XiaoMo held onto Ling Xiao\u2019s neck and his two white legs circled his waist. As for the interrogation, he had already thrown that out the window. Not only did he not get the answer, he also give himself up.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s called reaping what you sow!</p><br/><p>The next day, Ling Xiao\u2019s despicable nature came out again and wouldn\u2019t allow him to drink spiritual water to heal. Good thing he was already used to it, and his body was much stronger as his cultivation base increased, after resting for a few hours, he recovered.</p><br/><p>That afternoon, Ling Xiao finally took pity on him and showed him the transcendent level Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>But once You XiaoMo saw that place, he was so shocked that his chin almost fell off. No wonder the Black Spiders would partner up with the Guma Tribe, if they didn\u2019t, they would have make such a ruckus that everyone would have figured it out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

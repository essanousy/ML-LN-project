No matter how high one leaped, there was still nobody there to applaud them.</p><br/><p>The incident finally calmed down slightly after almost ten days of chaos.</p><br/><p>Even though it was like this, You XiaoMo and Ling Xiao still didn\u2019t plan on returning to Zhong Tian immediately.</p><br/><p>Besides the brazen and unreasonable You JunQi who stayed behind, PiQiu and the rest had already left, including CatQiu, who needed practical experience. Before they had left, You XiaoMo had very reluctantly distributed three teleportation talismans and several wound-treating magic pills to each of them, in case they didn\u2019t have medicine if they got hurt.</p><br/><p>Although it was a little unlucky, it was still the so-called \u2018repairing the house before it rains.\u2019</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao told them to split into two groups when leaving. Since there were six people, they split perfectly into two groups of three. The team with the Giant Roc was more powerful, so they were told to go find LanQiu. Although LanQiu had set out with several other fellows to go search for a missing friend, there was something a little odd about the disappearance of that friend.</p><br/><p>This was something that Tian Dao had roughly mentioned before.</p><br/><p>But then they heard that there was a mysterious force in Xi Jing recruiting many powerful demon beasts. Before, it had at least attempted to conceal itself, but recently it was acting too frequently, and Tian Dao suspected that they were doing something big.</p><br/><p>MaoQiu was in charge of the other team, and it included the eternal troublemaker PiQiu and CatQiu.</p><br/><p>They returned to Weeping Ghost Shore. Tian Dao\u2019s intelligence network was pretty expansive, so they could find out more from there. Moreover, Ling Xiao had also given them a special task.</p><br/><p>In Xing Luo City\u2019s Forest of Death, Ling Xiao had once accepted Hua Gu and her two little brothers. Back then, he had told them to go ahead to Weeping Ghost Shore by themselves, but they hadn\u2019t seen them the last time they were in Weeping Ghost Shore, so clearly they still hadn\u2019t found it yet.</p><br/><p>The task that Ling Xiao gave them was that if they found Hua Gu and her little brothers, they should hand them over to Tian Dao. Hua Gu was a good child, careful and considerate, and her little brothers were good assistants. The most direct method of training them would be to let them follow Tian Dao and learn from him, so if there was ever a time Ling Xiao needed them in the future, he could just use them right away. So this task was also called the \u2018Advantageous Training Method\u2019, or in other words, \u2018the more fit one is, the more they should do.\u2019</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo assessed this task. Its most impressive point was how it could anger Tian Dao to death, who would be taken advantage of.</p><br/><p>As for whether or not Tian Dao would accept Hua Gu and the rest, that wasn\u2019t something they had to consider. As long as one continued to wear it down, there would always be a point when an iron bar would be worn down to a needle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSonny, where should we go next?\u201d You JunQi was very happy that his son finally was no longer putting him back in the dimension. Even though he could still be with his son despite going into the dimension, he lost quite a few opportunities to get close to him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that You XiaoMo did not want to put him back, but he had been pestered too much. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re going back to Zhong Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then looked pleadingly at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao murmured, \u201cLet\u2019s first find a place without people, and then we can talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo instantly nodded.</p><br/><p>You JunQi opened his eyes wide. He found out that not only was his son being the one pushed down, but he also listened to everything this man said. Could it be\u2026 that he actually had a daughter?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo very much wanted to ignore his clingy dad\u2019s gaze, but instead, goosebumps erupted all over him because of it. He couldn\u2019t bear it any longer, nor was there any need to. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi walked over and looked him up and down. He asked carefully, \u201cSonny, tell your dad the truth. What dad has, you actually don\u2019t have, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>What \u2018you have, I don\u2019t have.\u2019</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo understood very well what he was saying, but Ling Xiao just happened to call for him, so he ignored his dad and ran over to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>You JunQi\u2019s face was full of tears. He indeed had a daughter.</p><br/><p>They were going to the ravine in Xi Jing where Ling Xiao had risen in rank last time. Originally it was a large ravine, rich and green, but after Ling Xiao had turned into a patch of scorched earth. The demon beasts that used to live in the ravine either died or ran away, but even after all this there were still people who came to try and figure out what had happened.</p><br/><p>When one rose to the Sacred Realm rank, there was a period of time when their energy fluctuated. Moreover, the unusual change in weather were more noticeable than thunderclouds, so at the time it had alarmed many experts. But by the time they had rushed over, Ling Xiao had already left.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and the rest stood at the edge of the scorched valley, and all they could see was an extremely devastated ravine. Something had smashed into the middle, creating another deep hole, as if it was a small ravine within the big ravine. Next to it were unsteady trees, half-burnt and half-withered, without a single trace of life left.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did we come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao took out the bottle with the Black Turtle Life Blood. There were only three droplets inside, since Xuan Wei\u2019s hadn\u2019t yet been refined. But he only needed one drop, so he withdrew one drop before handing the rest to You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Black Turtle Clan\u2019s Life Blood is full of the cultivation base from their original bodies. You can try absorbing its essence; it\u2019ll be useful for your cultivation base. However, do not use it to refine your constitution, since it will be discovered by the Black Turtle Clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo knew what he was going to do when he saw him take out the Life Blood, and he nodded seriously after receiving the bottle.</p><br/><p>Many months had already passed since the last time Ling Xiao had risen in rank. There hadn\u2019t been people for a long time now around the scorched valley, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about someone suddenly barging in here. Plus, they had a free guardian.</p><br/><p>You JunQi sighed again. The two of them had actually killed two Black Turtles because of the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s Life Blood. This wasn\u2019t something that could be kept a secret forever, and in the future they would have a horde of extremely strong enemies.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know the truth and could only silently keep the secret for his son. In his eyes, even if his son did something wrong, it would still have to be right.</p><br/><p>However, there was something that You JunQi didn\u2019t really understand.</p><br/><p>With Ling Xiao\u2019s level of power and the bloodlines of the Demon Phoenix Clan and the Qilin Clan, the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s Life Blood was already of no use to him. Even if it was, it would be just a drop in the ocean.</p><br/><p>Then why did he still want to ingest the Black Turtle Life Blood?</p><br/><p>You JunQi finally knew the answer a little while later.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had already witnessed Ling Xiao stimulate the Dragon Clan bloodline before. He was the most envious of this \u2018jump two levels at once\u2019 kind of thing. There was truly no way to compete with natural superiority.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo sighed heavily before swallowing the two drops of Life Blood and concentrating on absorbing the Life Blood\u2019s essence. Xuan Ze\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t very high, so two drops of Life Blood shouldn\u2019t be enough to help him break through, but it was still better than nothing.</p><br/><p>Not far in front of him, You JunQi had long since opened his mouth in surprise.</p><br/><p>He had actually detected the presence of the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s bloodline in Ling Xiao before. Although it wasn\u2019t very rich, it was still impossible for him to ignore it. In addition, as more time had passed, that thread of a bloodline seemed to be fully awakening, and he could faintly sense that it was as if this bloodline possessed a kind of power that didn\u2019t belong to the Black Turtle Clan of today.</p><br/><p>A Black Turtle twice as big as the baby turtle crouched on Ling Xiao\u2019s shoulder. The eyes of the Black Turtle were half open, and its eyelids looked lazy, yet the wisdom that leaked through its gaze seemed as if it had been accumulating for hundreds of millions of years.</p><br/><p>You JunQi suddenly thought of a distant legend, and a monstrous wave instantly rose in his mind.</p><br/><p>Legend had it that that the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s first ancestor was TongTian Continent\u2019s first sage. His mind was vast, embracing all under the sky with boundless wisdom.</p><br/><p>Could Ling Xiao be a descendant of the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s first ancestor?</p><br/><p>You JunQi subconsciously rejected it.</p><br/><p>But as for this boundless wisdom, he hadn\u2019t seen it at all in Ling Xiao during the past two times.</p><br/><p>When You XiaoMo opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was his clingy old man frowning, nodding once in a while before shaking his head again. He was a perfectly fine man who looked like a madman.</p><br/><p>\u201cSonny, let daddy ask you a question.\u201d You JunQi saw that he woke up and instantly walked over to look at him with eager eyes.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why, but You XiaoMo suddenly had an intriguing feeling. It felt almost as if he was looking at his own clone. Why did he think it felt so annoying?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does he have the Black Turtle Clan bloodline?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo stood up and dusted off his butt before he answered dully, \u201cThis is a great question. The truth can be explained in five words.\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi asked impatiently, \u201cWhat five words?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo, \u201cI do not know either!\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Son, if you have an issue with your dad, then just say it!</p><br/><p>Too many issues!</p><br/><p>This time when Ling Xiao stimulated the Black Turtle Clan bloodline, a pillar of golden light didn\u2019t shoot up into the sky. Instead, huge patterns of waves rippled out from his body like the tide, spreading in all directions. A vast aura was included with it, and even demon beasts far away could sense it. Those that were weaker immediately kneeled down.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo suddenly had the impulse to kneel down.</p><br/><p>You JunQi hastily supported his son. \u201cIn ancient history\u2019s ancient history, the Black Turtle Clan\u2019s first ancestor was greatly loved by all of the demon beasts, and he was the only sage that tens of thousands of demon beasts followed. So, no matter if it was a human or a demon beast, everyone would be affected a bit by his bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAncient history\u2019s ancient history?\u201d The corners of You XiaoMo\u2019s mouth twitched. How long ago would that have to be?</p><br/><p>You JunQi coughed dryly. \u201cNo need to consider the time. In any case, it\u2019s from an era that was too long ago to remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao, whose power level was steadily climbing. Who knew how high his power level would rise this time; the first ancestor of the Black Turtle Clan seemed very extraordinary.</p><br/><p>About two minutes had passed before Ling Xiao suppressed the aura that was leaking out. Everything was calm and peaceful again, as if that shocking scene just now was merely a mirage.</p><br/><p>When Ling Xiao opened his eyes, You XiaoMo clearly felt that he wasn\u2019t the same as before. There was a saying that he hated so much it made his teeth itch that went like this: Ling Xiao was full of wisdom.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If it weren\u2019t for him being prepared, it would have most likely hit him.</p><br/><p>The one who attacked him was Fang Yang, who had run out of the tunnel before him.</p><br/><p>After dodging the ray of light, You XiaoMo saw that Fang Yang was standing at the entrance of the cave with a dark and ruthless expression on his face, staring at him. He had weapon in his hands that he got from who knows where, and he waved it a few times as rays of sword light crisscrossed towards him.</p><br/><p>There was no way to make large movements in the narrow cave, and You XiaoMo had no choice but to raise his hand and erect a defensive barrier. The sword light sliced against the barrier and dissipated after a while, allowing him to swiftly return fire. You XiaoMo flicked several Resonance Bullets towards him, but they were all blocked by Fang Yang\u2019s blade.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s figure flashed, and he disappeared in an instant.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang\u2019s eyes grew apprehensive, and he suddenly turned half to the left as he sliced downwards with the sword in his hand simultaneously. With a \u2018clang,\u2019 the sound waves erupted, causing their ears to throb, and a golden colored shovel showed its true appearance along with You XiaoMo\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>Using a shovel as a weapon?</p><br/><p>Fang Yang\u2019s mouth was about to reveal a sneer when You XiaoMo didn\u2019t give him the chance to do so. He swung the golden shovel and continuously attacked Fang Yang, faster than lightning, and Fang Yang had no choice but to use his large sword to block him over and over, always on the defensive. The metallic sounds echoed in the narrow cavern.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Fang Yang found that something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>After his weapon, the large sword, collided several times with his opponent\u2019s golden shovel, it actually started to change shape. The middle of the blade was beginning to curve at a speed visible to the naked eye, as several small nicks appeared in it at the same time.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang was completely shocked. Master had rewarded him this blade, and its degree of solidness could be compared to black iron. It had brought him success for countless years, but now it was actually ruined by an unremarkable shovel?</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo saw that it really was working, and his movements grew even sharper as he started to smash the golden shovel towards Fang Yang even more feverishly. Immediately, his sword began to curve even more, and it didn\u2019t look like it could take much more.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang\u2019s expression was extremely gloomy, and he had no choice but to withdraw.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was waiting for this exact moment. Right when he was withdrawing, the golden shovel smashed towards his head quickly and violently.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang only had enough time to defend as both of his hands lifted towards the top of his head as an expansive burst of spiritual energy condensed into a thick barrier instantly above him. You XiaoMo\u2019s golden shovel had already slammed downwards, and the reverberating energy struck the walls of the cave, creating a tiny hole.</p><br/><p>The energy and blood in Fang Yang\u2019s body was churning as a mouthful of blood welled up in his throat. He almost spit it out, but it was forcefully suppressed back down by him.</p><br/><p>Before this, he hadn\u2019t expected to get hurt. Even though he knew he would most likely run into You XiaoMo, he had never looked very highly upon him. Because Ling Xiao\u2019s brilliance was too great, many people only paid attention to Ling Xiao and unconsciously forgot that there was someone super-talented beside him.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t because of this that Fang Yang held You XiaoMo in contempt.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s profile was long since circulated within the Black Spider. He was a grade four mage, equal to the one or two star Sacred Realm level. Meanwhile, Fang Yang was a three star expert, so it was clear from the start who should be strong and who should be weak.</p><br/><p>But Fang Yang had also made a mistake. It wasn\u2019t as if You XiaoMo was dead, so he could always advance. Anyone who was vaguely familiar with his advancement circumstances would know that he advanced extremely quickly and unsteadily. For example, compared to the profile from a year ago he could very likely have advanced in that time.</p><br/><p>It seemed like the price for his mistake was to get injured.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo saw that his complexion wasn\u2019t very good, and he immediately pressed in to finish it with a very excited expression, continuously chasing him and hitting him like a madman.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang was essentially being suppressed and smacked, and he discovered that his own strength level was actually a little lower than You XiaoMo\u2019s. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have time to change his plans, because You XiaoMo didn\u2019t give him a chance to breathe at all, slamming down his golden shovel like he\u2019d gone crazy.</p><br/><p>Up until there was a \u2018crack\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>Wood shavings went flying, and the golden shovel that the Metal Swallowing Beast spat out flew upwards, broken.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo calmed down at once. Only then did he find out that, even though the golden shovel was made out of gold, the handle wasn\u2019t. Instead, it was made from wood. Because he used it too frequently and too forcefully, no matter how hard the wood was, it couldn\u2019t bear it, and it finally splintered.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang\u2019s expression was extremely panicked, and he was finally able to take a breather. He saw that You XiaoMo looked like a sinister demon that had crawled out from the pits of hell, ominous and menacing, as if he wanted to flay Fang Yang alive and pull out his bones. It had been a very long time since he was in such a sorry situation.</p><br/><p>However, You XiaoMo\u2019s reaction time wasn\u2019t slow. After the golden shovel broke, he grabbed the handle and swiftly stabbed it towards Fang Yang along with a surge of churning soul force.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang had already calmed down and steadily caught the handle. When he looked at You XiaoMo, he saw him reveal a sudden smile towards him, and Fang Yang\u2019s heart went cold.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo wasn\u2019t trying to attack him at all. What could a handle do, after all? He didn\u2019t think that this thing could hurt Fang Yang. His true goal was was just to make the other lower his guard, and after Fang Yang gripped the handle, a burst of accumulated soul force soared angrily towards Fang Yang.</p><br/><p>Fang Yang was caught off guard and had no choice but to meet this burst of energy head on. Two energies collided against each other, and their bodies flew several steps backward because of inertia.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was waiting for this exact opportunity. He quickly retreated towards the exit of the cave. He had long since determined the correct angle, and the exit was behind him. By the time he retreated to the cave exit, Fang Yang had already recovered, and he immediately released a wrathful roar, about to rush over.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo waved his hand, and the dirt that he piled in his dimension before immediately cascaded out. Even though there wasn\u2019t that much, it blocked the exit. The dirt was soft and loose, so it definitely wouldn\u2019t block Fang Yang for very long. While You XiaoMo ran, he threw out the dirt from his dimension.</p><br/><p>After Fang Yang got rid of the first pile, he discovered another pile after that. The same pattern looped over and over like that before it finally vexed him, and he wanted to slam a fist into the secret passageway, but fortunately, his reason returned at the last moment.</p><br/><p>Triggering a trap in the secret passageway would change the entire layout. Even though the secret passageway was actually created from an enormous transport circle, he couldn\u2019t guarantee that he would be sent out of here. If it changed into another secret passageway, he would very likely be trapped in this place. By the time the battle ended, he would be the turtle in the trap.</p><br/><p>So even though he knew that You XiaoMo was about to escape right under his nose, he had no choice but to bear with it and clean up the dirt in front of him that made him so annoyed that he wanted to kill somebody.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo hadn\u2019t expected the dirt to be so useful either. Originally, he wanted to just wait until things finished up before stuffing the dirt back into the tunnel, covering up the truth about them digging the passageway here, but Fang Yang\u2019s arrival ruined his plan. However, the results were still exceptionally good.</p><br/><p>The tunnel collapsed, covering up all their traces. After this, even if MoQi XiYuan found out, it would most likely be many years later.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, You XiaoMo felt like he should thank Fang Yang. If it weren\u2019t for him, their work wouldn\u2019t have finished up so beautifully.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo only found out that the tribe had already descended into chaos when he ran out of the secret passage. He could hear the ruckus float over from this far away, so it was no wonder nobody found out what was happening underground.</p><br/><p>Just as he was thinking, a sharp burst of energy suddenly attacked from his right side. It slid across his cheeks and hit a nearby tree that was two arm spans wide. The tree immediately fell over with an enormous crash.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo warily raised his hands and just happened to block a leg that swept over horizontally. He was knocked backwards quite a few steps, and the black shadow charged at him unwaveringly again, full of killing intent. Only the person\u2019s eyes were revealed, gleaming with cold light and staring straight at him, as if they wanted to curse him to death.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was startled. It looked like this was the black-clothed person who had infiltrated ShuiXi Tribe during the past few nights. Sure enough, his target was also the transcendent level Spirit Eye, and judging from his attacks, he knew that the transcendent level Spirit Eye was with You XiaoMo.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand why each and every one of them knew about their plan!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have time to think about it further before the black-clothed person broke his train of thought with his attacks. However, he attacked only with his fists and feet, no particularly flashy moves, as if he was afraid of drawing over ShuiXi Tribe\u2019s people.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo discovered that his cultivation base was at the Sacred Realm two star level, and he was slightly surprised. Nowadays, were Sacred Realm experts already of so little value? But something even more shocking was to follow.</p><br/><p>Just after they exchanged a hundred blows, another black shadow suddenly appeared out of thin air and inserted itself between them.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blurted out a curse. Another one showed up? In addition, this one\u2019s cultivation base was also quite high, Sacred Realm one star. As expected, Sacred Realm experts were already as common as Chinese cabbages.</p><br/><p>The second black-clothed person was weaker than both of them, but he was very experienced in battle. Luckily, they didn\u2019t seem to be accomplices, so it wouldn\u2019t be too strenuous for You XiaoMo to fight them. However, he didn\u2019t dare to be too zealous in fighting, as he had to remember there was still Fang Yang behind him. He would come rushing over in a short while, and then it would become one versus three, which he absolutely had no way of dealing with.</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of when the two of them were dueling, You XiaoMo turned and ran.</p><br/><p>The two people both gave a start. They were about to chase after him when a large explosion came from behind them abruptly, followed closely by someone running out. It was the battered and exhausted Fang Yang.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything yet before ShuiXi Tribe found them. A large crowd of people ran over in this direction, interspersed with a few phrases like \u2018they\u2019re behind the mountain\u2019.</p><br/><p>The three of them swiftly shared a look before they each picked a different direction and fled. It was no longer pragmatic to continue chasing You XiaoMo.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Nearly everyone was present; his two shixiong and his clingy dad were all there, and they seemed to be discussing something. When they saw him come out, everyone stopped talking.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo immediately felt a bit uncomfortable after being stared at by so many pairs of eyes. He coughed a few times, breaking the heavy atmosphere in the hall. \u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi instantly replied fawningly, \u201cSonny, we\u2019re discussing the current situation in TongTian Continent. Do you want to come over and listen?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was very interested. He knew about the state of affairs in Xi Jing right now, but he still wasn\u2019t clear about what was going on in South Continent. However, the Cang Alliance should have gained the upper hand.</p><br/><p>You JunQi purposefully moved aside to clear space for his son to show how considerate of a dad he was.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo originally wanted to sit next to Ling Xiao, but when he saw this scene, he was suddenly a little embarrassed, so he slowly walked over. He was about to throw himself into his dad\u2019s \u2019embrace,\u2019 when halfway there, a hand lightly tugged him over. He tumbled completely into an expansive hug, and he landed on somebody\u2019s thighs at once.</p><br/><p>You JunQi, who had extended a hand: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Fang ChenLe coughed lightly and broke the silence.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo recovered and immediately started to struggle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Ling Xiao\u2019s voice spoke threateningly next to his ear.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo was about to speak when he felt something hard and stiff pressing against his butt. He stiffened instantly. No wonder his voice was so threatening, what would happen in the hall if they discovered this situation?</p><br/><p>Now You XiaoMo couldn\u2019t even leave if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was in heat because of him. If something embarrassing happened, You XiaoMo would be embarrassed as well, so he had no choice but to bear the pressure from everybody else, thicken his face, and continue to sit on Ling Xiao\u2019s thighs.</p><br/><p>He coughed. \u201cWhat were you guys talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi had a bitter face and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>Fang ChenLe had no choice but to explain. \u201cWe were discussing Zhong Tian. Ling-xiong said that XiaoYao Institution decided to hold a Mage Assemblage on their own. Moreover, this won\u2019t be the last time; rumor has it that they\u2019ll host one every ten years from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. Even though TongTian Palace isn\u2019t supporting them from behind anymore, it is said that the rewards that the Mage Association and Beast Transfiguration Guild are providing are also very rich. When the time comes, many mages will most likely participate.\u201d You JunQi continued.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded and suddenly said, \u201cDid they say what prizes there were?\u201d</p><br/><p>You JunQi shrugged. \u201cSonny, the first place reward is a priceless treasure for many mages. However, it\u2019s not very useful for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the reward is Grade Water, which helps rainbow level mages to raise their grades. Even though rainbow level mages have rainbow colored souls, it\u2019s still extremely hard to level up their grades. Sonny, your grade level is already maxed, so even if you got first place, it\u2019s useless for you.\u201d You JunQi explained.</p><br/><p>Grade Water was something from the legends. Even though it wasn\u2019t as uncommon as spiritual water, it was still better than the Five Blessing Spirit Eye, which was one grade lower. You could see how highly the XiaoYao Institution valued the Mage Assemblage since they brought out this as the first place prize.</p><br/><p>Even the two associations would covet such an object.</p><br/><p>In addition, the mages who placed in the top ten would receive the opportunity to become XiaoYao Institution\u2019s recorded elders. It was different from being an honored guest. Recorded elders had real power, and they could even enjoy XiaoYao Institution\u2019s resources. However, they first had to enter XiaoYao Institution, and they couldn\u2019t refuse when they were occasionally needed.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo and the rest might not care about it, but for those people without a background, this was an extremely big temptation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I go participate?\u201d You XiaoMo looked at Ling Xiao. He was indifferent to whether they participated or not, but Lin ShaoYi and Ling Xiao still had their promise.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao held his hand, as his calm expression revealed a hint of a profound smile. \u201cGo, of course you should participate. Even if there wasn\u2019t that promise, that woman would still go participate. She\u2019s already halfway to the grade seven realm, but she\u2019s still missing one thing. Her soul grade still isn\u2019t completely at grade seven yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, the higher the soul grade is, the harder it is to raise it. Not everyone\u2019s the same as xiao-shidi. Holy maiden Zu Ma has already become famous for many years, but as far as I know, she was a grade six mage ten thousand years ago. Now, her soul grade has only raised half a grade. She probably needs at least another ten thousand years for the other remaining half, unless she uses the Grade Water. There\u2019s even a possibility she might not be able to raise it in this lifetime.\u201d Fang ChenLe added on. Guma Tribe was their enemy, and back then, he had profiled all of the experts in Guma Tribe, Zu Ma included.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I understand!\u201d You XiaoMo immediately was full of fighting spirit. His goal for entering the Mage Assemblage was to prevent Zu Ma from getting the Grade Water.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo asked when the Mage Assemblage was. Even though it had been extended half a year, it was still less than a year away.</p><br/><p>Originally, they wouldn\u2019t need to prepare for such a long time, but this was XiaoYao Institution\u2019s first time personally conducting the assemblage from start to finish on their own. There were many areas that needed preparation and confirmation. Furthermore, TongTian Continent\u2019s situation still wasn\u2019t stabilized yet, so everything needed time.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, they discussed Xi Jing\u2019s situation again.</p><br/><p>Even up till now, the Four Ancient Beast Clans didn\u2019t know that Black Spider\u2019s leader was Lin ShaoYi. If they found out, Lin ShaoYi and the Black Spider\u2019s situation would become very difficult.</p><br/><p>After the deliberation, they decided to leak out that information.</p><br/><p>Even though they didn\u2019t have proof, people were always naturally suspicious, whether they were human or demon beast. As long as they planted a seed of doubt in someone\u2019s mind, it wouldn\u2019t be able to be easily removed; what\u2019s more, the Black Spider rose suddenly and had their base set up in Xi Jing. There were people who had long since started suspecting that the Black Spider\u2019s leader was a prominent demon beast in Xi Jing.</p><br/><p>After confirming the results, Ling Xiao told You JunQi to go to TianGou to look for Tian Dao. After telling Tian Dao about this, You JunQi should tell him to create a plan, and the meeting ended thereafter.</p><br/><p>The two of them went directly into the dimension upon returning to the room.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo had already cleared out all of the mud in the dimension. Now it was vast and empty, and only the Five Blessing Spirit Eye that they placed next to the spiritual water lake remained.</p><br/><p>The nature of the Five Blessing Spirit Eye and spiritual water lake were very similar; they were simply different methods leading to the same outcome. However, the reason it was called a Spirit Eye was because there was something that looked very much like an eye at the bottom of it. Rumor had it that it was a rainbow stone that the five elements nurtured. After years of settlement, this kind of rainbow stone would slowly release five-colored spiritual energy. When this five-colored spiritual energy was at its richest, it would take shape as a rainbow liquid, which was what the Five Blessing Spirit Eye was in You XiaoMo\u2019s dimension.</p><br/><p>What existed at the beginning was this transcendent level Spirit Eye.</p><br/><p>The biggest difference between the transcendent level Spirit Eye and its high grade, mid-grade, and lower grade counterparts was that the other rainbow stones weren\u2019t actually real rainbow stones. For example, if the transcendent level Spirit Eye\u2019s rainbow stone was the mother stone, then the high grade\u2019s one was its child.</p><br/><p>The child stone wasn\u2019t as valuable as the mother stone. The biggest difference was that the child stone couldn\u2019t give rise to more stones, while the mother stone could nurture new transcendent level Spirit Eyes as long as the requirements were met.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo didn\u2019t know how to go about doing it, but Ling Xiao did.</p><br/><p>The two of them moved the transcendent level Spirit Eye into the small wooden house. After that, Ling Xiao arranged a barrier outside of the house and locked the multi-colored spiritual energy inside.</p><br/><p>The Five Blessing Spirit Eye had a lifespan, which was related to the Five Blessing Spirit Eye\u2019s volatility.</p><br/><p>The only reason why the transcendent level Spirit Eye could accumulate so much rainbow liquid was because there was a layer of ice encasing it in a sealed space, preventing the multi-colored spiritual energy from diffusing out. Over the years, it was only about one cubic meter large, so once it was out in the open, the Spirit Eye would still keep leaking, even if nobody was near it to cultivate and inhale the multi-colored spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should we take care of this transcendent level Spirit Eye?\u201d You XiaoMo asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was silent for a second. \u201cYou just advanced. For now, you should primarily focus on consolidating your realm near the Spirit Eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d You XiaoMo responded before he suddenly lifted his head. \u201cThen what about you? I heard my dad say before this that you forcefully broke into the six star realm when I was locked in TongTian Palace for a year. There aren\u2019t any after effects, are there? And how did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao knew that he was going to ask about this. \u201cDo you still remember when I used the White Tiger\u2019s corpse to refine a few drops of Blood Essence?\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo nodded and looked at him in awe. \u201cYou aren\u2019t trying to tell me that you used the White Tiger\u2019s Blood Essence to forcefully advance, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d Ling Xiao curled his lips.</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo blinked. Wasn\u2019t that saying he was still missing something?</p><br/><p>A peculiar light flickered through Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out later. For now, let me just keep you in suspense. When the time comes, I will definitely give you a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>You XiaoMo\u2019s mind was full of curiosity. He really wanted to know then and there, but now that Ling Xiao had already said it, he had no choice but to endure it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really can\u2019t tell me now?\u201d You XiaoMo looked at him pitifully, as he still couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. If I tell you, then it won\u2019t be a surprise anymore.\u201d Ling Xiao said resolutely. \u201cAlso, this is my ultimate strategy for defeating Lin ShaoYi, so there\u2019s even more of a need to keep it secret, because I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019ll succeed either. Right now, I only achieved the first step, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then I won\u2019t ask anymore,\u201d You XiaoMo compromised.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao patted his head indulgently and said, smiling, \u201cGood. When I succeed, you\u2019ll be the first one I tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to be the first!\u201d You XiaoMo raised his head and pouted as he looked at him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed and lowered his head before kissing him on the lips. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

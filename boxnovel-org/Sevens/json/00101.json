What the Circry House\u2019s head bought was a \u3010Hippogyph\u3011.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About Norma\u2019s and Clark\u2019s futures</p><br/><p>A: Author: No current plans to write about it.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I\u2019m curious about how exactly Lyle worked the casino.</p><br/><p>A: Lyle (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`): \u201c\u2026 Um, I didn\u2019t really do anything special. There are people who keep watch, and sense for Skill use, and all. I just wasted time normally, and earned a silver in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Is the Quilin behind why Lyle doesn\u2019t get influenced by Celes?</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head \uff08 \u309c\u0414\u309c\uff09: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Is he an idiot to venture outside while he knew Celes was there?</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head (\u00b4\u2200\uff40 ): \u201cYou\u2019d rather him hide in a corner in fear? More so, I never thought knights to be so belligerent. I thought they\u2019d deride him at most. Well, in truth, they did encounter one another, so I have to agree with your opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I don\u2019t get why Lianne agreed to meet Lyle.</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation Head (\uff40\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4\uff1b): \u201cWe were surprised at that one to. I just thought on the level of, \u2018It\u2019d be nice if they\u2019d meat someday.\u2019 Well, I\u2019ll bet the girl has much on her mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation Head (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb`): \u201cI think she just wanted to see Lyle herself. Perhaps she was also considering the reason he didn\u2019t sound charmed. The reason she saved him later was probably her hostility towards Celes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: It\u2019s time to marry into Faunbeux!</p><br/><p>A Sixth Generation Head (\u00b4\uff1b\u03c9\uff1b`): \u201cI really don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. I mean\u2026 with the beatdown I gave them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation Head (*\u00b4\u30fb\u0414\u30fb): \u201cBefore status even comes into play, there\u2019s the grudges they have to our House. They haven\u2019t had much opportunity to get back at us, so I doubt they\u2019d consent. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: The reason Lyle held back against the Walt house\u2019s soldiers.</p><br/><p>A: Fifth Generation Head (`\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\u00b4): \u201cIf he killed them, they\u2019d get more serious at killing him. Knocking them unconscious is good and all, but with their strength taken into consideration, he did get serious along the way! You may think that makes Lyle weak, but\u2026 being surrounded really is just that dangerous! Protecting two others adds various restrictions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation Head \uff08 \u309c\u0414\u309c\uff09: \u201cCome to think of it, I don\u2019t think Lyle has much experience fighting whilst surrounded. With the Skills he has, he normally avoids ending up in such situations. I think it\u2019s to do with not being used to it as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Is it really alright to pick a fight with an ancient elf clan?</p><br/><p>A: Third Generation Head (\u00b4\u2200\uff40): \u201cMeh, demi-humans don\u2019t have a very high standing anyways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Was the coupled carriage ticket they purchased to leave the country, or the city?</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation Head ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cTo get to Beim, they\u2019ll have to leave the carriage eventually. Because there isn\u2019t a coupled carriage system outside of Bahnseim, they\u2019ll have to secure another means of transportation somewhere. By the way, Beim\u2019s a foreign country. And quite a small one at that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Why is Lyle so well known when he never went out?</p><br/><p>A: Lyle \uff08 \u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff09: \u201cWell known? I think it\u2019s just the House, and me being born the first son of said House. Perhaps there was something like a wondrance why I never went out to begin with? I mean, that kid was quite normal before he turned ten. Did something happen? I think something of that level was likely a bit known.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: So if Celes is royalty, who\u2019s succeeding the Walt House?</p><br/><p>A: Lyle (\uff1b\u30fb\u2200\u30fb): \u201cI\u2019m curious myself, but I doubt Celes thought it through that far. That\u2019s the vibe she gives me. I really wonder what\u2019s to become of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About gems. Are they expensive? Isn\u2019t that a bit dangerous?</p><br/><p>A: Author: I\u2019ll take this as a question as to their price when the First Generation purchased one. If you want to look at it in modern measurements, they went in the tens of thousands of USD range, and the unpopular one the First purchased was in the thousands range.</p><br/><p>The funding for pioneering forces was also barely scraping through, so the image such pioneers gave off was one where a blue gem was the most they could afford.</p><br/><p>Gems themselves record Skills, but whether one will create an effective Skill combination naturally is up to question.</p><br/><p>The Walt House popped out useful Skills one after the other, so the Jewel seems quite proficient.</p><br/><p>But at present, there are already magic tools with which you can mix and match Skills at will, so the value of Gems has dropped off considerably.</p><br/><p>And if it isn\u2019t handed down in direct succession, with a generation personally teaching the next, you can only use Skills at their base level.</p><br/><p>By the way\u2026</p><br/><p>\u3010Red\u3011 is Vanguard</p><br/><p>\u3010Yellow\u3011 is Rearguard</p><br/><p>\u3010Blue\u3011 is Support.</p><br/><p>Did any of that answer your question?</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I\u2019m curious about the family organization of the Sixth.</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation Head (\uff1b\u00b4\u0414\uff40): \u201c\u2026 Y-yeah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation Head ( \u309c\u2200\u309c): \u201cHe tried to imitate me and make something like a Harem. Simply awful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seventh Generation Head ( \u309c\u2200\u309c): \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t build one myself is mainly the Sixth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Challenging Celes is stupid. The ancestors are stupid to have agreed with it.</p><br/><p>A: Yes?</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: The basis of this story seems to be more modern than medieval.</p><br/><p>A: Author: This is a fantasy.</p><br/><p>To put it bluntly, that doesn\u2019t matter!</p><br/><p>\u2026 or more so, when you try to get nobles to be the ruling order, this and that leads one to put a medieval world as the base.</p><br/><p>So as a model for the system alone, I have chosen the middle ages.</p><br/><p>In modern times, you can purchase titles with money, and the merchants are the stronger order. It\u2019s harder to work that angle.</p><br/><p>Well, I do think merchants were a sturdy and strong existence back then too, mind you.</p><br/><p>If you\u2019re looking at technological might, there\u2019s magic, so I do evaluate it quite high. If there\u2019s no problems, it\u2019s a world that could develop railways and airships at any moment.</p><br/><p>I mean, they have proper flushing toilets and baths and everything\u2026</p><br/><p>(TL: If you\u2019ve ever clicked on the link at the top of these corners, you\u2019ll notice the Q/A is a small part of a larger author commentary. The author further elaborates on this question, stating that if you really wanted a medieval setting, the truth behind puffy dresses, medical treatments, high heels, and perfume would destroy some dreams.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

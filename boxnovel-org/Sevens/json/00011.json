That in mind, I asked what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you get into another fight? What was it about this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The First shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u300eAs if all we ever do is fight. We just talked a bit about the past, and said what we wanted. Now let\u2019s go, Lyle. Oh, right.\u300f</p><br/><p>The First opened his own room\u2019s door, but before he entered, he called out to the Second.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019ll leave the rest to you, Crassel.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second merely dismissed him with his hand. This sort of back and forth from these guys was quite rare, I thought.</p><br/><p>(They usually do nothing but fight. How rare.)</p><br/><p>As I thought that, I passed through the door with the First Generation to find an old townscape extending before me.</p><br/><p>There were even some places where the stone pavement was crumbling.</p><br/><p>The style was quite old, and the Walt House\u2019s Weihs Territory was much further developed.</p><br/><p>And there were even people walking around, carrying out their daily lives.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t touch them?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I suddenly tried to dodge a person that came at me, My shoulder was pushed against a wall.</p><br/><p>But I didn\u2019t feel anything.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is my recollections, or perhaps the inside of my memory. The amount of things you can touch are limited, and it\u2019s useless no matter how many times you try talking to these guys. Hey, c\u2019mon, let\u2019s go already.\u300f</p><br/><p>As I watched through the main street that gave off a crude feeling, the First walked ahead.</p><br/><p>It was surely somewhere I\u2019d never seen before, but there was no doubt about it.</p><br/><p>(Is this the past of the estate? No, for the First\u2019s memory, the scale is off. It may feel a little crude, but the area\u2019s scale is on the level of a town or city.)</p><br/><p>If you think of the extent of the territory, the House\u2019s land shouldn\u2019t have advanced to this point in the First\u2019s time.</p><br/><p>Following the First, we stepped off the main road to a slightly narrower path.</p><br/><p>There, four to five story buildings lined themselves up, as if to make the sky seem small, and the road slender.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t smell anything, but the path seemed dirty.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eAh? It\u2019s the Imperial Capital Centralle. About two hundred years ago, I guess?\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I was a little surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo hundred years!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t be so shocked, boy. I was born around fifty years into the kingdom\u2019s history, you know. Right now, we\u2019re around three hundred into it, right? Something like that isn\u2019t shocking at all.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cR-right.\u201d</p><br/><p>I had never been too far into Centralle, but I wondered if it was this sort of place as I continued on.</p><br/><p>And when we had slipped out of the alley, we reached a residential area, where houses were lined up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eMy parent\u2019s home. That back there was a shortcut, so we took it.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I\u2026</p><br/><p>(So this is where the Capital\u2019s Noble Walt House was\u2026 well, we\u2019re not related to them at all anymore, or so I heard.)</p><br/><p>I heard that we became independent, and severed all ties.</p><br/><p>Of course, with them being imperial Nobles, it\u2019s not like they could act too friendly to the provincial Count House, the Walt House.</p><br/><p>I mean, I think this Walt House was a knight house in the capital.</p><br/><p>Even if you called them nobles, they were the tip of the iceberg, without even managerial posts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what are we here for? Or wait, do you have something to show me?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, the First silently nodded.</p><br/><p>And his eyes were directed ahead.</p><br/><p>There, watching a red haired woman\u2026 Aria, from afar was a young man carrying a large piece of luggage in his hand.</p><br/><p>His age was probably in the early twenties.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 That\u2019s me.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no way!\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think it was wrong for me to be surprised. I mean, his young self looked like an amiable young man. His hair was put in order, and his face was cleanly shaven.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t anything to point to his characteristic barbarian style.</p><br/><p>\u300eI-it\u2019s no lie! Like that, I would occasionally catch sight of Alice-san. I swore to one day rise up from being the third son of a knight house, and resolved my heart to come for her one day!\u300f</p><br/><p>It seems he was surprisingly pure.</p><br/><p>And the scene changed.</p><br/><p>There, a young First Generation was staring at a recruitment flyer for the pioneering corps posted on a wall.</p><br/><p>And the Young First shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis is it! With this, I can get promoted, and I can finally go to Alice-san\u2019s side!\u300f</p><br/><p>He delightedly sprinted off.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt was at that time. I went and bought a discounted blue gem at a bargain. The other types were expensive, but these didn\u2019t have any popularity, so they were cheap. And wait, there wasn\u2019t anything like Magic Tools in my time, so if you wanted Skills, there was nothing you could do but buy a gem. If you didn\u2019t record anything on it later, there was no meaning to it. Didn\u2019t know that back then.\u300f</p><br/><p>The reason the Jewel was purchased was because it was unpopular, and cheap\u2026</p><br/><p>As always, that\u2019s quite a reason there.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s better than having nothing, right? Still, I really wanted a red one, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>Taking the cheap blue gem in hand, the young First stared longingly at the red and yellow ones that were labelled at a price far beyond his reach.</p><br/><p>The First looked at his own form, and found it loathsome.</p><br/><p>\u300ePerhaps this was a mistake. Of course, it\u2019s not like I had a choice. For a lowly Knight House, without a managerial position, we were a low-return household living off pension. I hated a house like that. I wanted to become independent one day, and make it big\u2026 that\u2019s what I thought, though.\u300f</p><br/><p>The scene changed yet again, and this time, it looked like a few years had gone by.</p><br/><p>In a bar in Centralle, a young First, who looked a little wilder than before, was crying into his drink.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I returned to Centralle for a while. The village was kinda starting to take shape, so I thought I would go bring a marriage proposal to Alice-san.\u300f</p><br/><p>The result was just as I already knew.</p><br/><p>Aria\u2019s ancestor Alice-san married into the Lockwarde family.</p><br/><p>\u300eI was just starting to hate any and everything.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cI do get that feeling from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth drinking liquor before me continued pouring out tears, as he ordered more, again and again.</p><br/><p>In place of his betrothal money, he had converted it all into drinking money. I heard the First whisper that as he held his head in his hands.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s no good, isn\u2019t it? To do that sort of thing all of a sudden. He should have brought the talk forward first, or stayed in touch\u2026 and wait, the difference in their status\u2019 was still too great, so he would\u2019ve been turned down at the gate.)</p><br/><p>Love across rank.</p><br/><p>Without fate lending the slightest of hands, the First\u2019s first love came to an end.</p><br/><p>And this time when the scene warped, a tranquil landscape extended before me. It extended, but on it, a heated battle was being carried out.</p><br/><p>A barbarian-styled young First Generation was exchanging blows with another wearing similar pelts.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What is this supposed to be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eHmm? Ah, it\u2019s that. The territory of those who didn\u2019t follow the rule of the kingdom from the start, and my territory overlapped. In that case, you have to decide who it belongs to, right?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, even if you call talking with your fists the natural way to sort these matters out\u2026 ah, you won.\u201d</p><br/><p>The First pummeled his way to victory, and like that, he raised a war cry, as the barbarians around him fell to their knees.</p><br/><p>Even the man he was fighting kneeled before him.</p><br/><p>\u300eHow nostalgic. Back then, even thinking became detestable, so I just carried out my job.\u300f</p><br/><p>Like that, time went forward again, and a First Generation a little more weathered than before was having a drinking bout outside.</p><br/><p>There, he cried out.</p><br/><p>\u300eYa see, the wife I\u2019m gonna take has to be a beauty! Healthy! And she\u2019s gotta have a good head, and nice skin! I don\u2019t got no interest in anything else! These \u2018re the Walt Family Precepts, ya\u2019 hear!\u300f</p><br/><p>With the drink as his fuel, he let out some outrageous things.</p><br/><p>Looking at his own form, the First sighed.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis time is that, you know\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to have to deal with anything like marriage anymore. I mean, I couldn\u2019t think it possible that there was a woman out there better than Alice-san.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are cruel. Because of this, all the future heads went through hell to get married, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Oy, did you seriously think I thought my drunken spiel would be taken seriously?\u300f</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what the man said, but the people sitting around who heard his drunken spiel seemed to have taken his words quite seriously.</p><br/><p>Hey, whose daughter here fits those conditions?</p><br/><p>Ah, my place\u2019s daughter isn\u2019t too smart.</p><br/><p>My sister\u2019s a little sickly.</p><br/><p>They began a serious discussion.</p><br/><p>And within them, there was a single decent-looking man. He was older than the First, and he put his hand to his forehead with a troubled expression on his face.</p><br/><p>His attire was more splendid than the surrounding civilians, and he had some dignity to him.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, that person there\u2019s the old man. He had a territory nearby, and he taught me quite a bit. In the end, this person relied on his influence to bring a Noble wife over to me.\u300f</p><br/><p>By \u300eold man\u300f, he probably means this generation\u2019s Forxuz Head.</p><br/><p>He looked like quite a decent person to me, so seeing him go through troubles for the First Generation made me feel a little apologetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you relied on the Forxuz House from back then as well. I wonder just how far our Walt House\u2019s debt runs with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eHe was a good person, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>Having my sarcasm fall flat, I sighed.</p><br/><p>When the scene changed, an expanded village was burning up.</p><br/><p>The First Generation of his memory wielded a large sword as he confronted the monster before him\u2026 with ashen skin, a powerful jaw, and large forelimbs, a Dragon Subspecies.</p><br/><p>The sword in his hand, length alone, was more than that of a single person.</p><br/><p>(TL: So that hunk of iron really could slay dragons.)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sword is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>I was instantly able to recognize the similarities it had to the sword that came out when I gripped the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eA monster this big came to the village. Even if we got all the men together, it looked impossible. That\u2019s why I stood up front.\u300f</p><br/><p>The large sword in hand, the First Generation screamed out his Skill name as he began fighting the monster.</p><br/><p>For the beast several times his size, he relied on the momentum and weight of the blade, and cut it down.</p><br/><p>His figure was truly one of a hero.</p><br/><p>\u300eFull Burst\u2026 that was my trump card. I could raise my own abilities from two to five times over.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? That high? I get the feeling it wasn\u2019t that high when I used it? But if you raise your abilities that high, is there no backlash or anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eHah? As if I know! Just ignore the side effects. Ignore them!\u300f</p><br/><p>On the First-like opinion, I gave a strained smile.</p><br/><p>\u300eI usually saved up my Mana, and exploded it all at once when I used it. It raised my abilities in proportion to whatever I had saved up. For me, it would be around two to three times my abilities in a month, but it will probably be faster for you.\u300f</p><br/><p>Between us, the amount of Mana we possessed was too far apart.</p><br/><p>With the Fifth onwards taking in the bloodlines of magicians, we became nobles able to use magic in the truest sense of the word.</p><br/><p>While we were talking, the First finally managed to sever the Dragon Subspecies\u2019 head, and emerged victorious.</p><br/><p>And a single child rushed over to him.</p><br/><p>\u2026 It was probably the Second.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I guess it was around this time. Papa\u2019s amazing, or something, is what he got around to saying. Up to then, I couldn\u2019t do anything fatherly for him, and it wasn\u2019t easy on my wife. So I wanted to be able to leave something behind to the two of them.\u300f</p><br/><p>The child Second Generation seemed to be a boy who admired his father\u2019s gallant figure.</p><br/><p>And the times changed again.</p><br/><p>The village had expanded even further, but my impression was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that completely irresponsible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The First stayed quiet.</p><br/><p>As the First Generation of his memory was doing work in the Fields, a grown Second Generation shouted at him.</p><br/><p>\u300ePlease give me a break already! You\u2019re irresponsibly expanding the fields so far\u2026 because of that, there are some fights breaking out among the people! Why not think for a second!\u300f</p><br/><p>And from that scene, time went on even further, and we found ourselves inside the manor.</p><br/><p>The estate the First Generation lived in was ridiculously modest in comparison to the current Walt House\u2019s.</p><br/><p>The First was about to leave with a garden hoe in hand, and he passed by a silent Second Generation.</p><br/><p>The two of them were unable to look each other in the eye.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 It was a mistake, right? I just wanted to leave something behind, but in the end, all I left to the boy were problems with the territory.\u300f</p><br/><p>His haphazardly expanded fields caused problems among the people, but the First shut them up with his own charisma and strength.</p><br/><p>The one who worked more than anyone else was the Feudal Lord, the First Generation\u2026 Basil Walt, and no one would oppose the hero who saved the village time and again.</p><br/><p>But it looks like their dissatisfaction was to be directed at the Second.</p><br/><p>\u300eI just wanted to let them eat a little more. I cut down the forests, and expanded the fields\u2026 by the time I noticed it, I had left nothing but problems. No one would come complain to me. But those complaints were directed at that guy.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cFounder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eBack then, he had ignored me up to the end. Having come here, when he started complaining to me\u2026 I was honestly happy. I was only ever able to have a family shout out with him back when he was a kid, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>It seems their usual belligerent attitude was more decent than how the two of them treated each other before.</p><br/><p>Both of them must be awkward people.</p><br/><p>And the Scene returned to the First\u2019s fight with the Dragon, and froze there.</p><br/><p>\u300eIn my time, we were recovering from the chaos, and we were going to make the times to come more abundant. There were many villages crushed by the war, so we set out pioneering. Reclaiming the land. However, food was scarce, and it wasn\u2019t rare for there to be a problem with starvation.\u300f</p><br/><p>I did hear that it was a rough time.</p><br/><p>That when the Walt House was reclaiming land for themselves, it was a relentless era. When my father was still nice to me, he told me such stories.</p><br/><p>He also spoke of the greatness of the First Generation who raised a village like that.</p><br/><p>Reasons aside, he truly was a grand person.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, have you ever been troubled with food?\u300f</p><br/><p>To be honest, no.</p><br/><p>Even when I was distanced from the rest of the House, I was still fed.</p><br/><p>Even after I was driven out, Zell and Novem were there, so I never experienced starvation.</p><br/><p>(He\u2019ll definitely be mad.)</p><br/><p>If you wanted to call it a luxury, it was definitely one.</p><br/><p>From the point of view of the food-troubled First Generation, I, who had no worries of starvation despite being thrown onto the streets, must not be a good sight to look upon.</p><br/><p>Even so, looking at my weakness, and my mulling over nothing, he must be infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Never. I\u2019ve never starved. I\u2019ve experienced hunger, of course, but even in times like those, I was able to find a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>I prepared myself for whatever he was going to say, but when he turned to me, the First was smiling.</p><br/><p>\u300eI see. Then it\u2019s all good. My descendants were never troubled with having enough to eat. Then all I\u2019ve done wasn\u2019t a complete waste! I\u2019ve heard something nice at the end!\u300f</p><br/><p>The smiling First Generation produced the large sword from somewhere, and presented it to me.</p><br/><p>It was the silver one that gave off a pale light from that time\u2026</p><br/><p>The sword that cut down the red orc in one blow.</p><br/><p>\u300eLet me teach you my last Skill. You were flapping around when you used it back then, so I\u2019ve got to teach you properly. The Skill name is \u3010Full Burst\u3011. It releases all the Mana you normally store up all at once, and it explosively raises your abilities. Try fighting the one over there.\u300f</p><br/><p>The First pointed to the dragon subspecies.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t able to fly, and it was more like a monster that only resembled one, but a dragon was still a dragon.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re dangerous opponents.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? But I haven\u2019t stored up Mana or anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, the First put his hand on top of my head. After my head was violently stirred up, power started pouring into my body.</p><br/><p>\u300eEven I was able to do it. If it\u2019s you, then you\u2019ll do even better\u2026 have at it!\u300f</p><br/><p>Saying that, the First Generation hit my back with the palm of his hand.</p><br/><p>As I unsteadily stepped forward, the dragon that had been frozen in memories up until now started to move. Before I noticed it, the First of his memories had vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, why does he have to spring these things up so suddenly. Please think of how I feel being thrown around like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>As I rushed forward with the sword in hand, I swung it.</p><br/><p>No matter how you looked at it, it was a sword I shouldn\u2019t have been able to swing, but perhaps from the effects of his Skill, I could wield it easily.</p><br/><p>(For him to be able to use it with no side effects, I can call it nothing but cheating.)</p><br/><p>As the dragon tried to crush me with its fore feet, I retreated back, and used Magic.</p><br/><p>\u300eFire Bullet!\u300f</p><br/><p>From the tip of my finger, balls of fire shoot out one after another, but each and every shot was exceedingly powerful.</p><br/><p>As they hit the Dragon, they explode, and that large build falters, and even gets pushed back.</p><br/><p>Like that, I led myself into the second magic.</p><br/><p>I also wanted to confirm my output. Since my abilities were being raised by a Skill, just how powerful will it become\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning!\u201d</p><br/><p>As a purple flash of lightning assailed the dragon, the surroundings were suddenly brightened up.</p><br/><p>It was light from the magic, but its elevated power output surprised even me.</p><br/><p>It was greater than I had imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 I\u2019ll have to get used to using it.\u201d</p><br/><p>If played poorly, even my allies could get dragged into it. On the thought, I broke into a cold sweat. And after running forward, I took a leap.</p><br/><p>The black-burnt dragon turned its head left and right in order to find me.</p><br/><p>But at that time, I was over its head\u2026 right above it.</p><br/><p>I lower the large sword, and blow away its neck.</p><br/><p>The same method the First used to end it.</p><br/><p>And as the Skill\u2019s effects wore off, the sword began to feel extraordinarily heavy, and it pierced into the ground. While still gripping the handle, I tried to lift its weight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought\u2026 it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>While I said that, the First walked up to me. Looking at me, he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf you can do that much, there won\u2019t be a problem! As expected of my descendant.\u300f</p><br/><p>Getting my breathing in order, I lifted the sword that had regained its original weight onto my shoulder.</p><br/><p>The First raised his right hand.</p><br/><p>Sensing something, I raised my right hand as well. With my left hand, I stabbed the sword into the ground.</p><br/><p>Like that, the First Generation gave me a high five with all his strength.</p><br/><p>My hand stung, but the feeling wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle\u2026 have you decided on your goal yet?\u300f</p><br/><p>Having been told that, I remembered my conversations I had with the First up to now. As I stood unable to answer, the First smiled, and muttered, \u2018so be it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u300eYou\u2019ll have to decide what you want to do. You can even go off, and become independent somewhere if you want. You can raise a village and become a feudal lord if you want. Living a quiet life with Novem-chan doesn\u2019t sound bad either. Though personally, I\u2019d like it if you look out for Aria-chan too. Also\u2026 you can even challenge that Celes if you want, you know.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing Celes brought up, it felt like something had grabbed onto my heart tightly.</p><br/><p>My fear was being revived.</p><br/><p>But to someone like me, the First spoke with a tone full of expectations.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf there\u2019s someone out there who could stop her, it may just be you. Well, just do what you want. Ask the others for whatever comes next.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eMy role ends here. I\u2019ve said what I wanted, and it\u2019ll probably be fine if I just leave the rest to you. Rather than someone like me, you\u2019ll be much more reliable.\u300f</p><br/><p>I wasn\u2019t able to comprehend what he was saying.</p><br/><p>No perhaps, I just didn\u2019t want to accept it. The fact that the First Generation was going do dissapear from my life.</p><br/><p>And I tried stopping him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease wait. I still need the First Generation\u2026 I still need Basil Walt\u2019s advice! Why not save me with your instincts as usual? Your instincts are incredibly sharp, you know!\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice sounded like it was breaking down.</p><br/><p>But even I wasn\u2019t able to understand why it was I wanted to cry.</p><br/><p>\u300eI have no wisdom, or technique. And also\u2026 if it\u2019s instincts, the Second isn\u2019t to be looked down on himself. I mean, that guy\u2019s my son. Oh, right, you\u2019re also my descendant!\u300f</p><br/><p>Gahahaha. The way he laughed gave off an impression as if he had no regrets left behind.</p><br/><p>\u300eAfter all, we\u2019re just memories left behind by Skills. The real ones have died long ago. We\u2019re the Skills in the Jewel themselves\u2026 once we\u2019ve transmitted all our knowledge, that\u2019s the end for us.\u300f</p><br/><p>Once they\u2019re transmitted, they\u2019ll disappear. They\u2019ll vanish.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2026 knew?\u201d</p><br/><p>My voice was shaking.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo, it\u2019s just a hunch. I get it\u2026 it looks like those guys also have a vague inkling of it, so you better ask them for the specifics.\u300f</p><br/><p>I extended his hand to him, and he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eMy Skill is already yours now. Use it however you want, Lyle\u2026 and don\u2019t lose.\u300f</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t lose to what?</p><br/><p>I was about to ask that, but before I could let out my voice, the scenery around me changed.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In the same room as ever in the Jewel, I put my hand on the place where the First\u2019s door was once before.</p><br/><p>With his feet resting on the table, the Second called out to me.</p><br/><p>\u300eDon\u2019t cry, it\u2019s unsightly.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being told that, I touched my face, and found I was crying.</p><br/><p>\u300eHe taught you everything. His role in this is over.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cS-still! This is a Jewel, right? Then why is it in a form like this!? If it\u2019s just teaching, a gem works well enough. I can\u2019t understand the meaning of you guys coming out only to disappear!\u201d</p><br/><p>On my scream, the second gave a disinterested answer.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 A gem cannot pass down everything. Unable to grasp the entirety of the Skill, all it lets you use is a small portion. We are here in order to teach you the Skills. That\u2019s why we exist in this space. Did you know? Our memories end at the last moment where the real ones of us touched the gems. Meaning we only remember up to the moment where we passed it on to the next generation.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I was taken aback.</p><br/><p>The ancestors exist here for nothing but to teach me their Skills. No, the Skills were mimicking their forms.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s also strange that we can even talk to you without a problem. The words we should be using trace back to two hundred years ago, you know. You said that that old book was hard to read, and yet like this, you\u2019re able to hold a normal conversation with us. Why do you think that is?\u300f</p><br/><p>On the Second\u2019s thoughts, I came to an answer.</p><br/><p>Because there would be no meaning otherwise.</p><br/><p>In order to transmit the Skills to me, the ancestors matched their words with mine. When the times change, the manner of speech subtly changes as well.</p><br/><p>That was more than clear when looking back at writings of the past. Words that were once popular\u2026 words that change in meaning, but like this, I was able to converse without a problem.</p><br/><p>And that was solely because the Jewel had a message it wanted to get through to me.</p><br/><p>\u2026 That was the Jewel\u2019s role.</p><br/><p>\u300eDid you notice? That\u2019s right. We exist with no more of a purpose than to impart you with the Skills. We teach you how to use them, and even their effective usages.\u300f</p><br/><p>I noticed that the large sword had left my hand.</p><br/><p>And it was floating in the space where the First once sat.</p><br/><p>His chair had disappeared, and his door vanished\u2026 above the table, in the space he once sat, it simply floated.</p><br/><p>A large silver sword, with a blue Jewel embedded in the hilt.</p><br/><p>That sword was the proof that the First had recognized me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026 in that case, why did you\u2026 if it was just to teach me, then why not just do that! Why did he get so involved with me, and make it so that I have to go through such sorrowful emotions like these!?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the first, I hated it.</p><br/><p>He was loud, and there were even times I though of him as nothing but a pain.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 he taught me various things.</p><br/><p>He recognized me.</p><br/><p>Even so\u2026</p><br/><p>As I collapsed on the spot, the Second spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s what we would have wanted to do as well. But\u2026 with our memories, the damn thing even recorded our hearts. We couldn\u2019t just leave you alone. And the First Generation\u2026 Basil Walt left you to us now.\u300f</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t abandon me, the Second said. I didn\u2019t know how I was supposed to respond.</p><br/><p>It was pitiful.</p><br/><p>In the end, I couldn\u2019t even tell him my goal, and I gave him a pitiful parting.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Will we meet again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 If someone comes to possess the Jewel after you, then perhaps meeting would be possible. Though at that point, you\u2019ll be on our side. Still, I doubt that we\u2019ll have a recollection of the memories we\u2019re making with you now. The merits of retaining them are low. It\u2019s because all we exist for is to pass down the usage, and the Skill names.\u300f</p><br/><p>In the end, I won\u2019t be meeting the First Generation again.</p><br/><p>Whatever is recorded in the Jewel will be my Skill, and not the real me.</p><br/><p>The Second spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eIn the first place, it\u2019s a miracle that you were able to meet like this in the first place. The blue Jewel was passed down again and again, and it made its way to your hands. Lyle, this is not your place to be sad\u2026 in fact, be proud. That person\u2026 my old man recognized you. Stick out your chest.\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I opened my eyes in the world of reality.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Novem?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I was lying down on my bed, Novem looked at me with a worried expression on her face.</p><br/><p>She should have been sleeping in a different room, but for some reason, she had made her way to mine.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looked like you were having a nightmare. No, well\u2026 I heard you crying, so I came over.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I wiped my face, I found that it was covered in tears.</p><br/><p>I forcibly made a smile, and directed it at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright. I just saw a bit of a sad dream. Right now, I feel refreshed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA sad dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem tilted her head, as she handed over a towel soaked in water she had prepared. I accepted it, and wiped my face as I thought to myself.</p><br/><p>(If I kept crying forever, the First would be angry with me. I\u2019m a man that Basil Walt\u2026 the father of the provincial Noble Walt House has recognized.)</p><br/><p>Now that I look back at it, he had some barbaric and violent sides to him.</p><br/><p>But there\u2019s no doubt he was a reliable person.</p><br/><p>And ironically, while he hated me the most, he was the first one to accept me in the truest sense of the word.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019ve been recognized by that person.)</p><br/><p>\u201cShall I prepare a warm drink for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem looked worried, so I nodded, and left it at that.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Let\u2019s go get something to drink together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem went off to prepare something, and I called out to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem\u2026 thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem seemed a little perplexed, but she nodded with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you today, Lyle-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just something I felt like getting across. There\u2019s no deeper meaning.\u201d</p><br/><p>I rose from the bed, and headed to the Kitchen alongside her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were few youths among the people walking the streets. Male youths were especially low in number. It wasn\u2019t as if the snow was the only reason no one wandered.</p><br/><p>The light leaking from buildings was similarly few. When it should have been the main street of the capital, a number of stores had closed the doors, with notices of absences posted up front.</p><br/><p>It was surely cold out the window, but watching the outside scenery from the room, such a thing was irrelevant to Celes. The heating unit Magic Tool was operational, and the room was warm. The rapier she held in her left hand, from the shape of the scabbard, and the ornamentation of the hilt, it was made to look like a staff.</p><br/><p>From the yellow Jewel embedded in its hilt, a voice came towards Celes, who looked out the window with a grin on her face.</p><br/><p>\u300eWar piling on war, heavy taxation. How does it feel to watch the insects working for your sake wear themselves away?\u300f</p><br/><p>Unlike Lyle\u2019s Blue Jewel, there was only one mind recorded in the Yellow Jewel. \u3010Agrissa\u3011 who inherited a portion of Septem\u2019s memory, and dropped the continent into hell\u2026 She carved her own memory into the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terribly interesting. But seeing them weaken so much in such a short period of time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes looked down, a sorrowful expression on her face. Her gold hair carried a light wave, covering her expression as she looked down. That glimmering hair, and sorrowful blue eyes\u2026 but as she slowly raised the corners of her lips, she produced a course smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 They really are insects after all. While calling themselves the capital of Bahnseim, this is all it takes to ruin them, after all. I\u2019d have liked it if they entertained me more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Agrissa was a little impressed. Not at Celes\u2019 current form. For she was once called the beautiful siren of the country herself. Carrying on only Septem\u2019s memory of pain, she had chosen to wield her power for her own sake, and that alone.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s more fun to torment them by wringing them bit by bit. Well, you\u2019re still young. Having a bit of flexibility in your heart is a good thing. But it sure is amusing to see Bahnseim fall like this.\u300f</p><br/><p>Watching the city of Centralle lose its energy day by day was an extremely amusing thing for Agrissa. They were once enemies\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t all.</p><br/><p>Bahnseim had once sworn allegiance to her. Meaning he was a provincial feudal noble who obeyed her rule. Even while receiving her grace, he had changed sides the moment the situation took a turn.</p><br/><p>When Celes spoke with Agrissa, she would use the room at the very top of the palace. No one was allowed to enter, the two of them could enjoy their little chats alone.</p><br/><p>Celes smiled as she spoke, as if remembering something.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. Father is going to return from the territory soon. I have to prepare to welcome him. Mother stayed with me, but father had work, so he can\u2019t always be around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Age-wise it was around time for her to develop angst for her parents, or resentment for her father. But Celes held affection for her parents alone. And Agrissa was the same.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, right. Your father sure is busy. My dad was a lower end imperial noble, but he did quite a bit for me\u2026 my siblings were in the way so I drove them out, but after I made it to the inner palace, I gave him a government position and this and that to return the favor.\u300f</p><br/><p>Parents were special\u2026 this did not apply to brothers and sisters. Celes and Agrissa shared the sentiment. It was all due to the influence of the goddess\u2019 memories.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll have to be a party, and I\u2019ll have to prepare a present\u2026 oh, I\u2019ll have to get mother a new dress as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes\u2019 form as she gleefully spoke, rather than charming, she was like a child. There, a knock came at the door. Once Celes gave permission, the automaton Burt entered the room.</p><br/><p>A butler-model automaton, with the appearance of a charming young man. His red hair and blue eyes were exceedingly pretty. If someone who didn\u2019t know better caught sight of him, they would surely believe he was human.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeles-sama, Bahnseim\u2019s army on the eastern front was breached. It was a crushing defeat, it seems. The royal guard was also annihilated. Captain Breid is confirmed dead. Our casualties number in the ten thousands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Celes smiled at Burt.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so? But right now, I don\u2019t have time for such trifling things. My father told me before, you win some, and you lose some. More importantly, father is coming to Centralle. In order to see me! So we need a grand welcoming. Burt, could you arrange it for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems she was uninterested. Burt showed a fed-up expression. If anyone else did that in front of Celes, the torture would start on the spot. But Burt was an automaton. He was capable of all sorts of work, and was Celes\u2019 favorite toy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you would say that, so I\u2019ve already made the preparations. But the national treasury is in dire straits.\u201d</p><br/><p>A life of luxury, and with large wars raging on all over the place, the national treasure of the superpower Bahnseim was in a terrible state. Not that Celes cared.</p><br/><p>\u201cMore importantly, father! We need to give a grand welcome to father who does his work, and kills the insects who don\u2019t obey me!\u201d</p><br/><p>To Celes, Burt spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will effect the official ceremonies of Bahnseim. His royal highness, and the other royalty down the line are expectantly waiting for you to make your appearance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? I\u2019m not showing up at something like that? Why would I do that when father is coming? I can\u2019t believe it! I definitely won\u2019t let Rufus into my bedroom anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Burt shrugged. He offered a rebuttal to those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never even let him in once. As far as I know, and I\u2019ve heard never before then either. When you let all your favorites in, I\u2019m surprised you can say such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Celes showed an angry face. An angry expression that was cleverly made to look cute. As Burt was an automaton, his rude attitude was permitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean\u2026 once I stole him from that woman, I just lost interest. Hmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>A laughing voice came from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s the theft itself that\u2019s interesting. I guess it\u2019s a common tale. But the current me has something I want to take no matter what\u2026 though they always keep it by their side.\u300f</p><br/><p>Letting Agrissa\u2019s voice slide, Celes spoke words of the grand party she would hold for her parents as she waltzed out the room\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u300eSo the theft itself was the fun part\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The one who let out such a voice from the Jewel was the Third.</p><br/><p>The Rhuvenns Kingdom\u2026 a room of its under-repair castle, had become my office. It had originally been used by General Blois, but saying he had to go train his soldiers, he had shoved his work onto me.</p><br/><p>The mountain of paperwork before me were the reports of Rhuvenns and Beim alongside Adele-san\u2019s complaints. Short on hands. The merchants won\u2019t listen to me. The residents are loud about money, at this point she was just complaining.</p><br/><p>I was looking over such papers, the only other one in the room being Monica. The rule of Beim, divided into north and south. On top of that, Rhuvenns\u2026 I held my head at the overwhelming lack of personnel.</p><br/><p>Having come so far, the Seventh spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, with territory problems, it\u2019s usually because you have abundance of people that you go out and invade thinking you can handle it. If you have a firm selection of retainers, and rely on blood relation to gather people, I\u2019m sure your rule will be possible.\u300f</p><br/><p>As I has unskillfully gotten my hands on a large territory, our shortage of hands only became even more severe.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 After you take it, it\u2019s just a pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>After fierce battle after fierce battle was over, there was much to do in postwar processes, and new rule and such. What\u2019s more, the land ruled by Beim\u2019s merchants and the adventurers\u2019 Guild\u2026 they weren\u2019t used to a system with a ruling class.</p><br/><p>The door opened, and there came Lianne-san taking two Valkyrie units along. Her face was smiling, but she looked somewhat worn out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, Lyle-dono\u2026 here\u2019s your second serving. Keep on hammering those forms out\u201d</p><br/><p>The Valkyries placed their new paper mountains on the desk prepared to receive new documents.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, by the way, these ones are the urgent ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said as she left a smaller mountain before my eyes. Seeing my face, perhaps she sensed what I wanted to say as she opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just throw this out there, but I did check over them already. After removing everything that wasn\u2019t completely necessary, this is what\u2019s left. If you\u2019ve become a ruler, you should understand how much responsibility and obligation comes with the title, right? \u2026 And, if you plan to reign over the entire continent, your work load won\u2019t be anything as measly as this. It\u2019s around time you start thinking up a way of rule with higher efficiency.\u201d</p><br/><p>I could only nod at Lianne-san\u2019s words. From the Jewel, I could hear the Third and Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eAs expected, a princess who knows how to govern a single country is different. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s got quite a bit of knowhow with her.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eSerious talk here, the back line, or rather the desk side\u2019s shorthandedness is becoming more severe. Lyle, you\u2026 once you get your hands on the continent, no matter how tedious, you have to prepare a system of rule that can be passed down the ages.\u300f</p><br/><p>A country ruled by a hero\u2026 with the fame, it was an easy way to go about it. But when generations piled up, problems would come out.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 At this rate, I\u2019ll be tasting the pain of the First and Second simultaneously.\u201d</p><br/><p>The First who built up a village where there was nothing.</p><br/><p>And the one who got the first\u2019s village in order and followed behind, the Second.</p><br/><p>The Third sounded impressed.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m surprised you noticed. If you had those two with you, you might get some surprisingly interesting advice. But that\u2019s impossible for us, mind you.\u300f</p><br/><p>Lianne made a perplexed face, so I said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d and said she could go. But she didn\u2019t leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to think of it, right before I came here, I heard. It seems your post-Growth has quite a gap or something. I heard rumors that you\u2019d laid hands on the former Holy Maiden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? From who!? Rather, I didn\u2019t lay hands on her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lianne left the paperwork behind, and looked at the Valkyries that had gone into cleaning up the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Valkyries touched their mouths.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, it was a little game. A game of make belief. We were supplied with maid uniform, and our tensions high, we merely started gossiping a bit amongst ourselves. And Lianne-sama just happened to be in the immediate vicinity, there wasn\u2019t anyone else around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Expressionless with black hair and red eyes, the Valkyries used the cores of the maid automatons who were originally Monica\u2019s sisters. For that sake, they had some strong lingering attachment to maid clothing, it seems.</p><br/><p>Lianne scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen they suddenly started gossiping in my room, I had no idea what was going on. Well, it was a report they sent out to all units, it seems. It sure is convenient. It\u2019s quite a skill. If you station Valkyries all over the lands, you\u2019ll get your hands on all sorts of information in no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s me that it\u2019s possible. Even if it\u2019s possible to use it in rule, that will end with my generation. So if possible, I\u2019m looking for a way to rule without it.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were proficient automatons, but there was a problem. At present, their exchanges with far-away parties was realized through my Skill \u3010Connection\u3011, and if it wasn\u2019t active, these conversations would be impossible.</p><br/><p>Also, the number of cores was limited, and even if we wanted to produce more units, this was the limit\u2026 even Damien couldn\u2019t make cores.</p><br/><p>Lianne looked at my face, nodding a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to think of what comes next. Of course, it\u2019s all a tale of after you win it all. But even so, it isn\u2019t a period to think of war potential alone. You need to prepare a bureaucracy capable of handling office work. We\u2019re shorthanded, so maybe you should take applications outside of nobility. Rather than searching for talent, suppressing it with numbers would be more important in our current state.\u201d</p><br/><p>I reached a hand for an urgent document, and reading through it I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. Proceed with your education plan. The fact you\u2019re telling me this means you already started preparing, right? But I\u2019d like it if you confirmed it with me next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lianne looked a little surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun at all. I thought I would surprise you. Ah, right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wondering if there was anything more, I raised my head to see her making a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never heard who you would be making the legal wife. Can you decide sometime soon? I have to go suck up to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a dumbfounded expression, I dropped the papers, the Third giving a joyful voice from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat\u2019s right, I was waiting for this. The Fourth is just about the only one who would enjoy this boring desk scene, I was waiting for a topic like this!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh spoke in a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u300eTo crumble the equilibrium immobilized by check and restraint, could it be this princess of Faunbeux\u2026 I thought Galleria or Rusworth, or perhaps the queen of Cartaffs would make their move. I was careless. It feels like a bomb was lobbed in from an unexpected angle.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third was the same.</p><br/><p>\u300eI\u2019m the same. I thought this child would move after she made a faction to some extent. Well, it\u2019s fine if it\u2019s all muddled, but assassination alone you should avoid. Lyle, make sure you keep on your toes.\u300f</p><br/><p>No, if you say it like that, it\u2019s as if you\u2019re telling me to permit it as long as it doesn\u2019t reach murder, right? Rather, it looks like they\u2019d grown accustomed to it these days as they blatantly enjoyed the carnage around me.</p><br/><p>\u2026 These guys are the worst.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

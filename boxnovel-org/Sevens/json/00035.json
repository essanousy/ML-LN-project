For me to have been constantly drained of Mana in that state and surviving, I\u2019d like to praise myself. Ah, please make sure to forget my black history.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: What is Novem\u2019s objective?</p><br/><p>A: Second Generation ( \u309c\u0434\u309c) : \u201cNovem is a good girl without any ulterior motives, dammit!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth Generation( \u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40) : \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s actually scarier if she did all that on love without another motive (I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s a yandere. I pray to god she\u2019s not\u2026)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Does Growth come when you wake up in the morning?</p><br/><p>A: Fourth Generation ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@) : \u201cThere are cases like that. Especially at times when you suddenly get a large amount of experience at once, the body cannot process it, and you\u2019re stricken with a severe tired feeling. However, even if you\u2019re going through life as normal, you can undergo the sudden sensation of opening your eyes. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve experienced. So it\u2019s not certain that it\u2019ll always happen like Lyle, where he makes some black history for himself first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: I\u2019m pretty sure there was something between this \u2018sis\u2019 and the Second Generation Head. The Second Generation just didn\u2019t notice it.</p><br/><p>A: Second Generation \u03a3\u03a3(\u309c\u0414\u309c\uff1b) : \u201cNo, while I did become acquainted with her through our family\u2019s relations, there was quite an age difference between us! The one with an age close to hers\u2019 was the Third. But I\u2019m the one who prepared a bride for him, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation\u30fd(\u00b4\u30fc\uff40)\u30ce : \u201cIf the Second didn\u2019t frantically prepare a wife for me, it may have turned out like that. She sure was a pretty person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About Novem\u2019s and Celes\u2019 Skills.</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation (\u00b4\u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff40 ): \u201cThat area is something to wait for expectantly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Could it be that Celes actually likes Lyle? Or she\u2019s perhaps a reincarnator or body swapped?</p><br/><p>A: Seventh Generation ( \u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40) : \u201cI think I\u2019ve said this before, but she isn\u2019t a reincarnator or body swapper or anything. If you\u2019re asking whether she likes or hates Lyle, I think it\u2019s hate. Or perhaps she\u2019s uninterested? I think she was quite happy when Lyle finally left the mansion she lived in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Zelphy-san is too much of a failure as an advisor.</p><br/><p>A: Second Generation \uff08 \u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff09: \u201cWe received quite a few questions on that one. First, her being connected to the lord, and relaying information to him dropped the credibility of the guild, was it? If I was to give a reason for this, while she was an adventurer, Zelphy is a resident of Dalien, and I think it\u2019s natural to report things to the Lord. I mean, if something happened there\u2019s a chance the residents of her homeland would be put at a disadvantage. And wait, the guild is generally a management institution for hopeless ruffians, and an organization to collect magic stones. It isn\u2019t as noble a place as you may imagine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Generation (\u00b4\u2200\uff40) : \u201cThere were also some questions about the lord\u2019s relation to the guild. To continue explanations, the guild was well aware that Zelphy was related to the lord. In Sevens, the relation of the guild to its feudal lord changes based on the territory. They agree over whatever works best, and lash out at each other over whatever clashed, right? And wait, I think there\u2019s a problem in a feudal lord that isn\u2019t mindful of the massive organization crawling onto their doorstep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Generation ([email\u00a0protected]\u2200@): \u201cThere were some comments on how she took money, but that was the expenses to teach adventurers the basics. The bandit subjugation and the urgent request participation were separate fees. Lyle\u2019s low evaluation in Dalien was intentional on his side, so I doubt Zelphy knew what he was thinking most of the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fifth ( \u309c\u0414\u309c) : \u201cIn the end, she\u2019s no good in some areas, but they learned the fundamentals of adventuring, so there isn\u2019t really a problem. Lyle was able to gain knowledge and experience not even we possessed, so I think it\u2019s fine for him to have paid for it. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ll never forgive her for teaching him how to kill and skin a horned rabbit. Never, you hear!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: About the missing party and the deceased adventurer, how did the guild know about that?</p><br/><p>A: Seventh Generation \uff08 \u30fb\u2200\u30fb\uff09: \u201c\u2026 There was an explanation of this in part one, and at the start of the mess, there was a scene where Hawkins confirmed it, but was it hard to understand? Guild cards are made in pairs, and one is kept by the guild. Using that, if something is carved over the name in the guild card, then that\u2019s an assurance of death. People fill out where they\u2019re headed at the guild receptionist desk, and if you haven\u2019t returned by your appointed time, and a mark appears on the card\u2026 you get it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: For it to have eight Skills in it, is it really an heirloom?</p><br/><p>A: Sixth Generation \uff08 \u309c\u0434\u309c\uff09 : \u201c\u2026 Don\u2019t be doubting that part. Even like this, it\u2019s a bonifide heirloom that was handed down through the Walt Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle \uff08 \u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40\uff09 : (Even if I tried selling it, I doubt I would get too much. Even the rare metal from the ornaments around it is worth more.)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Q: Quite a few of the ancestors refer to themselves in the same way, so in order to differentiate characters, how about changing that?</p><br/><p>A: Lyle (\u00b4\uff1b\u03c9 \uff1b`) : \u201cThank you for the useful opinion. If there\u2019s a good place for that, I may end up changing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL: They mostly use \u2018ore\u2019 but this is lost in translation, nor is it too important if you can already differentiate characters.)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

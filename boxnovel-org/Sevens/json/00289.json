Also present were the guild personnel, and the merchants who didn\u2019t run away alongside their men.</p><br/><p>In order to fight Bahnseim\u2019s remnants, Maksim had marched off, so Adele currently had no allies.</p><br/><p>The one to mercilessly thrust that reality at her was Monica.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe leader of the alliance is about to enter Bahnseim\u2019s east, the land that once belonged to a nation neighboring this one. So the management of Beim shall be left to all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Adele looked out the window. Beim in ruins. And the city\u2019s residents taking refuge. On top of that, the smaller problems\u2026 all of them were being shoved onto them.</p><br/><p>Adele raised her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Adele-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica\u2019s forced addition of the \u2013sama irritated Adele.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a question. With Beim facing such ruin, it\u2019s management shall be left to we along?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica nodded expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Affirmative. You\u2019ve exactly right. For the main force is entering the land east of Bahnseim that\u2026 it\u2019s a pain, so let\u2019s just saying they\u2019re entering the country formerly known as \u3010Rhuvenns\u3011. There, they\u2019ll likely start into full-blown preparations. Ah, worry not. Maksim-dono will remain behind in Beim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s force was to enter Rhuvenns under General Blois\u2019 rule, and prepare to counteract Bahnseim from there. That she understood.</p><br/><p>But Adele spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I-I get the feeling we\u2019re short-staffed over here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re short-staffed everywhere. Well, we\u2019ve gotten together whoever seems cooperative, so do your best. I\u2019ve high expectations of your municipal abilities, Adele-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Monica stuck up her thumb and smiled, Adele ruffled up her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cA-at the very least, leave Lianne-san or Novem-san! There\u2019s no way I can manage the city of Beim alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica shook her head with a smile. There, she became expressionless again.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaintain the status quo. Make revival and Labyrinth management the bare minimum goal. Henceforth, Beim shall be split into South Beim and North Beim\u2026 its interests shared. A large portion of the Guild\u2019s rights will be confiscated, so please work hard as proxy leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking the Guild\u2019s rights. That was an important thing for Lyle. On top of that, by splitting Beim between north and south, his goal was to chip away at the power merchant\u2019s held as he fostered a greater sense of competition.</p><br/><p>The ruined North Beim. The developing- yet still small in scale- South Beim.</p><br/><p>It was the birth of twin Beims.</p><br/><p>But from Adele\u2019s point of view, hectic work had simply been shoved onto her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Can I refuse?\u201d</p><br/><p>Monica remained expressionless.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you can? Rest assured. It\u2019s not like everyone\u2019s going to Ruvenns at once. There are various jobs that remain such as adding the prisoners of wars to our forces. But Lianne-sama made her way to Ruvenns first.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she wasn\u2019t the same type as Adele, if she had to say, Lianne was the type more suited to desk work. While Lyle was away, her ability was abundant enough to act as agent leader of South Beim.</p><br/><p>But if that Lianne had already made her way out, Adele was the only one left.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t borrow anyone from the alliance. Zayin and Lorphys were busy with their expanded territory, while Galleria and Rusworth had been lacking in domestic affairs staff from the start. Cartaffs and Djanpear would be difficult, and having come to this point, the lack of people capable of working the back lines was become more severe.</p><br/><p>Adele hung her head, and offered a word\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCurse you\u2026 Lyle-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Where the Tr\u0113s House manor once stood was in tatters.</p><br/><p>Perhaps some noble had made use of it, as its furniture had been taken, and there were traces of battle left behind. Entering such a manor, Vera and Fidel were surrounded by their subordinates who\u2019d followed them all the way to South Beim.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Fidel-sama, there are also areas devastated by fire. This manor is no longer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When one of his men muttered disheartened, Fidel gave an, \u2018I see,\u2019 as he looked at the manor in nostalgia. Vera could only watch her father.</p><br/><p>There, a knock came to the mansion\u2019s broken door, causing everyone to turn. There, with black hair and red eyes\u2026 stood a Valkyrie in maid\u2019s clothing. Behind her, a slightly-worn Gina and Roland\u2026 alongside Fidel\u2019s former subordinates who\u2019d driven them him stood looking at the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cGina\u2026</p><br/><p>When Vera caller her name, Gina raised her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything was taken. Some ships were caught in the chaos and capsized\u2026 the employees betrayed, and took the others. If you want to laugh, then go right ahead! Isn\u2019t that why you searched us out!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGina, stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Roland held her back, Fidel looked over the two. The subordinates behind them couldn\u2019t look Fidel in the eye. Perhaps they were embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Vera addressed Gina.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I just wanted to see you if you were alive. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lyle\u2019s goal\u2026 the situation encircling Beim, and Bahnseim\u2019s declaration of war. In the worst case, Vera thought Gina may have died. But she was relieved to see her alive.</p><br/><p>And Fidel was the same. But he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unsightly. When I think of how I was driven away by you all, I can only feel more shameful of myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gina and Roland\u2019s bodies twitched. Time continued going by like that, until Gina hung her head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 We\u2019ll accept any form of punishment. But accept the people who worked for us in South Beim. I beg of you, father.\u201d</p><br/><p>In regards to her daughter\u2019s lowered head, Fidel took a cold attitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccept them after they drove me out? Your credibility rests at zero. After one betrayal, saying you want to serve under me again is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Fidel\u2019s attitude, Vera covered her face. He really did want to help them. But having only just started up a new business in South Beim, employing any more hands would be difficult.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, South Beim currently held a deep=rooted animosity centered around the belief Beim had thrown them away.</p><br/><p>As South Beim was, it was impossible for the driven-out-side accepting merchants of Beim.</p><br/><p>\u201cA number of large mercantile ships that had abandoned Beim made their way to South Beim, but we turned them all away. That was South Beim\u2019s answer. Do you understand? South Beim will not accept any of you. That is fact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fidel walked off, everyone following behind him. Vera stopped beside Gina and Roland. Fidel followed suit.</p><br/><p>But their subordinates continued walking on.</p><br/><p>Fidel spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 That whelp has a few debts to settle with me. I negotiated to have him let yyou set up a business in north Beim. I\u2019ll prepare an extent of money. The stolen ships have been secured in South Beim. We\u2019re using them to transport cargo, so come to receive them at the port in three days\u2019 time. That\u2019s all I will do for you. Roland, I leave Gina to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 He said, and walked off. Normally, he\u2019d have wanted to help them, but the surrounding environment, and the feelings of his subordinates. On top of that, the opposing representative merchants of Beim were to be crushed for the sake of Lyle\u2019s plan.</p><br/><p>Gina raised her face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vera walked off as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe pushed himself quite a bit. Now do something about it for yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Using all Lyle\u2019s debt to him, he had forced him to recognize Gina\u2019s business in north Beim. That was the most he could do\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The top floor of an inn of Beim.</p><br/><p>In that room with a high-class feel, I wrapped a blanket around myself. It was getting dark outside the window, and one day was on the verge of ending. It was a darkness unthinkable of Beim, the city whose streets were once lit at night. The stars looked pretty, but I felt terrible.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the Jewel, I could hear the Third\u2019s laugh.</p><br/><p>\u300eGolly, this time was a huge harvest. To think right after collapsing, you\u2019d take the former Holy Maiden to go, I never even imagined it.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh was the same. He gave a similar laugh.</p><br/><p>\u300eFor me, hearing Lyle\u2019s grand goal of doing good for the world was quite satisfying. No, was that mr. lyle\u2019s goal?\u300f</p><br/><p>These guys\u2026 they\u2019re having fun teasing me.</p><br/><p>I heard a knock. As my body reeled back in shock, I let out a voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes?</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon my intrusion. Lyle-sama, I\u2019ve come with today\u2019s reports. It\u2019s seems you\u2019ve received various reports form Monica-san, but there are some other specifics as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who entered the room was Novem. There was no worry of her teasing me, so I was relieved, but when I recalled how she had seen my post-Growth state as well, it was awkward. I\u2019d shown it to time and time again, but every time only increased the past I wanted to burry.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-sorry. I wanted to be alone for a while\u2026 I-I\u2019ll come out tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be a big help if you did. Lyle-sama, you\u2019re the leader of the alliance. It\u2019s a huge difference just if you make an appearance or not. And Lianne-san headed for Ruvenns. She did have guards, even if they train up troops there, it will only be to the minimum level. It\u2019s already winter, after all. They shouldn\u2019t be able to move for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked out the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It isn\u2019t snowing, but the cold is becoming harsher. We\u2019ll have to reconstruct the surrounding villages, and distribute people a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were too many people gathered, that goods expenditure was becoming something extraordinary. Even if we stole back what we could from Bahnseim, the problem was that there was less than expected.</p><br/><p>Novem took a seat on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to Lianne-san, she\u2019s going to gather people who endorse you in Ruvenns. For that occasion, she\u2019ll try to shake off as many spies as possible, but perfection will be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll do something about that when I make my way there. I have the appropriate Skill for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem sounded delighted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be Fiennes-sama\u2019s Skill, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said. I was surprised she knew it, but it was Novem after all. It wouldn\u2019t be strange for her to know, and it was natural for the Forxuz House to have documents on the Walt House. There was no use in minding it.</p><br/><p>There, Novem\u2019s face turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I heard from Baldoir-dono, but I cannot recognize his marriage to the princess of Lorphys. Baldoir-dono is an important retainer who will support you henceforth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Novem, you\u2019re quite terrible yourself. Aren\u2019t you just saying Lorphys\u2019 princess is plain terrible? Well, they\u2019re too far in status, so I do think it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, Novem gave a giggle. I was led along by her into a laugh, and the two of us exchanged some more friendly banter.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>Looking at Novem happily conversing with Lyle, the Third looked a little relieved. There were five silver weapons floating around the round table room, and now it was as quiet as if its once-boisterous atmosphere was a lie.</p><br/><p>\u300eI was a bit worried for Lyle, but it looks like it will work out. Perhaps it\u2019s best his mind is focused on mr. lyle right now.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eNo matter what reasons he has, his feelings of guilt will come out soon. When so many people have been killed, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have to take quite a bit upon himself. Well, he\u2019s got Novem and the others with him, so perhaps he\u2019ll be fine? Though that Novem is a bit suspicious.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third touched a hand to his mouth as he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u300eIsn\u2019t it fine? It\u2019s a bit heavy, but that\u2019s still love. Now the problem is how Lyle plans on having Novem-chan turn his way in the truest sense.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh sounded worried.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf he could do that, most problems would be settled. Well, the major problem would still remain, thought.\u300f</p><br/><p>The major one\u2026 it was Celes.</p><br/><p>In order to fight Celes, the ancestors were entrusting their knowledge\u2026 and their Skills to Lyle. They were preparing for a determined, and certain victory.</p><br/><p>If there was to be a problem, it would have to be what came after winning the war. If Celes was able to escape, it would be a problem.</p><br/><p>There was no point in surrounding him with people who would end up charmed. In the end, Lyle would have to fight Celes. He was gathering members for that sake, but the ancestors hadn\u2019t the slightest clue what his chances of winning were.</p><br/><p>And there was a problem they knew.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe eastern front is wide open. Other countries are marching their lines towards the superpower\u2026 you think they\u2019ll show up?\u300f</p><br/><p>On the Third\u2019s question, the Seventh nodded with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u300eThey\u2019re coming. The Walt army we trained up will definitely move. At soonest, right when winter breaks. But it all depends on the situation.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third touched a hand to his chin, and looked up at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u300eEven if a rebellion breaks out within the country, as long as it\u2019s small in scale, they\u2019ll prioritize Lyle. There are feudal lords in Bahnseim who\u2019ll side with him, but\u2026 those hostages in Centralle are troublesome.\u300f</p><br/><p>And there was something that intrigued the Third even more. He looked at the Seventh.</p><br/><p>\u300eNow then, it\u2019s about right time I asked. Seventh\u2026 no, Brod, do you think you can watch over Lyle\u2019s fight with Maizel?\u300f</p><br/><p>That the Walt House would move meant Maizel\u2026 The Eighth Generation Head of the Walt House would make his move. There was a possibility he would send a representative, but that didn\u2019t change the fact they would be fighting the Walt House\u2019s army.</p><br/><p>\u300eFrom my point of view, my era\u2019s too far removed. To be honest, after we got Baldoir-kun\u2019s cooperation, I\u2019ve barely any lingering attachments. But what about you? There\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019ll only be traitors like the Virden House.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh looked down.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Sure enough, it may be something painful to watch. But if the Walt House is going to fall at this rate, it may be best for Lyle to be the one to deliver the finishing blow.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third looked down as well.</p><br/><p>\u300eThat may be ideal, but I\u2019m emotionally\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh looked up at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 We\u2019ve finally come all the way here.\u300f</p><br/><p>The preparations to fight Celes were reaching their final stage\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

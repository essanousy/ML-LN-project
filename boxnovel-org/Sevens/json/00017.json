Right now, I\u2019m meeting Lyle-dono, the adventurer.\u201d</p><br/><p>I wonder if that means he decided not to accept my return as the heir.</p><br/><p>(Has he heard from Zelphy-san?)</p><br/><p>The moment she learned I was from the Walt House, Zelphy-san likely made a report.</p><br/><p>(She probably got curious and investigated when she saw me use magic or something.)</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s charge, the Seventh Generation, gave an evaluation of him.</p><br/><p>\u300eI see. Looks like he\u2019s not as he seems. How splendid.\u300f</p><br/><p>As we sat on the sofa, Ventra asked what he wanted to know.</p><br/><p>That was the true goal of this visit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard from Zelphy. That you two weren\u2019t particularly aiming to return to nobility, and that you were truly trying to live as adventurers. But you seemed to be moving along quite a different pretense during this case. If you wanted to sell your names, you should have moved in with an elite group during that mission. Right now, you\u2019re being called an \u300eIdiotic Former Noble Brat\u300f, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>From my actions, I already understood that the surroundings would see me as such.</p><br/><p>I matched their numbers several time fold to subjugate a single bandit troupe, and I even paid all the wages for it. There were many, many more efficient ways to go about doing it.</p><br/><p>Normally, I would be in a huge deficit. As an adventurer, and as the son of a noble, there was no helping it if they called me a fool.</p><br/><p>However, I fulfilled my own objectives, and on top of that, rather than going into the reds, I even earned sixty gold coins on top of that.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s enough of a plus.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, that was for my own benefit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you say there was personal gain for you in this time\u2019s subjugation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the Seventh gave a subdued whisper.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt was to release the conditions for a Skill. Even if you say it, I doubt he\u2019d understand, though.\u300f</p><br/><p>That was exactly the case.</p><br/><p>I agreed with the Seventh\u2019s opinion.</p><br/><p>And of all things, Zelphy-san brought up Lockwarde-san\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Lady Aria\u2019s request moved your hearts? No, perhaps ulterior motives?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? No, something like that is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only for a moment, but Zelphy-san directed an immense glare at me. Perhaps she was telling me to go along with it.</p><br/><p>The Seventh Generation gave a grunt of affirmation, before offering some advice.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle, just go with that. It would be a pain if the First Generation started acting up about Aria again.\u300f</p><br/><p>Without knowing what was going on, I affirmed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-well\u2026 it\u2019s that, you know\u2026 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I gave a vague response, I took a fleeting glance at Novem.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t angry or anything. She was just drinking tea.</p><br/><p>(Okay, Novem understands the flow of this! No, wait, if someone looked on from the outside, they would definitely think I worked for Lockwarde-san\u2019s sake.)</p><br/><p>Having thought that, I matched Zelphy-san\u2019s accusation, and offered a vague response to Ventra-sama</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so I guess it just means Lyle-dono is a man as well. No, it sure is wonderful to be young. Be faithful to your desires.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was smiling, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was being praised at all.</p><br/><p>Without me being able to alter the flow, the matter ended as me performing the bandit subjugation mission for the sake of Lockwarde-san, who I took a liking to at a glance.</p><br/><p>(That\u2019s kinda unpleasant in itself. I wonder what Novem is thinking.)</p><br/><p>I took another glance at her, but she didn\u2019t seem angry in the slightest.</p><br/><p>I was afraid of whether she was seriously fed up in her deeper thoughts, but there were no signs of that either.</p><br/><p>\u201cFumu. If that be the case, then would you be fine if your reward is settled as Lady Aria?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Reward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ventra-san nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this matter, because of Lyle-dono, I was able to benefit. If you desire Lady Aria, then I\u2019ll leave her disposal to you. I mean, the current head of the Lockwarde House was found to have ties to the bandit troupe, of all things.\u201d</p><br/><p>From their actions up until now, Ventra-san assumed they had conspirators and investigated based on that it seemed.</p><br/><p>As a result, they had found some connections leading towards the Lockwarde House.</p><br/><p>Having learned that, Lockwarde-san was in quite a bit of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cA gem holding multiple skills truly isn\u2019t an item for today\u2019s era. However, if they sold such a thing to a bandit troupe, they should have been able to understand what sort of matter would result. If they aided them as well\u2026 we have no choice but to punish them.\u201d</p><br/><p>He probably had to make an example of just what would happen if you aided enemies of the state.</p><br/><p>And wait\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eS-sold, you say\u2026 Lyle! Right now, go beat the hell out of that Lockwarde House\u2019s head! Doing something like selling Alice-san\u2019s gem is going down the wrong path as a human being!</p><br/><p>And as always, the Second restrained the First.</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd you went down the wrong path as a human parent. And wait, listen to what they\u2019re saying. It\u2019s about what\u2019ll happen to your all-important Lady Aria, isn\u2019t is?\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eAh, right!\u300f</p><br/><p>The ancestors shut up, and I looked at Ventra-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, as part of the family, Lady Aria will have to take some responsibility as well in the matter. Even more so now that only the father and daughter remain. Good grief\u2026 even when Zelphy said she would lend me her aid only if I let them continue to live here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I may be so rude, just what is it that the Lockwarde House did?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem asked that, Zelphy-san covered her face with her left hand and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsed their status as officers, had connections with criminals, and overlooked their sins. Because of that, the Lockwarde House\u2019s reputation fell to the earth. Of course, the current head\u2019s use of money was always rough. My father was driven out, and so we had to leave the capital and come to Dalien.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ventra-san took over her explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cA knight driven out draws quite a few chastising eyes, so it was probably hard to live in Centralle. It looks like Zelphy-san\u2019s house probably went through quite a bit of trouble. I mean, a knight became an adventurer to support her family.\u201d</p><br/><p>From there, Zelphy-san had an expression no words could describe on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Aria watched the fall of the Lockwarde House with her own eyes. On top of that, she learned they were connected to the bandit brigade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem cut off her voice.</p><br/><p>If a house can be raised in a generation, it can be crushed in a generation as well.</p><br/><p>(Though I\u2019m not really one to speak of that.)</p><br/><p>The Seventh Generation spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eWas the House\u2019s achievements up until now the reason the clan or people concerned weren\u2019t executed ? In my generation, they would all be sent to the gallows, you know? No, was the Lockwarde House in the Royal Faction? Perhaps it was the king\u2019s benevolence.\u300f</p><br/><p>It seems there were some circumstances surrounding the matter.</p><br/><p>Even I was banished, and if Zell and Novem weren\u2019t there, I may have bled to death on the streets somewhere.</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t think of this as someone else\u2019s problem.</p><br/><p>It was because Zell picked me up that I obtained the Jewel.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 So what is going to happen to the Lockwarde House?\u201d</p><br/><p>As I asked, Ventra-san\u2019s face turned serious.</p><br/><p>Their troublemaking was tolerated until now. But they sold off an orb that contained multiple skills to enemies for paltry change.</p><br/><p>On top of that, they assisted them and even helped them slip into Dalien.</p><br/><p>I doubt he had any intention to let them off.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of Zelphy-san\u2019s request, I let them stay in Dalien, but that has its limits. Having lost their rank and position, there was already enough demerits to keeping those troublesome presences in itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they were driven out of Centralle, the Lockwarde House moved into Dalien.</p><br/><p>It was easy to live in and a territory close to the capital.</p><br/><p>But for an officer that had connections to criminals, Dalien likely wouldn\u2019t accept them either.</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san was quite the loyal one, I see.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that they had connections and drew the bandits into Dalien. If we investigated, I wonder just what other deeds would surface as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The gem that was thought of as stolen was simply sold off.</p><br/><p>And along with conspiring\u2026 the Lockwarde Head\u2019s sins were heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe head will be sent to work in the mine. Originally, Lady Aria would be left alone with nothing but her figure and her age, so perhaps she would have to become a harlot in another land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being put to hard work in the mines as a slave.</p><br/><p>And the path of a harlot was what awaited Lockwarde-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to dispose of the brave daughter in a way like that. No, if you pursue her, Lyle-dono, I\u2019ll leave her to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ventra-san\u2019s smile, I tilted my head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zelphy-san energetically hit my shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that great, Lyle! I mean, you\u2019ve got a beauty like Lady Aria. Truly great. Ahahahahah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, wait a second\u2026 eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>She forcefully closed the conversation, and it doesn\u2019t look like anyone here was going to listen to what I have to say.</p><br/><p>I looked towards Novem for help.</p><br/><p>And she\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it, Lyle-sama. With this, you\u2019re one step closer to fulfilling your dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Dream? Eh? Eh!? What?\u201d</p><br/><p>Within my confusion, the talks proceeded forward.</p><br/><p>\u300eO-oy\u2026 what is the meaning of this?\u300f</p><br/><p>The First was bewildered.</p><br/><p>The Second was in a similar state.</p><br/><p>\u300eEh? No\u2026 that\u2019s where you should be helping him, right!? Hey, match the pace, and help Lyle make sure that Aria girl doesn\u2019t end up as a prostitute!\u300f</p><br/><p>But the Third differed.</p><br/><p>\u300eReally? Is seems that everyone has their own motives here\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The fourth was troubled by Novem\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>\u300eNovem-chan, open your eyes! This end is no good!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth offered a complaint to Ventra-san.</p><br/><p>\u300eThis Lord, as payback for having been fooled by Lyle, he intends to push Aria onto him. This sly one\u2019s probably roaring with laughter in his head after seeing Lyle so troubled.\u300f</p><br/><p>It looks like the Sixth had taken a liking to Zelphy-san.</p><br/><p>\u300eEven for that Zelphy adventurer girl, she sure was desperate. But still, Novem\u2019s reaction was unexpected.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh Generation didn\u2019t seem to mind it all too much.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s because Novem\u2019s a daughter of the Forxuz House, so perhaps she doesn\u2019t really mind if he has a side mistress or two? And wait, From my point of view, shouldn\u2019t we be more worried about Lyle?\u300f</p><br/><p>I understood I had no allies here.</p><br/><p>Of all things, when my eyes met those of the guard standing beside the lord, he broke into a grin.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 I-I was set up? B-but why?)</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t think there was a problem in my train of thought that Zelphy-san could have just taken Lockwarde-san under her in an instant.</p><br/><p>Even so, it ended up that I was taking her.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Having returned to the rented house for the first time in a while, I confronted Novem.</p><br/><p>Preparing food would be a pain, so we got that over with outside.</p><br/><p>I already entered the bath and brushed my teeth.</p><br/><p>(I-I have to put my spirit into it!)</p><br/><p>I got my breathing in order and tried to convey my feelings.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t because the ancestors told me to.</p><br/><p>To the girl that always supported me, I wanted to give an answer to her feelings.</p><br/><p>More than anything\u2026 I liked Novem.</p><br/><p>I was starting to sweat from nervousness. The words weren\u2019t coming out as well as I wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem\u2026 I love you. As hopeless as I am, I\u2019d like it if you married me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama\u2026 I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem covered her mouth with both of her hands. Her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes were teary.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yeah! So you see\u2026 um\u2026 I like Novem, and I don\u2019t have any romantic feelings towards Lockwarde-san or anything. That previous matter was more of one to somehow save her, I think.\u201d</p><br/><p>I felt like a hopeless man making an excuse for cheating, but getting my feelings to Novem across was my first priority.</p><br/><p>But the ancestors were noisy.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d like it if they could read the mood and shut their mouths.</p><br/><p>The First and Second said\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat a hopeless remark\u2026 You\u2019ve got to settle it clearly.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eFrom you, who wasn\u2019t even able to talk to your first love, you\u2019ve not a fragment of persuasive power there.\u300f</p><br/><p>Novem, it was enough if you alone were by my side\u2026 I wanted to say that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I\u2019d like it if you always stayed by my side. Together, I think it would be nice if we lived like that, you know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, your confession hasn\u2019t really locked itself in place. And wait, I think it would be best if you made more of an atmosphere there. You\u2019ve got to give a present, or select the location carefully, or else\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third judged me.</p><br/><p>I knew. But if I didn\u2019t say it here and now, I get the feeling the situation will become irreversible.</p><br/><p>Wiping her tears with a finger, Novem spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Lyle-sama\u2026 but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(B-but? Wait, does that mean I\u2019m being rejected? S-she said she was happy, didn\u2019t she?)</p><br/><p>\u201cFor those that call themselves men; it isn\u2019t right for you to give up on your dreams so easily. You wanted to become an adventurer, and live a willful life being waited on by women\u2026 To realize that dream, you have to steadily increase your influence. In order to actualize Lyle-sama\u2019s dream, as I thought, you will have to become a first class adventurer.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Novem said that, I was unable to comprehend her meaning.</p><br/><p>A first class adventurer?</p><br/><p>I just became an adventurer to secure the necessary provisions to live, and I hadn\u2019t really decided my future that far down the line.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle! So you had an ambition like that!?\u300f</p><br/><p>I heard the Fourth Generation\u2019s angry voice.</p><br/><p>But I had no memory of saying something like that. In the first place, it wasn\u2019t like I was fixated on being an adventurer or anything.</p><br/><p>Novem continued on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am aware of the Walt Family Precepts. Surely, Aria-san is one worthy of being a woman of the Walt House. So please include her in your harem without any further delay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem\u2019s statement shocked the First.</p><br/><p>\u300eW-what was that\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. Novem, please stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>And wait, it wasn\u2019t like I wanted a Harem or\u2026</p><br/><p>While I was thinking that, the Third spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u300eAh! Lyle, you did say it! Come to think of it, you did say something like that!\u300f</p><br/><p>(Like hell I did! And running after other women in front of Novem, who works herself so hard for my sake, I\u2019m not that much of an idiot!)</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I never said anything like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Novem tilted her head, the Third Generation continued on.</p><br/><p>\u300eSee, that time at the start! Before you knew about our existence, you said those exact words to Novem atop the cart!\u300f</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the Fourth Generation remembered.</p><br/><p>\u300eSo it was then!\u300f</p><br/><p>In confusion, the Second generation confirmed it.</p><br/><p>\u300eB-but that was just to get Novem-chan to return to her House, right? What? Isn\u2019t it strange for Novem-chan to have not caught onto that?\u300f</p><br/><p>After they said that much, I started to remember.</p><br/><p>I tried to disillusion her and send her back to her House.</p><br/><p>\u3010I have no such will. I\u2019ll become an adventurer and live a willful life being waited on by women. Being driven away by my family actually makes me feel relieved.\u3011</p><br/><p>\u201cHot damn, I did!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having remembered it, I let out a confused scream, and Novem put her hand on my shoulder in worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama!? What could be the matter, Lyle-sama!\u201d</p><br/><p>The First spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u300eY-you\u2026 despite being a wimp, you had ambitions like that.\u300f</p><br/><p>To the First, the Second\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eFollow the flow of the conversation! She got herself to believe the lie that Lyle spouted!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third Generation was a little lost in thought.</p><br/><p>\u300eBut still, I can\u2019t think that Novem-chan didn\u2019t notice something like that, though?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth judged me further.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle! What are you going to do from here on out!? Even when you have Novem-chan, are you going to welcome that Aria girl? It\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re going to choose one!\u300f</p><br/><p>To the Fourth, the First shouted.</p><br/><p>\u300eAre you making fun of the living likeness of Alice-san!? You damn glasses, let\u2019s take this outside!\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth seemed to be of the same opinion as the Third.</p><br/><p>The Sixth gave Novem the following appraisal.</p><br/><p>\u300eSo Novem is that\u2026 the type of woman where if you take one step off the path, she raises a first class loser.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh remained unconcerned.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle is the former heir of a Count House. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s a chosen existence that carries royal blood on him, isn\u2019t he? This may be due to the Forxuz House\u2019s teachings, but don\u2019t make such a fuss over a mistress or two.\u300f</p><br/><p>On the Seventh\u2019s opinion, the Sixth gave a soft reply.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 You, you say something like that when you only had one wife alone.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Seventh fired back.</p><br/><p>\u300eLooking at Father(the Sixth) and Grandfather(The Fifth), there\u2019s no way in hell I want a Harem. Well, if it\u2019s Novem, she\u2019ll properly manage such domestic matters, so there\u2019s no problem.\u300f</p><br/><p>(More importantly, why don\u2019t you guys put out some good ideas to help me resolve this situation!?)</p><br/><p>To correct her misunderstanding, I stood and grabbed both of her shoulders.</p><br/><p>I ignore those unreliable guys and resolved myself.</p><br/><p>\u201cNovem!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>I get my breathing in order.</p><br/><p>And I stared into her violet eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a harem. As long as I have you, that\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama\u2026 I deeply apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to avoid any misconceptions, I made sure to say it clearly.</p><br/><p>I knew that a vague response wouldn\u2019t get me anywhere.</p><br/><p>Even so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Novem offered her apologies, and the bell fastened on the door rung out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already called Aria-san over. She was without a place to stay, and Zelphy-san was living with her fianc\u00e9, so she said she couldn\u2019t take her in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about my opinion!?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first I\u2019d ever heard of Zelphy-san\u2019s fianc\u00e9, but more importantly, I need to deal with Lockwarde-san.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, I am deeply sorry. Ah, I\u2019ll go out to meet her.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she separated from me, Novem looked like she was smiling a little.</p><br/><p>Like a mischievous child, that sort of happiness.</p><br/><p>(W-what does this mean?)</p><br/><p>I sat down on the spot and squatted, as I put both hands to my head.</p><br/><p>I have a woman who had been by my side for so long, and I\u2019m bringing a new woman to the house.</p><br/><p>Looking from the sidelines, I\u2019m definitely a hopeless man. There\u2019s nothing I could say about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really have no hope, do I!!?\u201d</p><br/><p>And there, the Fourth\u2019s words stabbed into me.</p><br/><p>\u300eHa? No matter how you look at it, you were hopeless from the start.\u300f</p><br/>\n</div>"}

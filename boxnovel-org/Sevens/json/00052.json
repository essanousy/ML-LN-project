Maybe I should just go buy a domain already. Ah, also, I\u2019m struggling to innovatively translate the toxic maid\u2019s insults. Maybe I need an englishman.</p><br/><p>Prologue</p><br/><p>Inside the Circry House\u2019s estate in Arumsaas, I was eating my meal.</p><br/><p>I usually eat Novem\u2019s cooking, but only for today, a certain \u3010Toxic Automaton\u3011 insisted she would do it, and she wouldn\u2019t budge on the matter.</p><br/><p>It seems she possesses a sense of rivalry against Novem, but it\u2019s strange no matter how you look at it.</p><br/><p>That scrap metal maid\u2026 the moment she came to the mansion, she directed an attack at the girl.</p><br/><p>She had picked up the nearest broom, and tried to lower it on Novem\u2019s head, but I stopped her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? The taste of the food I put my all into making for a wimpy chicken dickwad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chicken dickwad was likely referring to me.</p><br/><p>It seems that since I didn\u2019t have the high spirits of when we first met, she added a wimpy to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s delicious. It\u2019s much tastier than I imagined, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut? But what? A chicken dickwad has some complaints to voice against my cooking? Now out with it. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll make use of those complaints to prepare the supreme dish.\u201d</p><br/><p>I looked at the other dishes lining the table.</p><br/><p>The presentation was perfect.</p><br/><p>There was no problem with the taste. In fact, it was delicious.</p><br/><p>The fact that an automaton could do this much was truly a truth I hadn\u2019t imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t there a gap between my plate and the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only I had a larger portion.</p><br/><p>The scrap metal looked at me, and let out a scornful laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, of all things? I prepared a greater portion of food for my master, the chicken dickwad. I did not exceed the sum of money I was permitted, so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you see, this is Miranda-san\u2019s mansion. We\u2019re just freeloaders!\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda-san, who was eating alongside us, spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to worry about that. How about it. Why not just become the master here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pale green haired Miranda-san looked at me with her emerald eyes.</p><br/><p>Her mischievous intentions were blatently visible.</p><br/><p>She was definitely having fun.</p><br/><p>I thought she was a cat-like person, but following the events of our previous dungeon expedition, more of her personality was showing than before.</p><br/><p>I looked towards Novem, with her brown side ponytail.</p><br/><p>Novem didn\u2019t seem to be noticing my glance.</p><br/><p>And she took a bite\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Lyle-sama\u2019s preferences, the taste is a little light.\u201d</p><br/><p>And said that.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Aria let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>The red-haired Aria directed her violet eyes at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t let them go too far.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reason Aria felt fed up was because of this piece of junk.</p><br/><p>I mean, this pile of scraps\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMu! So this is the rumored \u300eStepmother Bullying the Young Wife\u300f entry in my data! Are you perhaps unsatisfied with my cooking? Considering nutritional balance, I have surely created the finest of tastes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 Liked to compete with Novem.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not even sure why, but only to Novem did she ever display an emotion like hostility.</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation, feom the blue Jewel hung at my neck came a voice only I could hear.</p><br/><p>The Fourth Generation Head of the Walt House, \u3010Max Walt\u3011 had his long blue hair parted in a seven to three ration at the front, and glasses hanging on his face.</p><br/><p>Within the Jewel, everyone had manifest in a form somewhere around their thirties.</p><br/><p>This Fourth\u2019s notable characteristic was\u2026 not just his glasses.</p><br/><p>\u300eGood grief, what a strange automaton. For her to pick a fight with Novem-chan, just what could she be thinking\u2026 now stop them already, Lyle.\u300f</p><br/><p>In regards to women, the Fourth was quite loud.</p><br/><p>No, to be more specific, in regards to the treatment of women.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, scrap metal, isn\u2019t that enough? Why are you always on at Novem?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the Fourth requested, I stopped the scrap metal.</p><br/><p>But surprisingly, Novem\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLyle-sama, I think scrap metal is a little cruel. We\u2019ve finally gotten ourselves a new comrade, so we\u2019ll have to decide on a name.\u201d</p><br/><p>What a nice girl\u2026</p><br/><p>In contrast.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you to show mercy to the enemy\u2026 that naivety will cost you your life one day. Even if I look like this, I was manufactured as a top of the line model, and I\u2019ve even been praised as his greatest masterpiece. I can\u2019t be receiving mercy from\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she started into some incomprehensible words, Miranda-san spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t scrap metal good enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Chicken dickwad, I am pleading to you with upturned eyes, so please decide a worthy name for me, dammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>That isn\u2019t the right attitude to ask a favor.</p><br/><p>But only her mouth was bad, and pertaining to me, she did actually apply her all.</p><br/><p>The housework that was hard for Novem alone had become much easier because of her, or so I\u2019ve heard.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Looking at the movement of those twin tails, something\u2019s come to mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I voiced that, scrap metal took the bait.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! For you to lust after these twin tails, you\u2019ve got good eyes there. My makers even got into a fist fight over deciding between black bobbed hair, and these blond twin tails. As I thought, twin tails truly are the greatest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI kinda get a poyo poyo feeling as the move back and forth, so \u3010Poyopoyo\u3011 is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL: Just imagine the feeling something swinging back and forth leisurely gives off.)</p><br/><p>The scrap metal\u2019s refreshing expression suddenly turned expressionless.</p><br/><p>The one who was holding her stomach in laughter\u2026 was Shannon.</p><br/><p>In the past, she was a sightless, frail noble lady, but with her sister being something like that, the younger sister was quite a villain in her own regard.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got no naming sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who extended her hand towards the giggling Shannon was Miranda-san.</p><br/><p>She used her left hand to grab the top of her head, squeezed, and lifted her up like that.</p><br/><p>I\u2019m starting to hear a creaking sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cO-onee-sama, it hurts! It really, really hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in giving me that cute tone. You\u2019re being rude to Poyopoyo, who finally received her long-awaited name.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, Aria covered her mouth.</p><br/><p>Only Novem continued eating while she seemed to be thinking of various things with a serious expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Chicken bastard. If it\u2019s now, I will accept a revision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Poyopoyo said that, so I shook my head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo alterations, Poyopoyo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fourth raised an angered voice from within the Jewel\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eNo matter how you look at it, that\u2019s going too far! You have to be nice to girls!\u300f</p><br/><p>And said something like that.</p><br/><p>(There\u2019s no doubt this guy\u2019s wife subjected him to something.)</p><br/><p>From the other\u2019s ancestors\u2019 conduct, I can guess he was quite a submissive husband.</p><br/><p>This man acting up about women, was the head with the longest term of service in the Walt family\u2019s history.</p><br/><p>The Third fell in battle in his thirties, and so he took over the title in his teens.</p><br/><p>From there on, I heard he mostly contributed in domestic affairs, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eAnd wait, is there really no maintenance costs on that girl? She just sucks Lyle\u2019s Mana, right? If there\u2019s a service fee, wouldn\u2019t that be a pain? Perhaps even a normal servant maid would be better.\u300f</p><br/><p>He was also loud about money.</p><br/><p>I heard he handles things on the financial front as well, but when I\u2019m actually here conversing with him, he just keeps prattling on about money.</p><br/><p>It seemed he was the sort of man who would choose money over women.</p><br/><p>That was the Fourth Generation, but only concerning his wife did he ever turn frail.</p><br/><p>His son, the Fifth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eOy, weren\u2019t you saying something about being nice to girls? No wait, while her outside is female, her insides are iron, or something, right?\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth\u2026</p><br/><p>\u300eOh, right\u2026 but Poyopoyo is cruel.\u300f</p><br/><p>But yeah, perhaps Poyopoyo was a bit much.</p><br/><p>Expressionlessly, Poyopoyo (temp) continued to grumble on about demanding a change.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, won\u2019t you consider it a bit longer? Please use that meaningless godforsaken brain of yours to think of a name for my sake. I\u2019ll be sure to treasure it. If it\u2019s a proper name, I\u2019ll be sure to treasure it, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Scary. This automaton is scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cOy, that\u2019s a little scary, so please stop. I get it. I\u2019ll think. I\u2019ll think about it, so please give me some more time\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, the troublesome pile of scrap metal returned a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, the chicken dickwad is weak to a woman\u2019s pressure!\u201d</p><br/><p>I also shot back a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly your skin\u2019s a woman, and your insides are black, right? How about we stop denying reality here.\u201d</p><br/><p>An angered scrap pile told me.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying? As a special model of the highest grade, there is nothing impossible for me. If I was in the mood, then even a gentleman\u2019s lustful urges are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that much, Novem spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a meal, Poyopoyo-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scrap metal bit down on her hankerchief mortifyingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-this bitch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dinner at the Circry House has become lively all of a sudden, but it\u2019s gotten quite enervating.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd so, that\u2019s why you\u2019ve come here, is what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Library.</p><br/><p>It was a place meant for one to drop by and store up knowledge, but today, I was reading alongside Clara.</p><br/><p>While we read our books, we exchanged various conversations.</p><br/><p>A while ago, I accepted the request of Damien, a famous professor of Arumsaas, the City of Scholars, and we ended up working together.</p><br/><p>While she specialized in support, she was a skilled adventurer.</p><br/><p>Her deep blue hair was cut around her shoulders, but perhaps she had done that herself, as the edges were quite ruffled.</p><br/><p>It seems she liked reading books here, as whenever I came, I had quite a high probability of finding her.</p><br/><p>I usually ask her about what books are interesting, but we would occasionally exchange such gossip.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That scrap metal keeps insisting I decide a name, and she competes with Novem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strange. Could her rivalry with Novem be on her job as a maid?\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know that one either.</p><br/><p>I mean, that piece of junk\u2026 is broken.</p><br/><p>There\u2019s how she doesn\u2019t remember some important things, but her tone towards me is generally terrible.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe individual herself said her sensors labelled her as an enemy or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s an ancient automaton, so it\u2019s amazing enough that she can even move. Ah, come to think of it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara remembered something, and conveyed it to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the academy, Damien is moving around more automata. He\u2019s gotten three of them operational, and he\u2019s confirming the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now Damien was the talk of the town.</p><br/><p>Just being able to move an ancient automaton and control it was amazing in itself.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, I thought\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that my scrap metal is like that\u2026 should I swap it in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s properly doing her job, right? Is there some sort of problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer choice of words, I guess? Everything else is perfect. Cleaning, laundry, and cooking, she\u2019ll do it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>She really was quite perfect, but I\u2019d like to do something about that mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I think you should give up on that. I did hear it was a form of contract, and the means to sever it are as of yet unknown, so you\u2019ll be like that all your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me remember those things\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For the contract to the automaton, my own blood was needed as a catalyst.</p><br/><p>But having just gone through a Growth, my spirits were high, and I went ahead to kiss the Automaton to activate it.</p><br/><p>(Was that where it went wrong? No, she said she got broken of her own accord.)</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Clara looked at me.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure do some troublesome things. Restricting your own Skills, and aiming for the labyrinth\u2019s thirtieth floor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Last time when we challenged the labyrinth, we made it past the fortieth floor\u2019s boss with but a party of six.</p><br/><p>Apparently, it was an enemy that would usually require fifty.</p><br/><p>And it\u2019s good that we achieved results and all, but seeing that, the ancestors imposed a restriction of my Skills until I defeated the thirtieth floor\u2019s boss.</p><br/><p>Under the banner that my own abilities were overwhelmingly lacking, they forbid any such usage of any Skills in my possession.</p><br/><p>Because of that, I somehow have to use my own strength to break through the chappence.</p><br/><p>While it may sound easy in words, the challenge was on a scale where it required from twenty to thirty adventurers.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a personal matter. If I remain too reliant on my Skills, then it will be dangerous once my Mana runs out.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I expressed the ancestors\u2019 reasoning, Clara made a slight surprised face.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I was sure you hadn\u2019t noticed it, and that you were going to make a huge mistake one day. It seems I\u2019ll have to reassess m evaluation of you, Lyle-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH-how cruel.\u201d</p><br/><p>As I said that, I get the feeling she was smiling a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anything happens, call out to me. With your ample funds, I don\u2019t think I would be at a loss to hear you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it\u2019s a matter of money, I thought\u2026 but in truth, to adventurers like us, money was essential.</p><br/><p>In order to live, we threw ourselves into life threatening situations.</p><br/><p>And if the money we obtained was what we used to get by, we had to be firm in that regard.</p><br/><p>Of course, I\u2019ve taken various things onto myself, and I\u2019m in a standing where I have to earn enough to support two women, and one automaton.</p><br/><p>(But really, what is it that I should to)</p><br/><p>If we simply raised greater numbers to challenge it, then it really would be easy.</p><br/><p>But during Damien\u2019s request, I displayed quite a sorry sight.</p><br/><p>(Because I returned to the guild carried by Novem, my reputation\u2026 is quite low.)</p><br/><p>At the end of the end, I became unable to move my body, and I showed off quite a terrible state to the other adventurers.</p><br/><p>For that reason, my own personable credibility is low.</p><br/><p>While I want to gather the numbers, my questionable standing in Arumsaas is dragging my feet.</p><br/><p>(As I thought, there\u2019s no choice but for me to steadily build up my own strength.)</p><br/><p>My sudden Growth, and the fact that I produced results was all because of the Heads of History\u2019s Skills recorded in the Jewel.</p><br/><p>If I become unable to use them, it\u2019s exceedingly troublesome.</p><br/><p>(I\u2019ll have to think of a way to overcome the thirtieth floor.)</p><br/><p>As I thought that, I continued to pile up the knowledge of the library.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That part was fine and all.</p><br/><p>But today\u2019s Monica was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cProstrate yourselves before me, mass produced mongrels. Having received the name \u300eMonica\u300f from my master, I\u2019ve far transcended you numbered assembly lines.\u201d</p><br/><p>With her chest stuck out, she domineered over the three automata owned by Damien.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! You should\u2019ve just been destroyed then and there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou intentionally took attacks onto yourself to reach a special scene\u2026 as expected of a special model. Your underhandedness is quite characteristic of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA methodology as dirty as that\u2026 we would never have even imagined it.\u201d</p><br/><p>(Could it be these girls actually get along?)</p><br/><p>The three automata stared at her with irked expressions.</p><br/><p>Seeing their faces, Monica remained stuck up in her sense of superiority.</p><br/><p>Damien spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw her insides, and a red liquid flew out\u2026 they really were amazing, those ancients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of having been destroyed, Monica was equipped with a formidable self-repair ability. I reported that to him.</p><br/><p>Hearing my report, Damien pushed up his glasses, and lost himself in thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t try destroying them as an experiment, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked, a little worried, the ones to react were the three automata.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s master\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, we\u2019re always prepared for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, shall we get started!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the automata desire for their own destruction, I found absolute confidence that these guys were of the same sort as Monica.</p><br/><p>Damien let out a scornful laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor what sake? I\u2019m busy with my own research here. I tossed away automaton research to another professor already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having lost interest, Damien conceded automaton research to another, it seems.</p><br/><p>He gathered all the data he wanted, and he was currently caught up in his own research.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you not need my report?\u201d</p><br/><p>When I asked, he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in the non-automaton-related parts. It\u2019s Porter. The adventurers are loud and noisy about it, but the academy\u2019s also got its eyes on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien made a tried expression, and a voice came from the Jewel.</p><br/><p>It was the usual fourth.</p><br/><p>\u300eHmm\u2026 Lyle, the time has come for you to sell the knowhow you\u2019ve built up for a fortune. It\u2019s the machine that the adventurers dabbled in backhand dealing to obtain. You should be able to get gold coins numbering in the thousands\u2026 you get it, right? At the start, present an outlandish amount, and then slowly\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>I ignored him, and continued my talk with Damien.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it will shut up the guild, I\u2019ll hand over all the data I\u2019ve obtained. I\u2019ll also add on a blueprint for a simplified model, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you could get them to stick on a considerable pricetag.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien looked over me.</p><br/><p>He seemed a little perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure? There are a few idiots out there prancing around about how it\u2019ll amount to the fortune of the century, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Truly, Porter\u2019s value in the labyrinth was immeasurable.</p><br/><p>But generally, it couldn\u2019t output that much speed.</p><br/><p>Its movement speed was low, and its structure was specialized to this specific labyrinth.</p><br/><p>The Fourth started shouting.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhat are you saying, Lyle!? This is where you obtain a large sum, and then save\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fifth stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf he got that much, he\u2019d just be targeted again. It\u2019s best to take these things in moderation.\u300f</p><br/><p>The data in my hands was definitely valuable.</p><br/><p>But if the academy actually got serious about it, they could probably collect it immediately.</p><br/><p>At the same time, I don\u2019t actually think it will go that well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this from having used it, but while it\u2019s definitely excellent at baggage carrying\u2026 it takes quite a bit of talent to put to use, and more importantly, you\u2019ll have to be a middle level or higher magician. If you expand Porter, then it\u2019ll barely be able to go down a straight road in the labyrinth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The simplified blueprints were able to traverse stairs, and turn the corners\u2026 it was a model smaller than our Porter.</p><br/><p>Monica planned it out.</p><br/><p>It was a smaller version optimized for baggage carrying, and ease of use.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a valuable user opinion. Truly, if we plan on spreading those, it\u2019ll have to be miniature models.\u201d</p><br/><p>Damien could use \u3010Golem\u3011 magic.</p><br/><p>The academy would use that and Porter to reap a huge profit.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 The Arumsaas guild is hesitating to accept our home change request. With that previous matter, they\u2019re short on hands, and they said they definitely want us to stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>A large party was crushed, and the guild was in turmoil.</p><br/><p>There was the problem of the adventurer we dragged back spreading information, but the other adventurers already heard he was of the party that tried initiating an assault.</p><br/><p>We made him move that way to begin with, so it was just as planned.</p><br/><p>And in that chaotic Arumsaas guild, we submitted a home change request.</p><br/><p>Damien spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unfortunate. Lyle, you were one of the few individuals whose names I\u2019ve committed to memory. Well, those that build up strength in this town are fated to flow elsewhere. I mean, that guild\u2019s as you can see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both the academy and guild had their objections.</p><br/><p>It seems they wanted to buy information off of me.</p><br/><p>Porter stood out more than I had ever imagined.</p><br/><p>Damien grumbled over how, \u2018It\u2019s going to be stormy for a while,\u2019 or something along those lines, as he corrected the position of his glasses with his index finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass the message to the higher-ups. Of course, even if I don\u2019t do anything, the guild\u2019s going to be in an uproar.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the past few days, whenever I dropped by, the receptionists greeted me with pale expressions.</p><br/><p>On the other hands, the adventurers started up conversations with smiles.</p><br/><p>From here on, I\u2019m not sure if for better or worse, a large change was bound to happen in the guild of Arumsaas.</p><br/><p>I was changing homes, so I wasn\u2019t interested.</p><br/><p>Where should I go next?</p><br/><p>We discussed that back at the mansion.</p><br/><p>But Aria kept making an expression troubled enough to make even me curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you. I have the documents together, so I can even bring them over by tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure are prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Damien said that, I made a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a loud person who kept telling me they\u2019d definitely be necessary.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fourth within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>From the start, he was thinking of making a fortune off of Porter.</p><br/><p>\u300eIt\u2019s a waste, I tell ya`! Ask for royalties, and get ten percent of their profits over the years, at least!\u300f</p><br/><p>He was loud about money, but after becoming an adventurer, I learned that money was important as well.</p><br/><p>But the Sixth spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eLyle\u2019s just an adventurer. He has no political or military power. If he makes too much of a ruckus, I don\u2019t think it will turn out for the best.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Fourth resisted.</p><br/><p>\u300eJust how many humans do you think will be influenced by Porter!? It isn\u2019t just those operating it. They\u2019ll need manufacturers as well. Even people to carry our repairs! If they can raise its efficiency even further, then there will arise adventurers who can earn even more! Listen here, this investment is\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>I do hold the Fourth\u2019s opinion in high regards, but I can\u2019t manage all of that, nor do I have any plans on doing so.</p><br/><p>And so, I\u2019ll submit whatever knowhow I\u2019ve obtained to the academy, get some money, and call it a day.</p><br/><p>Damien asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you plan on going next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t decided where to set as our next home, but for now, we\u2019ll head to Centralle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about your large luggage? Do you plan to have Porter carry it?\u201d</p><br/><p>By large luggage, he was likely referring to what was left of the fortieth floor boss\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>I purchased it because I thought it would be useful for something, but taking it along sounds a bit dubious. However, the current me doesn\u2019t have a restriction on using Skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll deal with that stuff with Skills and the like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow convenient. I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, Damien formed a smile.</p><br/><p>Around the laboratory, Damien\u2019s subordinates were looking upon the automata with cramped faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuh! Three on one is unfair!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Don\u2019t underestimate the coordination of a mass produced lineup!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSurround her, and go in for the kill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow sturdy. I guess even when broken, she isn\u2019t a special model for nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>When I turned around, I found Monica locked in battle with the other three automata in fluttering attire.</p><br/><p>I spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026 we\u2019re going back, Monica.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying that, I departed the laboratory, and Monica followed after imparting some sharp parting remarks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cute chicken dickhead\u2019s Monica will now be accompanying his departure. Well then, farewell serial numbered mass produced defects.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three automata were chewing on their aprons mortifyingly.</p><br/><p>Perhaps I should call them complex, but they really did look like humans.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 For what sake was Monica built for?)</p><br/><p>I couldn\u2019t help but wonder that once more.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Aria had come to the adventurer whose care she had been under, Lyra.</p><br/><p>Lyra was at work in her room, when Aria declared her intent to change homes.</p><br/><p>Continuing on with her work, Lyra gave a response as usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat so? Well, with your level of skill, you should be able to make it wherever you go. Could it be Beim next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beim was called the capital of adventurers, and it was a location with no dearth of adventurer work to be found.</p><br/><p>At the same time, its public safety was bad, and the name Capital of Adventurers was often spat out cynically.</p><br/><p>It truly was a free city reigned over by merchants, but that was the name it was called nowadays.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat part hasn\u2019t been decided yet. For now, we plan to leave Arumsaas, and head for Centralle.\u201d</p><br/><p>If they arrived at Centralle, they could use a coupled carriage to visit most major cities.</p><br/><p>If they wanted to move, they would likely have to stop by the city regardless.</p><br/><p>This time\u2019s goal was securing members.</p><br/><p>Miranda, Clara, Shannon\u2026 they were successful in adding three of them.</p><br/><p>It may sound nice to say they cleared their objective, but Aria was sad to part with the women who had taken care of her for several months.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Adventurers part the moment they meet. On the other hand, there are also those that refuse to leave, and drag out their meetings. That\u2019s how it goes. If you keep paying mind to it, there\u2019ll be no end to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps sensing Aria\u2019s feelings, Lyra stopped her work.</p><br/><p>And she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, leaving this line of work, and finding a decent job it the best option, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>While it may not be the case in Arumsaas, adventurers were a gathering of scoundrels.</p><br/><p>With numerous criminals among them, they held a terrible image.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s different once one becomes famous, but still, there are plenty a man who\u2019d make a sour face upon merely hearing the word, \u2018Adventurer.\u2019</p><br/><p>Arumsaas\u2019 special environment was one where students of the academy often registered as adventurers, so they weren\u2019t often looked at with such eyes.</p><br/><p>Lyra spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDalien and Arumsaas\u2026 they\u2019re all places abundant in work. I\u2019m a bit worried about that, but you survived through a large-scale assault. You\u2019ll probably be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that was because the enemy was negligent, or so Lyle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Aria recalled what Lyle had stated about the enemy.</p><br/><p>Making good use of their Skills, and waiting for the right timing to use their tools was good on their part.</p><br/><p>But they had underestimated the party. If the enemy had taken a little more caution, it would have been dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were against those accustomed to targeting those of the same trade, it\u2019s likely you guys would be dead. Well, guys with that level of skill are probably hard at work with mercenary jobs, but\u2026 here, with the very fact of them carefully selecting their targets, and preparing to attack, it\u2019s certain they\u2019re all small fried.\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to build up their skills as adventurers, novices would run off to Arumsaas. It was a place to hone themselves, and meet up with comrades.</p><br/><p>Even if you could hold confidence in your strength there, that doesn\u2019t mean it would hold true in the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, you see, it\u2019s better to be a coward. Don\u2019t you go around forgetting that. Well, luck\u2019s an important one as well\u2026 your places leader\u2019s probably a human with those things to his name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luck\u2026 a factor that hard work couldn\u2019t do anything against.</p><br/><p>Hearing Lyle be called as a possessor of it, Aria tilted your head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor all those that succeed and survive to the end, they\u2019ve all got to have good luck. But for that part, you\u2019ve got to watch them to the end to confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it be good or bad, Aria decided to follow along with Lyle.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because he had bought her life.</p><br/><p>It was because she had decided to follow.</p><br/><p>(\u2026 That man, could it be his confession\u2026 no, but he said he read a lot of books, didn\u2019t he?)</p><br/><p>There was something she was curious about.</p><br/><p>There was also the fact that Aria wasnted to become stronger.</p><br/><p>Lyra finished the product she was working on, and tossed it over to Aria.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a parting gift. Take it with ya\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201dEh? This is\u2026</p><br/><p>Taking the chain with a spot to embed her gem in hand, Aria looked at Lyra.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do you plan on hanging your precious trumpcard on some cheap string? You\u2019ve got to make sure you won\u2019t drop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Lyra\u2019s direction, Aria pressed her own red gem into the necklace.</p><br/><p>Hanging it on her neck, she felt the new weight of the metal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell doesn\u2019t it suit you? You\u2019ve got to pay a little mind to your appearance too, you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lyra said that with a smile, Aria gave her thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-thank you very much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Aria\u2019s moist eyes, Lyra couldn\u2019t help but feel a little bashful\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The academy graduate Miranda was tidying up the Circry House\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>It was in order to get rid of it.</p><br/><p>It was the property of her home, the Circry House, so she would have to request permission from her father, the head, before selling it. She had already sent out a letter.</p><br/><p>She also wrote of how she graduated, and planned to live on as an adventurer.</p><br/><p>Pertaining to Shannon\u2019s eyes\u2026 they hadn\u2019t fully recovered, but she was able to carry out life to some extent, or so she lied.</p><br/><p>(But I can\u2019t really write the entire things as a lie.)</p><br/><p>Miranda looked towards Novem and Shannon, who were cleaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, make sure you do it properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be bought off by some merchant, and sold, so of course I\u2019ll do the cleaning before that! There\u2019s definitely a meaning to that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shannon resister her cleaning duty, but before Novem\u2019s smiling, she screamed in fear, and continued persisting onwards.</p><br/><p>Clara, who came to help, asked Miranda.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, will I also be following?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miranda cleaned as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I mean, you\u2019re a comrade. Ours comrade, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She placed some emphasis on the word comrade, but Miranda looked at Clara, before turning back to her work.</p><br/><p>She was a little happy.</p><br/><p>More importantly, she started recalling the contents of the leter from her father, and began thinking on them.</p><br/><p>Even as a daughter driven out, Miranda was still a person of the Circry House.</p><br/><p>Her father had told her to drop by now and again.</p><br/><p>(So he can\u2019t help but be curious. He didn\u2019t even oppose when I said I would become an adventurer.)</p><br/><p>Miranda\u2019s father seemed to think that if she had chosen that life, then there was no helping it, and he gave up.</p><br/><p>But he wrote to stop by once, no matter what.</p><br/><p>(I wonder if there was some sort of problem.)</p><br/><p>Having left the main house, Miranda\u2019s interest concerning it was quite low.</p><br/><p>The second and third daughters had their grooms decided, and while she was studying in Arumsaas, Miranda would receive financial aid.</p><br/><p>There was also looking after Shannon, but those around knew she had been basically driven out.</p><br/><p>(I hope it doesn\u2019t become a problem, though\u2026)</p><br/><p>Miranda considered bringing up the contents of the letter with Lyle.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u2026 Within the Jewel.</p><br/><p>The Second and Third were conversing.</p><br/><p>\u300eSo Lyle\u2019s successfully cleared the challenge.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. It\u2019s unfortunate he didn\u2019t experience a Growth\u2026 Ah, he has physically grown, though.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third seemed regretful he didn\u2019t get to witness mr. lyle this time around.</p><br/><p>The Second shared that sentment, but not wasn\u2019t the time for that.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Hey, I think you know already, but\u2026\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eThere\u2019s an order to things. But it sounds like my turn will be dropped.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second\u2019s Skill was useful, but not complex.</p><br/><p>It generally allowed others to use one\u2019s Skills, a true Support Skill.</p><br/><p>Its side effect allowed one to conveniently perceive the situation around them. But the difficulty in learning and applying it wasn\u2019t all that high.</p><br/><p>The First and Second\u2026 their Skills were, compared to the others, quite peculiar.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it\u2019s precisely because they possessed those two Skills, that the succeeding heads of history developed ones of different form.</p><br/><p>Because the foundation was in place, they sought for characteristic Skills.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I was quite the plain family head, so I wonder just how many things there are out there for me to teach the boy.\u300f</p><br/><p>As the Second said that, the Third made a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\u300eThe First cut through the forests, I achieved greatness in the war\u2026 when you\u2019re stuck between those two, you sure do look plain! I apologize for being so great!\u300f</p><br/><p>From his serious face, he suddenly burst into laughter, so the Second hit the top of his head.</p><br/><p>The Third complained.</p><br/><p>\u300eOh my, \u2018twas but a joke.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eYour jokes always turn dark. Also, you went and died in battle\u2026 you\u2019re the one least fitting of it all.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 I also think so.\u300f</p><br/><p>The two remained solemn for a while, before the Second spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eAt the very end, at least, I want to get him to clearly make a decision. As I thought, with plainness as my base, I can\u2019t think of anything, though. Acting cool like my old man is also out of the question.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second smiled, and the Third went on.</p><br/><p>\u300eIf it\u2019s Lyle, he\u2019ll understand your troubles, Second\u2026 he\u2019s a good kid.\u300f</p><br/><p>As the Third said that, the Second nodded.</p><br/><p>\u300eHe\u2019s neither crude like the first, or plain like me. He isn\u2019t pitch black like you, either. He really is a good kid.\u300f</p><br/><p>\u300eHow cruel~.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third laughed, before putting on his serious face again.</p><br/><p>\u300eWell, just leave the rest to me. The other members are also reliable.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Second spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300e\u2026 Originally, we weren\u2019t even supposed to be giving advice like this. Good grief, that First Generation\u2026 it\u2019s because my old man bought that bargain blue gem that it all came down to this.\u300f</p><br/><p>The heads of history recorded within the gem were all truly dead.</p><br/><p>Even so, they held memory, and they heald heart.</p><br/><p>For what sake did the Jewel hold an ability like that?</p><br/><p>Why had it never activated until now?</p><br/><p>There was a mountain of things to ponder over.</p><br/><p>If it was just to hand down the Skills, then a gem was ample at passing on the knowledge.</p><br/><p>The Second spoke.</p><br/><p>\u300eWhatever the reason may be, I doubt I\u2019ll get the chance to learn it\u2026 of course, it\u2019s not like anything will come of knowing anyways.\u300f</p><br/><p>The Third agreed.</p><br/><p>\u300eRight. Why do we have a need to do something like this\u2026 it\u2019s as wondrous as that automaton.\u300f</p><br/><p>And like that, the two continued their conversation within the Jewel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
